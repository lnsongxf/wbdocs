About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Private Engineer

      BuildCo needs to hire an independent engineer to attest that the structural
      project is consistent and can be implemented (Controllo Strutture). The
      engineer also checks if the structural project complies with anti-seismic
      standards. The hiring comes after the conformity from the two previous
      procedures, so it cannot be a simultaneous one.

  4   Obtain the construction permit                                                         90 days            EUR 105,148
      Agency : U cio Urbanistica

      BuildCo must le a request for the construction permit at the U cio
      Urbanistica under the Segreteria di Stato per il Territorio, l’Ambiente e
      l’Agricoltura. The following documentation needs to be attached to the
      request:


      - Project documents
      - Map (allibramento)
      - Proof of ownership (partite)
      - Relazione sulla fattibilita’ strutturale
      - Attestato di conformità del progetto alle norme energetiche vigenti


      When the request is processed, the U cio Urbanistica will notify BuildCo
      about the total cost for obtaining the permit. Once noti ed by the U cio
      Urbanistica of the amount due, BuildCo has to pay the Tassa di Concessione
      Edilizia. This is done at a bank.


      As per the Piano Regolatore Generale of 1992 the amount due equals 8% of
      the construction cost. This construction cost estimates are updated by
      Decrees of the Commission for Territorial Policies (Commissione per le
      Politiche Territoriali). The estimates depend on the intended use of the
      construction (destinazione d’uso). The category that applies to the Doing
      Business case-study is category D5 (Wholesale activities - Commercio
      all’ingrosso). As per the latest Decree the estimated construction cost is EUR
      1,010.5683086 per square meter. U1 and U2 (oneri di urbanizzazione
      primaria e secondaria) are not due as it is assumed that this is an area of
      Intervento Diretto.

       inspection to test whether the structures built are in conformity with the
       structural project. The engineer sends the conformity certi cate about 2
       days after the inspection took place. This can only happen if the safety
       clearance is granted and the construction has started, therefore it is not a
       simultaneous procedure.

   8   Receive on-site inspection and obtain energy performance certi cate                 3 days     EUR 2,000
       Agency : Private Engineer

       An engineer must be hired in order to carry out an inspection to test the
       thermic dispersion of the structure. The engineer sends the certi cate about
       2 days after the inspection takes place.

       Agency : Cadastre O ce

       The independent engineer completes the documentation for the registration
       at the cadastre, and then must physically visit the o ce and provide the
       details of the new building. The cadastre then takes about 3 months to
       update the information in the system but the formal registration happens
       right away.


       The application costs EUR 10, and the rest of the fee is for the independent
       engineer. This happens only after the on-site inspection was done, so
       simultaneity is not applicable.

       Agency : AASS (Azienda Autonoma di Stato per i Servizi Publici)

       An engineer of AASS visits the client’s premises and conducts a short
       inspection to check where the closest connection point is, what connection it
       would be and if there is the need to occupy the public space.

       After the inspection, the utility (AASS) sends the client an estimate of the
       connection costs (preventivo) through fax and a letter.

   3   Sign contract and await external works and meter installation by AASS              35 calendar days   EUR 25,525.26
       Agency : AASS (Azienda Autonoma di Stato per i Servizi Publici)

       After the reception of the preventivo, and in case the client already agrees
       with the amounts provided, AASS prepares the contract, which is signed at
       AASS’s premises as soon as the client can come to sign it and make the
       payment.

       There are 3 amounts that need to be paid. The client can pay cash, wire
       transfer or check at the moment the contract is signed.
       • Fixed amount: Contributto di allacciamento forfettario
       • Variable amount: Contributto di allacciamento a preventivo, which depends
       on the amount of works that need to be made. This amount comprises both
       the material costs as well as the labor costs of the works as well as general
       expenses. Of this amount, only 70% is born by the client. The 30% remaining
       is born by AASS (state discount). Pleae also see the document in the O drive
       with a draft of the preventivo.
       • Security deposit: Anticipo fornitura
       • Taxes on this aggregated amounts: Marca di Bollo (10 Euro, always xed
       amount taxed on public documents), and a tax called Imposto di Quietanza,
       which amounts to 1,5 per 1000 of the total amount resulting from
       aggregating 1 and 2 and 3 above.

       AASS will take care of the permit to occupy the street and to do the
       underground works. This permit is the licenzia d’occupazione pubblica. As
       part of this phase, the meter is also installed, always outside the warehouse
       of the client.

If the minimum outage time considered for SAIDI/SAIFI is over 5 minutes, the economy is not eligible to score on the index.




    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator         Answer            Explanation

Proceeding        liquidation        Considering the assumptions of the case study, the most likely procedure applicable in San
                  (after an          Marino would be an attempt to a "concordato preventivo", which would be followed by
                  attempt at         liquidation (fallimento), regulated under Legge 17 of November 15, 1915. In this procedure,
                  reorganization)    an insolvent debtor will try to reach an agreement with its creditors negotiating the
                                     rescheduling and reduction of the debt. Following his application, an automatic stay
                                     (moratorium) would apply to all executive actions and an insolvency representative would be
                                     appointed ("curatore") to manage the business while the process is ongoing. After creditors
                                     file their claims with the court ("insinuazioni"), the process can be terminated under two
                                     different alternatives: either the creditors accept a rescheduling and reduction of their
                                     claims proposed by the debtor at the beginning of the filing ("concordato") or the company
                                     is liquidated piecemeal if the debtor’s proposal is rejected ("fallimento"). In San Marino, a
                                     "fallimento" would be the most likely option, as it is the procedure that applies more
                                     commonly to small and medium size companies in financial distress. Very few
                                     reorganizations "concordati" are actually approved.

Outcome           piecemeal sale     Even if it is very likely that the company will continue operating after filing for insolvency
                                     ("concordato preventivo") to maximize the value of the assets, the "fallimento" always implies
                                     the sale of the business piecemeal, and the concordato will almost always imply the
                                     liquidation too. Therefore, once the "fallimento" is declared, the business will stop operating
                                     and will be sold piecemeal.

Time (in years)   2.3                Assuming a reorganization attempt ("concordato preventivo") that is then rejected and
                                     liquidation ("fallimento") starts, our estimates indicate that the total time that this case
                                     would take would be 2.3 years. Within this estimate, the "concordato preventivo" would take
                                     approximately 1,3 years, including the time to appoint a "curatore", to file creditors’ claims
                                     ("insinuazioni") and to hold the first creditors meeting, which would be closed with a
                                     judgement ("sentenza") declaring the "fallimento". After this, new "insinuazioni" would have
                                     to take place, and the organization of the public auction ("asta pubblica") and the final
                                     transfer of the assets of the debtor would take around another year.

Cost (% of        5.0                Assuming a reorganization attempt ("concordato preventivo") that is then rejected and
estate)                              liquidation ("fallimento") starts, our estimate would be that it would approximately cost 5%
                                     of the total value of the estate (140,000 EUR) to close the procedure, broken down like this: -
                                     800 EUR as Court Fees for filing the case - 126,000 EUR on the fees of the "curatore",
                                     according to "compensi spettanti all'avvocato per la funzione di curatore" - 675,000 EUR on
                                     the lawyer's fees, according to the article 30 and article 26 of the "tariffario professionale del

   Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
