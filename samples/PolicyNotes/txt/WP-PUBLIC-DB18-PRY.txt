About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Based on General Municipal Taxes Ordinance for 2013 (Ordenanza General
      de Tributos Municipales para 2013), the cost is calculated according to a fee
      schedule that takes into account materials and building types. For a
      warehouse such as the one described in the case study, the fee is 0.4% of the
      construction cost, which is set at PYG 871950 / sq. m. In addition, there is a
       xed fee of PYG 70,000 for studies of prevention systems and protection
      against re hazards.


      20% of the municipal fee must be paid in advance when one is requesting the
      building permit, while the remaining 80% is paid once the building permit
      has been obtained.

      Once the feasibility of the project has been established, the electrician
      submits the o cial application which has to include the following
      documents:
      • Application for service signed by the responsible electrician
      • Photocopy of the property title (only document that requires notarization)
      • Photocopy of the national identi cation form of the owner of the property.
      • Photocopy of the carnet of the responsible electrician.

      • The results of the feasibility study
      • Security Deposit in the amount of one month of future consumption. The
      deposit is returned without interest at the end of the contract.


      The supply contract is signed at the same time as the application is
      submitted. A work order is issued and the customer awaits the connection
      works. An internal wiring inspection is not necessary. The utility ensures that
      the internal wiring of the customer is in order by requesting the responsible
      electrician to sign the application for the connection.

      transformer because the demand will represent the highest demand in the
      area and therefore determine the infrastructure needed. The customer pays
      for the transformer but will be reimbursed by ANDE for a total of 50% of the                                              Page 22

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the              - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                          and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                              economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                             - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                             - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                           equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                   - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                             commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                             - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                      - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                     - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                       - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                             movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                       insolvency and start a reorganization proceeding, or iii) Mirage or it creditors will request the

Outcome              piecemeal sale    Having chosen the option of initiating foreclosure proceedings, the hotel will cease
                                       operations and the property (assets) will be sold at public auction (assets will be sold
                                       piecemeal). Once the order for the auction is issued by the Court, a public auctioneer will be
                                       in charge of the management of the debtor’s assets. The public auctioneer is in charge of the
                                       sale of such assets and distribute the proceeds of sale among the creditors according to the
                                       priority set forth by law. BizBank as a secured creditor will have priority with respect to other
                                       creditors. There is no possibility for the company to continue operating after the auction
                                       takes place.

Time (in years)      3.9               The foreclosure procedure in in Paraguay will take approximately 4 years from the moment
                                       of the debtor's default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. It will take 1.5 years
                                       until the approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the Court including all required
                                       notifications and the debtor’s counter-claim. Henceforward, it is important to bear in mind
                                       that the debtor will file an appeal which will add at least an additional year until the appeal is
                                       decided. After that, it will take an additional year for the auction to take place (including the
                                       necessary time to appoint an auctioneer, the scheduling of the auction and the sale of the
                                       real estate). It will take around 6 months for the judge to approve the auction, the sale of the
                                       estate and the distribution of the remaining among unsecure creditors.

Cost (% of           9.0               The cost for a foreclosure proceeding will amount to approximately 9% of the value of
estate)                                Mirage’s estate. The main component of this expenditure would be the attorney’s fees, which
                                       would amount 7% of the value of Mirage’s estate). The rest of the cost (2%) is related to
                                       judicial and service fees, and fees related to the public auction.
