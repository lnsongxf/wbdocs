SRI LANKA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE

November 2017
Preface
          The Sri Lanka Development Update has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past six months in Sri Lanka’s economy, and places these in a
          longer term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes
          over the period, it updates the outlook for Sri Lanka’s economy and social welfare.
          Second, the Update provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of medium-term development challenges. It is intended for
          a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Sri Lanka’s
          evolving economy.

 Executive Summary




                        Sri Lanka has the opportunity to implement its Vision 2025 agenda to sustain growth, job
                        creation and poverty reduction in the medium term, provided it shifts from a public investment,
                        non-tradable sector-driven growth model to a more private investment, tradeable sector-led
                        model. It can greatly benefit from its location close to the largest fast-growing economies in the
                        world. This new growth model will open new opportunities for development, and will make
                        Sri Lanka more resilient to many risks, but will also expose it to new ones, It is therefore
                        important to manage them well to maximize the opportunities.

                  1. Recent Developments

                        buffers strengthened thanks to foreign exchange purchases and improved capital
                        flows. Inflation has risen since the second half of 2016 on account of drought and
                        changes to the VAT Act.

                        towards sustainable revenue-led fiscal consolidation. Although yet to be in full

                       SOEs and state agencies (7.1 percent of GDP, 2016) remained high in the first five

                       contraction of the agriculture sector. On the external front, the benefit of low oil
                       prices was offset by greater imports of food and petroleum3 due to the drought, while
                       the impact on agricultural exports were masked by increased tea prices. Along with
                       the changes in VAT, inclement weather exerted upward pressure on prices. However,
                       relatively low international commodity prices helped maintain the inflation around
                       mid-single digit. Despite drought related fiscal costs, the government has achieved a
                       primary surplus in the first half of 2017.

in the backdrop of       on revenue-led fiscal consolidation adds to confidence. The central bank has shown
policy reforms.          that it stands ready to take appropriate action in the direction of stability. These
                         factors have contributed to an improved outlook.

                         Growth is expected to reach 4.6 percent in 2017 and increase marginally over 5.0
                         percent beyond, driven by private consumption and investment. The impact of past
                         high monetary growth along with the increase of VAT collection will increase
                         inflation in 2017 although low international commodity prices will maintain some
                         downward pressure.

                         The external sector is poised to benefit from the reinstatement of GSP+ preferential
                         access to the European Union and growing tourism, although the drought could
                         adversely impact exports and increase petroleum imports to cover a hydro power
                         shortfall. The deceleration of the previously stable remittances flow will also be a
                         strain on the external sector. Foreign capital inflows to government securities and
                         FDI inflows will help closing the external financing needs with no Eurobond falling
                         due in 2017. Nevertheless, external buffers are projected to improve, with emphasis
                         placed on purchasing foreign exchange, maintaining a more market-determined
                         exchange rate, and the sale or leasing of selected government assets, including
                         Hambantota seaport.6

                         The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 5.1 percent of GDP for 2017 in line with
                         its primary surplus target thanks to the impact of VAT changes in its first full year of
                         implementation, and expenditure control. Further revenue-increasing policy measures
                         along with improved tax administration will help increase revenues and reduce the
                         deficit to 3.5 of GDP by 2020. Sustained primary surpluses would put debt on a
                         decisive downward path, even with growth shocks.

The outlook is           External risks include slower growth performance in key countries that generate

and external risks.      and other capital flows. Tighter than expected global financial conditions could
                         increase the cost of debt and could make it difficult to roll over the maturing
                         Eurobonds from 2019. Faster than expected rises in commodity prices could increase
                         pressure on the balance of payments and make domestic fuel and electricity price
                         reforms more difficult.

                         On the fiscal and debt management front, risks include the delay in implementing
                         revenue and liability management measures; and slower than expected improvement
                         in tax administration. The increasing occurrence and impact of natural disasters could
                         have an adverse impact on growth, the fiscal consolidation path, the trade balance
                         and poverty reduction. Finally, the complex political environment could delay
                         implementation of important structural reforms.

                         flexible inflation targeting, the exchange rate is expected to be given more flexibility, in the future.

Tackling challenges     Sri Lanka faces a number of challenges to sustain future economic growth, create
through reforms is      more and better jobs and reduce poverty; and thus, must be addressed through
crucial for sustained   determined reforms. These challenges can be addressed through four sets of priority
and equitable           reforms:
growth.                 1. staying on the fiscal consolidation path and creating fiscal space for health,
                            education, social protection and other public investments
                        2. improving the economy’s competitiveness and promoting trade and FDI to
                            facilitate a shift in the growth model driven more by private investment and
                            exports;
                        3. making progress on and completing the already started governance reforms such
                            as Right to Information, the National Audit Law and the Public Finance Law;
                            and
                        4. reducing vulnerability and risks in the economy: (a) dealing proactively with the
                            Eurobonds maturing from 2019 by increasing the flexibility in the Appropriation
                            Act to manage liabilities actively; (b) improving the debt management function
                            with requisite institutional, legal and strategy frameworks to manage the costs and
                            risks of domestic and external debt portfolios; (c) mitigating the impact on the
                            poor by replacing untargeted effective subsidies to the non-poor by targeted
                            spending; and (d) enhancing the country’s resilience and disaster preparedness to
                            deal with frequent natural disasters more pro-actively

                        These key challenges are inter-linked and require a comprehensive and coordinated
                        approach. Although, domestic political considerations and institutional constraints on
                        policy implementation make it challenging, a strong political will and support of the
                        bureaucracy could help advance the reform agenda. Steps are needed to ensure the
                        support of private sector, civil society and other stakeholders through improved
                        communications on costs and benefits of its Vision 2025 agenda.
                  3. Special focus

Managing risks is       The new growth model will open new opportunities for development. It will make
important for           Sri Lanka more resilient to many risks, but will expose it to new ones, while
sustainability.         increasingly frequent natural disasters also demand more preparedness. It is important
                        to manage risks well at different levels of society—households, firms, the public
                        sector and the macroeconomy. Therefore, the Special Focus Section of this edition
                        of the Sri Lanka Development Update is devoted to a discussion on integrated risk
                        management using the framework presented in the World Development Report,
                        2014.

Box 1: Sri Lanka: country context
Sri Lanka is a Lower Middle-Income country with a GDP per capita of USD 3,835 (2016) and a total population of 21.2
million people. Following 30 years of civil war that ended in 2009, Sri Lanka’s economy grew at an average 6.2 percent
during the period of 2010-2016, reflecting a peace dividend and a determined policy thrust towards reconstruction and
growth; although there were some signs of a slowdown in the last three years (Figure 1). The economy is transitioning from
a predominantly rural-based economy towards a more urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing and services.
The country has made significant progress in its socio-economic and human development indicators. Social indicators rank
among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries. Economic growth has
translated into shared prosperity with the national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1
percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical pockets; however, a relatively large share
of the population subsists on slightly more than the extreme poverty line. The country has comfortably surpassed most of
the MDG targets set for 2015 and was ranked 73rd in the Human Development Index in 2015.
The economy’s weak competitiveness is an issue to address. Restrictive trade policie s over the past decade have created a
strong anti-export bias, which has been reflected in a dramatic decline in trade. While growth in Sri Lanka has been strong
over the past few years, it has been inward-oriented and based on the growth of non-tradable sectors. Sri Lanka also attracts
a much lower volume of FDI than peer economies and the shortcomings of the investment climate pose obstacles for new
firms. Moreover, significantly high state participation in the economy has implications on competitiveness in a number of
sectors and labor market dynamics.
Low revenues as a share of GDP has been a structural issue that adversely impacts fiscal position. The major causes are the
low number of number of tax payers (less than 7 percent of the labor force and formal establishments pay income tax),
reductions in statutory rates without commensurate efforts to expand the tax base, inefficiencies in administration and
numerous exemptions. Low revenues combined with largely non-discretionary expenditure in salary bill, transfers, and
interest payments has constrained critical development spending and squeezed expenditure on health, education and social
protection, which is low compared to peer (Figure 2).
Sri Lanka has a 3-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program with the IMF, which is primarily focused on increasing
revenues. The program calls for fiscal consolidation, transition to flexible inflation targeting, and reforms in public financial
management, state enterprises and trade and competitiveness. The IMF announced that it had reached staff-level agreement
with the government on completing the third review of the EFF.
The government that came to power in 2015 envisions promoting a globally competitive, export-led economy with an
emphasis on inclusion. It has indicated keenness to undertake reforms in the areas of public finance, competitiveness,
governance and education sectors. Recently, the government presented Vision 2025, a policy document encompassing key
structural reforms to address the above challenges (Box 4).

 A. Recent Developments




 Growth performance of first half 2017 was affected by inclement weather

Floods and drought     Floods in the month of May in the South and the West; as well as continued drought
affected growth.       in some parts of the country reduced the economic growth of the first half of 2017
                       to 3.9 percent.7 Adverse weather turned the agriculture sector’s contribution to
                       growth into a negative 0.2 percentage points in the first half, for the second
                       consecutive year, while impacting related industry and service sectors. In contrast, the
                       construction sector’s contribution to growth remained at 1.0 percentage point
                       continuing the strong rebound in 2016. This was mainly due to the resumption of a
                       few large-scale infrastructure projects and increased private construction activities.
                       Although, significant contributions also came from financial services and trade, these
                       were not sufficient to fully compensate for the dampened performance of other
                       industry and service sectors affected by unfavorable weather conditions, leading to a
                       lower growth rate (Figure 3).

Capital formation      The contribution to growth from consumption remained low at 1.7 percentage points
was the key            in the first half of 2017 with private consumption being subdued due to drought and
contributor to         VAT change while government consumption has also slowed down. 8 Meanwhile,
growth.                activity in construction and related sectors increased the contribution to growth from
                       gross capital formation to 3.8 percentage points. Increased gross capital formation,
                       especially in the construction sector, was reflected in the expenditure on imported
                       investment goods such as machinery, equipment and building material, which led to
                       a 2.6 percentage point negative contribution to growth from imports of goods and
                       services. The contribution from exports in the first half of 2017 remained low with

                       7 However, this compared well with the natural-disaster-affected 3.7 percent recorded in the
                       corresponding period of 2016.
                       8 When computed on a first-half contribution to growth basis

of 2016.                                 inflation since the second half of 2016. Accordingly, year-on-year inflation measured
                                         by the widely-watched Colombo Consumer Price Index (2013=100) reached 7.1
                                         percent in September 2017 from 4.2 percent recorded a year earlier. Annual average
                                         inflation followed suit, rising to 5.8 percent from 3.9 during the same period. In
                                         addition to food inflation, larger contributions to the rise in prices came from health,9
                                         education, restaurant and hotel segments with the increase in the VAT rate. Reflecting
                                         demand pressures in the economy amid continued high monetary growth, core
                                         inflation, measured excluding fresh food and energy, moved up to 5.8 percent by
                                         September 2017, on an annual average basis (Figure 5 and 6).

 The new Inland Revenue Act is expected to pave the way for sustainable, revenue-led fiscal
 consolidation.
Parliament passed a                                The new Inland Revenue Act,10 which builds on international best practice, aims to
new Inland Revenue                                 broaden the tax base by removing excessive tax exemptions; rationalize corporate tax
Bill in September                                  incentives toward an investment-oriented regime; simplify the tax system; and
2017.                                              strengthen powers of the tax administrator. If well implemented, the new law would
                                                   serve as the foundation for sustained fiscal consolidation over the medium term and
                                                   provide resources for essential social services and productivity-improving public
                                                   investments while making the budget more resilient to natural disasters.

Increase in VAT led                                VAT collection almost doubled in the first four months of 2017 thanks to changes
to a primary surplus                               effected in 2016. With improved collection of VAT and income taxes, the first four
in the first four                                  months’ total tax collection increased by 25.6 percent, year-on-year, compared to the
months of 2017.                                    corresponding period of 2016.11 Non-interest expenditures rose by 13.7 percent
                                                   during the same period with improved execution of the public investment budget.
                                                   The faster growth in revenues compared to non-interest expenditures, helped the
                                                   government to report a primary surplus for this period. Continued improvement,
                                                   particularly in the revenue front is expected to lead to a marginal primary surplus for
                                                   the full year 2017 while a substantial increase in interest expenditure compared to the
                                                   budget will mask the improvement of the overall fiscal deficit (Table 1).

2017 results follow                                Increased revenues and low execution of public investment contained the fiscal deficit
the fiscal                                         for 2016 at the envisaged level of 5.4 percent of GDP as against a 7.6 percent in 2015
consolidation path of                              (Table 1, Figure 7). However, the central government debt remained high at 79.3
2016; however, debt                                percent of GDP in 2016 (Figure 8)12 while the debt profile also indicated significant
remains high.                                      exposure to a variety of risks as discussed in the Special Focus section (Figure 10).

                                                   10 Submission of the bill to the Parliament satisfied an important structural benchmark in the IMF-

                                                   11 Yet, the tax revenues remained 4.4 percent below the budgeted volume for the first four months of

                                                   2017.
                                                   12 Debt stock increased in 2016 due mainly to exchange rate depreciation and the real interest rate effect.

                                These factors suggest that, in the absence of high growth rates seen in earlier years,
                                fiscal consolidation and more efficient debt management are key to improving the
                                debt profile and bringing the debt-to-GDP ratio back to a declining path. 13

Guaranteed and non-             Some of the SOE debt, both foreign and domestic, is guaranteed by the Treasury. In

                                oriented state-owned business enterprises with revenue capacity, such as Ceylon
                                Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), declining from
                                90 percent in 2006 to 36 percent in 2016 while guarantees given to state
                                establishments, primarily dependent on the state budget for expenditures are on the

                                there are other means of fiscal and quasi-fiscal support to SOEs, such as fiscal

                                banks. Based on available data,17 by end 2015, total SOE debt excluding the financial
                                institutions was estimated at over LKR 1.3 trillion or 12 percent of GDP.

                                13 Sri Lanka’s long-term foreign currency credit rating is B+ for Fitch and S&P, and B1 for Moody’s.
                                14 Issued treasury guarantees increased as a share of GDP from 5.6 percent in 2015 to 7.1 in 2016 while
                                the used guarantees also moved up from 3.7 to 4.4 percent of GDP during the same period.
                                15 Among others, these include Road Development Authority, General Sir John Kotelawala Defence

                                University and Urban Development Authority. These agencies have no significant sources of revenue
                                and the debt repayment will likely come from the Treasury in the future.
                                16 It is important to formulate a Guarantee Policy to manage risks emanating from the guarantees.

                                   Currently, there is no written policy on guarantees.

 Mixed external sector performance, but recent purchases led to improvement of external buffers.

Trade performance       The trade deficit expanded by 13.4 percent to USD 4.8 billion in the first half of 2017
weakened in the first   compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The benefit of low oil prices was
half of 2017.           offset by greater imports of food and petroleum due to the drought, while the impact
                        on agricultural exports was masked by increased tea prices. Although growth in
                        tourism flows18 continued to ease external pressures, weakening worker remittances
                        and an elevated trade deficit led to more than doubling of the current account deficit
                        in the first half of 2017 from a year earlier. 19

Debt-creating flows     The external current account deficit was mainly financed by debt creating flows.
dominated the           Although FDI substantially increased from a low base, loan receipts and portfolio
financial account.      receipts continued to be the main sources of financing the deficit in the first half of
                        2017. While the government securities market started attracting inflows after a period
                        of outflows, issuance of sovereign bonds worth of USD 1.5 billion, 20 receipts of USD
                        1.1 billion in project loans and syndicated loans of USD 450 million 21 were the key
                        inflows to the financial account. The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by only 2 percent,
                        year-to-date, against the US dollar by end-August, much less than other emerging
                        market currencies thanks to these significantly large inflows (Table 2, Figure 13)).

After bottoming out     Gross official reserves increased to USD 7.7 billion or approximately 4.5 months of
in April 2017,          merchandise imports by end-August 2017 (up from USD 6.0 billion recorded in
reserves recovered.     December 2016), the highest level recorded in 32 months. The central bank continued
                        to strengthen reserves through purchases in the forex market from the month of
                        March22 while proceeds from debt issuances helped to increase reserves. However,
                        foreign exchange obligations for the 12 months starting from August 2017 are
                        estimated at USD 6.9 billion, implying that official reserves net of short-term liabilities
                        are low. About USD 1.9 billion or 1/4 of these liabilities represent swap arrangements
                        with domestic banks (which issued medium-term international bonds), some of which
                        will be maturing in 2018. The central bank has already indicated that it plans to settle
                        some of the swaps, which were rolled over in the past. 23 Moreover, the government
                        expects that the foreign inflows related to the setting up of the Hambantota port lease
                        would further shore up reserves in the coming months (Figure 11, 12 and 14).




                        18 Growth in tourism receipts decelerated to 4.8 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017 compared
                           to double-digit growth rates experienced in the past few years, reportedly due to the limited access
                           provided by the country’s main airport through to April on account of renovation activities and a
                           Dengue breakout that kept tourists away.
                        19 During the period, remittances shrank on a year-on-year basis for the first time in more than eight

                        years, indicating the potential impact of continued low oil prices in the Middle East. This region generates
                        over 50 percent of Sri Lanka’s remittances.
                        20 Sri Lanka issued its eleventh sovereign bond worth USD 1.5 billion (10-year) in May 2017. The coupon

                        rate of 6.20 percent reflected a spread of 380 bps over the US Treasury rate for a 10-year security, which
                        compares well with a 540-bps spread recorded in the previous issuance in July 2016. The issuance rated
                        ‘B1’, ‘B+’ and ‘B+' by Moody's Investors Service, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch attracted bids over
                        USD 11 billion achieving an oversubscription ratio of over 7 times (compared to an oversubscription
                        ratio of 3 times in the previous issuance), spread across 500 participating accounts.
                        21 A further USD 550 million was raised in the month of August 2017.
                        22 These purchases were supported by capital inflows to the government securities market.
                        23 Some of the underlying Eurobonds are expected to mature in the coming year: e.g. National Savings

                        Bank USD 750 million, Bank of Ceylon USD 500 million, DFCC Bank USD 100 million.

                       maintained well above the minimum statutory requirement of 20 percent during the
                       first half of 2017. The expansion of the loan book was supported by the growth in
                       deposits in a high interest environment. Faster growth in lending rates compared to
                       deposit rates led to increased net interest income resulting in improved Return on
                       Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) for the banking sector. The Non-

                       aggressive credit recovery. However, the NPL ratio might come under upward
                       pressure in the coming months when the pace of credit growth decelerates following
                       the last two years of rapid credit growth, a trend observed in the past. Moreover,

 Despite the fast poverty reduction, there remain areas with significant poverty; a large share of the
 population subsists on little more than the extreme poverty line.

Extreme poverty is                Despite the recent macroeconomic challenges, extreme poverty remains low, as the
low in Sri Lanka and              $1.90 (PPP 2011) poverty rate fell half a percentage point, from 2.4 to 1.9 percent
fell further between              between 2009/10 and 2012/13. The real per capita consumption of the bottom 40
2012/13 and 2016.                 percent increased 2.2 percent annually between 2006/07 and 2012/13, and improved
                                  living standards were reflected in rising asset ownership, declining shares of food
                                  consumption, and a rise in reported household per capita income among the poor.
                                  Preliminary results from the Department of Census and Statistics’ Household Income
                                  and Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted in 2016 show a further decline in the
                                  national poverty rate, which is equivalent to about $2.50 in 2011 Purchasing Power
                                  Parity terms, from 6.7 percent in 2012/13 to 4.1 percent in 2016.

During the past year, Employment in agriculture continues to fall, boosting productivity and contributing
labor market trends   to continued declines in poverty. Between 2013 and 2016, the share of employment
have been mixed.      in agriculture fell from 30.2 to 27.1 percent. Unemployment remained constant during
                      that period, at a manageable 4.4 percent. Furthermore, perhaps due to the shift out
                      of agriculture, the share of workers working for 40 hours or more increased from 65.5
                      to 67.9 percent of the workforce. Female labor force participation remains low and
                      lags behind male rates by nearly 40 percentage points.

Box 2: Getting to Work: Unlocking Women’s Potential in Sri Lanka’s Labor Force
 Sri Lanka has shown remarkable persistence in low female labor force participation (FLFP) rates over the past three
 decades. Even as the economy expanded, FLFP declined from 41 percent in 2010 to 36 percent in 2016. This trend
 stands in contrast to the cou ntry’s achievements in human development outcomes that favor women, such as high
 levels of female education and low total fertility rates, as well as its status as a middle-income country.

 A forthcoming World Bank report, Getting to Work: Unlocking Women ’s Potential in Sri Lanka’s Labor Force, finds
 that women’s experience in Sri Lanka’s labor market remains characterized by: (1) low LFP; (2) high unemployment,
 especially for women under age 30; and (3) persistent wage disparities between the sexes, though these are shrinking
 over time. The report’s analysis supports three hypotheses to explain gender gaps in labor market outcomes.

 Household roles and responsibilities, which fall disproportionately on women: Marriage continues to penalize
 women’s participation in labor markets, though less so than before 2010. As of 2015, marriage lowers odds of FLFP
 by 4.4 percentage points, while boosting men’s odds by 11 percentage points. Having young children is associated with
 even lower odds of FLFP, lower chances of becoming a paid employee, and lower earnings compared to these odds
 before 2010—and compared to men’s odds. Social norms against women’s mobility outside the home, especially for
 commuting, exacerbate the gender gap in LFP.

 A human capital mismatch, whereby women are not acquiring the proper skills demanded by job markets:
 Since the end of civil conflict, women at all levels of educational attainment are even more challenged than men in
 securing high-skill and higher-paying jobs. Qualitative research reveals women’s preference for humanities and arts in
 their educational training, rather than in technical skills that better match with private sector jobs in growth industries.
 These educational and occupational choices are also strongly influenced by what girls and their parents consider to be
 gender appropriate—e.g., women with the highest educational attainments (university level or higher) still queue for a
 limited number of public sector jobs—which, unlike the private sector, uniformly offer regular working hours, maternity
 leave, and other women-friendly benefits—and thus contribute to elevated rates of female youth unemployment.
 Multivariate analysis confirms that in spite of women’s advancements (even exceeding those of men, as with years of
 education), endowments are not sufficient to close gender gaps in LFP and wages.

 Gender discrimination in job search, hiring and promotion processes: Discrimination appears to determine large
 shares of gender gaps in LFP and earnings, though to a diminishing degree over time, especially since 2009. Primary
 research confirms that employers actively discriminate by gender to a much smaller degree than employees suspect. Yet,
 stubborn occupational segregation across industries suggests that this may not be the case for promotions —especially
 into high-skill and management jobs, in which men continue to dominate. Raw gender wage gaps are shrinking, but the
 portion of these gaps that is determined by gender discrimination —rather than endowments—is increasing over time
 and is especially pronounced in the public sector.

 The report recommends four priority areas for addressing the multiple supply- and demand-side factors to
 promote women’s entry into and continued employment in the labor market. This is essential for preparing for an aging
 population and to achieving the country’s growth and eq uity goals.
 • Reduce barriers to women’s participation in paid work, particularly (a) lack of child care services, and (b) socio -
    physical constraints on women’s mobility, which undermines their ability to travel to work.
 • Strengthen girls’ early orientation to career development and to acquiring the types of education and skills (e.g.,
    STEM courses) that prepare them for labor markets.
 • Improve the job orientation of education providers; and expand provision of job matching services and TVET that
    respond to employers’ needs.
 • Ensure gender equity in labor legislation and non-discriminatory workplace environments, which includes zero
    tolerance for sexual harassment in—and traveling to—the workplace and provision of safe transportation for
    women; undertake affirmative action and ethical branding initiatives to expand women’s share of employment and
    firm ownership in emerging sectors.

                                  Summary of key macroeconomic developments
  •    Construction sector rebound partially compensated the impact of weather on growth performance
  •    Inflationary pressures remained high due to drought, VAT changes and demand pressures
  •    External trade balance weakened due to increased petroleum and food imports
  •    Official reserves improved markedly with forex purchases and external borrowings
  •    Primary surplus expected thanks to VAT changes; however, high interest costs to mask the improvement of
       fiscal deficit
  •    Public debt remains high; the debt portfolio indicates some significant risks
  •    Preliminary data shows poverty has fallen further between 2012/13 and 2016

                         flexible inflation targeting will keep inflation in the single digits, while the exchange

Fiscal consolidation     Supported by a small primary balance, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to fall to

back on a declining             fiscal consolidation. In outer years, implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act,
path.                           further reforms to the VAT law and improvements in tax administration are expected
                                to expand revenues. On the expenditure side, staff projects that the increased fiscal
                                space will primarily benefit public investment, assuming no major additional recurrent
                                expenditure commitments. Under this baseline, the fiscal deficit is expected to narrow
                                to 3.5 of GDP by 2020.

Public debt levels are          Continued fiscal consolidation is projected to bring the public debt burden to a
projected to fall,              downward path again in 2017 with a marginal decline in public debt-to-GDP ratio,
provided fiscal                 ending a 5-year consecutive rise. Fiscal discipline is even more important in an
consolidation                   environment of high domestic interest rates, an expected gradual tightening of global
remains on track.               financial conditions and an expected gradual depreciation of the exchange rate, as the
                                central bank moves to inflation targeting. Under the baseline scenario, this would
                                bring the debt-to-GDP ratio to 73 percent of GDP by 2020. However, this is subject
                                to shocks. A shock to the growth rate or exchange rate would widen the fiscal deficit
                                (Figure 19) and would mainly affect the path of public debt (Figure 20).32 In addition,
                                there is a risk that guarantees and other contingent liabilities will be called.

The outlook is              The immediate risk is tighter than expected global financial conditions that would
subject to a number         increase the cost of debt and make it difficult to roll over the maturing Eurobonds
of risks.                   from 2019. Other external risks include disappointing growth performance in key
                            countries that generate foreign exchange inflows to Sri Lanka in terms of exports,
                            tourism, remittances, FDI, and other financing flows. Faster than expected rises in
                            commodity prices would increase pressure on the balance of payments and make
                            domestic fuel and electricity price reforms more difficult.

                            Domestically, on the fiscal and debt management front, risks include the delay in
                            implementing revenue and liability management measures; and slower than expected
                            improvement in tax administration. The increasing occurrence and impact of natural
                            disasters could have an adverse impact on growth, the fiscal consolidation path, the
                            trade balance and poverty reduction. Finally, the complex political environment could
                            delay implementation of important structural reforms.

                            The Special Focus section contains a discussion on risks and opportunities at various
                            levels of society.


Box 3: South Asia economic context
 Growth and prices: Global growth is firming, contributing to an improvement in confidence. A recovery in industrial
 activity has coincided with a pick-up in global trade, after two years of marked weakness. In emerging market and
 developing economies (EMDEs), obstacles to growth among commodity exporters are gradually diminishing, while
 activity among commodity importers remains generally robust. As a result, global growth is expected to reach 2.9
 percent in 2017 and 2018, up from a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent in 2016 despite substantial policy uncertainty (Table
 3.1). Commodity prices have continued to recover moderately, although prospects for increased U.S. shale oil
 production are weighing on the outlook for oil prices.
 Financial markets: Global financing conditions have been benign and benefited from improving growth prospects
 and expectations of low interest rates despite ongoing U.S. monetary policy normalization. Financial market volatility
 has been low despite elevated policy uncertainty, reflecting investor risk appetite and, perhaps, some level of market
 complacency. Renewed risk appetite has supported EMDE financial markets and led to a narrowing of corporate bond
 spreads globally. Capital inflows to EMDEs were robust in the first half of 2017, partly in a rebound from late-2016
 weakness. Over time, however, a gradual tightening of international financing conditions may weigh on capital flows to
 EMDEs.
 Risks: Substantial risks cloud this outlook, despite the possibility of fiscal stimulus in some major advanced economies,
 particularly the United States. Escalating trade restrictions could derail a fragile recovery in trade and undo gains from
 past liberalization efforts. A further increase in policy uncertainty from already high levels could dampen confidence

 and investment and trigger financial market stress, after a period of unusually low financial market volatility. Market
 reassessment of advanced-economy monetary policy, or disorderly exchange rate developments, could contribute to
 swings in EMDE asset prices and capital flows, potentially amplified by vulnerabilities in some countries. Over the
 longer term, persistent weaknesses in productivity and investment growth would erode potential growth.
 Factors affecting EMDE growth prospects : Even if the expected modest rebound in investment across EMDEs
 materializes, slowing capital accumulation in recent years may have already reduced potential growth. Moreover,
 structural headwinds to global trade, worsening demographics, slowing productivity growth, and governance and
 institutional challenges could adversely affect EMDE growth.
 South Asia: South Asia is no longer the fastest-growing region in the world, due to gradual deceleration in India after
 the first quarter in 2016. Nevertheless, the region is expected to grow by 6.7 percent in 2017, reach 6.9 percent in 2018
 and stabilize around 7 percent over the medium term. Robust growth prospects rest on the expectation that domestic
 consumption will remain strong, private sector investment will regain momentum, and exports will recover.

crucial for sustained        determined reforms. These key challenges are inter-linked and require a

growth.                      considerations and institutional constraints on policy implementation make it
                             challenging, a strong political will and the support of the bureaucracy could help with
                             advancing the reform agenda. Steps need to be taken to ensure the support of the
                             private sector, civil society and other stakeholders through improved communications
                             on costs and benefits of the reform agenda (see Box 4 Vision 2025).

Box 4: Sri Lanka’s Vision 2025 document

 The government announced its vision – “Vision 2025” - to make Sri Lanka a rich country by 2025. While recognizing
 the structural and inter-linked challenges that Sri Lanka is facing, the Vision 2025 aspires to transform Sri Lanka into
 the hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social market economy focused on inclusion.
 It sets intermediate targets for the next three years to lay the foundation to become a rich country by 2025. These
 include raising per capita income to USD 5,000 per year, creating one million new jobs, increasing FDI to USD 5 billion
 per year, and doubling exports to USD 20 billion per year.

 Key challenges
 The document recognizes the important constraints to growth.
 • It suggests that growth in recent years has primarily been through inward-oriented economic activities driven by
     government infrastructure spending based on heavy commercial borrowing. Persistent fiscal deficits and external
     current account deficits have resulted in poor investor confidence and low levels of foreign direct investment (FDI)
     and private domestic investment. Much of private investment, both local and foreign, has gone into real estate and
     related sectors as well as uncompetitive import substitutes.
 • The documents attributes strong anti-export bias in the economy to the often-uncompetitive exchange rates
     alongside high effective protection rates. It argues that the country’s exports a re still concentrated on a few, mainly
     low technology products and that investment policies have failed to attract transformational, knowledge-based
     investments.
 • The Vision 2025 contends that public finances have been a constraint on growth. A steady decline in government
     revenue generation has resulted in debt accumulation, particularly concentrated on non-concessional foreign
     borrowing. It suggests that high levels of public debt hamper growth through increased uncertainty, over-taxation,
     predominance of indirect over direct taxation, diverting resources from social and infrastructure development,
     crowding out of private investment and weakening resilience to shocks.
 • It recognizes the fragile financial standing and the poor quality of public service delivery of state-owned enterprises
     (SOEs) as additional constraints to productivity and growth.
 • According to the document, growth is also hampered by regulatory barriers constraining both foreign and local
     private investment. Critical constraints are the dearth of land for commercial and other productive purposes; the
     skill profile of the current workforce not being aligned with the needs of a globally-integrated economy; archaic
     labor laws and inefficiencies in the labor market that hinder female labor force participation; rigid border taxation
     laws which hamper trade facilitation, inadequate infrastructure in terms of access, quality and pricing of energy,

                             much on non-tax revenues driven by SOEs. Continued fiscal consolidation will help
                             the country prepare for additional public spending on expanding pension coverage
                             and old-age health and long-term care in the medium to long term as Sri Lanka’s
                             demographic transition advances. Fiscal space is equally important to increase
                             investment in human and physical capital and the provision of other public goods to
                             sustain growth in the medium term. A reduced fiscal deficit will also limit exposure
                             to global financial markets, which are expected to gradually become tighter, and free
                             up credit for the private sector in the domestic market. A reduced fiscal deficit, a
                             reduced debt level and more predictability in the markets will also reduce the burden
                             on the central bank to provide temporary financing, which gives it more operational
                             independence to pursue an appropriate monetary and exchange rate policy for the
                             country.

                        on investment allowances is expected to promote investment and job creation instead
                        of offering fiscally expensive tax holidays, exemptions and special rates. Although
                        there is room for improvement through sector targeting, investment allowance based
                        incentives could be helpful for simplification and reduce leakages while preserving
                        competitiveness. Improving the VAT Act and its administration will be a key step in
                        the direction of revenue-led fiscal consolidation, going forward.

 2. Change to more private investment, tradable sector-led growth model

                        sustained economic prosperity (Figure 18).

                        Policy recommendations to improve trade and business environment and FDI:
                            • Trade policy: (1) adopt trade policy with a gradual but firm liberalization
                                 schedule, allowing time for adjustment to avoid a sudden shock to fiscal
                                 revenue and the balance of payments; and (2) make progress on bilateral trade
                                 agreements while carefully evaluating the costs and benefits to Sri Lanka, with
                                 a particular focus on non-tariff barriers and Mutual Recognition Agreements.
                                 The Special Focus Section discusses managing risks of carrying out para-tariff
                                 reforms with a view to improve trade.
                            • Trade facilitation: (1) adopt a systematic and effective risk management
                                 system, the absence of which imposes a huge burden in terms of time and
                                 cost, adversely impacting competitiveness; and (2) create a single trade
                                 information portal, which will help meet the informational needs of
                                 businesses.
                            • Innovation: improve the innovation landscape in Sri Lanka especially for
                                 SMEs and start-ups.
                            • FDI attraction: (1) enhance effectiveness of the Board of Investment as a
                                 ‘one-stop shop’ for foreign investors; (2) strengthen BOI’s investment

                        33 Real GDP expanded by 40.5 percent from 2010 to 2016 with the top six sectors contributing to 70.0
                        percent of the total growth all being non-tradables: construction, transport, other personal services,
                        financial services, wholesale and retail trade, and real estate. Agriculture that employs around 28 percent
                        of the total labor force contributed to only 4.1 percent of growth while all other manufacturing/service
                        sectors collectively accounted for 25.9 percent of growth.
                        34 In general, shifting resources into tradable sectors, led by manufacturing, is desirable for emerging

                        markets because productivity gains are higher in tradable sectors than in non-tradable sectors. (World
                        Bank (2013), ‘Island of Prosperity? Ideas for Accelerating Inclusive Economic Growth in Sri Lanka’,

                        to 19.5 percent in 2005, and declined to 16.3 percent by 2016 due to faster growth in the services sector.

                               •    Enhance institutional capacity of GoSL to address the shortcomings in the

                                                Summary of outlook

  •    Growth expected to be affected by disaster, but return to 5 percent in medium term
  •    Inflation will increase in 2017 due to one-off impact of VAT and stabilize with continued low commodity prices
  •    Fiscal consolidation will continue towards a deficit of 3.5 percent of GDP in the medium-term, despite 2017
       government budget deficit target of 4.6 percent of GDP is likely to be missed.
  •    Debt is likely to stabilize and start to fall, but sensitive to growth, fiscal and exchange rate shocks
  •    External sector will benefit from tourism and GSP+ from the second half of 2017; however, expenditure on food
       and petroleum could mask the improvement
  •    Reserves will improve, with forex purchases, a more market-determined exchange rate, monetary policy and
       divestment/lease out of some government assets

                        must also be identified, prioritized, and addressed through private and public action.

                            4. For risks beyond the means of individuals to handle alone, risk management
                            requires shared action and responsibility at different levels of society, from the
                            household to the international community.
                            5. Governments have a critical role in managing systemic risks, providing an enabling
                            environment for shared action and responsibility, and channeling direct support to
                            vulnerable people.

                        and implement risk mitigation mechanisms. The public sector and especially the
                        budget plays a special role in its ability to mitigate risks. There is also a need to
                        communicate reforms well, be open about the risks and opportunities and make
                        credible announcements how the risks can be mitigated.

                        most of the consumption of these items. Those exemptions therefore increase
                        inequality. Since VAT is in principle not a burden on firms in the value chain, the
                        existence of VAT exemptions on intermediate goods is the result of individual firms
                        lobbying for exemptions. However, the aggregate impact of the exemptions offset
                        these individual benefits to some extent. This backdrop warrants a discussion to
                        revisit VAT exemptions with a view to widen the tax base and support revenue-led
                        fiscal consolidation.

                         40 percent, which makes them effectively subsidies benefitting the non-poor.

To manage this risk,     To maximize the fiscal benefits and minimize the risk of increasing poverty, it is
the government           important to focus on removing exemptions on goods that (1) account for large

                         Employing timely and targeted fiscal measures to mitigate the impact on the poor is
                         critical as these households often lack the resources and preparedness to cope with
                         adverse shocks in a sustainable and effective way, while the targeting will maximize
                         the positive net fiscal impact.

                         The most natural way to channel the funds would be through targeted cash transfers,
                         such as Samurdhi. However, since Samurdhi benefits reach many non-poor, this
                         system needs to be reformed first. In the meantime, the additional fiscal resources
                         can also be used in other ways to reach the poor, for example, through improvements
                         in public health and education provision (which are highly progressive in nature), or
                         public investment projects in DS divisions with high poverty rates.

                         Adopting such measures to mitigate the impact of these risks and communicating
                         them to the public at the onset of these reforms will go a long way towards gaining
                         public support and ensuring that the policy reforms are accepted and successful while
                         also minimizing or even offsetting the adverse outcomes that are unavoidable in the

                         Since the non-poor are the largest consumers of fuel and electricity (the top 30 percent
                         of society consumes 70 percent of fuel, well ahead of direct and indirect consumption
                         of fuel by the bottom 40 percent through the use of public transport), the
                         administered fuel prices are an effective subsidy to the non-poor funded indirectly by
                         fiscal resources.

                         The reforms will, therefore, pose similar risks and opportunities for vulnerable
                         households, as VAT reforms. As with the VAT reform, fuel and electricity reforms
                         should go hand in hand with strengthening safety net and targeted expenditure to
                         mitigate the impact on the poor, while preserving fiscal resources.

                         The opportunities would be a stronger public balance sheet through reduced fiscal
                         risk and a better pass-through of global commodity prices to users, which could
                         facilitate a shift to alternative fuel sources and lead to a more stable balance of
                         payments, as the volume of fuel imports would fall if global prices rise.

                         percent in 2016) and an unchanged composition of exports. As a result of an inward-
                         oriented growth model, Sri Lanka suffers from a structurally weak external position,
                         and is vulnerable to shocks in a few key export markets (textiles, tea and rubber) and
                         a few destinations (European Union and the United States).

The internal             While being mindful of the impact on fiscal revenue and balance of payments, the

                         suggests that many countries, transitioned to upper middle income level, have gone
                         through similar processes (Box 5).

                               remaining duties. Economy-wide, the impact of opening up may lead to an initial

                               who benefit often have a less powerful and uniform voice than those who lose out.

Box 5: The Complexity of Sri Lanka’s Tariff Structure and Reform Possibilities
   The government of Sri Lanka has recently adopted the New Trade Policy36 with “an overarching objective to improve
   domestic productive capacity and trade performance, revitalize the nation ’s integration in global and regional markets, raise the living
   standards of the people and accelerate the nation’s long-term economic growth rate”. A central piece of the implementation of this
   strategy is to simplify and reduce the burden of protective import taxes. Indeed, Sri Lanka’s import tax structure has
   become a complex web of tariffs and para-tariffs that have been revised frequently during the last decade. The
   revisions have been ad hoc, inconsistent, and have followed different directions. The number and complexity of the
   taxes on imports impair the development of competitive firms, industries, and exports.

   Ports and Airports Development Levy (PAL) and Cess are two prominent para-tariffs. As of October 2017,
   besides Customs Duties (CDs) which have rates of 0 percent; 15 percent, and 30 percent,37 there are two taxes that
   apply exclusively to imports (“para-tariffs”): (i) PAL with rates of 0, 2.5 and 7.5 percent; and (ii) import cess, which
   has ad-valorem, specific and mixed rates that range from 1 percent to 465 percent.38 In addition, three other taxes are
   charged on both imports and domestic production (VAT, NBT and Excise) and one composite tax (Special
   Commodity Levy) is charged in lieu of all other taxes for a small number of mainly agricultural commodities.

   Para-tariffs add significantly to overall protection of          Figure 22: Cess prevalence and implied average
   domestic production. While PAL applies to most tariff            protection in different sectors
   lines (84 percent of the total) with uniform and low rates,
   the import cess applies to 28 percent of tariff lines with
   significantly higher rates (59 percent of tariff lines under
   cess pay a cess rate above 10 percent). The cess is also
   imposed non-uniformly between sectors with more than
   half of tariff lines in sectors like footwear, vegetables,
   textiles, plastics, and foodstuff, paying import cess. On the
   other hand, less than 10 percent of tariff lines in sectors
   like machinery, chemicals, and transportation pay import
   cess. Because the import cess generally falls on items
   paying non-zero customs duties, the level of protection
   afforded by the combination of tariffs and para-tariffs can
   become very high. Thus, average protection implied by the
   cess tends to be higher for sectors like foodstuff, footwear,
   glass, vegetables, etc. (Figure 1).

   Revenues generated by para-tariffs are relatively low, Source: Customs data, staff calculations
   making tariff rationalization manageable from a
   revenue standpoint. In 2016, the two most prominent para-tariffs, Cess and PAL, represented less than 10 percent
   of total government revenue. The largest share of revenue from imports arises from domestic taxes such as Excise,
   VAT, and NBT applied to imports. These taxes, along with the SCL, generated more than 28 percent of total tax
   revenue in 2016. Finally, the government forgoes considerable revenues through the provision of many exemptions
   to several of the seven taxes applied on imports for different purposes. Thus, from a revenue point of view, there is
   considerable room to rationalize the very pervasive and complex para-tariff regime.

   The complexity of para-tariffs also means that there is much scope for relatively painless rationalization.
   For example, there are many tariff lines where revenue collections are very low or negligible. There are a very large
   number of tariff lines where the import cess is specific (as in Rs/unit), and could be converted to ad-valorem. The
   overall duty structure is also very dispersed, and a serious effort could be made to reduce this variation.

   A broader reform of all tariffs and para-tariffs also needs to begin, as announced in the New Trade Policy.
   Such reforms are expected to have a positive impact on the economy as a whole, with the gains in GDP, exports, and
   imports, as well as a lowering of the price level for consumers outweighing the impact on those sectors that are less
   competitive and face a risk of shrinking.

   The process is manageable, and a part of the transition to upper middle income levels. For example, Thailand
   reduced its average tariffs from 40.4 percent in 1991 to 8.2 percent in 2014; Malaysia from 13.6 to 3.4 percent between
   1991 and 2014. Both countries are in the upper middle income ranks. Sri Lanka’s average tariffs (including para -
   tariffs), by contrast, rose from 13.4 to 21.9 percent between 2004 and 2016.




                            37Specific or mixed custom duty rates apply to 262 tariff lines (3.8 percent of total).
                            38The import cess is only applied on 1,937 tariff lines (TLs). The ad-valorem rates apply to 598 TLs and
                            range from 1 percent to 70 percent; specific rates apply to 522 TLs and range from LKR 4/kg to LKR
                            6,000/kg; mixed rates apply to 817 TLs and range from 8 percent or LKR 25/kg (whichever higher) to
                            35 percent or LKR. 2,000/kg (whichever higher). The ad-valorem equivalents of specific and mixed rates
                            usually exceed 10 percent and can reach up to 350 percent.

                  3. Public debt and contingent liabilities
Sri Lanka’s public       At 79.3 percent of GDP, Sri Lanka’s public debt is high compared to its regional

risks.                   status has led to more commercial borrowing terms and increased the cost and risk.
                         The non-concessional and commercial component of the government foreign debt
                         rose from 1 percent in 2000 to 53 percent in 2016. The interest rate risks on foreign
                         currency debt has risen, while average interest rates also increased. The average time
                         to maturity has shortened, and reserve adequacy in relation to share of the foreign-
                         currency commercial debt component has deteriorated. Given the bunching in
                         external Eurobond repayments, external debt service could become a matter of
                         concern starting from 2019 (Box 6). Guaranteed and non-guaranteed SOE debt
                         amounted to about LKR 1.3 trillion or 12 percent of GDP, presenting additional fiscal
                         risk.

Compounded by            The fragmented institutional framework and lack of a comprehensive debt

                         short in providing a comprehensive framework for modern debt management. 39 The
                         Private Public Partnership (PPP) agenda may move the direct fiscal cost of investment
                         to the private sector, but may require the public sector to assume more fiscal risk.

                         rates and thereby the cost of funding for households and firms. Together with the
                         expected presentation of the Secured Transactions Registry Act, which will allow
                         firms to pledge movable collateral for loans, this would support access to finance on
                         reasonable terms for the struggling SME sector. Improvement in SOE governance
                         may reduce fiscal pressures and improve service delivery.




                         39   A well-defined legal framework for debt management includes the following: clear authorization for
                              the Executive branch to borrow and issue guarantees on behalf of the government, definition of long-
                              term debt management objectives to guide the debt management office, definition of the purposes of
                              borrowing (including to finance budget deficit and cash needs, to refinance and prefinance outstanding
                              debt, to honor guarantees, to fulfil requirements by the central bank to issue Treasury bills),
                              requirement of the Executive branch to develop a debt management strategy in line with objectives to
                              guide borrowing decisions; and requirement to report annually on the implementation of the strategy

However, urgent          Fiscal risks emanating from the debt portfolio and SOE-related liabilities highlight
action is needed to      the need to carry out reforms. In this context, the government has initiated steps to
manage the               set up a unified Debt Management Office (DMO) to manage the debt portfolio, but
downside risks of        progress has been slow. In order to enhance performance and reduce the fiscal risk

                         the right direction, more needs to be done to manage the risks and reap the benefits
                         of improved performance.

                         The World Bank recommends that the government:
                         • Continue the already started work on establishing the unified DMO and
                            strengthen the legal framework for debt management, which currently has some
                            gaps.
                         • Formulate and implement a comprehensive Medium-term Debt Management
                            Strategy (MTDS): A proactive debt management strategy can provide guidance
                            to the DMO on how to consider trade-off between the costs and risks of available
                            domestic and external borrowing options, while enhancing transparency and
                            predictability in the domestic financial market that will contribute to capital
                            market development.
                         • Active Liability Management (ALM): ALM operations could mitigate the
                            refinancing risks emanating from the bunching of Eurobond maturities, and
                            could help domestic bond market development. Changes to the budget’s legal
                            framework are needed to allow ALM operations (Box 6).
                         • Formulate a guarantee policy: A well-designed guarantee policy could ensure that
                            guarantees are going to priority sectors while helping manage fiscal risks. Key
                            elements would be an independent credit risk assessment, charging a risk-adjusted
                            guarantee paid into a guarantee fund, and close monitoring of the beneficiary and
                            the project throughout the lifetime of a project and a consolidated presentation
                            of debt and contingent liabilities. This is even more important given the
                            government’s vision to promote PPPs as an important vehicle for large projects.
                         • Strengthen capacity for modern debt management: Staff capacity in modern debt
                            management techniques and toolkits is critically important. Among others, these
                            include formulation and implementation of an MTDS and an annual borrowing
                            plan, carrying out a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), and ability to evaluate
                            various debt instruments and options for a prospective Upper Middle Income
                            Country.
                         • Manage fiscal risks from SOEs through implementing performance agreements
                            and monitoring mechanisms, establishing a centralized state ownership
                            institution to improve the effectiveness of public enterprises oversight and reduce
                            fiscal risks, and enhancing the capacity of public enterprise boards to improve
                            operational and financial performance.

Box 6: Active liability management could potentially reduce costs and risks for Sri Lanka’s debt.
 Sri Lanka faces external sovereign bond maturities starting from 2019 to 2023 and from 2025 to 2027 (USD 9.65 billion).
 The situation is exacerbated by maturing bonds of commercial banks and Sri Lankan Airlines during the period from
 2017 to 2019 (approximately USD 1.8 billion).

 switching (buy-backs and re-issuance) of bonds, and Source: Central bank of Sri Lanka, respective annual reports of
 building cash buffers for future redemptions. The SOEs
 government, for example, could decide to buy back one of the 2019 sovereign bonds (there are two bonds maturing in
 2019: USD 500 and USD 1,000) now and issue a bond, maturing in 2024 – a year in which there is no sovereign bond
 maturing. The benefits of ALM include (a) mitigating the bunching risk by improving the maturity profile; (b) lowering
 costs; and (c) reducing refinancing risks. It could simultaneously help improve the sovereign credit rating. However,
 ALM could create some fiscal costs related to buy-backs and higher interest rates due to extension of maturities.

 Similar to external debt, domestic debt in Treasury bonds and bills can be managed actively to improve the debt profile
 and market liquidity. Building cash buffers, buy-backs and switches could help debt management by lowering the cost
 and risks of the debt portfolio and by focusing on a limited number of benchmark maturities, which would (a) provide
 liquidity for primary and secondary market trading; (b) establish a stable and credible yield curve; and (c) help with the
 development of private debt markets. Moreover, buy-backs could be used to capitalize on market interest rate
 movements.

 Timing is important in ALM. Financial market considerations suggest that such a buy back should be expedited as (a)
 Sri Lanka’s bonds spreads have come down in the past few months due mainly to the confidenc e in the IMF program;
 (b) Tighter than anticipated global financial markets could increase the interest rate for new bonds issued; and (c) active
 debt management would signal the investors that Sri Lanka is addressing refinancing risks prior to large redemptions
 that could potentially have implications on macroeconomic stability.

 In order to facilitate ALM, the present legal framework on budgetary operations need changes. The annual
 Appropriation Act currently only gives the space to service the debt maturing in the budget, and does not allow explicitly
 for the building up of cash buffers and early retirement of debt maturing beyond the budget year. Simple changes to
 the provisions of the Act would provide sufficient flexibility for liability management for debt maturing in future years,
 while still providing an anchor for fiscal consolidation.

                  4. Natural disasters and climate change
Sri Lanka is             On average over the long term, annual losses for housing, infrastructure, agriculture,
vulnerable to            and relief from natural disasters are estimated at LKR 50 billion (or around USD 327
recurring natural        million), with the highest annual expected losses from floods (LKR 32 billion),

                         (LKR 1.8 billion). This is equivalent to 0.4 percent of GDP or 2.1 percent of
                         government expenditure.40

                         The execution of the budget is continuously knocked off track due to the impact of
                         natural disasters, which seem to have increased in frequency, severity and economic
                         impact. Evidence of disasters can be seen everywhere in the macroeconomic data: the
                         contraction in the agriculture sector in GDP data, the increase in food price inflation,
                         the decline in revenue due to temporary removal of duties on essential goods,
                         reallocated fiscal expenditure, increased imports of essential goods, increased imports
                         of oil (due to the 2016/17 drought’s impact on hydro power) and reduced exports
                         due to damage and losses in the productive sectors.

                         Due to the increased sophistication of the Sri Lankan economy, the damage caused
                         by the 2016 and 2017 floods and landslides was more than twice as high in US dollar
                         terms than the worst flood disasters between 1992 and 2011.

Better disaster risk     Better disaster preparedness and faster response to disaster will have benefits for all

                         food insecurity. Firms will face fewer interruptions in production. Public
                         infrastructure will be easier to maintain at a higher quality. The public sector would
                         benefit as it will be less subject to revenue and expenditure shocks and fiscal risks,
                         and the macroeconomy will be more stable.

To manage the risk       It is important for Sri Lanka to increase its physical resilience (to reduce impact of
