About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of starting a business is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for

addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

   8   Obtain construction guarantee and deposit it with the Municipality                2 days    USD 6
       Agency : Municipality of Quito (Municipio de Quito)

       Proof of the guarantee deposit is a required document for the building
       permit application. Once the land plans have been registered for zoning and
       before their approval, the Municipality noti es the applicant the amount to
       be guaranteed (fondo de garantia). The applicant can deposit the guarantee
       in cash or certi ed check or in the form of an insurance policy. The insurance
       policy is purchased in 2 days from a local insurance company. The fee to
       purchase the guarantee depends on the value to be guaranteed.


       After construction is nalized, the Municipality will return the guarantee
       upon inspecting the construction. The guarantee will be returned in full only
       if the actual construction conforms to the plans approved by the
       Municipality. It is assumed that the full guarantee is returned to BuildCo
       upon successful completion of construction. Therefore, the cost is not
       recorded.

       However, the transaction fee for the guarantee, which amounts to 0.05% of
       the guarantee itself, is taken into account because it is non-refundable. The
       guarantee amount is determined by the Municipality and depends on the
       type of construction, the size, the sector, and the relevant zone. For
       construction under 600 sq. m., the guarantee will range between 1.5% and
       3% of the warehouse value. For construction over 600 sq. m., the guarantee
       will be about 4% of the warehouse value.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      from the Property Registry
      Agency : Property Registry of the Metropolitan District of Quito

      An encumbrances certi cate ("Certi cado de Gravámenes") must be
      obtained at the Property Registry of the Metropolitan District of Quito. The
      certi cate remains valid for 60 days (with the certi cate dated from the
      request date, and not from the date the document is issued). If the
      registration of the property transfer has not been submitted by then, a new
      encumbrances certi cate would have to be requested.
      Since January 2013, it is possible to request the encumbrances certi cate
      online, by submitting a standardized online form (at
      http://www.registrodelapropiedad.quito.gob.ec/index.php/component/conte
      nt/article?id=26). Prior to requesting the certi cate, the user has to obtain
      user credentials at the Property Registry. After submitting the request, the
      user can either pay the fee of this procedure at the Property Registry or at
      any commercial bank. However, as of May 2017 the system was shut down to
      update it and no online certi cates can be requested.

      When issued, the certi cate can be picked up at the Property Registry or be
      sent to the user's address by courier.

      According to Art. 3 of "Ley Orgánica para evitar la especulación sobre el valor
      de las tierras y jación de tributos" enacted on the 29th of December of
      2016, and e ective after its publication on Ecuador's o cial Gazette No. 913
      of December 30th, 2016, a new procedure is required to register a property
      transfer. The Notary has to request a valuation certi cate to the Municipality
      (in our case study, to the Dirección Metropolitana de Catastro) that states
      the latest o cial updated value of the property. Without this document, the
      Registrar would deny the petition to register the property transfer.


      This procedure is simultaneous to requesting a non-encumbrance
      certi cate.

      These taxes are paid based on the o cial or on the market value of the
      property. The Municipality calculates the taxes according to the highest
      value of the two. The Property Appreciation tax (a capital gains tax named
      "utilidad" or "plusvalía) is also paid at this stage and is calculated on the
      di erence between the sale-price and acquisition-price of the property. In                                                Page 31

      These taxes are paid based on the o cial or on the market value of the
      property. The Municipality calculates the taxes according to the highest
      value of the two. The Property Appreciation tax (a capital gains tax named
      "utilidad" or "plusvalía) is also paid at this stage and is calculated on the
      di erence between the sale-price and acquisition-price of the property. In
      addition, the amount of the tax is reduced taking into account the economic
      bene ts added to the property by the seller and the antiquity of the
      property. The tax is 10% of the di erence. The tax was cut to 0.5% only for
      the rst transfer of any real estate delivered after January 1st, 2006, with a
      discount of 5% of that for every year old that the property/building is. The
      registration tax (1% of the o cial value) was eliminated. After payment of the
      taxes, the Municipality will issue a municipal permit-letter and register the
      property in the cadastre. The documentation shall include: (a) Notarized
      public deed (b) Previous property titles (c) Contracting parties identi cation
      documents (d) Encumbrance certi cate (obtained in Procedure 2) (e) Copy of
      the municipal permit for commercial activities for companies for the year in
      which the transfer is performed (patente municipal); (f) Copy of the Unique
      Contributors Number (RUC); (g) Copy of the 1.5 x 1000 municipal tax of the
      companies; (h) Property Appreciation Tax form duly signed by the Seller; (i)
      Letter of appointment of the legal representatives of both companies; (j)
      Minutes of the meeting of the Board of Shareholder of both companies in
      which the board authorizes the legal representative to buy and/or sell the
      property of the company; (k) Copy of the voting certi cate of the legal

      (Provincial Council). These taxes were lowered in 2006 in Quito to 0.1%
      ("Adicional de registro") + 0.01% ("Adicional de alcabala"), and $1.80
      administrative fee for each tax (total charge $3.60). The value used to
      calculate the fees is the highest value between the cadastral value and the
      contract value. The cadastre was updated in 2005.

                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding           foreclosure       BizBank will opt to retrieve the payment of the debt based on the sale of the assets used as a

                                       foreclosure will be handed down by the Court and an order to set up an auction will be
                                       issued. Once the time allocated by law for appeal lapses, the court would appoint an
                                       auctioneer who will be in charge of the sale of the debtor's assets pledged as collateral in a
                                       public auction.

Outcome              piecemeal sale    Because the hotel is going to be sold through an auction, the hotel won’t be able to continue
                                       operating and its assets will be sold piecemeal

Time (in years)      5.3               The foreclosure proceeding will take over 5 years in Ecuador from the moment of Mirage’s
                                       default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. It will take 4.5 years until the approval
                                       to initiate foreclosure is handed down by the Court. This stage will include all required
                                       notifications to interested parties, the expected counter-claim filed by the debtor, and the
                                       time required for the appointment and acceptance of the auctioneer. Subsequently, it would
                                       take about six months for the auction to take place, including the time required for
