 About Doing Business
 The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
 selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

 The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
 applying to them through their life cycle.

 Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
 quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
 property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
 insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
 of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
 the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

 By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
 over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
 reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
 climate of each economy.

 In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
 cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
 reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
 cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

 The    rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
 indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
 for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
 Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
 largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
 project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
 an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.

 The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
 performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
 distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
 frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
 aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.                                                                                        Page 2

     Starting a Business
 This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
 limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

 To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
 owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
 employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
 a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
 by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
 obtained for each of the component indicators.


 The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

         Upon issuing of the cadastral sheet, BuildCo. must outline planning
         permission should be obtained prior to applying for full planning
         permission. This permission informs an applicant whether or not the type of
         development proposed is consistent with the existing land use policy and
         provides overall development standards applicable to the site. Submission
         of an outline application reduces the risk of unnecessary expense in the
         preparation of plans and technical drawings for a development that may not
         be approved.


         To obtain outline planning permission, BuildCo must submit the following
         documents to the regional o ce responsible for the area concerned:

         • Two copies of the completed “outline application form” (TCP/3). An Outline
         application form (TCP/3) can be obtained ‘online’ or from the nearest
         regional o ce

         permission should be obtained prior to applying for full planning
         permission. This permission informs an applicant whether or not the type of
         development proposed is consistent with the existing land use policy and
         provides overall development standards applicable to the site. Submission
         of an outline application reduces the risk of unnecessary expense in the
         preparation of plans and technical drawings for a development that may not
         be approved.


         To obtain outline planning permission, BuildCo must submit the following
         documents to the regional o ce responsible for the area concerned:

         • Two copies of the completed “outline application form” (TCP/3). An Outline

        property is located. The deeds registartion system, established under
        the Common Law system, was the initial property registration system
        and then RPA was introduced and the property in the city of Port of
        Spain is predominantly still held under it. This is the reason why the
        calculations of the time and cost in the DB Report re ect the
        Common Law system. Under RPA, all dealings with land or property in
        endorsed on a document called a Certi cate of Title, so it is also
        referred to as the Title system, and the Common Law system is
        referred to as the Deeds system. Title searches are carried out under
        both systems as a routine part of the property registration system.
        The search under RPA is quicker and less expensive as the certi cate
        of title provides all the information on the previous owners on it. In
        the case of the Deeds registration, one is required to do a search for
        a minimum of 20 years. The search is done manually and entails
        longer time and higher costs. A search clerk conducts the title search
        at the Land Registry by examining the Index of Deeds and Country
        Books relating to parcel of land. The Land Registry created an online
        database which is in the testing stage and, thus, only grants access to
        search clerks. The fee for conducting a single index or a single deed
        search is TDD 10.

                                                            - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                            - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                            - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                            largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                            - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                            loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                            of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                            to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                            property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                            In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

      Paying Taxes
  This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
  as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
  was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

  Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
  economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
  shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
  across economies.

  The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

 Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
 paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
 number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
 the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
 frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
 distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
 tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

      Trading across Borders
  Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
  measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
  compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
  round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

  Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
  questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
  With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
  platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing

     Trading across Borders
 Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
 measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
 compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
 round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

 Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
 questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
 With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
 platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
 business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

 Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
 trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
 documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

 Cost required to enforce a contract through the                - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
 courts (% of claim)                                            and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

                                                                - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
   Court fees
                                                                - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
   Enforcement fees
                                                                equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
 Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                     - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                                commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                                - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
   Case management (0-6)                                        - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
   Court automation (0-4)                                       - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
   Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                         - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s

       Resolving Insolvency
  Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
  used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
  liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
  by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
  banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

  Proceeding           receivership         Upon Mirage's default on the secured loan, there will be a stay period of 10 days for Mirage
                                            to attempt to negotiate and reorganize its financial affairs. In the meanwhile, BizBank is likely
                                            to immediately appoint an interim receiver and in the terms of the debenture to take control
                                            of all charged assets of Mirage. Since BizBank is a major creditor, it is also likely that it will not
                                            support reorganization and instead will appoint a usual receiver who will conduct piecemeal
                                            sale of the assets under protection and guidance of the High Court.

  Outcome              piecemeal sale       The appointed receiver will try to sell the business as a going concern. However, it is unlikely
                                            to happen considering the market condition in Trinidad and Tobago. Sale of the assets will
                                            take place informally as there are usually no auctions.

  Time (in years)      2.5                  The receivership proceeding takes approximate 2.5 years until BizBank is repaid some or all
                                            of the money owed to it. The delay is largely due to potential objections from debtors and
                                            the difficulty to find buyers of Mirage's assets.

  Cost (% of           25.0                 The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 25% of the value of the
  estate)                                   debtor's estate. Main components of the costs incurred include attorney fees and receiver
                                            fees.
