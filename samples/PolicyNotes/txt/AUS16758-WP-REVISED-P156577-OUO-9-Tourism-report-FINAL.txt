       Tourism in Kenya: More than Meets the Eye: Today, the typical international
       tourist arrives in Kenya on a package tour that may include a safari, a visit to
       the beach, or both. Tourism is Kenya’s third largest source of foreign exchange,
       it dominates the service sector, and contributes significantly to employment.

          For example, in the case of exogenous investment and foreign account, the backward multiplier for tourism is 0.22 for Kenya against 0.18 for Tanzania (see Annex for details).
          This means that there is a greater impact in Kenya. For instance, $1 spent in Kenya induces a backward multiplier effect of 22 cents in Kenya but 18 cents in Tanzania.

     Measuring the contribution of tourism to GDP is not a simple exercise since tourism involves a plurality of value chains that include travel, lodging, leisure
     activities, and many interlocking sectors and subsectors. For example, in the case of Italy, one of the world’s most sought out tourist destinations, the World
     Atlas estimates that tourism accounts for 19 percent of GDP, while the government declares “…the sector of tourism, including the activity it generates,
     contributes approximately one-third to the overall GDP by creating over one million jobs.” (http://www.esteri.it/mae/en/ministero/servizi/benvenuti_in_

                According to the World Bank and the Kenya Economic Survey, in the years 2012-2014, tourist arrivals declined from 1.8 million to 1.3 million, while expenditure increased
                from $197 million to $206 million, with expenditure per-capita increasing from $108 to $153. Other accounts, such as a recent interview with the Minister of Tourism, suggest
                that earnings from foreign tourism had fallen to $870 million from a peak of $1.2 billion in 2011. (http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Balala-sees-Kenya-tourism-recovering-

                A common sight in the Masai Mara is that of tourists crowding around (say) a pride of lions, trying to get a good view. The experience has often been compared to that in a zoo,
                lacking in both authenticity and quality, and as a result few experienced wildlife enthusiasts visit Kenya’s most popular sites.

                During the 2008–09 recession, tourist numbers plummeted across the globe, yet tourist numbers in Tanzania were largely unaffected (World Bank, 2016).

recognizes that tourism is a major sector of           Equilibrium (CGE) model of the Kenyan economy

will have impacts that reverberate throughout          of the model and the Annex discusses more
the economy, with magnitudes that are defined          technical details.

   Box 1: Description of the CGE Model


   The CGE was formulated using fixed input-output coefficients for intermediate inputs, linear
   expenditure systems for household consumption, and Cobb-Douglas specifications for demand for
   factors of production. Trade is modeled assuming that internationally tradable and non-tradable
   goods are imperfect substitutes.

   The main structure of the model is based on the reasonable assumption that intermediate inputs
   are not substitutes for each other in production technology. The main features involve profit
   maximization by producers, utility maximization by households, mobility of labor, and competitive
   markets. It is a static and single-country CGE model extended to incorporate both national and
   international tourism and its relations with the other sectors and environmental variables.

   Tourism is modeled as an industry providing a specific product and by distinguishing the different
   components of the domestic value chain. Foreign tourist demand is divided into four components:
   business, beach, safari, and ‘other’, the latter category being a miscellaneous category that includes
   the relatively new forms of ecological and domestic tourism.

   The model has been calibrated using the SAM estimated for 2014 so that the model parameters
   are such that the CGE solution reproduces the 2014 data as a baseline reference. Two alternative
   closure rules have been used for the first experiments: (1) exogenous government expenditure with
   flexible exchange rate, and (2) fixed exchange rate with exogenous foreign trade. In both cases,
   closure rules are “Keynesian”, in the sense that they are compatible with less than full employment.
   Because the model is based on an extended Environmental SAM, it generates statistics of both GDP
   and green GDP (defined as GDP plus the additional value added imputable to the environmental
   components).

   An important caveat must be noted when interpreting the results. Projecting future economic
   performance is a complex and hazardous endeavor. Future changes in economic structures,
   technological innovations, policies, political priorities, and consumer preferences cannot be
   known. As with all modeling exercises, the analysis is based on a litany of assumptions, driven
   by data availability and computational constraints. The exercise provides projections based upon
   hypothetical scenarios, not forecasts of the economy.

                    Kenya is now at a crossroads and must decide how it will develop its
                    lucrative tourism sector. In terms of tourism products, the economic

                    significant contribution to GDP, jobs, and the rural incomes of the poor.

                                                      described briefly in Box 2 below.
As an example, if there is insufficient growth
in labor supply, the responsiveness of a labor        To assess how well the dynamic model
intensive industry to higher demand will be           performs, it is instructive to compare

are especially relevant since the magnitude           are not designed to capture short-term
and nature of backward linkages vary between          volatility, which is better analyzed through
the different types of tourism (safari, beach,        statistical modeling; instead, the CGE approach
business, and other). Hence, the availability         seeks to assess long-term growth trajectories.


   Box 2: The dynamic CGE model


   The task of introducing dynamic features in a CGE is conceptually straightforward but computationally
   complex. On the one hand, it amounts to replicating the static model over time periods – or
   equivalently adding a time subscript to the variables in the static model. On the other hand, solving
   intertemporal optimization problems are notoriously difficult, so the model needs to be simplified
   along a number of dimensions to be rendered tractable.

   Recognizing these challenges, a recursive dynamic version of the static CGE model was developed
   with decision-making linked across periods. The model contains a capital updating module that
   allows capital to flow between sectors as a result of increased demand for capital goods in
   one period that leads to an increase in productive capacity in a future period. The lag between
   investment and increased production can be interpreted as the time it takes to build new capacity.
   The demand for investment is assumed to be a function of income and the price of capital.

   Given these characteristics, the model generates a sequence of static equilibria, which reflect a
   path of continuous adjustment of the main economic variables. In turn, this can be seen as the
   result of the attempt of consumers and producers to respond to incentives by updating their
   decisions in light of the new evidence. To reflect this process, in each iteration, a new static
   equilibrium and a new SAM are computed as the basis for the computation of next period iteration.

Annex A: Dynamic CGE - Components of the tourism value chain
This annex provides a further robustness check of the results. Much of safari tourism occurs in
lodges, while beach and business tourists use the more conventional hotels. Lodges are typically
more labor intensive and located in rural areas and may cater to clients with different tastes and
spending patterns.

This annex shows that impacts on the economy vary depending upon whether investments are
made in hotels or lodges. These simulations can also be interpreted as the dynamic counterpart of
the supply shocks of Chapter 2. Tables 21 and 22 show the effects on income formation of an annual
expansion of investment in hotels and lodges as defined in the Kenya official statistics. Lodges
exhibit a higher productivity with better income distribution effects. However, the differences
appear relatively small at the level of growth considered. These are likely to become larger only
for significantly higher levels of investment in lodges.

Table 23 shows the basis of another two scenarios that explore the value added and job creation
potential of the tourism industry. In both scenarios, there is a 5 percent expenditure injection in
the tourism industry. In Scenario 1, this occurs evenly across all sectors of tourism in accordance to
the existing the historical pattern. In the second scenario, there is a higher investment in lodges,
whose construction and management is more labor intensive (scenario 2). The results (Tables 24 and
25) indicate that the contribution of a policy package of the second scenario would be far superior in
terms of value and job creation, and it would contribute substantially to economic growth.

     Annex B: Water in the CGE model

     This annex describes the manner in which water is integrated into the CGE model and the
     introduction of water into the SAM. The annex begins with a brief overview of the concepts that
     are relevant to exploring the effects of water in a general equilibrium context. To gain a greater
     understanding of the ways in which water impacts the economy, it is necessary to explore the
     role of water in each of the significant sectors of the economy that consume water. This is
     achieved by introducing water in the Social Accounting Matrix as described in the boxes below.
     This is followed by a description of the effects of water on the economy, beginning with the
     backward and forward linkages.

      Box 3: Water in the SAM and CGE models and some crucial definitions


      The incorporation of water into a SAM has traditionally been based on the idea of linking the
      input-output accounts with the natural system (see, for example, Isard (1969), Ayres & Kneese
      (1969), Daly (1968), Leontief (1970), and Victor (1972)). For water, as for other environmental goods,
      the methodology has followed a two stage process, consisting firstly in creating quantity based
      satellite accounts of the flows, and secondly integrating these flows into components of the income
      generation cycle by converting them into values.

      The concept of Virtual Water (VW) was defined by Allan (1993, 1994) as the water embodied in a
      product; i.e., as the amount of water that is used to generate a given product. The Water Footprint
      (WF) of a sector, a region, or a country on the other hand is a closely related concept, which
      is defined as the volume of VW necessary for the satisfaction of one unit of final demand. The
      consumption pattern of different economies can thus be characterized by the direct and indirect
      withdrawal of water, taking into account the international water flow involved in commodity trade
      (Chapagain & Hoekstra (2004), Hoekstra & Hung (2002), and Hoekstra & Chapagain (2007).

      In CGE models, water may be considered a factor of production (to produce something), as an
      intermediate input (a good not catering to final consumers), and a consumption good (caters
      to final demand). Furthermore, in the water geography and hydrology literature, “blue water” is
      defined as water extracted from aquifers, lakes and rivers, used by irrigated agriculture, and “green
      water” is the rainwater used by rain fed agriculture, while “grey water” is the amount of water
      needed to flush pollutants.

      In some CGE models, water is treated only as a municipal good (Wittwer, 2009) by focusing on
      municipal water demands as intermediate inputs or final consumption goods where trade-offs
      between urban water demands and water for crop irrigation are of central concern. Treated water for
      urban use and untreated water for irrigation enter the production function both as an intermediate
      input and as a factor of production.

   Using the 2003 KIPPRA-IFPRI and the KNBS SAMs as starting points, an Environmental–Water
   Resources SAM is built for Kenya by applying the entropic methodology described in Scandizzo
   and Ferrarese (2015) to national and state account data and other statistics (Kiringai et al., 2006,
   KNBS a,b,c,d, 2014). These methods are based on the so called “maximum entropy econometrics”
   (Golan, Judge, and Miller (1996) and are able to handle the “ill-conditioned” estimation problems
   associated with the lack of the degrees of freedom typical of i-o matrices. The methods are very
   flexible in combining a variety of specific data with prior information and national accounts.

   The matrix estimated contains a detailed natural resource account, including water resources,
   water distribution, and natural capital in various forms. The multipliers of this chapter correspond
   to the hypothesis that the rest of the world (including international tourists), investment, and
   the government are exogenous. Under this hypothesis, backward multipliers are on average 0.13,
   between a minimum of 0.06 for machinery to a maximum of more than 0.22 for distribution water,
   and highs of around 0.12-0.16 for agriculture, tourism, and most services.

   For water, in particular, it turns out that for both blue and green water, backward multipliers are
   very high at about 0.237, or almost twice the average backward multiplier of the other sectors. This
   means that on average an increase in 1% of demand for water is met with a 0.237% increase in
   the demand for inputs from other sectors. Forward multipliers are also similar for blue and green
   water and are around 0.09, which is about 72% of the average forward multiplier. This implies a
   much weaker linkage of water with the sectors that are closer to the final consumer, with only a
   0.09% of increase in water demand in response to an average 1% increase in all other sectors of
   the economy.

   Natural resources usually have higher backward than forward multipliers as a consequence of the
   lower contribution to sector uses compared to their response to exogenous demand increases in
   terms of demand for conservation, renewal, and management.

     Annex D: The water footprint

     Using historical data on national accounts and data from a plurality of sources, we have
     estimated the SAM accounts for water. Table 27 below contains the results of the SAM estimates
     of water withdrawn directly and indirectly by each sector. These values measure the amount of
     water directly and indirectly withdrawn to sustain the final demand of the sector and, as relative
     indicators, the ratio between the water value and the sector final demand value (value ratio)
     and the water quantity and the final consumption value (quantity to value ratio). They can be
     therefore interpreted as indicators of the water footprints of each sector. As the comparison of
     figures shows, the apparent domination of the irrigated agricultural sector in terms of direct water
     withdrawals is mitigated by this water footprint measure.

     When both direct and direct withdrawals are taken into account, several counterintuitive results
     follow: (i) traditional agriculture and mining are more water intensive than irrigated agriculture;
     and (ii) industrial sectors and services are less water intensive in terms of value to production
     ratio than services. We believe these results are new and highlight the importance of taking into
     account feedback effects when considering the footprint an economic activity. Stated simply, a
     sector that consumes less water than another may stimulate other more water-intensive types
     of economic activity that end up consuming a larger amount of water. This is why non-irrigated
     agriculture and mining have a larger water footprint than irrigated agriculture.
