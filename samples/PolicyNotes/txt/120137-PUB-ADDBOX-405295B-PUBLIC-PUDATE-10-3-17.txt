Foreword


Productivity growth is critical for accelerating development. Poverty across the
globe cannot fall unless poorer countries raise their per capita incomes. Some of
this income growth will come from investing in better physical and human capital.
However, we know that a signiﬁcant share of income growth derives from produc-
tivity growth, and speciﬁcally from innovations that render physical and human
capital more productive.
Understanding how innovations arise and are adopted, and which policies can sup-
port them, is important for development policy design. It is now even more impor-
tant, given the new wave of digitalization and automation that is rapidly altering
economies around the world. One of the key ﬁndings of the research presented here is
that the observed low level of technological adoption in developing countries is a
rational response of ﬁrms to a range of conditions they face: barriers to accumulating
physical and human capital, low ﬁrm capabilities, and weak government capacity.
Unlocking the enormous growth potential of moving countries closer to the techno-
logical frontier however is not as simple as, say, providing additional incentives for
research and development. Moving countries closer to the frontier will require far-
reaching policy changes that tackle multiple constraints to technological adoption.

The research presented here is part of a larger research project on productivity, led by

Preface


Productivity accounts for half of the differences in GDP per capita across countries.
Identifying policies to stimulate it is thus critical to alleviating poverty and fulﬁlling the
rising aspirations of global citizens. Yet, productivity growth has slowed globally over
recent decades, and the lagging productivity performance in developing countries con-
stitutes a major barrier to convergence with advanced-country levels of income.

The World Bank Productivity Project seeks to bring frontier thinking on the measure-
ment and determinants of productivity, grounded in the developing-country context,
to global policy makers. Each volume in the series explores a different aspect of the
topic through dialogue with academics and policy makers, and through sponsored
empirical work in our client countries. The Productivity Project is an initiative of the
Vice Presidency for Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions.

The present volume focuses on the roughly half of overall productivity growth that is
driven by ﬁrms adopting new technologies, products, and processes. In particular, it
examines a heretofore under-researched “innovation paradox”: Returns on technologi-
cal adoption are thought to be extremely high, yet countries appear to invest little,
implying that this critical channel of productivity growth is underexploited. The analy-
sis sheds light on how to redress this paradox and leads to rethinking many aspects of
innovation-related productivity policies.

Executive Summary


The Innovation Paradox
The centrality of innovation to the rise of advanced economies was captured by David
Landes’ (1969) classic metaphor of The Unbound Prometheus, referring to the Greek god
who released the power of ﬁre to mankind. Deﬁned as the introduction of new pro-
ducts, technologies, business processes, and ideas in the market, as well as the invention
of new ideas, innovation drives Schumpeter’s creative destruction process (Schumpeter
[1942] 2008), underlies modern growth theory, and is the critical ingredient in histori-
cal accounts of how countries achieve prosperity.

    In turn, the gains from Schumpeterian catch-up afforded to follower countries—
arising from the radiation of ideas, products, and technologies to developing
countries—represents an externality of truly historic proportions that should rise with
increased distance from the technological frontier. Yet Prometheus remains bound in
developing countries. This study documents that, despite the vast potential returns to
innovation, developing countries invest far less, measured along a variety of dimen-
sions, than advanced countries. Firms and governments appear to be leaving billions of
dollars on the table in forgone productivity growth and lost competitiveness. Indeed,
policy advice to move into production baskets thought to be more growth-friendly
misses the critical point that countries unable to innovate in their present industries
are unlikely to do so in new industries.

    To explain this innovation paradox the report focuses on three central determinants
of innovation performance: (1) the critical complements to innovation investment
needed to realize the high potential returns; (2) the range of ﬁrm capabilities required
to undertake innovation and take it to market; and (3) the required government capa-
bilities for implementing effective innovation policies. The analysis draws on two
important traditions, the neoclassical and the National Innovation Systems (NIS) lit-
eratures, highlighting the common ground between them, with the ultimate goal of
contributing to more coherent and effective policy making in developing countries.

The Nature of Innovation in Developing Countries

The ﬁrst part of the report describes ﬁrm innovation in developing countries and pro-
vides a resolution to the innovation paradox. Chapter 2 draws on several new sources of
ﬁrm data to generate stylized facts about the nature of innovation investments under-
taken across the development process. The analysis shows that ﬁrms report innovation


                                                                                             xix
     across the income spectrum and in all sectors, but that innovation often consists of
     marginal improvements in process or products, rather than signiﬁcant technology
     adoption or new product imitation, and it very infrequently involves frontier research.
     The coexistence of the extraordinarily low levels of innovation-related investment in
     poor countries with the dramatically high returns thought to accompany technological
     adoption and Schumpeterian catch-up, particularly far from the frontier, deﬁne the
     innovation paradox.

        More important, investments in innovation-related inputs increase with income per
     capita. The paucity of high-level investment is suggestive that the appropriate policy
     model to support innovation in developing countries will differ from that of advanced
     countries, where policy often centers on research and development. More generally,
     the co-movement with the development of a wide variety of innovation inputs suggests
     a high degree of complementarity among different factors of production in the innova-
     tion function.


     Explaining the Innovation Policy Paradox: The Importance of
     Complementarities

     Chapter 3 offers a resolution to the innovation paradox. The new data sources analyzed
     show that the higher returns to innovation predicted by Schumpeterian catch-up are
     far from being realized. The returns to innovation are often positive and high but,
     below a certain level of development, decrease with distance from the frontier and may
     even become negative. The chapter proposes that this decline is driven by the absence
     of a broad set of complementarities, such as physical and human capital, which becomes
     more acute with distance from the frontier and more than offsets the gains from
     Schumpeterian catch-up. If a ﬁrm (country) invests in innovation but cannot also
     import the necessary machines, contract trained workers and engineers, or draw on
     new organizational techniques, the returns to that investment will be low. In turn, the
     underlying conditions that impede the accumulation of any of these types of capital—
     such as the cost of doing business, trade regime, competitiveness framework, or capital
     markets, as well as those seen as particular to innovation, such as intellectual property
     rights protection or market failures that disincentivize the accumulation of knowledge—
     affect the returns and hence the quantity of innovation investment.
        This insight has two implications for innovation policy and evaluation. First, it suggests
     that the policy maker’s conception of the NIS must go beyond the usual institutions and
     policies to offset widely recognized innovation-related market failures, to include these
     broader complementary factors and supporting institutions. Second, conventional mea-
     sures of benchmarking innovation performance, such as comparing raw levels of gross
     domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD), are likely to be misleading if they do not take into
     account the stock of other complementary factors: countries with low levels of physical or
     human capital probably should not try to target advanced country levels of R&D.

Managerial Practices As a Key Input for Innovation

Chapter 4 focuses on describing a key input and complementary factor for innova-
tion: managerial and organizational practices. An ample literature in the NIS tradi-
tion argues that, in order to innovate and manage innovation projects effectively,
ﬁrms need to acquire a range of capabilities. Teece and Pisano (1994)—and, more
in the mainstream, Sutton (2012), Sutton and Treﬂer (2016), or Hallak (2006),
among others—have also stressed the acquisition of these capabilities as fundamen-
tal to both productivity and quality upgrading. Accounts of the East Asian miracles
in the NIS tradition place primary emphasis on the process of learning and raising
the capabilities for innovation of ﬁrms, rather than on the particular sectors they
were in (see Kim 1997; Hobday 2000; Dodgson 2000; Lee 2013).

    The recent introduction of the World Management Survey (WMS), initiated by
Bloom and Van Reenen (2007, 2010), has permitted a quantum leap in the compara-
tive quantitative analysis of management practices and their implications for produc-
tivity and innovation. In particular, the WMS has documented that developing
country ﬁrms are indeed lagging in a wide range of capabilities that are critical to the
Schumpeterian catch-up process. Average scores in monitoring, employment of just-
in-time processes, internal feedback mechanisms, long-run planning and goal stretch-
ing, and human resource policies in poor country ﬁrms are well below those in frontier
countries. Firms that lack the capabilities required to respond to market conditions,
identify new technological opportunities, develop a plan to exploit them, and then
cultivate the necessary human resources will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to innovate.

   Using several new data sources, chapter 4 conﬁrms the importance of advanced
managerial and organizational practices for innovation. Empirical analysis shows their
direct impact on innovation. Even after controlling for the usual inputs such as R&D,
managerial and organizational practices are important predictors of innovation and
productivity across countries, ﬁrm size, and country income levels, and can partly
explain the lower returns to R&D found in poorer countries.

   In sum, developing these capabilities is of paramount importance for innovation
policy, especially in countries and ﬁrms that are more distant from the technological
frontier.

What Drives Managerial Capabilities?

The above ﬁndings beg the question of why managerial capabilities are so weak in
developing countries. Chapter 5 shows that scores are of lower quality than those in
the frontier (the United States) across the entire distribution, which implies that con-
vergence to the frontier requires not only the exit of badly run ﬁrms but also upgrad-
ing of the best ﬁrms. Several factors emerge as affecting managerial quality. More
educated managers tend to be better. Limits on competition can impair managerial


Executive Summary                                                                          xxi
       capabilities, either by enabling the most inefﬁcient ﬁrms to survive or by failing to
       provide adequate incentives for ﬁrms to upgrade. Firms with diffuse ownership tend
       to be among the best, whereas government-owned companies and family-owned
       ﬁrms are weaker, the ubiquity of the latter in developing countries partly due to weak
       rule of law.

           Chapter 5 also explores several sources of learning and upgrading capabilities. One
       critical source is related to participation in international trade. Openness to trade pro-
       vides incentives to upgrade and exposure to new ideas. Imports can increase access to
       technology and its embedded know-how, and exporting enables ﬁrms to learn about
       more sophisticated and contested markets. Foreign direct investment (FDI) can also
       provide important learning opportunities: Firms with foreign ownership tend to be
       better managed and are more likely to perform R&D and to introduce product
       innovations. Exposure to multinational enterprises (MNEs) and participation in global
       value chains (GVCs) can also be important sources of knowledge spillovers, although
       in many cases spillovers do not occur because domestic ﬁrms lack the complementary
       capabilities that would allow them to accumulate knowledge.


       The Innovation Policy Dilemma
       The second part of the report focuses on how governments can better support innova-
       tion and in particular the accumulation of innovation capabilities. This requires con-
       fronting what we label the innovation policy dilemma: For developing countries, the
       greater magnitude of the market failures to be resolved and the multiplicity of missing
       complementary factors and institutions increase the complexity of innovation policy;
       at the same time, governments’ capabilities to design, implement, and coordinate an
       effective policy mix to manage it are weaker.


       Weak Government Capabilities

       Governments in many developing countries lack the human resources and orga-
       nizational efficiency to design and implement policies that could redress market
       and system failures and hence foment innovation. This weakness constitutes
       another key to the innovation paradox, yet the role that public servants, minis-
       tries, and agencies play in ensuring or undermining the effectiveness of innova-
       tion policy is generally absent in academic and policy discussions. Chapter 6 offers
       an overall view of the necessary policy capabilities and how to improve them.

          Governments require capabilities for policy making across four key dimensions:

          1. Policy design requires the ability to identify market failures, design the
             appropriate policies to redress them, and establish clear metrics for success.
             Many failed experiments in developing countries result from simply importing


xxii                                                                             Executive Summary
      from advanced countries institutional models and best practices that may not
      address the true failures or be politically viable. Many agencies, such as public
      research institutions, lack a clearly deﬁned mission and incentives that would
      align them with identiﬁed clients and goals and shield them from capture.
   2. Efﬁcacy of implementation requires strong public management practices,
      as well as processes for evaluating, adapting, and modifying or terminating
      policies when needed.
   3. Coherence of policy across the NIS requires the ability to take an overview of the
      overall system and effectively coordinate across ministries and agencies. In
      practice, policy is often balkanized by ministry or administrative level, and there
      is little alignment between the stated goals of policies and actual budgets and
      impact.
   4. Policy consistency and predictability require systems that cultivate innovation
      policies and institutions over time, overcoming ﬂuctuations in political economy
      and guaranteeing a predictable environment for long-run innovation investing.
      Instead, there is often limited national consensus on the importance of the
      innovation agenda and high-level political commitment, and policy is subject to
      weak backing and frequent reversals.

   None of these capabilities is easy to generate or maintain.


Supporting the “Capabilities Escalator”

The final step in addressing the innovation policy dilemma requires choosing the
appropriate combination of innovation policy instruments—the policy mix—in
the context of scarce government capabilities. Chapter 7 offers a heuristic frame-
work, the “capabilities escalator,” where policies to support firm upgrading are pri-
oritized consonant with the level of capabilities of the private sector, and of policy
makers and institutions, and ratchet up through progressively higher stages of
sophistication:

   1. Stage 1 primarily supports production and management capabilities
   2. Stage 2 increases the focus on supporting technological capabilities
   3. Stage 3 expands the support to invention and technology-generation
      capabilities

    Given the heterogeneity of ﬁrms found even in relatively poor countries, the frame-
work is not meant to be deterministic but rather to highlight overlooked policy
considerations. For example, as the report shows, and despite the absence of such poli-
cies in most developing country growth strategies, many advanced countries such as
Italy, Japan, Singapore, and the United States have invested and continue to invest heav-
ily and proﬁtably in the ﬁrst stage of the escalator. Chapter 7 discusses some of the key
policy instruments in the transition toward more sophisticated technological and


Executive Summary                                                                           xxiii
       invention capabilities such as technology centers, public research institutions, and
       other R&D instruments. Developing stage 3 capabilities is an agenda of decades that
       must be started concomitantly with efforts in the earlier stages, but it cannot be consid-
       ered a substitute for the policies to support stage 1 capabilities—ﬁrms need to walk
       before they can run.


       Rethinking Innovation Policies

       To conclude, the report shows that the low innovation activity observed in developing
       countries is not due to some irrationality on the part of ﬁrms and governments. Nor is
       it simply a question of remedying the commonly articulated knowledge-related market
       failures. Rather, innovation in the developing world faces barriers that are orders of
       magnitude more challenging than those found in the advanced world. Thus, fostering
       innovation requires a rethinking of innovation policies along three key dimensions.
          First, the importance of a wide range of innovation complementarities implies that
       the scope of the NIS that policy makers must keep in mind is much larger than in
       advanced countries and must include everything that affects the accumulation of all
       types of capital—physical, human, and knowledge—and their supporting markets. What
       looks like an innovation problem, such as a low rate of investment in R&D, may reﬂect
       barriers to accumulating other factors, including physical and human capital.
           Second, ﬁrm managerial and technological capabilities are a central complementar-
       ity to narrowly deﬁned innovation expenditures, and their cultivation is critical to
       fomenting a continual process of technological adaptation and quality upgrading. This
       implies a rebalancing of policy priorities toward management and technology exten-
       sion instruments and away from a focus mostly or exclusively on promoting R&D.
       Although R&D is an important input for innovation, it requires a set of capabilities
       that are unlikely to be prevalent in developing countries and its promotion cannot be
       at the expense of the other investments in the capabilities escalator.

           Finally, the complexity and problems in constructing a functional NIS and building
       private sector capability are greater in developing countries, whereas government capa-
       bilities to manage them are weaker. Innovation policy thus needs an honest balancing
       of capabilities with tasks, which requires working on a selective set of issues rather than
       trying to import a full set of institutions and policies from elsewhere.

           The analytical work here brings to light important shortcomings in the way statisti-
       cal agencies collect and interpret data, and the report implicitly makes a plea for more
       accurate measurement to help policy makers understand innovation in their econo-
       mies and to better benchmark performance of ﬁrms and the NIS.

           Both better data and better analytical frameworks are necessary as developing coun-
       tries face the dramatic and unpredictable evolution of the world economy. The rate of

technological change is accelerating, and we cannot know with assurance which sectors or
industries will offer rapid routes to prosperity, or what technologies will drive them.
However, Pasteur’s counsel that “fortune favors the prepared mind” remains as vitally
relevant for countries as for people, and this report provides a map of areas where policy
makers need to ensure they are ready. Raising the capabilities of ﬁrms to manage this
uncertainty and chart their way forward, ensuring that the innovation system provides
necessary complementary inputs and ﬂows of knowledge, and strengthening government
capabilities to manage a large and expanding set of challenges, are all keys to resolving the
innovation paradox and preparing countries for the opportunities ahead.

1. The Innovation Paradox


Introduction: The Innovation Imperative
The centrality of innovation to the rise of advanced economies was captured by David
Landes’s (1969) classic metaphor of The Unbound Prometheus, referring to the Greek
god who released the power of ﬁre to mankind. Deﬁned as the introduction of
new products, technologies, business processes, and ideas in the market, as well as the
invention of new ideas; innovation drives Schumpeter’s creative destruction process
(Schumpeter 2008, originally published in 1942) underlies modern growth theory, and
is the critical ingredient in historical accounts of how countries achieve prosperity.1

    In turn, the radiation of ideas, products, and technologies to developing countries
represents an externality of truly historic proportions. In the long run, productivity
improvements can account for half of gross domestic product (GDP) growth (Easterly
and Levine 2001), with adoption of technologies making up a sizable share of those.
This implies that the wealth transfers from North to South are hundreds of billions of
U.S. dollars per year, dwarﬁng international aid ﬂows. Although recent estimates of the
returns to research and development (R&D) for the United States and Spain put them
at a striking 40–60 percent annually, Grifﬁth, Redding, and Van Reenen (2004) argue
from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2005) data
that the returns rise much higher (potentially in the triple digits) with increased dis-
tance from the technological frontier, reﬂecting the gains from Schumpeterian catch-
up afforded to follower countries. Even prominent observers more concerned with
equity and how the fruits of prosperity are shared, such as Piketty (2017, p. 21), concur:
“Knowledge and skill diffusion is the key to overall productivity growth as well as the
reduction of inequality both within and between countries.” Moreover, the beneﬁts
from innovation go beyond income alone: the unmeasured welfare gains from improve-
ments in health and longevity are thought to be almost as large as those measured by
GDP per capita.2

The Innovation Paradox
Despite the vast potential returns to innovation, this study documents that developing
countries do far less innovation, measured along a variety of dimensions, than advanced
countries. This we term the “Innovation Paradox.” Developing country ﬁrms and

        BOX 1.1
       The Concept of Innovation
       One important problem in the study of innovation is the lack of clarity and consensus on what
       “innovation” means. Innovation means different things to different people. In this report, we adopt
       a broad, Schumpeterian view of innovation, which is more useful to understand the growth pro-
       cess of countries.
           Innovation can be deﬁned as the ability to use knowledge to develop and apply new ideas that
       result in changes in the production and organizational structure of the ﬁrm. Schumpeter (1934)
       deﬁned several of these applications that qualify as innovation:
           ■   Introduction of a new product or modiﬁcations to an existing product
           ■   A new process or technology in an industry
           ■   The discovery of a new market
           ■   Development of new sources of supply of inputs and raw materials
           ■   Changes in industrial organization
            Innovation is, therefore, broader than invention. It includes commercial applications of new
       technology, new material, or new methods and processes. It primarily involves the process of
       adoption of existing technologies, the process of copying or imitating attributes from other prod-
       ucts, or the adoption of new managerial and organizational practices or business models from
       other companies.
            Innovation also includes the invention of new technologies and disruptive business models.
       Although important, these are a small part of the innovation process, especially in those countries
       farther away from the technological frontier. The popular view of innovation that understands
       innovation primarily as invention, patenting, or the generation of disruptive technologies misses
       the larger part of the innovation process—the more incremental implementation of ideas and
       knowledge to improve the ﬁrm—which, as discussed extensively in the report, lies at the heart of
       the “growth miracle” in East Asia.
            An implication of this broader view of innovation is the fact that ﬁrms accumulate knowledge
       to apply these new ideas in different ways. These include not only R&D activities but also other
       knowledge accumulation activities, often informal or through collaboration with other ﬁrms,
       through learning from clients, or by participating in global value chains or international markets.
            Although chapter 2 deﬁnes in more detail ﬁrm-level innovation, the reader should keep in mind
       this broader deﬁnition of innovation throughout the report.




    governments appear to be leaving billions of dollars on the table, uncollected. Indeed,
    Pritchett (1997), among others, documents a “Great Divergence” of the last two centu-
    ries where, instead of poor countries catching up, with few exceptions rich countries
    continue to pull ahead. Comin and colleagues (Comin and Hobijn 2004; Comin and
    Ferrer 2013) argue that it is precisely the differences in the rate of adoption of new
    technologies that drives the magnitude of the Great Divergence.3

   In ﬁgure 1.1, Maloney and Valencia Caicedo (2017) suggest that the ability to
identify, absorb, and adapt technologies, as represented by the number of engineers
per capita, is indeed a key part of the divergence story. In 1900, countries such as
Argentina, Chile, Denmark, Sweden, and the southern United States had similar
levels of income but vastly differing capacities to innovate. These differences, in turn,
predict well today’s differences in income: the Nordic countries and U.S. states sped
ahead while Latin America lost ground. By contrast, in the 20th century, the growth
miracles of Japan and the Asian Tigers reﬂected their capacity to innovate and shorter
technological adoption lags (Comin and Hobijn 2010).

   Analogously, box 1.2 offers historical examples of how identical industries expe-
rienced both faster growth and greater diversification in countries better able to
manage new technologies than in countries with less capacity. Hence, policy advice
to move into production baskets thought to be more growth friendly misses a criti-
cal point: countries that have been unable to innovate and apply technological
advances to their present industries are unlikely to do so in new industries. Hence,
innovation capacity appears as the more critical policy priority for economic
development.

       Innovation and Development Outcomes
       History offers numerous examples of countries losing competitiveness or missing opportunities to
       diversify while other countries succeeded. Wright (1986) documents the difﬁculties the U.S. South
       faced in absorbing the knowledge required to replicate the North’s steel industries: despite having
       all the necessary raw materials, the Birmingham Steel Company was unable to adapt production
       technologies to local ores. The same lackluster performance occurred in the southern textile indus-
       try. By contrast, Japan was able to take the same extant textile technologies and modify them for a
       local context, eventually establishing its ﬁrst leading manufacturing industry. In the face of foreign
       competition in the early 20th century, Brazil experienced retrogression in its long-established iron
       industry until it made a deliberate push midcentury to upgrade technologically. Similarly, Spain and
       Chile became uncompetitive in copper in the 19th century because they could not identify and adopt
       new advances in mining and metallurgy, and eventually had to sell out to foreigners who could. By
       contrast, the United States leveraged its copper into a stock of high-level technical human capital
       and a network of universities and laboratories that pushed the frontiers of metallurgy and chemistry
       and laid the foundations for many of its subsequent industries.
            Likewise, in Asia, Japan was a major exporter of copper and relied on the industry as a main-
       stay of its economy until the end of World War II. As in the United States, Japan’s technological
       upgrading in the Meiji period (1868–1912) gave rise to major companies like Sumitomo, which
       began in the 17th century as a traditional mining company but later diversiﬁed into the machinery,
       chemicals, electric cables, metals, and the banking conglomerate that it is today. Development
       based on an extractive natural resource had radically different outcomes in Latin America than in
       the United States and Japan. We see the same dynamic at work today: Norway has leveraged its
       oil and gas deposits into a diversiﬁed economy with a dynamic high-tech sector whereas, for
       instance, Nigeria has not. In each case, the difference is clearly not in what is being produced, but
       rather how. Innovation is a critical part of that how (see Lederman and Maloney 2012; Maloney
       and Valencia Caicedo 2017).



    The Still-Bound Prometheus
    The paradox of low investment in innovation despite vast potential gains in efﬁciency,
    quality, and diversiﬁcation, and the lack of effective policies to facilitate these returns,
    suggest the existence of barriers to the ﬂow of knowledge and effective governance.
    Prometheus somehow remains fettered in the developing world.

        This report examines three such barriers: (1) weak ﬁrm capabilities to undertake
    meaningful innovation, (2) the general absence of critical innovation complementari-
    ties, and (3) weak government capabilities to manage the increased complexity and
    breadth of the innovation policies implied by the previous two.

       In exploring these three barriers, the report explicitly seeks common ground between
    two analytical traditions that often ﬁnd themselves at odds in both the conceptual and
    the policy spheres. The ﬁrst is the standard neoclassical tradition that, to oversimplify,
    sees innovation policy as largely remedying market failures particular to innovation.


4                                                                                        The Innovation Paradox
A commonly invoked failure is that, because knowledge can be used by many, a person
making the investment in research or identifying new technologies to bring to a coun-
try will not be able to recoup the full beneﬁt of the investment—others can proﬁt from
the investment at no cost to themselves. Redressing this failure has given rise to a vari-
ety of policy tools such as R&D subsidies or tax incentives, matching grants, and the
creation of nonmarket institutions such as public research institutes or universities.

   On the other hand, policy discussions in the National Innovation System (NIS) lit-
erature focus more on the interactions among the various actors and nonmarket insti-
tutions necessary for knowledge creation and diffusion—the innovation system—and
the nonlinear nature of knowledge creation.4 For instance, Triple Helix models stress
the dynamic interactions between university, industry, and government.5 Governments,
therefore, have a role in cultivating the necessary institutions, overseeing the interactive
process, and intervening to redress systemic failures where necessary. In particular,
the NIS literature has been very critical of the neoclassical conception of the ﬁrm, of
the market failure approach as adequate to guide policy, and more generally of the
minimalist state approach to growth policy.
    However, recent evolution on both sides of the divide, we argue, leaves a broad
area of common ground.6 To begin, both traditions put the ﬁrm, not universities or
think tanks, as the central generator of value added and the driver of growth; both
broadly accept the market as the primary allocator of factors of production, albeit
with different views of what can be said about the optimality of the outcome; and
both are doubtful that the composition of the production basket is the primary bar-
rier to growth.7 In addition, the neoclassical tradition has seen an increased focus on
the role of institutions in supporting the market, which makes it potentially more
open to the kind of systemic concerns of the NIS tradition. Perhaps of greatest impor-
tance, the emergence of systematic measures of management capabilities has opened
the door to a potential consensus view of the bounded rational ﬁrm and the corre-
sponding innovation policy.
   In developing our analysis of the three barriers to innovation, we will both draw on
and seek to highlight the common ground between the two traditions, with the goal of
contributing to more coherent and effective policy making.

Firm Capabilities

In the neoclassical simpliﬁcation, the ﬁrm is a fully rational, forward-looking actor
cruising with perfect foresight to the technological frontier, impeded only by a set of
well-understood market failures. We take advantage of new sources of cross-country
data to conﬁrm that, however useful in many analytical contexts, this is not an adequate
characterization of the average developing country enterprise. Such ﬁrms may lack
capabilities ranging from basic bookkeeping and plant layout skills, to the tools to plan
over a multiyear horizon, to the ability to identify a relevant technological advance and


The Innovation Paradox                                                                         5
    then cultivate the human resources needed to adopt it. They may have neither a clear
    idea of the technological frontier nor the abilities to approach it—that is, how to
    innovate. In this context, the standard battery of policies to redress the garden-variety
    market failures in the advanced world—R&D tax credits, matching grants, public
    research institutes—will not ﬁnd able partners in the private sector and will be ineffec-
    tive. Accounts of the East Asian miracles in the NIS tradition place primary emphasis
    on the process of learning and raising the capabilities for innovation of ﬁrms, rather
    than on their particular sectors (see Kim 1997; Hobday 2000; Dodgson 2000; Dutrénit
    et. al 2013; Lee 2013).

        The report reviews the recent evidence on ﬁrm capabilities; presents original
    research showing that basic managerial skills are central to the introduction of new
    processes, technologies, and products as well as to patenting; and documents that these
    capabilities are sorely lacking in developing countries. Few ﬁrms can articulate a long-
    run strategic plan of any kind, let alone an innovation project per se; and, unsurpris-
    ingly, few have human resource strategies that would support such a project. We
    introduce the “capabilities escalator” where ﬁrms advance from basic production capa-
    bilities to the ability to adopt and adapt technologies and then invent (ﬁgure 1.2). We
    offer evidence on what appears to drive differences in the level of capabilities across
    ﬁrms and countries, and the ﬁnal chapter presents evidence on the kinds of policies that
    appear successful in moving them up the escalator. Why ﬁrms do not naturally move
    themselves up the escalator, despite proven high returns to investing in business sup-
    port services, remains an open question; but the literature offers substantial evidence
    of severe market failures in the form of information asymmetries—ﬁrms do not know
    what they do not know—that appear to be exacerbated in developing countries, as well
    as about the efﬁcacy of the available support services.

       A central message of this report is that equating innovation policy to frontier sci-
    ence and technology policy will lead to frustration and waste if the ﬁrm dimension is
    neglected. This is not to say that developing countries shouldn’t lay the foundations for

the emergence of world-class universities and think tanks that can push the technologi-
cal frontier; this is an agenda of generations and needs to be started now. However,
without a corps of capable ﬁrms to take these ideas to market, these investments will
yield little in terms of growth.


Missing Complementarities

Firm capabilities are only one complementary factor essential to the innovation pro-
cess that is scarce in developing economies. Conceptually, innovation can be thought of
as the accumulation by ﬁrms of knowledge capital. It is thus subject to the impedi-
ments to the accumulation of any type of capital—for instance, thin ﬁnancial markets,
macroeconomic volatility, or obstructive business climates—in addition to those
barriers speciﬁc to innovation. Furthermore, this accumulation of knowledge capital is
not a free-ﬂoating activity, but rather occurs in a “production function” that also incor-
porates the accumulation of physical, human, and managerial capital. Advanced coun-
tries may count on well-functioning education systems and business climates to ensure
the accumulation of these complementary factors of production, but developing
countries cannot. This implies that what is called the National Innovation System or
Innovation Ecosystem in developing countries must extend beyond the concerns gen-
erally identiﬁed in discussions of Triple Helixes and the like to a much broader set of
business environment issues.

    More profoundly, however, the focus on complementary factors provides one of the
keys to the innovation paradox: while the potential gains from Schumpeterian catch-
up increase with distance from the technological frontier, the quantity and quality of
complementary factors decrease. As a result, if a government were to offer grants to
undertake innovation projects or R&D activities, scarce human capital may produce
products of limited quality, poor links with the private sector may limit the potential
for marketability, weak ﬁrm capabilities may mean that managers neither see the proﬁt
potential in the idea nor are able to organize production, barriers to capital imports or
weak ﬁnancial markets may prohibit investing in the needed material to operationalize
the idea, or the local education system may not provide adequately trained workers to
productively run new technologies adopted. In sum, the absence of these critical com-
plementarities means that the actual returns to innovation are far less than promised
by the catch-up effect. The innovation paradox, then, is a direct analogue to Lucas’s
(1990) classic query about “why capital doesn’t ﬂow from rich to poor countries” given
that its scarcity should guarantee a higher return in the latter.

   This, in turn, has implications for how we benchmark innovation performance.
A low level of R&D relative to the Republic of Korea or the United States may say
nothing at all about innovation-related market failures but rather reﬂect more
generic factors affecting all accumulation or the accumulation of complementary
factors. Hence, the standard raw comparisons of gross domestic expenditure on


The Innovation Paradox                                                                       7
    R&D can mislead policy making, emphasizing increases in R&D spending without
    digging sufﬁciently deeply into why the returns are not leading to such investment
    happening naturally.


    Weak Government Capabilities: The Innovation Policy Dilemma

    Finally, on the other side of the capabilities ledger, governments need to be able to
    generate an informed overview of the broader innovation system and identify failures,
    design coherent multi-instrument responses, implement them effectively and consis-
    tently over time, and then evaluate their effectiveness. Furthermore, as ﬁgure 1.2
    suggests, the policy mix or combination of instruments and institutions to support
    innovation needs to evolve, becoming progressively more sophisticated and dense
    with development.

        Here we ﬁnd another key to the innovation paradox: for developing countries, the
    greater magnitude of the market failures to be resolved—for instance, in upgrading ﬁrm
    capabilities—and the multiplicity of missing complementary factors and institutions
    increase the complexity of innovation policy, at the same time that government capabili-
    ties to manage it are weaker. Hence, the report attempts to shed light on the implemen-
    tation challenges inherent in innovation policy making in developing countries.

        On the design front, weak capabilities can lead to defaulting to isomorphic mimicry
    (Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock 2012)—importing organograms and practices that
    may not address the local failures and that do not generate corresponding functionality.
    Logical frameworks that would discipline policy by ﬁrst identifying the market failures
    critical to the local context, then engaging in cycles of experimentation and evaluation to
    generate the greatest local functionality, tend to be the exception rather than the rule.

        Effective implementation of these policies requires developing the appropriate tools
    for execution and strengthened management quality in an administrative context
    where policy instruments are deployed in a coherent manner, and consistently over
    time. However, in much of the developing world, policy is balkanized by ministry or
    administrative level, and in many cases there is little alignment between the stated goals
    of policies and actual budgets and impact. Furthermore, even though cultivating
    a functional NIS, including high-quality ﬁrms and knowledge institutions, requires
    decades of sustained effort, high-level commitment is frequently lacking and there is
    often little policy continuity across political cycles. Finally, the institutions established
    to execute policy often lack a clearly deﬁned mission and corresponding incentives that
    would align them with these goals.

        As with weaknesses in ﬁrm capabilities, these government capability deﬁcits con-
    strain and shape innovation. Redressing both is a long-term development priority; in
    the short to medium term, they need to be considered in both the ambitiousness and
    the design of innovation policy.

The Plan of the Report
The narrative of the report is structured in two main parts; the ﬁrst largely empirical
and analytical and the second policy focused. Throughout, we draw on new sources of
innovation and management data, and analysis that enable us to place the discussion
on ﬁrmer empirical foundations than was previously possible. The focus of these data
leads the report to disproportionately discuss formal ﬁrms in the manufacturing and
service sectors. This in no way implies a lesser importance of the issues for micro and
informal ﬁrms, agricultural enterprises, or start-up innovative ventures: the processes
of capabilities accumulation, barriers to innovation, or policy instruments described in
the report also apply to them. We highlight these where the literature and data permit.

   In part I, chapter 2 exploits several new sources of data and empirical approaches to
explore the patterns of innovation effort in developing countries, establishing the
apparent complementarities across a range of factors of production. Chapter 3 intro-
duces the Innovation Paradox, ﬁnds its roots in innovation complementarities, and
develops the implications of this both for how we conceive of the NIS and for the
resulting difﬁculties in benchmarking innovation performance. Chapter 4 goes deeper
into describing the importance of one particular input for innovation—managerial
capabilities—and chapter 5 describes some of the process of accumulation and learn-
ing of these capabilities.
   In part II on policies, chapter 6 takes up the problem of developing government
capabilities and the challenge of implementing innovation policy more effectively.
Speciﬁcally, the chapter focuses on three key issues for innovation policy: (1) identify-
ing the failure that constrains innovation investments, (2) strengthening government
capabilities for innovation policy making, and (3) the design of the agencies that imple-
ment these policies. Chapter 7 discusses the instruments available to increase ﬁrm
capabilities for innovation, and how the policy mix or combination of instruments that
form innovation policy may vary as national innovation systems become more mature.
The last chapter concludes.

    GDP very incompletely measures the true “output” of the health sector. Becker et al. (2005)
    calculate a “full” measure of income incorporating an economic value of longevity for 96 coun-
    tries from 1960 to 2000; they ﬁnd that 1.7 percentage points of the 4.1 percent full growth rate
    for the poorest 50 percent of countries are due to increases in longevity arising from reduc-
    tion in disease. Lichtenberg (2014) documents a large impact of foreign drug research on life
    expectancy. Hence, the ability to transfer and adapt health advances developed elsewhere with

         modest amounts of innovative effort may potentially generate much larger social returns for
         poorer countries.
      3. Likewise, Howitt and Mayer-Foulkes (2005) and Feyrer (2008) argue that Quah’s (1996) ﬁnding
         that countries converge to “twin peaks” arises from diverging productivity as opposed to diverging
         physical capital or human capital accumulation, pointing again to knowledge-related barriers pre-
         venting catch-up. Numerous models (Aghion and Howitt 1992; Howitt and Mayer-Foulkes 2005)
         postulate situations in which countries enter a “stagnation equilibrium” far from the technological
         frontier because they are unable to incorporate new technologies.
      4. See among others Freeman (1987), Lundvall (1992, 1997), Nelson (1993), Soete, Verspagen, and
         Ter Weel (2010) and Edquist (2011). Also, Freeman (1995) and Lundvall et al. (2002) discuss the
         origins of the term. Freeman states that the concept of a National Innovation System originated
         with Friedrich List’s ([1841] 1909) discussion of the system of institutions and policies most
         related to learning about new technology and applying it to Germany’s catch-up with England.
         See also Smits, Kuhlman, and Shapira (2010) for a recent review, as well as Lee (2013) in the
         context of leapfrogging in Asia and Latin America.
      5. See Etzkowitz (2001) and Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995). Firms increasingly engage in higher
         levels of training and knowledge sharing. Government acts as a public entrepreneur and venture
         capitalist, in addition to its traditional regulatory role in setting the rules of the game. Universities
         combine discrete pieces of intellectual property and jointly exploit them. Innovation has expanded
         from an internal process within and even among ﬁrms to an activity that involves institutions not
         traditionally thought of as having a direct role in innovation, such as universities. Edquist (2011)
         similarly stresses that there is no linear path from basic research to applied research and then to
         the implementation of new processes and products but rather that innovation is characterized by
         complicated feedback mechanisms and interactive relations.
      6. See Maloney (2017) for a detailed discussion.
      7. See for example Dodgson (2000, 261) who notes, “An important policy question for less tech-
         nologically developed nations, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, is whether the present empha-
         sis on electronics is likely to produce any longer-term sustainable comparative advantages. One
         might justiﬁably ask whether emphasis could be better placed on more traditional and historical,
         but still potentially high technology, high value-added industries, such as tropical cash crops in
         Malaysia and textiles in Indonesia.”

Understanding Innovation in
      Developing Countries
2. The Nature of Innovation in
   Developing Countries


Introduction
How frequently do ﬁrms in developing countries innovate, and what types of innova-
tion do they undertake? The literature on the advanced countries is extensive, especially
around the topics of investment in research and development (R&D) and patenting.
However, to date, the information on developing countries, both how much they inno-
vate and the nature of that innovation, has been scarce. This chapter draws on several
new sources of ﬁrm data to explore these patterns across the spectrum of countries and
how they evolve over the development process. We document a great breadth of inno-
vation-related investments, ranging from small process improvements to capital-
embodied technology transfer to R&D. However, overall innovation inputs and outputs
increase dramatically as countries get richer.

What Is Innovation?
Innovation has recently emerged as central to debates around how to rekindle produc-
tivity growth in both advanced and less advanced countries. Roughly, half of cross-
country differences in income per capita across countries are thought to be due to
differences in total factor productivity (TFP) (Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 1997; Hall
and Jones 1999; Jones 2016). In turn, although better allocation of factors of produc-
tion emerges as an important factor in productivity growth (Hsieh and Klenow 2009;
Restuccia and Rogerson 2008), a potentially larger contribution arises from improved
efﬁciency and product quality within ﬁrms and among newly entering ﬁrms (see, for
example, Collard-Wexler and De Loeker 2014 and Restuccia 2016). These gains reﬂect
innovation in production technique, product design, and to some extent branding,
all of which are driven by the ability to create, manage, and leverage new ideas.1

    To date, we have had only limited information on the nature of innovation
activities in developing countries, on how countries develop the capacity to innovate,
how it evolves over time, and what the potential barriers to innovation are. Most work
on innovation has been done through the advanced country lens, and innovation is
commonly seen as the work of highly educated labor in R&D–intensive companies
with strong ties to the scientiﬁc community. It has, therefore, been largely perceived
as a “ﬁrst world” activity.



                                                                                            15
         However, innovation also includes attempts to try out new or improved products or
     processes, or experiment with alternate ways to do things (Bell and Pavitt 1993; Kline and
     Rosenberg 1986). Further, the notion of Schumpeterian catch-up is precisely one of tech-
     nology adoption, imitation, and adaptation of existing nonfrontier technologies (Comin
     et al. 2008; Klinger and Lederman 2006), where ﬁrms adopt incremental (as opposed to
     radical) changes (Fagerberg, Srholec, and Verspagen 2010). It is also a process that
     requires the combination of different innovation inputs and outputs, such as product
     and processes, marketing or organizational innovations (Bell and Pavitt 1993).

        This extended conception of innovation is captured in ﬁgure 2.1; a broad set of
     tangible and intangible assets with embedded knowledge, ranging from basic human
     and organizational capital to R&D, need to be accumulated and combined to yield
     innovation outcomes in the form of new or improved products and services, produc-
     tion and delivery processes, business organization, and patented intellectual property.
     These, in turn, can lead to greater productivity and associated social beneﬁts such as
     better jobs, ﬁrm growth, and diversiﬁcation.

     Characterizing Innovation in Developing Countries: Some
     Stylized Facts
     Generating measures of ﬁrm-level innovation has been difﬁcult, especially for develop-
     ing countries, because of the lack of comparable information. In this section, we draw
     on several new sources of data, the World Bank Enterprise Surveys (ES) (see annex 2A
     for a detailed explanation),2 Bureau van Dijk (BvD) Orbis,3 and the World Management
     Survey4 to characterize the nature of innovation in these countries and how it evolves
     across the development process.

     BOX 2.1
    Deﬁning Firm-Level Innovation
    In chapter 1, the report emphasizes the broader and Schumpeterian view of innovation as the
    accumulation of knowledge and implementation of new ideas. Speciﬁcally, innovation is the
    implementation of a new or signiﬁcantly improved product (good or service) or process, a new
    marketing method, or a new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization,
    or external relations (OECD 2005, Paragraph 146).
        Several observations can be made regarding this deﬁnition, in particular:
        ■   An innovation must be novel or a signiﬁcant improvement (at least) to the ﬁrm (and pos-
            sibly to the market or other higher levels) and must be implemented (that is, introduced
            inside the ﬁrm or commercialized). On the other hand, there is no requirement for the
            innovation to be successful.
        ■   The general deﬁnition does not mention intention or objective, but it seems implicit
            that innovation aims at improving the ﬁrm’s competitive position and is associated with
            uncertainty.
        ■   There is no reference in the broad deﬁnition to technology, and the current deﬁnition (since
            the third edition of the Oslo Manual [OECD 2005]) explicitly considers “nontechnological”
            forms of innovation (marketing and organizational) that were not previously included,
            thereby encompassing a broader set of knowledge sources/types besides scientiﬁc/
            technical ones.
        The Oslo Manual deﬁnes the following four main subtypes of innovations:
        1. A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service that is new or signiﬁcantly
           improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes signiﬁcant
           improvements in technical speciﬁcations, components and materials, incorporated software,
           user friendliness, or other functional characteristics. In the context, traditional surveys have
           used three metrics to measure the complexity or novelty of the innovation:
            a. New products to the ﬁrm
            b. New products to the market
            c. New products to the international market
        2. A process innovation is the implementation of a new or signiﬁcantly improved production
           or delivery method. This includes signiﬁcant changes in techniques, equipment, and/or
           software:
            a. Innovative methods for manufacturing products or offering services
            b. Innovative logistics, delivery, or distribution methods for inputs, products, or services
            c. Innovative supporting activity for processes, such as maintenance systems or operations
               for purchasing, accounting, or computing.a
        3. A marketing innovation is the implementation of a new marketing method involving
           signiﬁcant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion,
           or pricing. These aim at increasing the effectiveness and efﬁciency of marketing, to gain
           competitive advantage.
                                                                          (Box continues on the following page.)

             4. An organizational innovation is the implementation of a new organizational method in
                the ﬁrm’s business practices, workplace organization, or external relations. This type of inno-
                vation ﬁts into one of the following groups: structural innovations that are meant to impact
                responsibilities, accountability, command lines, and information ﬂows, as well as the num-
                ber of hierarchical levels; the divisional structure of functions (R&D, production, human
                resources, ﬁnancing, and so on) or the separation between line and support functions; and
                procedural innovations, which consist of changes to routines, processes, and operations of
                a company. Thus, these innovations change or implement new procedures and processes
                within the company, such as simultaneous engineering or zero buffer rules.

        a. The following are not considered to be process innovations: minor changes or improvements; an increase in production or
        service capabilities through the addition of manufacturing or logistical systems that are very similar to those already in use;
        ceasing to use a process; simple capital replacement or extension; changes resulting purely from changes in factor prices;
        customization; regular seasonal and other cyclical changes; and trading of new or signiﬁcantly improved products.




     Innovation Outputs

     Although we have data only on a few dimensions on the elements in the center of
     ﬁgure 2.1—product and process innovation, improved organization, and intellectual
     property creation—the description of the data is nonetheless revealing.

     Product and Process Innovation
     Figure 2.2 combines the two main innovation datasets for developing and developed
     economies; the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Organization
     (UNESCO) data5 (blue dots) and the ES6 (green dots) to plot the share of manufactur-
     ing ﬁrms that report introducing either process or product innovation against national
     income. Given some important measurement challenges that are discussed in box 2.2,
     we include duplicate values for a few countries with information in both datasets,
     to compare differences in innovation rates.7

         What is immediately clear is that ﬁrms in poor countries report substantial innova-
     tive activities using both surveys. Further, ﬁgure 2.3 shows that this is broadly true
     across sectors. The Enterprise Surveys suggest that professional services and manufac-
     turing have the highest innovation rates (between 50 and 60 percent of ﬁrms reporting
     either product or process innovation), compared to about 24 percent in construction,
     30 percent in hotels, 36 percent in transport, and 25 percent in wholesale and retail.
     However, the broader point remains that reported innovation is widespread throughout
     the economy, and hence policy should not restrict itself a priori to one sector.

    Problems in Innovation Measurement
    Several approaches to measuring innovation have been pursued, each focusing on different aspects
    of the innovation process. The ﬁrst measurement efforts attempted to quantify speciﬁc inputs to
    innovation such as R&D, others have looked at outputs such as patents, or focused instead on prox-
    ies such as productivity. It is only more recently that attempts have been made to directly measure
    innovation activities and outputs within ﬁrms using so-called innovation surveys. Guidelines for
    conducting this type of survey were developed in the early 1990s and codiﬁed in the Oslo Manual
    (OECD 2005) to harmonize concepts and deﬁnitions for cross-country data collection. The most
    well-known example of these surveys is the Community Innovation Survey (CIS), a biennial survey
    carried out across the European Union. In the last two decades, the use of innovation surveys and
    statistics has grown across all regions, and about 100 countries have now carried out at least one
    innovation survey based on the Oslo Manual guidelines (Oslo-type) often modeled after the CIS.
         In a review of existing frameworks, Cirera, López-Bassols, and Muzi (2017) identify two main
    gaps in the measurement of business innovation. First, existing approaches tend to be R&D–cen-
    tric and do not fully recognize the importance of nontechnological innovation, which is more preva-
    lent in developing countries. Frameworks that consider innovation capabilities more broadly can
    considerably enrich existing measurement models. Second, the current measurement of innova-
    tion outputs, primarily product and process, is problematic because it is highly subjective; it poorly
    identiﬁes the extent of novelty of technological improvement; and it is incomplete, because impor-
    tant questions about the technology introduced or the degree of disruption are not measured.

         Problems in Innovation Measurement (continued)

              This has resulted in some volatility in innovation incidence rates. Experimental evidence has
         shown the difﬁculties in properly identifying innovation. For example, a recent study has shown that
         respondents in the United States are more likely to identify innovation with something new or unique
         and not to consider improvements as innovation; in Europe, on the contrary, people are more inclined
         to indicate both novelty and improvement as elements of innovation (Galindo-Rueda and Van Cruysen
         2016). In addition, the way the questionnaires are framed matters. An experiment conducted by
         Statistics Norway shows that innovation rates are signiﬁcantly different when captured by a stand-
         alone innovation survey than by a combined R&D and innovation survey (Wilhelmsen 2012). In
         Flanders, innovation rates were considerably and systematically higher when measured with a short
         questionnaire than when using a long questionnaire (Hoskens 2015). Although it is not clear which
         survey instrument is most accurate with respect to measured innovation rates, these results clearly
         suggest that survey methodology and design can greatly impact the results. Cirera and Muzi (2016)
         ﬁnd for a sample of 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia that responses to questions
         formulated identically to the same ﬁrm in two periods, one with a short module in a general ﬁrm survey
         and another in a longer dedicated innovation questionnaire, vary greatly within the same ﬁrm, even
         when the same person is interviewed. The authors ﬁnd that the time elapsed between interviews or
         the quality of the interview play a more important role in explaining these differences than a lack of
         understanding about innovation concepts. This calls for the need to improve the way innovation ques-
         tions are formulated with the objective of minimizing framework biases.
              Finally, methodological issues can also affect the measurement of innovation across ﬁrms of
         different size. A recent study in Poland, which compares innovation rates across ﬁrms’ size, shows
         higher innovation rates for micro ﬁrms as compared to small and medium ﬁrms (Rozkrut 2015). This
         counterintuitive result may be explained by the fact that micro ﬁrms may be more likely than larger
         ﬁrms to report improvements as innovation.

Is There a U-Shaped Curve in Innovation or a Measurement Problem?
The U-shaped curve shown in ﬁgure 2.2 is somewhat surprising: very poor countries
report higher levels of innovation than, for instance, China, Colombia, or South Africa;
and the slope increases again as countries approach the technological frontier. The high
level of variance among the low-income countries and often disparate values from
different surveys for the same country point to signiﬁcant measurement issues
(see box 2.2). For example, the ES reports that 80 percent of manufacturing ﬁrms in
India innovate, whereas the UNESCO data report only 20 percent (annex 2B). The
overall correlation between the two sources is only. 28, with the ES consistently showing
higher values. This suggests that, because the ES comprises the bulk of the low-income
sample, the U-shaped relationship is exaggerated. That said, some double-sampled
countries, such as Kenya or Serbia, emerge with conﬁrmed values higher than
many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.
Further, the U shape would emerge with either data set alone.

   Though we cannot go deeply into what is driving this, two important sampling issues
suggest themselves. First, there may be a compositional effect. For instance, in South
Sudan, which shows the highest response in our sample, as in Africa in general, there are
very few formal ﬁrms and, of these, many may be international importers; introducing
new products to the domestic market may include exactly that—introducing a new
import line, but with minimal level of technological transfer.

    Second, careful examination of responses reveals systematic differences in what is
reported as innovation across the income spectrum. Firms in poor countries report,
for example, changing lighting ﬁxtures as process innovation whereas this is less
often the case in the advanced countries. In the Africa region, of those ﬁrms intro-
ducing a “product innovation,” only 14 percent introduce a completely new product—
half the share of the other regions. In Chile, Aroca and Stough (2015) examine in
detail a random sample of 50 Chilean small and medium enterprises (SMEs) report-
ing considerable product and process innovations and ﬁnd that only one in ﬁve of
these ﬁrms produced true innovative outcomes and associated business growth.
Annex 2A similarly ﬁnds a lower correlation of reported innovation with productiv-
ity enhancement as countries move farther from the frontier. Cirera and Sabetti
(2016) ﬁnd no impact of innovation on productivity in developing countries when
this is deﬁned as imitation, which is suggestive of very marginal changes that are
reported as imitation.

   Further, this intuition is further supported by examining some subcategories where
innovations are more tightly and clearly deﬁned, thereby allowing less discretion in
response. Figure 2.4 suggests that the U pattern shown above is a survey response issue.
For countries with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita below US$40,000, the ES
distinguishes between more radical product innovation, or products new to the coun-
try or the world, and simple adoption/imitation of existing products or processes,

     which is less precisely deﬁned. We see that high scoring and poor countries again
     impart something of a bowl shape to the overall relationship between innovation
     and income level (ﬁgure 2.4). However, the dark blue line showing the share of ﬁrms
     undertaking more radical product innovation increases with income, from roughly
     3 to 10 percent.

        In short, available surveys may not fully capture differences in both the nature
     and the quality of the innovation effort that respondents claim. Annex 2B provides
     some guidelines on how to improve innovation measurement in developing countries.
     Although it is clear from the evidence reviewed that many ﬁrms do innovate, the ﬁnd-
     ing of an initial decline in innovation with development would likely disappear once
     accounting for the quality or novelty of the reported innovations.

     Intellectual Property and Patenting
     Creating codiﬁed intellectual property is another innovation output (see again
     ﬁgure 2.1) and offers an even more precise measure of innovative activity. Though
     patenting activity very incompletely captures the universe of relevant activity (see for
     example Moser 2013), patent applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce
     (USPTO) or European Patent Ofﬁce do provide a more standardized measure of a
     particular type of knowledge output.8 Hence, the patterns shown in patent data are

more reliable than the indicators discussed above for broader classes of innovation,
though they are perhaps less relevant for developing countries.

   The ﬁrm-level data from BvD Orbis enable us to disaggregate patenting activity into
incidence (share of ﬁrms that patent) and intensity (patents per patenting ﬁrm).
Although the Orbis data may not be collected in a fully uniform way across countries,
ﬁgure 2.5 suggests some rough stylized facts.

The Nature of Innovation in Developing Countries                                                                           23
         First, as expected, in most developing countries, with the plausible exception of
     China,9 well below 5 percent of ﬁrms do any patenting; however, this ramps up as we
     approach the technological frontier, most dramatically in Japan and Germany where
     over 40 percent of ﬁrms in the sample report patenting. This ﬁnding is consistent with
     ﬁgure 2.4 above showing that a similarly low share of ﬁrms introduces any radically
     new products or processes. Even Australia, Singapore, and the United States appear in
     this data to have relatively few ﬁrms patenting.

         It is also the case, however, that ﬁrms engaging in patenting increase the number of
     patents ﬁled for across the development process. Again, for most countries up to the
     income level of Greece or Italy, the very few ﬁrms that patent, ﬁle for relatively few
     patents. Though the Orbis data cannot be taken as representative of the overall ﬁrm
     population, they do conﬁrm the sharply increasing share of patents per inhabitant over
     the development process found using USPTO data (ﬁgure 2.5) and suggest it results
     from both incidence and intensity increasing. The data also conﬁrm that more sophis-
     ticated innovation activities increase as well and that relatively few ﬁrms in lower-
     income countries engage in radical innovation, either by introducing new processes or
     products or by actually patenting.

     Some Stylized Facts
     Overall, the evidence suggests ﬁve stylized facts in relation to innovation outputs:

        ■   A large fraction of ﬁrms report innovating in product and process across the
            entire income spectrum.
        ■   Innovative activity occurs across the economy and is not just restricted to, for
            instance, the manufacturing sector.
        ■   Imitation and adoption are the prevalent forms of innovation in low- and
            middle-income countries.
        ■   Innovation increases with income. Though the subjective data on introducing
            new products or processes suggest more innovation among the very poor
            countries than the middle-income countries, controlling for the quality of
            these reported investments is not possible using current surveys. With tighter
            deﬁnitions of what constitutes an innovation, we ﬁnd innovation positively
            correlated with income overall.
        ■   The process of increasing innovation nationally includes both increasing the
            share of ﬁrms that undertake innovation as well as the intensity with which
            they do it.

     Innovation Inputs

     Figure 2.1 reﬂects a wide range of inputs into the innovation process, ranging from
     basic organizational capacity to R&D. Data limitations force us to focus on a narrow
     subset of these that have been collected on a consistent cross-country basis.


24                                                                         The Innovation Paradox
R&D
R&D spending is the most commonly discussed input into innovation, largely because
it is one of the very few inputs measured with consistency across ﬁrms and countries.
R&D is thought to facilitate both advances at the technological frontier and catch-up
through building absorptive capacity (see, for instance, Cohen and Levinthal 1990)
and most studies ﬁnd it robustly related to innovation. Analysis with the ES data con-
ﬁrms this: R&D is an input into product and process innovation measured either by
whether the country does R&D or by overall intensity. Cirera (2017) attempts to con-
trol more directly for causality and ﬁnds R&D signiﬁcantly related to product innova-
tion in particular.
   Furthermore, numerous authors (Hausman, Hall, and Griliches 1984; Hall, Griliches,
and Hausman 1986; Blundell, Grifﬁth, and Van Reenen 1995; Blundell, Grifﬁth, and
Windmeijer 2002; Kortum and Lerner 2000) establish the existence of a knowledge
production function at the micro level relating R&D and patenting activity. At the
national level, Bosch, Lederman, and Maloney (2005) show that patenting increases
with development and that an analogous aggregate global knowledge function exists
(see ﬁgure 2.6).10

The Nature of Innovation in Developing Countries                                                                                       25
         Finally, an extensive literature documents a robust impact of R&D on productivity
     per se. Many micro studies using the Crépon–Duguet–Mairesse (CDM) model
     (Crépon, Duguet, and Mairesse 1998) (see box 3.1 in the next chapter) have docu-
     mented a positive correlation between product innovation (driven partly by R&D) and
     productivity. (See Hall 2011 and Mohnen and Hall 2013 for a survey of a large sample
     of studies in the OECD.) A robust relationship with TFP also emerges in the literature.
     For example, Hall, Mairesse, and Mohnen (2010) ﬁnd that the returns to R&D are posi-
     tive across OECD countries, and higher than for capital investments. Though these
     studies generally do not cover developing countries, estimates using the ES data show
     that the average ﬁrm-level return to R&D, while varying across countries, is generally
     positive, regardless of income level. Furthermore, meta-analysis of agricultural R&D
     investment studies from a sample covering all regions of the world suggests consis-
     tently high rates of return to R&D (Alston et al. 2000).

         Both the aggregate data from UNESCO and the ﬁrm-level data from the ES show that
     investment in R&D, as a share of GDP or per worker, increases sharply with development
     (ﬁgure 2.7). Moreover, this pattern holds regardless of the type of innovation novelty
     pursued—imitation or radical innovation (ﬁgure 2.8)—consistent with the “two faces of
     R&D spending” described by Cohen and Levinthal (1990). As with the patterns of patent-
     ing activity presented earlier (see ﬁgure 2.5), the ES data suggest that a large part of the
     increase with development is due to increased intensity in the ﬁrms that undertake it
     (ﬁgure 2.9, blue line). Roughly 10 percent of ﬁrms do any R&D up to the income level of
     Israel (incidence, red line). The ES data suggest that across countries and sectors these
     ﬁrms tend to be larger and to participate in international markets, in high-tech manufac-
     turing, or in knowledge-intensive services sectors. The shallow bowl in incidence, again, is
     largely driven by a suspiciously high incidence in, for instance, Bangladesh, India, Kenya,
     and Uganda. However, the intensity of R&D in these countries is very low. The rise
     in national R&D intensity across ﬁgure 2.9 is largely driven by an increase in spending
     among ﬁrms doing R&D, which shows effectively a quintupling across the income span.

         In sum, data on R&D capture important dimensions of the process of innovation
     because R&D drives both imitation and invention. R&D is conducted by few ﬁrms in
     developing countries, and the rise in R&D intensity over the development process is
     largely driven by increased spending by these ﬁrms. However, were we able to combine
     the ES and OECD data as we could with patents, we might expect the incidence to rise
     as well, matching the pattern of patenting.

         Critically, the ES data show that a much larger share of ﬁrms report that they
     innovate than report formal R&D.11 Fewer than half of sampled ﬁrms (in most coun-
     tries less than 30 percent) that introduce a product or a process innovation do any
     formal R&D, which indicates that other innovation inputs are at play. Again, this
     suggests that developing country policy must look beyond R&D in seeking to pro-
     mote innovation.

Technology Licensing
Licensing is another important input into innovation activities, although to date the
returns to such investments have not been estimated. ES data suggest that, even among
relatively advanced countries like the Czech Republic, Israel, and Turkey, only 20 percent
of ﬁrms engage in licensing (ﬁgure 2.10). Note, however, that licensing captures only the
small segment of technological adoption from abroad where royalties are paid for the use
of intellectual property. This share increases with development; hence, licensing appears
complementary to the home country production of intellectual property (patenting).

Purchases of Equipment and Training
The purchase of equipment is one important form of absorbing (embedded knowl-
edge) and thereby generating productivity catch-up or “off-the-frontier” innovation.
For example, more than 75 percent of Turkish ﬁrms indicate that the purchase of
machinery and equipment is their main mechanism for knowledge acquisition, as
opposed to other possible sources of knowledge (World Bank 2005). The ES also col-
lects data on other types of investment in knowledge accumulation activities for Africa
and South Asia. For most countries, the purchase of equipment is reported to be the
main other source of knowledge acquisition, with an average incidence of 45 percent of
ﬁrms for Asia and 29 percent for Africa. Expenditures on equipment, and less so expen-
ditures on training, broadly track expenditures on R&D, and the resources per worker
spent on equipment broadly rise with income, proxied by the distance of the ﬁrms’

     tivity in the same sector for the whole sample) (ﬁgure 2.11).

     Management Quality
     The ﬁnal category in ﬁgure 2.1 is investment in organizational/managerial capital.
     Bloom et al. (2014) argue that differing management practices contribute roughly
     25 percent of the observed differences in productivity between countries and between
     ﬁrms in the United States. Though the next chapters will take up this subject in
     greater detail, here we present some stylized facts put forward in recent work by
     Bloom and Van Reenen (2007, 2010) and Bloom et al. (2016) quantifying manage-
     ment practices across the world.

        The new availability of data has raised the proﬁle of this issue in the economics
     profession, although the National Innovation System literature has long argued that
     managerial and organization competencies are critical inputs for innovation. For
     example, one reason why ﬁrms don’t do more R&D or licensing may be that they lack
     managers with the ability to identify high-return potential projects, engage in the
     long-term planning required for their gestation, and then recruit, train, and moti-
     vate the talent to implement them. However, what is clear from ﬁgure 2.12 is that
     the quality of managerial practices is much higher in advanced countries than in
     developing countries.

The Nature of Innovation in Developing Countries                                                                                                          31
     Some Stylized Facts
     In sum, several additional stylized facts emerge from the analysis in relation to innova-
     tion inputs:

        ■   As with innovation outputs, the intensity in the accumulation of innovation
            inputs rises with level of development.
        ■   A large fraction of the ﬁrms reporting that they undertake product or process
            innovation do not undertake formal innovation, such as R&D or licensing. This
            suggests that policy needs to look beyond these commonly measured inputs
            when thinking about the determinants of innovation.
        ■   All inputs examined—R&D, licensing, purchase of equipment, and training or
            management quality—increase with level of development, reﬂecting both an
            increased number of ﬁrms undertaking innovation and, more important, the
            intensity of innovation within those ﬁrms.


     Concluding Remarks
     The literature is clear that innovation, thought of as both the transfer of existing
     technologies and products and the invention of new ones, is fundamental for growth
     and economic development. This chapter has employed new sources of data to gener-
     ate stylized facts about the nature of innovation investments undertaken across the
     development process. Three points merit highlighting in addition to the patterns
     discussed above.
         First, across the income spectrum and in all sectors, ﬁrms report innovating.
     However, that innovation often consists of marginal improvements in process or prod-
     ucts, rather than signiﬁcant technology adoption or new product imitation and very
     infrequently involves frontier research. It is clear, therefore, that the policy model
     appropriate for developing countries will differ from that of advanced countries. This
     topic will be taken up in Part II of the report.
        Second, investments in innovation-related inputs increase together with income
     per capita. This is suggestive of a high degree of complementarity among these
     “factors of production:” If a ﬁrm (country) is going to invest more in innovation,
     they are likely to need to invest in machines, trained people, and new organizational
     techniques as well. The implications of this basic insight for how we approach inno-
     vation policy and benchmark innovation performance insight are discussed in
     chapter 3 and are far reaching.

        Third, that these investments rise together with development, and the fact that in
     developing countries only a small fraction of ﬁrms undertake signiﬁcant investments
     in serious product or process upgrading, technology licensing, managerial practices,
     or R&D, may seem somehow reasonable, but upon reﬂection, it is not obviously so.

The coexistence of the extraordinarily low levels of innovation related investment in
poor countries with the dramatically high returns thought to accompany technological
adoption and Schumpeterian catch-up, particularly far from the frontier, poses a true
“innovation paradox.” The dimensions of this paradox and how the patterns of com-
plementarity documented here may contribute to our understanding of it are explored
in the next chapter.

     Annex 2A The World Bank Enterprise Survey Innovation Data
     This is the most comprehensive set of cross-country surveys on innovation informa-
     tion carried out to date. The survey implemented during the period 2013–15 used a
     stratiﬁed sampling strategy, where ﬁrms are stratiﬁed by industry, size, and location.
     Firm size levels are 5–19 (small), 20–99 (medium), and 100+ employees (large). Because
     in most economies most ﬁrms are small and medium sized, the ES oversamples large
     ﬁrms. One advantage of the survey is that it collects substantial balance sheet and other
     information regarding the investment climate, which enables analysts to link innova-
     tion efforts to ﬁrm performance. The standard ES questionnaire includes a large array
     of issues: ﬁrm characteristics, access to ﬁnance, annual sales, costs of inputs/labor,
     workforce composition, and other business climate and performance measures. The
     mode of data collection is face-to-face interviews.

         The data are collected in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the core enterprise survey
     questionnaire is implemented. Then, in the second stage, the innovation questionnaire
     is implemented in a large sample of ﬁrms surveyed by the core questionnaire. In some
     regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa and Europe and Central Asia, both
     surveys are implemented sequentially in the same interview. In other regions, such as
     Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the innovation survey is implemented a few weeks
     after. In addition, the managerial quality module of the innovation questionnaire is
     implemented only in a subsample of ﬁrms, mainly medium and large ﬁrms, which
     reduces the sample considerably. In total, the original pooled sample with innovation
     questions is about 34,000 ﬁrms, but the sample of ﬁrms that answered the manage-
     ment module is reduced to about 10,000 observations. The countries with the largest
     representation in the sample are India (25 percent) and Egypt (11 percent). Whereas
     in the original sample most ﬁrms are concentrated in the manufacturing sector
     (50 percent) and wholesale and retail (29 percent), the management practices module
     concentrates mainly in manufacturing (86 percent). In addition, the size composition
     changes by construction because only medium (60 percent) and large (37 percent)
     ﬁrms were interviewed.

        The innovation survey differentiates between two types of technological
     innovation outcomes, product and process, and two nontechnological innovations,
     marketing and organization. However, there is signiﬁcant confusion in the identiﬁ-
     cation of the different types of innovation outcomes by ﬁrms in the survey. For
     example, new marketing processes such as discounts, new packaging, or new client
     segments are sometimes misconstrued as process or product innovations. The fact
     that interviewees provide a recorded description of the product and process innova-
     tions enables us to verify the identiﬁed innovations, and reclassify wrongly attrib-
     uted cases to their respective category or invalidate cases that do not constitute an
     innovation at all (see Cirera 2017 for a description of the methodology). Overall, the
     cleaning exercise results in a decrease in both product and process innovation rates


34                                                                         The Innovation Paradox
due to cases of incorrect classiﬁcations of innovation or misclassiﬁcations of mar-
keting as product or process innovations. Figures 2A.1 and 2A.2 show before and
after cleaning unweighted means by country. The reduction in innovation rates due
to cleaning is signiﬁcantly large in the Africa region and Eastern Europe, and espe-
cially for product innovation. This suggests that using raw data from innova-
tion outcomes could lead to biased interpretations, given their subjective nature
and the lack of clarity in the deﬁnition of the different types of innovation. In order
to mitigate some of this bias, in what follows we use the cleaned data on
innovation outcomes.

    Regarding management practices, we construct a measure of management qual-
ity as similar as possible to Bloom and Van Reenen (2007). In the management
chapter of the innovation module, respondents of medium and large ﬁrms (more
than 50 workers) describe management behavior covering four major themes:
(1) operations, (2) monitoring, (3) targets, and (4) incentives. The operations man-
agement section focuses on the degree to which a ﬁrm acts upon encountering
problems in the production process. The monitoring section focuses on the tracking
of production performance indicators. The targets section covers the time horizon
of production targets, and the incentives section deals with whether managers are
offered performance incentives. Because the scaling of each question may vary, we
convert the scores from each practice to z-scores by normalizing to mean zero and

     Annex 2B Improving Innovation Measurement in Developing Countries
     As box 2.2 discusses, there are signiﬁcant problems in the measurement of innovation
     outputs. These result in a likely overestimation of innovation incidence, especially for
     measures of product or process innovation, and in difﬁculties when conducting
     benchmarking across countries.

     ES versus UNESCO Data

     Clear evidence of the problems with benchmarking and comparing different datasets is
     illustrated in ﬁgure 2B.1. The ﬁgure shows how the ES tends to ﬁnd higher innovation
     rates than UNESCO data for the same country.

     The Problem with Subjective Measurement

     Subjective data have strong limitations as measures of actual outcomes. In an inﬂuen-
     tial study, Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001) show the likely bias when analyzing sub-
     jective data given their likely correlation with context variables. The possible sources of
     bias when using subjective data are numerous, such as those that derive from cognitive
     problems, as shown in Bertrand and Mullainathan (2001). A large amount of experi-
     mental evidence shows that certain characteristics of the survey, such as how the ques-
     tions are structured in the survey, the ordering and the wording used, the format of the
     interview, or the quality of the translation, all signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the outcome of

survey responses. For example, whether the question is formulated in a positive way or
in a negative way is more likely to translate into a positive or a negative answer. In addi-
tion, Schwarz (1999) describes how closed versus open response formats or the rating
scale can also bias the response obtained.
    The sources of bias identiﬁed in the literature on subjective measurement are par-
ticularly relevant for innovation surveys, given the subjective nature of many of the
questions used in innovation surveys. For example, the Oslo Manual (OECD 2005)
deﬁnes product innovation “as the introduction of new or signiﬁcantly improved
product (goods and/or services).” However, “signiﬁcantly improved” is a relative and
subjective term that may be understood differently by different people.
    The use of standard survey instruments in most innovation surveys in OECD
countries has mitigated the impact of cognitive issues, like ordering or wording,
on the quality of the data collected. However, methodological issues related to the
respondent’s understanding of innovation or to the type of survey instrument used
have yet to be solved. The correlation between innovation and core economic indica-
tors for EU countries, for instance, has pointed out the existence of the “Norwegian
puzzle,” which shows relatively lower innovation rates for Norwegian ﬁrms than
would be expected when comparing the Norwegian economy to that of other coun-
tries. The results of an experiment conducted by Statistics Norway suggest that this
is partially explained by the survey instrument used. The experiment shows that
innovation rates are signiﬁcantly different when captured by a stand-alone innova-
tion survey versus a combined R&D and innovation survey (Wilhelmsen 2014).
Similarly, an experiment conducted in the Flanders region of Belgium shows that
innovation rates are considerably and systematically higher when measured with a
short questionnaire than when using a long questionnaire (Hoskens 2015). Although
it is not clear which survey instrument is more accurate in measuring innovation
rates, this difference shows that survey methodology can greatly impact innovation
measurement.
    Context, cultural differences, and social desirability are likely to affect how
respondents understand and respond to innovation questions. Respondents are
likely to have different views on what is considered innovation, depending on the
context in which they live and operate. Whereas in the United States ﬁrms consider
innovation as something new and unique, in Europe ﬁrms are more likely to include
improvement as elements of innovation (Galindo-Rueda and Van Cruysen 2016).
Furthermore, self-reported innovation may be biased by social desirability that, in
turn, might have a differential effect on respondents from different cultural back-
grounds (Johnson and Van de Vijver 2003). Because innovation is commonly associ-
ated with increased productivity and growth, it may be perceived as a desirable
outcome. Therefore, respondents to innovation surveys may be inclined to over-
report innovations in the absence of follow-up questions to ascertain the accuracy of
the answer.

     Is the U-shaped Relationship between Innovation and per Capita Income an
     Artifact of Such Measurement Issues?

     Figure 2B.2 replots the ES-reported share of ﬁrms focusing on innovations that are new
     to the ﬁrm or the local market only as imitation (green line). Then it also plots the aver-
     age labor productivity differential—for each country between ﬁrms that report inno-
     vating and those that do not (blue line). This differential diminishes with distance from
     the frontier. Although we cannot be certain of the direction of causality, this is consis-
     tent with the poorer countries having different subjective ideas of what deﬁnes an
     innovation: a lower quality of “innovation” implies less productivity impact in the ﬁrm.
     Alternatively, it is consistent with lower-productivity ﬁrms being less able to distin-
     guish incidental from impactful innovation when surveyed.

     Results from an Experiment

     Cirera and Muzi (2016) show the results of an experiment conducted by the Enterprise
     Analysis Unit of the World Bank Group in 15 countries to test two different approaches
     to measuring innovation in developing countries. The ﬁrst, more economical, approach
     uses a short questionnaire embedded in a general ﬁrm-level survey, namely the ES.
     The second, much more expensive, approach uses a stand-alone, longer questionnaire
     and provides more information. The same question about innovation is asked twice

     Note: The productivity differential is calculated as the coefﬁcient associated to the estimation of Cobb–Douglas productivity function
     augmented to include innovation as a knowledge input. The coefﬁcient on the innovation dummy is then transformed to a percentage
     change. The x axis measures the logarithm of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

(often to the same person), once without many other questions on innovation and
again after some weeks with an entire set of questions on innovation.

    The results of the experiment show large variation in responses within the same ﬁrm,
in some countries averaging more than 30 percent. As ﬁgure 2B.3 shows, differences in
reported innovation are sizable across types of innovations and countries. However, the
magnitude and direction of these differences vary widely, and no country shows consis-
tently lower or higher differences across types of innovation. This is indicative of signiﬁ-
cant problems with subjectivity and survey design.

    Cirera and Muzi (2016) ﬁnd that cognitive issues do not seem to play a key role in
explaining inaccuracies because neither the use of explanatory cards nor the experience
of the respondent seems to matter. Also, a lower-quality interview is more likely to
produce inaccurate responses, whereas whether the ﬁrm reports making informal pay-
ments and the size of the ﬁrm are likely to reduce inaccuracies. The time elapsed
between interviews is a strong predictor of differences in reported innovation between
surveys, likely the result of the recall effect. The results point toward issues of subjectiv-
ity, incentives, and framing as sources of bias.

     Some Key Elements to Improve Innovation Measurement

     Cirera, López-Bassols, and Muzi (2017) provide an analysis of different innovation
     measurement frameworks and suggest some key elements to better measure innova-
     tion outcomes. These are summarized here:

        ■   Describing the innovation introduced. The experience of the World Bank innova-
            tion surveys suggests that a key variable to deﬁne innovation is the description of the
            innovation introduced and how this differs from existing products or process. This
            is instrumental to be able to determine the accuracy of the report of an innovation.
        ■   Avoiding framing the responses. To avoid framing, some surveys in countries
            such as Canada and Australia do not use the term “innovation” throughout the
            survey. These questionnaires are labeled as business strategies or business pro-
            cesses questionnaires. Questions can be made about changes and about improve-
            ments that do not require a positive association with innovation.
        ■   Degree of novelty. The notion of “new or signiﬁcantly improved” is difﬁcult to
            operationalize because it is attempting to assess changes to some characteristics
            (of a product or process) that should somehow be measurable, but are usually
            lacking a reference point (Smith 2005). Distinctions made between innovations
            that are new only to the ﬁrm (imitation or adoption) and those that are new to
            the local, national, or international market are not very informative regarding
            the degree of novelty of innovations. In many cases, ﬁrms are not aware of or do
            not have full information to assess whether such innovations are truly new to the
            local or national market. This is even more important in the case of process
            innovation, where there may be little information available about other ﬁrms’
            production processes.
         This means that when possible one should ask about speciﬁc changes and provide
     some metric of novelty. A more relevant distinction should be made at two levels. First,
     at the level of the ﬁrm it is important to differentiate between a completely new product
     (diversiﬁcation) from a simple product upgrade. Second, it is important to identify
     whether the new product or process embodies a new technological attribute or type of
     product that has not been in the market versus whether it is mainly imitation or tech-
     nology adoption. More clarity in these deﬁnitions of novelty is of critical importance
     in comparing countries and reconciling these surveys with economic theories of diffu-
     sion and technology adoption. Surveys could thus consider testing alternative formula-
     tions that make a clearer distinction between invention and imitation/adoption (see also
     Nieminen and Lehtoranta 2015).
        ■   Intention and impacts. Another problem related to the previous one concerns
            the intention of the changes introduced and to what extent they had a mea-
            surable impact on the ﬁrm’s activities. For example, in difﬁcult business
            environments—characterized by lack of reliable inputs, electricity shortages,
            customs delays, and so on—ﬁrms may have to constantly change some of their

        production processes to adapt and survive with little efﬁciency or improvement
        effects. Intention of improvement is therefore important to deﬁne innovation.
    ■   Implementation. A further challenge for measurement is the requirement that
        an innovation needs to be implemented (that is, introduced to the market or
        within the ﬁrm), which is key to distinguishing innovation from other related
        activities such as invention. However, in some cases it may be difﬁcult to identify
        when this happens because the innovation process often includes small incre-
        mental steps that are not in themselves innovative. In any case the survey needs
        to ask whether the innovation is implemented.

Increasing the Scope for Measuring Innovation Inputs

As has been shown in chapter 2, most innovation occurs without formal R&D activities.
Chapter 4 describes some of these inputs in more detail. Below we suggest some of the
key capabilities for innovation that need to be measured in surveys.

Technological Capabilities
The ﬁrst category includes several knowledge-based activities and assets that ﬁrms
develop or purchase to strengthen their technological potential. The two main sugges-
tions for innovation surveys are to

    1. Expand the list of innovation inputs currently included in the Oslo framework
       by identifying more precisely certain types of tangible and intangible assets that
       can be acquired or sourced externally (for example consultancy services and
       technology gained through ﬁrm acquisition); and
    2. Consider key activities that may be related to R&D but are supporting the
       creation of new knowledge (for example, design and engineering).

   Some of these activities are more prevalent in technologically mature economies
and ﬁrms closer to the technological frontier that have the capability to create more
radical innovations. However, ﬁrms in less developed countries can start accumulating
some of these capabilities in line with the process of increasing the accumulation of
R&D as they converge to the technological frontier. Moreover, design and engineering
are critical capabilities in sectors such as knowledge-intensive business services (Pina
and Tether 2016).


Production Capabilities
The second category involves a broad set of capabilities needed to improve production
processes, through both internal factors and relations with external agents. Two key
areas proposed for this category are

    1. Collecting additional information regarding the ﬁrm’s involvement and
       position within value chains (local or global); and


The Nature of Innovation in Developing Countries                                              43
        2. Considering the use of modern production techniques such as lean
           manufacturing methods.

         These activities are important complementary capabilities for innovation and can
     vary considerably in terms of their sophistication as ﬁrms get closer to the technologi-
     cal frontier.

     Organizational/Managerial Capabilities
     The third category includes capabilities related to the effective deployment and use
     of internal resources, in particular the ﬁrm’s human and organizational capital. As
     chapter 4 shows, managerial practices are part of core competences and critical inputs
     for innovation because they determine the way in which knowledge is accumulated and
     used, particularly for ﬁrms farther away from the technological frontier. This involves
     documenting how the ﬁrm is organized as well as the use of various processes and
     practices aimed at collecting and using strategic information and knowledge more efﬁ-
     ciently, both internally and externally. Future surveys need to further develop several
     questions on the role of structured management practices and management quality
     (see, for example, Bloom and Van Reenen 2007, 2010) using data from the World
     Management Survey), including on

        ■   The use of structured management and modern production techniques;
        ■   Performance monitoring and target setting; and
        ■   Talent management and incentives.

     Notes
     1. Sutton (2001) for example, treats the role of R&D broadly construed as “increasing the consum-
        ers’ willingness-to pay” for a ﬁrm’s product, complementary to its role in decreasing the cost of
        production. See also Hallak and Schott (2011) and Khandelwal (2010).

     5. UNESCO data summarize data on innovation incidence on the basis of national surveys of
        selected middle- and high-income countries.
      6. The World Bank Enterprise Survey and its linked innovation modules were implemented during the
         period 2013–2015 in 53 countries over four regions—Europe and Central Asia (ECA), the Middle
         East and North Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. This is the most comprehensive set of
         cross-country surveys on innovation information carried out to date with the same questionnaire.
         Most ﬁrms in the sample are concentrated in the manufacturing sector (49 percent) and wholesale and
         retail (29 percent), although the sector composition varies by country. The countries with the largest
         representation in the sample are Russia (12 percent) and India (10 percent), and some countries in
         ECA have fewer than 250 ﬁrms in the innovation modules. The core innovation questionnaire is based
         on Oslo Manual guidelines, and the questions are similar to Community Innovation Survey (CIS)
         questionnaires. The mode of data collection in both surveys is face-to-face interviews.

 7. Whereas the Enterprise Survey uses a comparable questionnaire for all countries, UNESCO
    collects information from national statistics ofﬁces. In some cases (for example, Azerbaijan or
    Kenya) both incidence rates are similar; in other cases (for example, India) there are signiﬁcant
    differences across sources. Including one or the other data source does not change the main ﬁtted
    line in ﬁgure 2.2.
 8. For these reasons, we follow Jaffe and Trajtenberg (2002); Branstetter (2001); Furman, Porter, and
    Stern (2002); Furman and Hayes (2004) and Ulku (2007), among others, and use the number of
    utility patents granted by the USPTO. The USPTO demands that the invention be “novel and
    nontrivial, and has to have commercial application” (Jaffe and Trajtenberg 2002, 3–4). In the
    absence of a global patenting agency, the United States remains the principal locus of patenting
    activity, and the USPTO offers reliable panel data for the period 1963 to 2000 for a large number
    of countries. Granted patents are assigned by country of origin on the basis of the country of
    residence of the ﬁrst inventor.
 9. See Branstetter, Guangwei, and Veloso (2015) for a discussion of why this number is exaggerated.
    The bulk of patents are ﬁled by multinationals from the United States or Taiwan, China, and
    hence we are not measuring the innovative activity of domestic ﬁrms.
10. Although concerns about remaining endogeneity suggest caution in putting too much weight
    on this estimate, it nonetheless contrasts importantly with ﬁrm-level estimates using the same
    techniques, which imply substantially lower elasticities. One interpretation is that the aggregate
    estimations capture spillover effects among ﬁrms and industries, although the lack of compara-
    bility of the aggregate and micro samples leaves this as a conjecture only.
11. By region, in Sub-Saharan Africa only 26 percent of innovators do any R&D, 56 percent
    in South Asia, 28 percent in Europe and Central Asia, and 18 percent in the Middle East and
    North Africa.

3. The Innovation Paradox and the
   National Innovation System


Introduction
The stylized facts presented in the previous chapter pose what we term the innovation
paradox: Given how high the rates of returns to innovation are thought to be and,
further, that they are thought to rise with distance from the technological frontier, why
do poor countries not invest far more than they do? This chapter argues that the key
to the paradox lies in the absence of critical complementary factors, which depresses
the return to innovation and makes low rates of innovation investment rational.
This insight has important implications for how we benchmark innovation perfor-
mance and how we conceive of the National Innovation System (NIS).

The Innovation Paradox
As noted in the introduction, estimates of the returns to research and development
(R&D) are generally extremely high, and the most recent and reliable estimates appear
to conﬁrm this. Bloom, Schankerman, and Van Reenen (2013) and Lucking, Bloom,
and Van Reenen (2017) ﬁnd social returns of 55.0–57.7 percent depending on the
sample period, compared to a private return of 13.6–20.7 percent. Doraszelski and
Jaumandreu (2013) ﬁnd an average private return across sectors of 40 percent for Spain
(1996–2000), roughly double that of, for instance, investments in infrastructure.
As much of the literature argues, the advanced countries should be investing multiples
of the amounts they presently do (Jones and Williams 1998 and Bloom, Schankerman,
and Van Reenen 2013).

    The potential gains from Schumpeterian catch up suggest that the case is even
stronger for developing countries. Grifﬁth, Redding, and Van Reenen (2004) argue
using data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) that returns rise much higher with increased distance from the technological
frontier, reﬂecting the progressively greater gains from knowledge transfer afforded to
follower countries. Simple extrapolations from their estimates suggest that returns
could reach the triple digits, far higher than returns to physical or human capital.
By this logic, innovation should be the central policy focus for growth-minded




                                                                                            49
     countries and investment in innovation a priority. In fact, to reframe Lucas’s (1988)
     famous observation about growth: confronted with the rates of return found in the
     literature, it would be hard for governments to think of anything else.

         Yet, chapter 2 shows that not only do developing countries not make heroic invest-
     ments in innovation but they also invest far less in every type of innovation than rich
     countries do. As an example, ﬁgure 2.7 established that the poor countries invest far less
     as a share of their gross domestic product (GDP) than do rich countries in R&D: the
     Scandinavian countries, Japan, and the United States rank highest in investment, and
     Africa and parts of Asia rank lowest.1 What can explain this seeming irrationality on
     the part of developing country ﬁrms and governments? We will argue below that dis-
     tance from the frontier could indeed increase the gains from Schumpeterian catch-up,
     but the increased scarcity of complementary factors necessary for R&D to have an
     impact prevents these potential returns from being realized.


     Innovation Complementarities
     Adopting a new technology may involve not only R&D to identify and modify the
     technology to the local context but also investment in physical machinery (physical
     capital), very likely, training (human capital) to enable employees to run the machines,
     as well as upgrading management skills to plan and execute longer-term projects.2
     R&D spending will have little impact without well-trained engineers, and any new
     ideas will be useless without able private sector entrepreneurs to take them to market.
     The centrality of these complementarities would seem to be supported by the fact that
     the increased aggregate intensity in innovation effort as countries develop, tracks the
     long-documented increase also in capital intensity, educational attainment, and now
     managerial capability.

         Conceptually, this is an often overlooked but absolutely critical point. Innovation
     is not a free-ﬂoating activity but can be considered the accumulation of “knowledge
     capital” that enters a ﬁrm or national production function along with physical and
     human capital (see Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare 2005 and box 3.1). Mainstream
     economic theory highlights how these factors interact with and often enhance each
     other. In the present context, this means we cannot consider innovation activity
     separate from the stock of these other factors of production, which are also scarcer
     in developing countries. In turn, behind the provision of each of these complemen-
     tary factors lies a further set of institutions and markets, ranging from schools to
     ﬁnancial markets to trade agreements, that are also likely to be weaker in developing
     countries.

        This discussion clearly has important implications for how developing countries
     should benchmark their innovation performance and how they conceptualize their
     National Innovation Systems. The next two sections focus on these topics.



50                                                                         The Innovation Paradox
     BOX 3.1
   Complementarities: A Basic Neoclassical Intuition
   Drawing on Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare (2005), we begin simply assuming that ﬁrms produce
   goods combining labor L, physical capital K, human capital h, and technological progress or knowl-
   edge capital A. Adopting a standard mathematical simpliﬁcation, ﬁrm i ’s production function is
   given by

                                               Yi = k iα (Ai hi Li )1-α                          (B3.2.1)

   The terms a and (1-a) capture output elasticities of capital and labor, respectively, and dictate
   constant returns to scale.
        Beginning with such a standard formulation highlights several key issues. First, as most of the
   NIS and neoclassical literature agrees, the central actor in innovation policy must be the generator
   of wealth, the ﬁrm, that appears on the right-hand side of ﬁgure 3.4. Second, it critically argues
   that, technological progress augments both capital K and labor L and allows us to produce more
   output for each. Third, in the same way that we think about K and h as accumulating physical or
   human capital, innovation can be thought of as accumulating knowledge capital A that includes all
   the learning and ﬁrm capabilities stressed by the NIS literature. Fourth, our production function
   also implies that production decisions are made jointly—that is, a decision to “innovate” is also
   likely to imply investments in machinery K and training h. Hence, innovation is not a free-ﬂoating
   factor outside of the production process but needs to be thought of it as part of it.
        How is knowledge A accumulated? There is general agreement that, whereas rich countries
   need to invent new knowledge, ﬁrms in developing countries can beneﬁt from accessing the exist-
   ing stock of knowledge in the world A* and applying it to the home stock of knowledge, A (that is,
   Schumpeterian catch-up). The degree of technological lag can be expressed as A/A*, where 1
   implies the country is at the frontier and less than 1 implies room for catch-up. The potential for
   knowledge accumulation through transfer is (1-A/A*).
        However, as the NIS literature has stressed, this transfer does not occur automatically: the
   ﬁrm needs to identify and adapt this technology to its particular context. To formalize this intuition,
   the change (accumulation) of knowledge, A    , is given by
                                                ı


                                           = λR (1- A / A* )
                                          A                                                      (B3.2.2)

   where, Ri (R&D broadly considered) is the investment in knowledge capital made by the ﬁrm and
   the efﬁciency of that effort is denoted by l, which we assume is the same for all ﬁrms. Therefore,
   lR term captures the productivity of ﬁrms in the country in producing innovation from innovation-
   related expenditures. We could think of both terms as partly reﬂecting the capabilities of ﬁrms
   listed as the second group of factors under “the ﬁrm” in ﬁgure 3.4. The ﬁrm’s demand to accumu-
   late any factor (in this case R) will depend on its capabilities ranging from its core competencies
   to its particular capability to identify and absorb new technologies. But then weak management or
   a lack of technological familiarity (a low l ) can result in misspent innovative effort.

     Benchmarking Innovation Performance: How Do We Know Whether a
     Society Is Investing Enough in Innovation?
     Ideally, societies should invest in innovation up to the point where marginal social
     returns are equated to the cost of borrowing. Jones and Williams (1998), for example,
     estimate a rate of return to R&D for the United States of 28 percent, which they argue
     implies that a quadrupling of investment was in order. Bloom, Schankerman, and Van
     Reenen’s (2013) estimates dictate a doubling of R&D spending. Their estimates are
     broadly consistent with the OECD literature (for a review, see Hall, Mairesse, and
     Mohnen 2010), which suggests that these ﬁndings may be generalizable for the advanced
     countries.3
        As discussed above, we would expect the returns to R&D to be much higher for devel-
     oping countries. The imitation face of R&D facilitates the adoption of new technologies,
     and, as Schumpeter argues, countries further from the frontier have greater potential
     gains from catch-up and hence should have higher rates of return. Indeed, as noted in
     chapter 1, Grifﬁth, Redding, and Van Reenen (2004) ﬁnd that the return to R&D in the
     OECD increases as we move from frontier countries to those farther from the frontier.4
     Extrapolating their results to poor countries suggests the return to R&D could easily be
     200 to 300 percent. This logic gives legitimacy to simple benchmarking techniques that
     assume that more is better: given Kenya’s low gross domestic expenditure on R&D
     (GERD) compared with that of, for instance, the Republic of Korea, Kenya should invest
     more. This argument is often implicitly made in policy circles. For instance, the Lisbon
     declaration in Europe set a goal of raising the target for R&D expenditures from 1.9 to
     3 percent of GDP by 2010 to close the gap with the United States (2.7 percent) and Japan
     (3.0 percent). Given Chile’s comparatively low investment rate, former President Lagos
     proposed a goal of 1.5 percent by the same date for Chile.
         But above we document that developing countries invest far less than rich countries
     in all types of innovation despite the expected high returns. This is precisely the inno-
     vation paradox. Should we not expect governments to divert a very large share of their
     resources toward supporting R&D?
        The answer is probably no. Figure 3.1 presents estimates of the rate of return to
     innovation activities and to R&D intensity at the country level, using the enterprise
     surveys, for those countries for which the returns were statistically signiﬁcant. What is
     clear is that when signiﬁcant, the returns are positive and often very high for those few
     ﬁrms that perform R&D. However, they are not obviously higher than those reported
     for the advanced countries. In fact, for several countries, they are substantially lower.
     How do we square this with the Grifﬁth, Redding, and Van Reenen (2004) ﬁndings of
     increased returns with distance from the frontier?

        Using panel country-level data, Goñi and Maloney (2017) estimate the relationship
     between returns to R&D and country income. Consistent with Grifﬁth, Redding, and

Note: Panel a shows the percentage share in labor productivity associated with the introduction of product or process innovation.
This is calculated using the coefﬁcient on the innovation dummy that enters an augmented production function with capital and labor
scaled by labor. The coefﬁcient is estimated by ordinary least squares. In the absence of a convincing instrument, or even a panel
dimension, these estimates are simple ordinary least squares, which may suggest that they are, further, biased upward. Further, the
ﬁgure does not include country estimates that are not statistically different from zero. Panel b shows the returns to R&D estimates
using a similar approach but using R&D expenditure intensity as knowledge input. GDP = gross domestic product; R&D = research and
development.

     Van Reenen (2004), they ﬁnd that the rate of return to R&D increases with distance
     from the frontier up to the income level of modern Argentina or Chile. However, mov-
     ing still farther from the frontier, the rate of return begins to fall and may even be nega-
     tive for quite poor countries (ﬁgure 3.2). This is consistent with ﬁgure 3.1, as well as the
     Bosch, Lederman, and Maloney (2005) estimates of the knowledge-generation func-
     tion of patenting from R&D, which show that developing countries produce less addi-
     tional knowledge per R&D expenditure than advanced countries, yielding implicit
     rates of return to R&D that are perhaps 50 percent (or less) of those found in the
     advanced countries.

         A likely explanation is that, as countries are farther from the technological frontier,
     the potential gains from Schumpeterian catch-up in fact increase but the stock of the
     complementarity factors discussed above decreases. Below a certain level of develop-
     ment, the second effect begins to outweigh the ﬁrst. That is, governments could try to
     invest directly in R&D; but if they lack the necessary complementary factors—a capital
     market that would enable ﬁrms to buy the necessary accompanying machinery, manag-
     ers who know how to take new ideas to market, higher-order human capital necessary
     to translate greater spending into good quality innovation, and capacity to ensure the
     investments are allocated well—the returns will be low. Moreover, to the degree that

such spending crowds out investments in human capital or infrastructure, the returns
could potentially be negative.

   The discussion highlights how comparing raw innovation measures, such as GERD,
across countries can be very misleading. The assumption that returns in poor countries
would be at least as high as in the rich countries, so that low levels of R&D signal sub-
stantial underinvestment, is probably invalid. For Nepal to target Korea’s level of R&D/
GDP would almost certainly involve a vast waste of resources.5 Given Nepal’s lower level
of physical and human capital, we would not expect Nepalese ﬁrms to be able to use the
same amount of newly produced or adopted knowledge. Hence, ﬁnding that developing
countries invest less in R&D than frontier countries does not necessarily imply that they
should do more relative to their investments in other complementary factors.

Innovation Benchmarking in the Presence of Complementarities:
Simulating Innovation Shortfalls
Some idea of the importance of this last point can be gleaned by calibrating the simple
neoclassical model of innovation and growth developed by Klenow and Rodriguez-Clare
(2005) (see box 3.2) with the stock of existing human and physical capital, and then
asking whether the observed innovation (knowledge capital) is high or low given the
existing levels of these types of capital. If lower than expected, we can think of there
being innovation-related barriers, disincentives, or other failures that keep countries
from reaching the optimal level of investment. As is clear from ﬁgure 3.3, there is essen-
tially no relationship between the magnitude of this deviation from optimal and observed
GERD.6 Korea’s high R&D appears, in fact, low relative to its human and physical capital,

     suggesting a “tax,” whereas Colombia, Senegal, and Tunisia have higher investment than
     might be expected (or efﬁcient) given their other factors of production.

        Though the methodology necessarily makes some heroic assumptions, it makes the
     same fundamental point as made above with regard to the rates of return. Low R&D/
     GDP levels in Colombia, Senegal, and Tunisia are not necessarily due to problems
     particular to innovation, or even less to weak science, technology, and innovation
     institutions. The reason could lie, for instance, in a lack of complementary factors—
     such as bad schools limiting human capital accumulation or weak ﬁnancial markets
     impeding physical capital accumulation.

     Complementarities and the NIS

     on promoting R&D or to relegate innovation policy solely to a science and technology
     ministry. A much broader view of the overall accumulation problem of the country and
     the constellation of markets, institutions, and individuals and the links among them that
     are often grouped under the term National Innovation System (NIS) is needed.7

         There are many deﬁnitions of the NIS, and views differ on which policies and insti-
     tutions should be included (see Freeman 1987; Lundvall 1992, 1997; Nelson 1993; and
     Soete, Verspagen, and Ter Weel 2010).8 Figure 3.4 supports a broader interpretation
     than is often used, to take into account the complementarities discussed above. It also
     seeks to bring together many of the concerns of both the NIS and the neoclassical eco-
     nomics literature (see Maloney 2017). Broadly speaking, the left panel and lower cen-
     tral and right panels (blue triangles) depict elements that have priority in the NIS
     literature, including human capital, ﬁrm support mechanisms and STI institutions,
     innovation-speciﬁc credit and subsidy policies, and the capabilities of the entrepre-
     neurs. The rest of the diagram attempts to capture some of the concerns raised by our
     focus on missing complementary factors. In particular, it highlights that ﬁrms make
     accumulation decisions of knowledge capital (innovation), human capital, and physi-
     cal capital together (see box 3.2 for a formal exposition). Clearly, the division between
     the two sets of variables is not so sharp, but nevertheless the ﬁgure is useful in provid-
     ing an integrated view.

         We break ﬁgure 3.4 into demand and supply for knowledge capital (innovation
     broadly construed). The bidirectional arrows crudely capture the feedback relationship
     between ﬁrms and knowledge institutions and that much accumulation of knowledge
     in advanced economies occurs in what is called “Pasteur’s quadrant” of the innovation
     space—where basic research and applied technology interact in a mutually reinforcing
     and nonlinear way (Stokes 1997; Edquist, 2004).

        Figure 3.4 highlights two critical facts. First, innovation cannot be supply driven;
     there must be demand from ﬁrms that have the capabilities to innovate and the

         BOX 3.2
        Estimating the Rates of Return to R&D
        One approach to estimating the returns to R&D (see Jones and Williams 1998 and Hall, Mairesse,
        and Mohnen 2010 for a review) begins from a simple production function where Y = Q(A, K, L),
        where output Y is produced as a function of ideas or knowledge capital A and a collection of fac-
        tors, in our case labor L and physical capital K.
             As an approximation, Goñi and Maloney (2017) in ﬁgure 3.2 estimate DlnY = a + bA DlnA +
        bK DlnK + bLDlnL + e, where a captures period ﬁxed effects. They employ the common transfor-
        mation bf DlnF = rF F/Y, where rF is the rate of return on any factor F and F/Y is the share of invest-
        ment F in output. They use this transformation for both physical (Investment/GDP) and knowledge
        capital (R&D/GDP), but leave labor in growth terms.
             An extensive literature struggles with controlling for the potential endogeneity of R&D: it may
        be that R&D drives growth, but it may also be that expectations of future growth drive R&D, for
        example. Lagged values of R&D are often used (Hall and Mairesse 1995; Grifﬁth et al. 2006),
        although this can be questioned because R&D investments tend to be persistent over time.
        Credible external instruments are sometimes available: Bloom et al. (2013) use changes in the
        ﬁrm-speciﬁc tax price of R&D (exploiting changes in federal and state-speciﬁc rules). Crepon–
        Duguet–Mairesse (CDM) models (Crépon, Duguet, and Mairesse 1998) explicitly measure the
        interactions in a structural model including an equation for innovation inputs, outputs, and the
        production function.
             In the absence of good country-level instruments, Goñi and Maloney use lagged values and
        the national intellectual property rights regimes (Ginarte and Park 1997) as instruments—the
        latter, as Rodrik (2001) notes, largely being driven by considerations related to trade agreements
        with the advanced countries. The results are robust to instrumenting. Figure 3.2 is estimated using
        a varying parameter technique developed by Hastie and Tibshirani (1993) and Fan and Zhang
        (1999, 2000) that allows the full parameter vector to vary across the development process and Cai
        et al. (2006) who extend the methodology to accommodate endogeneity in the conditioning set.
        The data are cross-country quinquennial averages.



     incentives to do so, including to accumulate capabilities. Second, as noted above, the
     accumulation decisions of the traditional (capital and labor) and innovation (knowl-
     edge) parts of the economy need to be jointly considered.

         The ﬁrst group of variables on the demand side comprises the overall set of
     incentives to invest and accumulate. This includes the macro context, competitive
     structure, trade regime, and international networks that determine whether ﬁrms seek
     to innovate. The second set of variables captures ﬁrm capabilities discussed in the next
     chapter: the core managerial competencies, production systems, and higher-end capa-
     bilities for technological absorption and innovation that enable a ﬁrm to recognize an
     opportunity and mobilize itself to take advantage of it. Of particular salience is the
     ability to quantify and manage the risk intrinsic to any project. Development is, by
     nature, a process of placing a series of bets on opportunities of uncertain returns, and
     entrepreneurs need to develop the capabilities to quantify and manage the associated

risk (see, for example, Maloney and Zambrano 2016). These capabilities can be seen as
increasingly demanding in sophistication as “innovation” moves from simple improve-
ments to actual long-term R&D.

   There are clear interactions between the two sets of variables. For instance, a larger
international market increases the likely beneﬁts of upgrading and innovating while
better capabilities permit taking advantage of these markets.

   On the supply side are all the sources of knowledge that support ﬁrm demand.
This begins with the basic supply of human capital, from the worker level to the entre-
preneur to engineers and scientists. The second set are institutions that support ﬁrms,
including the kinds of productivity and quality extension services found around the
world, services to disseminate new technologies or best practices, and higher-end
consulting services in specialized topics. These are discussed in depth in chapter 7.
The science and technology system adapts existing knowledge or generates new
knowledge for the use of ﬁrms. Finally, the global innovation system generates most
new knowledge; therefore, being ﬁrmly plugged in along manifold dimensions is key.
Because many of these institutions are nonmarket (government research institutes,
universities, and so on), the question about what mechanisms and incentives link them
to one another is prominent in the NIS literature.

    The center panel makes the point that NIS policy must concern itself with barriers
to all types of accumulation, both because physical capital is a complement and because
the accumulation of knowledge capital is subject to all the same accumulation barriers
as physical capital—capital markets, business climate, or ability to diversify risk—
which we normally abstract from in the advanced country literature because those
markets function reasonably well. Hence, low investment in managerial capabilities or
innovation may be due to a variety of accumulation investment barriers that are com-
monly discussed in the World Bank Doing Business analyses, rather than innovation-
related market or systemic failures.

   Clearly, innovation-speciﬁc issues are still important, and they are captured in the
next group down. For instance, there may be an absence of seed/venture capital that
would enable new innovative start-ups to emerge and existing ﬁrms to place new inno-
vative bets. In addition, there may be speciﬁc restrictions on the workforce restructur-
ing required for the adoption of new technologies. Finally, there are all the standard
information-related market failures discussed above, those related to the appropriation
of knowledge that have given rise to R&D subsidies and tax incentives, and to intellec-
tual property rights systems.

   There is evidence that the latter are important. The analysis of Bosch, Lederman, and
Maloney (2005) suggests that the security of intellectual property rights, the quality of
research institutions, and the degree of collaboration with the private sector plausibly
explain half the difference in the elasticity of knowledge creation between advanced and

     follower countries. Nguyen and Jaramillo (2014) found that lower institutional quality in
     terms of rule of law, regulatory quality, or property and patent right protection lowers the
     return to innovation for a large sample of ﬁrms in developing countries. In Vietnam, the
     concern of many start-ups about having their ideas compromised during the process of
     ﬁling for local patents impeded all subsequent mobilization of ﬁnancing and scaling up.

         But more general accumulation issues impinge as well. Aghion et al. (2012), Bond,
     Harhoff, and Van Reenen (2010), Hall and Lerner (2009), and Mulkay, Hall, and Mairesse
     (2000) stress credit constraints as a reason for underinvestment in innovation and
     Bloom (2007) the depressing impact of uncertainty. Allard, Martinez, and Williams
     (2012) show that political stability plays an important role in the development of the
     NIS, given the need for long-term accumulation of human capital. More generally,
     Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) show how policy uncertainty reduces investment, which
     is likely to have even more effect on innovation projects with long gestations. Other
     studies have documented the role of more democratic regimes (Srholec 2011), corrup-
     tion (DeWaldemar 2012), or efﬁcient institutions (Amendolagine et al. 2013). Various
     works have demonstrated a correlation between exporting ﬁrms and innovation, sug-
     gesting openness is also important (Almeida and Fernandes 2008).

         Overall, the NIS concept provides a framework to understand the environment
     within which ﬁrm innovation occurs. It also highlights how demand for innovation,
     speciﬁcally the ability of the ﬁrm to recognize, articulate, and execute an innovation-
     related project, is at the center of the discussion. This dictates a deeper examination of
     ﬁrm capabilities and a recognition that innovation occurs along a continuum of
     sophistication ranging from basic business practices, to more advanced production
     systems (just-in-time, for example), to technical literacy to manage formal R&D.
     Evolving into more R&D–intensive products also requires a greater set of skills
     and contracting institutions for managing technological complexity (Krishna and
     Levchenko 2013), ﬁnancial literacy and deeper capital markets for managing riskier
     products (Acemoglu and Zilibotti 1997; Krishna, Levchenko, and Maloney 2017),
     greater technological literacy, and high-quality science and technology institutions.

        Overseeing this evolution and the overall functioning of the NIS is the government,
     which is also tasked with the resolution of market and systemic failures and coordina-
     tion among various actors.

     Concluding Remarks
     The innovation “paradox” arises from the coexistence of great potential gains from
     Schumpeterian catch-up in developing countries with low innovation investment by
     ﬁrms, and the surprising lack of effectiveness by governments in increasing these
     investments by several orders of magnitude. Our proposed answer to this paradox
     stresses that innovation demands a broad set of complementarities in terms of physi-
     cal and human capital. These, in turn, depend on all the underlying conditions that


60                                                                           The Innovation Paradox
facilitate the accumulation of any type of capital, as well as those seen as particular to
innovation, such as intellectual property rights, or resolution of market failures.
Advanced countries have many of these worked out: ﬁnancial markets function, busi-
ness climates are friendly, and skilled human capital abounds. A marginal increase in
R&D spending under these conditions may have a high rate of return. However, devel-
oping countries lack many or all of these; hence, the expected rate of return to knowl-
edge capital investment is far below what Schumpeterian models would predict.

    This implies that benchmarking innovation performance must go beyond compar-
ing raw levels of GERD to incorporate the stock of these complementarities—countries
with low levels of physical or human capital probably should not try to accumulate
advanced country levels of knowledge capital. In turn, the conception of the NIS needs
to have a broad scope to reﬂect the fact that innovation policy cannot consist of simply
offsetting innovation-related market failures. It must also ensure that a broader set of
complementary factors, necessary for ﬁrms to receive the potentially high rates of
return from technological adoption, are present.

    The next chapter takes up one complementary input—that related to ﬁrm capabili-
ties and management skills—as a critical missing item on the developing country
innovation agenda.

Notes
 1. Roseboom (2003) argues that underinvestment is the rule in agricultural R&D as well.
 2. Correa, Fernandes, and Uregian (2008) ﬁnd that the technology choices of ﬁrms in Europe and
    Central Asia are related to access to appropriate complementary inputs such as skilled labor,
    managerial capacity, R&D, ﬁnance, and to a lesser extent good infrastructure.
 3. However, these rates of return are substantially below those from other studies using cross-country
    data for the G-7 (Group of Seven countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United
    Kingdom, and the United States) (see, for example, Coe and Helpman 1995; van Pottelsberghe de la
    Potterie and Lichtenberg 2001; and Kao, Chiang, and Chen 1999). Again, returns to R&D have been
    most studied and, although we stress above the need to look beyond R&D, the lessons apply generally.
 4. In their model Grifﬁth, Redding, and Van Reenen (2004) ﬁnd the returns to R&D have a dual
    source—the ﬁrst one related to R&D itself and the second via the effect of R&D into technology
    transfer by allowing countries and ﬁrms to converge to the technological frontier. This model
    could be generalized to other innovation inputs, such as technology licensing, training, purchase
    of equipment, and so on, because they facilitate technology transfer in these countries and ﬁrms
    farther away from the frontier.

 6. This was previously done in more detail for several Latin American countries in Maloney and
    Rodriguez-Clare (2007), but here we seek to make a general point focusing on a global sample of

    including the fundamental problem of exclusively treating total factor productivity (TFP) differ-
    ences as reﬂecting innovation performance as opposed to, for instance, allocation inefﬁciencies.

      8. Nelson (1993) deﬁne the NIS somewhat narrowly as “a set of institutions whose interactions
         determine the innovative performance of national ﬁrms,” especially those supporting R&D
         efforts. Lundvall (1992) suggests a broader view that includes national education systems, labor
         markets, ﬁnancial markets, intellectual property rights, competition in product markets, and
         welfare regimes. Edquist’s (1997) view includes “all important economic social, political orga-
         nizational institutional and other factors that inﬂuence the development, diffusion and use of
         innovations” (Soete, Verspagen, and ter Weel 2010).

4. Managerial Practices as Key Firm
   Capabilities for Innovation


Introduction
In the previous chapter, we described the variety of complementary factors required for
innovation expenditures, narrowly considered, to be effective. This chapter focuses on
a particular set of complementarities—the capabilities ﬁrms develop that enable them
to identify new technological opportunities, develop a plan to exploit them, and then
cultivate the human resources necessary to execute it. Without these complementari-
ties, moving beyond the simplest types of innovation is not feasible. Hence, a central
dynamic of the development process is a progressive increase in sophistication in both
production and technological capabilities, and especially a subset of those—managerial
capabilities—as ﬁrms approach the technological frontier.

   This view differs from the simpliﬁcation typically employed in mainstream
economics that ﬁrms are fully rational, possess full information, and will simply follow
with perfect foresight the path to the technological frontier. In this view, policy should
focus ﬁrst on eliminating the external barriers to ﬁrm growth—for example, distor-
tions in the business climate or ﬁnancial markets. Innovation policy should then
primarily redress the market failures pertaining to innovation in all countries, such as
imperfect appropriability of the rents from ideas.

    By contrast, an ample literature in the National Innovation System tradition has
long argued that ﬁrms need to learn how to approximate the neoclassic ﬁrm by acquir-
ing a range of capabilities without which they cannot manage innovation projects
effectively. Teece and Pisano (1994), and more in the mainstream Sutton (2012), Sutton
and Treﬂer (2016), or Hallak (2006), among others, have also stressed the acquisition
of these capabilities as fundamental to both productivity and quality upgrading. Of
great importance has been the recent introduction of the World Management Survey
(WMS) discussed in chapter 2, which has permitted a quantum leap in the comparative
quantitative analysis of management practices and their implications for productivity
and innovation. In particular, the WMS has documented that developing country ﬁrms
are indeed lagging in a wide range of capabilities that are critical to the Schumpeterian
catch-up process: few managers in developing countries can take a long-term view,
have sophisticated project evaluation skills, or have a human resource policy that would
staff research and development (R&D) projects. Hence, there may be no effective



                                                                                             65
     partner for matching grant schemes, or R&D subsidies and the variety of market
     failures in innovation may be compounded by others that drive weak management.

         Redressing these capability deﬁciencies emerges as a critical element in most
     accounts of the “East Asian miracle,” which stress the increasing capacity of entrepre-
     neurs to engage in a continual process of adaptation and innovation across many
     sectors (see, for example, Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997). Matthews (1996) and
     Cho and Mathews (2000), for example, downplay R&D–focused paradigms and focus
     on how in Asia latecomer ﬁrms acquired capabilities through accelerated organiza-
     tional learning and have proceeded through stages of technological capability
     enhancement.1 In the Republic of Korea, Kim (1997) argues that the accumulation of
     technological capability—ﬁrm learning capacity—was more important than most
     sectoral interventions commonly cited2 (see also Katz 1987; Lall 1987). The acquisi-
     tion of these capabilities, as Hobday (2000) notes, is neither automatic nor painless
     but was in East Asia a difﬁcult process with much trial and error, investments in train-
     ing, and creativity. This economic learning process—acquiring the capacity to absorb,
     adapt, diffuse, disseminate, and improve ideas—is arguably one of the core dynamics
     of the development process, regardless of the underlying production structure of the
     economy.

         This chapter ﬁrst describes the capabilities ﬁrms require for successful innovation.
     It then discusses managerial and organizational practices at the core of the innovation
     and productivity process. The third section provides the ﬁrst systematic evidence,
     drawing again on the same datasets used in chapter 2, about the relationship between
     managerial and organizational practices and innovation processes; and the ﬁnal
     section concludes.

     Firm Capabilities for Innovation
     Deﬁning Capabilities for Innovation

     Sutton (2012) deﬁnes capabilities as those elements of the production process that
     cannot be bought “off the shelf ” on the market like a normal input and hence must be
     learned and accumulated by the ﬁrm. This idea lies behind the ample literature on
     resource-based theories of the ﬁrm (see Penrose 1959; Rumelt 1984; Wernerfelt 1984;
     and Lockett, Thompson, and Morgenstern 2009). These capabilities range from basic
     organizational skills, to logistical abilities (see Syverson 2008), to planning routines and
     systems of human resource management.

         In more complex settings, the “organizational capital” literature (Prescott and
     Visscher 1980; Atkeson and Kehoe 2005) studies the ﬁrm characteristics driving dif-
     ferential performance across ﬁrms. This literature views the organizational structure of
     the ﬁrm, rather than market position or propriety knowledge, as the main source of
     ﬁrm value. In the dynamic capabilities framework (Teece and Pisano 1994; Teece 2000;


66                                                                           The Innovation Paradox
Helfat et al. 2007), the organization’s key competencies are those that enable it to
integrate, build, and reconﬁgure resources in rapidly changing environments (Teece,
Pisano, and Shuen 1997).3 A review of the early literature in capabilities and some of
the existing conceptualizations of this concept can be found in annex 4A. Here we focus
on some of these key capabilities for innovation.


The Importance of Organization Competencies for Learning and Innovation

The central role that organizational practices play in ﬁrms’ knowledge management has
been emphasized by the literature. Some case studies focusing on the East Asian experi-
ence emphasize that the rapid learning process described above was facilitated by the
introduction of managerial and organizational processes, establishment of dedicated
design and engineering departments, or development of quality management processes
(Bell and Figueiredo 2012). More recently, Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2015)
emphasize that the capacity of a ﬁrm to exploit new technologies greatly depends on its
organization. Individuals are time-bound in their ability to deploy knowledge to solve
problems. Organizational hierarchies relax this constraint by creating layers of teams
where “expert” workers manage less knowledgeable workers, thus increasing the experts’
time availability and enabling them to specialize.

   The process of organizational articulation and capabilities accumulation requires
the articulation of internal incentives to ensure workers are allocated to tasks where
they can be more productive, are incentivized (or not penalized) to propose improve-
ments at early stages, and are later incentivized to propose and execute more sophisti-
cated innovation. Although large-scale quantitative evidence is still sparse, some studies
ﬁnd that performance-based reward systems have a positive inﬂuence on the creativity
and innovative behavior of individual employees (De Jong and Den Hartog 2007;
Ederer and Manso 2013; Gibbs et al. 2015) and, in some cases, on the ﬁrm’s overall
innovation-related activities and outcomes (Leiblein and Madsen 2008). These
activities include ﬁrms’ patenting propensity (Chen, Chen, and Podolski 2014) and
quality (Mao and Weathers 2015).

   Though this report focuses primarily on innovation, it is important to highlight
that we use the term capabilities amply. For example, much of the existing analysis in
the strategic management literature on ﬁrm capabilities focuses on capabilities that are
needed to build and maintain a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage, including the knowledge
and routines required to maintain existing production. One example is provided by the
response of the Aquafresh company in Ghana when faced with intense competition
from Asian producers. Sutton and Kpentey (2012) document how the ﬁrm began in
clothing and textiles but, under competitive pressure, reinvented itself as a maker of
soft drinks. It could achieve this not because of its expertise in clothing and textiles but
rather because it was a well-functioning ﬁrm that could identify an alternative path and
reorient itself to changing market conditions.4


Managerial Practices as Key Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                   67
        A useful taxonomy to understand these capabilities is provided by ul Haque et al.
     (1995) and Bell (2009), who differentiate capabilities—including physical, knowledge,
     human, and organizational capital—that are needed for the use of existing technology
     from those needed for adapting or creating new technologies.5 Speciﬁcally, the authors
     distinguish two useful subsets of capabilities:

        1. Production capabilities: those that make use of existing technologies and
           organizational conﬁgurations to maintain production; and
        2. Technology/innovation capabilities: those that enable ﬁrms to improve existing
           technologies or processes or to develop new ones.6

         However, the distinction between production and innovation capabilities is often
     blurred. Some of the routines and organization structures that start as basic production
     capabilities evolve to become innovation capabilities. These can include design
     (Galindo-Rueda and Millot 2015), engineering, market intelligence, and other
     “change-generating knowledge and skill” (Bell 2009, p. 14). For example, ﬁrms need
     some technical or engineering capabilities for maintenance as production capabilities.
     These, however, may evolve over time in some ﬁrms to a dedicated engineering
     department to test new technologies, which will be key for innovation. Thus, the capa-
     bilities needed for innovation are multidimensional, depend on the type of innovation
     introduced, and evolve over time. Figure 1.2 in chapter 1 summarizes this general
     typology, differentiating within innovation capabilities needed for technology adop-
     tion and imitation from those needed for invention and technology generation.

     The Capabilities Escalator

     Case studies suggest that ﬁrms progressively build on their accumulated capabilities,
     facilitating more and more sophisticated investments and innovation. Bell and
     Figueiredo (2012), for example, characterize the manufacturing sector as proceeding in
     different stages corresponding to discrete levels of innovation complexity. From imple-
     menting minor adaptations and imitation of products and processes using a few quali-
     ﬁed technicians, successful ﬁrms moved to more incremental innovation using
     engineers in organized units for product development and introducing better market-
     ing and managerial practices. Subsequently, a second transition to more advanced
     innovation and catching up involved various types of engineers and designers, R&D
     departments, and collaboration with knowledge providers, with more centralized
     knowledge management and more sophisticated lean production processes. Firms that
     reach the technological frontier tend to have internationally recognized R&D depart-
     ments, sophisticated organizational practices and incentives, and strong collaboration
     with knowledge providers.

        Figure 4.1 attempts to capture this accumulation of capabilities across several
     dimensions as ﬁrms gain in sophistication. Moving from left to right, the ﬁgure



68                                                                        The Innovation Paradox
represents the process of catching up, where innovation shifts from simple technology
adaptations and improvements in products and processes to more R&D–intensive
technology and product generation. Moving toward the frontier requires increased
sophistication in some of these capabilities, in some cases with more intensive resources
and routines that are more organized, as well as more specialized human capital such
as engineers and designers.

    Figure 4.1 highlights three key insights. First, production capabilities, some of
which are managerial and organizational, are important for incremental innovation.
Target setting or quality management and monitoring are key elements of innovation
projects (see box 4.1 for an example in Vietnam). These capabilities evolve and
become more sophisticated as ﬁrms converge to the frontier. For example, basic
capabilities, such as simple task assignment or maintenance work, become more
sophisticated in training or technology management. Second, a core set of manage-
rial and organizational capabilities are important for both production and innova-
tion along the entire catch-up path. These managerial and organizational capabilities
are still critical for adopting frontier technologies. Finally, related to the previous
insight, many of these capabilities are complementary, as suggested in box 4.1. Their
absence signiﬁcantly constrains the ability to accumulate other technological capa-
bilities and learning.




     BOX 4.1
    Managerial Practices and Innovation in Vietnam
    The WMS data indicate that Vietnamese ﬁrms are strong on monitoring but weak on setting long-
    run targets, on introducing new technologies and best practice in operations, and on developing
    human resource policies. Interviews with ﬁrms suggest that “many managers have mentioned that
    they meet their targets all the time, and anything less than 100 percent target achievement is
    considered unacceptable by senior management.” A target of 100 percent is probably too high
    given that it suggests targets are too easy, and that the ﬁrm is not experimenting or taking the
    risks necessary to be innovative in the long run. However, “Regardless of any forward-thinking and
    strategic policies, Vietnamese managers emphasize that their principal objective is proﬁt and
    the focus is always on the short term” (Bloom et al. 2015; italics added).
         This is consistent with Newman et al. (2015), who report that 84 percent of ﬁrms surveyed had
    no program of either technology adaptation or R&D. A longer time horizon articulating a vision of
    long-run ﬁrm and product upgrading as well as the human resources necessary for innovation is
    largely absent. For example, “Developing talent is considered expensive and often unnecessary,
    as it is perceived to be easy to replace workers and even managers” (p. 180). This is a critical
    lacuna because active innovation requires a dominance of best practice and a multiyear strategy
    for the ﬁrm.

     Note: Those capabilities in blue are the ones that are often used intensively for innovation. However, in practice, some can also be used in normal production processes; and, vice versa,
     production capabilities are also key complementarities in the innovation process. R&D = research and development.
Measuring Capabilities
As noted, the schematic in ﬁgure 4.1 is derived primarily from detailed case studies.
To date, there has been very little attempt to systematically explore the role of capabili-
ties broadly construed in innovation empirically; in fact, the issue is frequently absent
in policy discussions. This may be partly due to the limited availability of information
about these capabilities in traditional innovation and enterprise surveys. The Oslo
Manual, the internationally recognized reference book on the measurement of innova-
tion, which provides guidelines for the innovation surveys described in box 2.1, identi-
ﬁes activities that are necessary for producing innovation outputs (OECD 2005). This
list, which includes R&D, the acquisition of machinery and equipment, training, and so
on, has evolved over time but is still limited to a range of activities heavily focused on
R&D–based innovation (see annex 2B). Even here, detailed measurement of necessary
human capital–related capabilities, such as engineers or scientists, remains thin. In the
broader growth literature, Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (1991) document at the coun-
try level that the density of engineering graduates affects growth more, for instance,
than that of lawyers. However, ﬁrm-level data on such technical human capital, not to
mention how it is deployed and organized within the ﬁrm, remain unavailable. The
lack of information on these other ﬁrm capabilities has impeded efforts to measure
their importance and thus shape the innovation policy debate. This is perhaps less
problematic in the case of technological capabilities because many policy makers
believe engineering or scientiﬁc capability to be important for innovation.

   However, the absence of data on the basic organization of ﬁrms and how they are
managed has led to this key complementary capability being largely overlooked in
innovation policy. Two examples are the use of matching grants to promote R&D and
public research institutes to provide knowledge to ﬁrms. In both cases, there may not
be a partner to employ ﬁnancing or knowledge effectively. The rest of the chapter is
devoted to this point, which is critical to reorienting the developing country innova-
tion agenda.

The Data Revolution in Managerial Capabilities Measurement

Progress on the managerial data gap has been rapid in recent years. A data revolution
in measuring ﬁrm management and organizational practices, which as ﬁgure 4.1
discusses relates to both productive and technological capabilities, has occurred in
developed countries and is increasingly expanding to developing countries (see box 4.2).
This wave of ﬁrm-level surveys, largely promoted by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007),
focuses on a set of structured management practices such as monitoring and use of
information for improving production; design, integration, and realism of production
targets; and human resource policies and incentives, including bonuses, promotions,
and dismissals. Initial surveys of this type include the 2010 Management and
Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) in the United States and the WMS,

      BOX 4.2
     The New Data on Management Quality
     Three new sources of data permit benchmarking countries by management quality and studying
     consequent ﬁrm performance.
         The World Management Survey (WMS) is conducted through phone interviews with
     representative samples of ﬁrms across the world along four principal dimensions (see Bloom and
     Van Reenen 2007):
         1. Operations. The degree to which the ﬁrm acted upon encountering a problem in the
            production process
         2. Monitoring. Whether the ﬁrm monitored production performance indicators and how
            many indicators
         3. Targets. Time horizon of production targets, if any, short versus long term
         4. Incentives. Whether managers were offered performance bonuses
          The survey has been carried out in 34 countries, including both advanced and developing
     countries.
          The Managerial and Organizational Practices Survey (MOPS) is a written-response
     questionnaire used in the United States that broadly follows these categories as well and a similar
     survey has been recently implemented in Mexico (ENAPROCE 2015) in a large representative
     sample of small, medium, and large ﬁrms (25,456 ﬁrms).
          The innovation module of the World Bank Enterprise Survey includes a section on manage-
     rial practices based on a reduced set of questions of the MOPS (see annex 2A). The section is
     implemented on medium and large ﬁrms (above 50 workers).
          For comparability across surveys, we focus on creating an index like the one proposed in
     Bloom and Van Reenen (2007) based on four major management dimensions: (1) operations,
     (2) monitoring, (3) targets, and (4) incentives.
          As in Bloom and Van Reenen (2010), the scores of each management practice are standard-
     ized to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one:

                                                           m ji − m j
                                                Z m ji =                                            (B4.2.1)
                                                             σ mj

     where zmji is the standardized score for management practice j in ﬁrm i.
         Then, for each ﬁrm, the unweighted average of each management practice is standardized to
     obtain a ﬁnal measure of overall ﬁrm managerial quality, the management score:

                           mi = (moperations + mmonitoring + mtargets + mincentives) /4             (B4.2.2)


                                                            mi − m m
                                                Z i (m) =                                           (B4.2.3)
                                                              σm




72                                                                                        The Innovation Paradox
implemented primarily in large ﬁrms in 35 countries, including Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, some emerging econo-
mies, and an increasing number of low-income countries. Some more general business
and innovation surveys, such as the Survey of Innovation and Business Strategy (SIBS)
in Canada, the innovation survey of the Enterprise Survey Unit of the World Bank
implemented in 48 countries, and the National Survey on Productivity and
Competitiveness on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and micro ﬁrms in Mexico,
are adopting some of the questions used in the MOPS and the WMS.

   These new data, either by themselves or matched with, for instance the Bureau van
Dijk (BvD) Orbis ﬁrm data, provide a richer characterization of innovation activities
and enable researchers to explore the importance of management practices in the
innovation process. This work indicates that many developing country ﬁrms lack the
management practices required to support robust innovation systems.

    For example, developing country ﬁrms in the WMS sample frequently have very
short time horizons and little in the way of long-run productivity plans, and, corre-
spondingly, have very weak human resource policies. China, for instance, is world class
at short-term targets, however it is among the worst in long-term planning and stafﬁng
for such plans. Vietnamese entrepreneurs focus exclusively on the short term and con-
sider cultivation of human capital to be largely a waste of time (see box 4.1). Experience
with undertaking randomized control trials (RCTs) in even reasonably sophisticated
countries like Colombia suggests that many ﬁrms lack basic accounting and tracking
routines. It is highly unlikely that such ﬁrms are capable of undertaking complex activi-
ties such as R&D, which have long gestation periods and are subject to substantial
uncertainty.

New Empirical Evidence on Managerial Practices and Innovation
The Evidence Linking Managerial and Organizational Practices with Innovation

Despite the extensive qualitative evidence linking managerial and organizational
practices to innovation, quantitative evidence establishing this link is extremely lim-
ited. In one of the few empirical studies on this issue, Peeters and Van Pottelsberghe
(2005) use data from large ﬁrms in Belgium to identify seven capabilities, including
technological, production, and managerial processes, that matter for innovation. These
include corporate culture (for example, values, employee recognition and rewards,
mainstreaming the ﬁrm’s innovation strategy, and communication); work organiza-
tion (for example, brainstorming, multidisciplinary teams, employee rotation, and
information exchange across departments); generation of new ideas (for example,
market surveys, competitive intelligence, recruitment, and patent searches); and project
selection (for example, knowledge management).7




Managerial Practices as Key Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                 73
        With the data described in box 4.2 above, we are able to offer a more comprehensive
     view of the link between managerial and organizational practices and innovation.
     The objective is to build a bridge between the innovation literature and the new
     management literature, and to provide evidence on the importance of these capabilities
     for innovation in both emerging markets and low-income countries.

        All the three datasets employed here—the WMS, the Enterprise Survey (ES), and
     ENAPROCE for Mexico—use the same approach to measuring managerial practices
     pioneered by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007). The authors focus on a set of structured
     management practices that were identiﬁed by industry experts as key in explaining
     ﬁrms’ performance. These include four different dimensions: (1) operations in terms of
     introduction of lean manufacturing and improvements, (2) monitoring for constant
     improvements, (3) use of appropriate targets and acting when problems arise, and (4)
     use of incentives to attract and retain talent. Although other managerial practices could
     also be identiﬁed and measured, this set has been shown to be a robust predictor of
     performance across countries and highly correlated with other practices (Bloom and
     Van Reenen 2012).

     Managerial Practices Are Correlated with R&D Intensity and Other Innovation Inputs
     Bloom et al. (2013), using U.S. data from the 2012 MOPS, show that there is a very high
     correlation between structured management and R&D expenditures and patents, after
     instrumenting for potential endogeneity. Figure 4.2 suggests that the correlation
     between management practices and R&D is robust, using two different global samples
     and controlling for the impact of income per capita in both. Panel a plots the average
     management index from the WMS data for large ﬁrms against the average R&D quality
     index, a component of the Global Innovation Index that measures business R&D
     intensity, the ability of countries to generate researchers, and the quality of their uni-
     versities. In both cases, we plot the residuals of regressing these indices on GDP per
     capita to ensure that income per capita is not driving this relationship. The two indexes
     are highly correlated.

         Panel b is based on data from the ES that include information on management and
     innovation in medium and large companies from a larger sample of countries. Again,
     there is a high correlation between the average management index and the average
     country R&D intensity (measured as dollars per worker), conditional on investing in
     this type of activity and controlling for the level of income per capita. Although clearly
     causality is difﬁcult to establish, both are consistent with the idea that better manage-
     ment practices are necessary to increase R&D intensity and manage it efﬁciently.

     Managerial Practices Are Also Correlated with Innovation Outputs
     This positive correlation between the quality of managerial practices and innovation
     inputs is unsurprisingly found with outputs as well. Countries with better managerial
     practices on average also have higher overall innovation capacity, broadly construed.

     Note: The residuals of regressing the Global Innovation Index and management on gross domestic product per capita are plotted to

     Figure 4.3 shows that the average WMS management score is highly correlated with the
     Global Innovation Index (GII 2015), which captures overall innovation capacity,
     including the quality of framework conditions and other infrastructure. Those coun-
     tries with better management practices also have more innovative capacity.

        This correlation is also seen using ﬁrm-level data on innovation expenditures.
     Figure 4.4 shows the percentage of ﬁrms introducing innovations, decomposed by
     region and type of innovation (from the ES data). Better-managed ﬁrms in each region
     are more likely to introduce any innovation (product or process) and are more likely
     to introduce a product new to the ﬁrm, the national market, or the international
     market.8

        More recently, Bloom et al. (2017) also show this correlation between innovation
     inputs and outputs and management, using data from MOPS in the United States.
     Speciﬁcally, the authors show that those ﬁrms that are at the highest managerial quality
     quintiles are the ones that also have higher R&D intensity and ﬁle more patents per
     worker (ﬁgure 4.5).

     Estimates of the Role of Managerial Practices in Knowledge Creation Functions

     Identifying the separate effects of managerial capabilities versus technological capabilities
     requires more structured empirical exercises that control for a greater range of variables.

Drawing on both the ES and the WMS/Orbis datasets, we estimate the standard knowl-
edge creation function described in chapter 2, which relates innovation outcomes to
R&D, and add management quality and other covariates (see box 4.3). In a sense, we can
think of management quality as capturing a broader set of management capabilities and
R&D as capturing revealed capabilities that are more technological.


Managerial Practices as Key Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                                                                                   77
         BOX 4.3
        Estimating the Augmented Knowledge Creation Function
        As discussed in chapter 2, a substantial literature estimates a knowledge creation function, where
        knowledge is generally represented by patenting. We do something similar. Depending on the
        exercise, I represents process or product innovation, or patenting. In each case, we add manage-
        ment as an additional capability, along with a set of ﬁrm-level controls:

                                       I = βR R & D + βM M + Controls + e                         (B4.3.1)

             As the dependent variables are frequently discrete—0 or 1, or count variables, such as num-
        ber of patents ﬁled in the ﬁrm— we use appropriate estimation techniques. For instance, Maloney
        and Sarrias (2017) use a negative binomial estimator to deal with count data (patents).
             Because we are generally working with cross-sections of data—which do not permit using
        lagged variables—and lack other credible instruments, the coefﬁcients are almost certainly
        biased and must be taken as suggestive. In several exercises, Cirera (2017) employs the Crépon–
        Douguet–Mairesse (CDM) model (Crépon, Douguet, and Mairesse 1998) to address endogeneity
        concerns using a system of equations. Speciﬁcally, the CDM model is a recursive system of equa-
        tions that characterize the evolution of the innovative process in three stages. Equations in the
        ﬁrst stage explain the ﬁrm’s decision to invest in R&D on the basis of ﬁrm-speciﬁc, sectoral, and
        other factors. The second stage characterizes innovation outcomes, or the likelihood that the ﬁrm’s
        investment in knowledge capital translates to successful innovations (a knowledge production
        function). In the third stage, an equation links innovation outputs to ﬁrm productivity.




     Capabilities and Process and Product Innovation
     Cirera (2017), using the ES data, conﬁrms the relationship shown in ﬁgure 4.4, control-
     ling for size, age, sector, and country effects. The latter ensures that management and
     R&D activity are not simply picking up the level of development per se. Figure 4.6 plots
     the coefﬁcients from that exercise and shows that both R&D and management quality
     increase the probability of introducing product innovation, process innovation, and pro-
     cess innovations that involve automation.9 Bartz, Mohnen, and Schweiger (2016) ﬁnd
     consistent results with a similar model for ES data for Europe and Central Asia.

     Capabilities and Patenting
     Management quality also is signiﬁcantly related to patenting and R&D. Figure 4.5 from
     Bloom et al. (2017) shows that, for the United States, patenting is associated with higher
     management skills. For a broader range of advanced and developing countries, Maloney
     and Sarrias (2017), using the WMS/BvD Orbis database, ﬁnd broadly similar patterns
     (ﬁgure 4.7). Formal econometric estimation shows that management quality has a
     strong independent effect on patenting, quite apart from whatever support it gives to
     undertaking R&D—on average a one standard deviation increase in managerial quality
     leads to roughly ﬁve additional patents per ﬁrm.

Managerial Practices as Key Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                                                                                             79
     Interactions between Managerial Quality and Innovation
     Finally, more detailed ﬁrm-level data from Mexico allow us to establish that the effect
     of management on innovation grows stronger with better management. Figure 4.8
     shows the coefﬁcients of the unconditional quantile regression of an index of innova-
     tion inputs and outputs10—and the quality of management increases and shows that
     the relationship becomes stronger for those ﬁrms that are at the top of each manage-
     ment quintile.

     The Dual Impact on Productivity
     In chapter 2, we discussed the positive impact that ﬁrm-level innovation has on
     productivity. In this chapter, we summarized some of the evidence suggesting that
     management quality has a substantial, positive impact on productivity and showed
     evidence that managerial and organizational practices are important inputs for inno-
     vation. This supports the view that good management practices have a dual positive
     effect on productivity: a direct effect through enabling a more efﬁcient use of factors
     and an indirect effect through increasing the probability of innovating.

         Cirera (2017), using ES data in a CDM framework (see box 4.3), ﬁnds evidence for
     this hypothesis. Better management practices drive innovation and subsequently
     productivity in developing countries in all regions analyzed. However, the indirect
     effect via innovation disappears for incremental innovation in lower-income countries
     and persists in middle- and high-income countries. As discussed in chapter 2, this sug-
     gests that some of the innovations introduced in the lower-income countries reﬂect
     small changes rather than substantial upgrading.

Complementarities between Managerial Practices and R&D

Not only does management quality enter independently from R&D in knowledge
generation but it also increases the efﬁcacy of R&D in generating innovation outputs.11
In ﬁgure 4.9 the efﬁciency of R&D (the y axis) is measured by the residuals generated
by regressing the GII (2015) on the measure of R&D quality—an index that includes
the quality of R&D institutions as well as the level of gross domestic expenditure on
R&D (GERD). A negative value indicates that the country obtains lower-than-average
innovation quality for a given R&D quality. Distance to the managerial frontier
(the x axis) is measured by the difference between the country’s management score and
the maximum score (the U.S. score). As countries move farther from the managerial
frontier, there is lower R&D efﬁciency in achieving innovation.

    This positive complementarity between management and R&D is also evident using
ﬁrm-level data. Iacovone and Pereira-López (2017) ﬁnd that better managerial prac-
tices increase the efﬁciency in which R&D efforts translate into innovation activities in
Mexico. In other words, an additional investment in R&D expenditure has a larger
impact on innovation in a better-managed ﬁrm than the same investment in a poorly
managed ﬁrm. Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that lack of managerial and orga-
nizational complementary factors may be an important explanation for the low rates of
return to R&D in poor countries documented in chapter 3.

     What Managerial Practices Matter for Innovation
     Does the impact of management quality differ by type of practice? For example, as
     noted earlier, Chinese and Vietnamese ﬁrms are strong on monitoring but weak on set-
     ting long-run targets, on introducing new technologies and best practice in operations,
     and on developing human resource policies. The latter practices are likely to severely
     constrain innovation projects because setting targets and having a well-trained and
     incentivized labor force is critical to transform an idea to prototyping and commercial-
     ization. Iacovone and Pereira-López (2017) replicate the same exercise as in ﬁgure 4.9
     using individual practices (ﬁgure 4.10). They ﬁnd a similar correlation between both
     the innovation index and the use of data-driven performance monitoring and incen-
     tives and targets. This reinforces the view of some studies in the innovation manage-
     ment literature that emphasize continual improvement and risk management, where
     both types of practices play a very important role.


     Concluding Remarks
     This chapter has emphasized the importance of managerial and organizational practices
     as ﬁrm capabilities necessary for innovation and described their process of accumula-
     tion. The key messages can be summarized as follows:

                               ■       Managerial and organizational practices have a direct impact on innovation,
                                       even after controlling for the usual innovation inputs such as R&D.
                               ■       Managerial practices are important predictors of innovation and productivity
                                       across countries, across ﬁrm size, and across country income levels.

    ■   Strong managerial and organizational practices enhance the impact of R&D on
        innovation and productivity and a lack of them may partly explain the lower
        returns to R&D found in poorer countries.
    ■   Developing these capabilities is an important policy objective, especially in
        countries and ﬁrms that are more distant from the technological frontier.

   Policy makers need to identify the barriers to accumulating these capabilities, as
well as the set of complementary factors needed to maximize their impact. This requires
that agencies and policies support the innovative efforts of enterprises in ways that are
appropriate to the local National Innovation System (NIS) and business climate.
We focus on these elements in part II of this report.




Managerial Practices as Key Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                83
     Annex 4A A Review of Firm Capabilities for Innovation
     This annex summarizes the key capabilities highlighted by different literature over the
     last three decades as important for innovation (See Cirera, López-Bassols, and Maloney
     2017). Despite the strong R&D myopia that has biased innovation policy and practice,
     the innovation literature has traditionally emphasized the importance of a broader set
     of capabilities for successful innovation, especially in developing countries. Recent
     advances in the measurement of managerial and organizational practices have opened
     the “black box” of these capabilities, and provided a more nuanced view of the different
     routines that are necessary to converge to the technological frontier.


     Accumulating Capabilities Are the Key for Growth and Economic Catch-Up

     During the 1980s, several authors studying the experiences of Latin American coun-
     tries and the Newly Industrialized Countries (NICs) in East Asia emphasized the
     importance of acquiring technological capabilities during their process of growth con-
     vergence. A World Bank project, “The Acquisition of Technological Capability” led by
     Carl Dahlman and Larry Westphal, emphasizes that the acquisition and development
     of technological capabilities were at the center of the innovation process in the NICs.
     Rather than invention or the generation of indigenous technologies, acquiring the
     capabilities for efﬁcient production requires the combination of foreign technologies
     with efforts to develop the skills and know-how required to effectively use this technol-
     ogy (Dahlman, Ross-Larson, and Westphal 1987). Although most of the debate around
     the East Asian “miracle” centered on the role of openness, which has an important
     impact on incentives to engage in innovation, a critical element explaining the growth
     success of these countries was the ability of ﬁrms to learn and accumulate capabilities
     over time, and thus catch up technologically.


     Firm Capabilities: An Old Subject of Study with Different Conceptualizations

     The longstanding interest in understanding the concept of ﬁrm capabilities is rooted in
     Penrose’s (1959) seminal work on the nature (and growth) of the ﬁrm. In this frame-
     work, ﬁrms own a number of resources that support (and constrain) their growth
     (Cantwell 2000; Jacobides and Winter 2005). However, views on the nature of these
     capabilities differ. On the one hand, neoclassical theories of the ﬁrm have traditionally
     conceptualized these capabilities and the process of technology adoption as a black box
     (Rosenberg 1982). Under this paradigm, ﬁrms were seen as organizations with the
     main objective of reducing transaction costs (Coase 1937). Important efforts were
     made in the late 1970s and 1980s to explain differences in ﬁrm growth, for example
     emphasizing managerial talent (Lucas 1978) or learning (Jovanovic 1982). These mod-
     els, while explaining critical features of ﬁrms’ dynamics, fail to offer a clear conceptual-
     ization of the processes that enable ﬁrms to learn and acquire tacit knowledge.


84                                                                           The Innovation Paradox
Instead, they focus primarily on how differences in capabilities were revealed in
performance—that is, ﬁrm growth or market share changes—or, as in Sutton (2005),
in attributes such as quality and cost.

   On the other hand, organizational theory, management-related ﬁelds, and most of
the innovation literature have examined the concept of ﬁrm capabilities in more detail,
using primarily case studies and qualitative information. These studies focus on identi-
fying the precise set of capabilities (and combinations of capabilities) that ﬁrms must
acquire, develop, and accumulate to introduce innovations or maintain competitive
advantages. Although these strands overlap to some extent, they provide different con-
ceptualizations of ﬁrm capabilities, which has resulted in a lack of a unifying frame-
work to understand capabilities. This contributed to the widely accepted view in policy
and media circles that innovation is generated primarily by accumulating a limited
subset of these capabilities—research and development—for technology generation
and radical new products. As we discussed earlier, this model is at odds with the inno-
vation processes typical of ﬁrms farther away from the technological frontier.

    To build a bridge between this literature and the industrial organization tradition,
Sutton (2000, 2005, 2012) distinguishes between two conceptualizations. First, there is a
ﬁrm’s underlying capability (“the set of elements of ‘know-how’ or ‘working practices’ held
collectively by the group of individuals comprising the ﬁrm”; Sutton 2005, p. 3). Second,
there is a ﬁrm’s revealed capability, which is the observable (and performance-relevant) out-
come reﬂecting the ﬁrm’s productive capacities in terms of both quality and productivity.

    Different conceptual models emphasize various aspects of ﬁrm capabilities, but some
key characteristics are consistently highlighted throughout these studies. Speciﬁcally,
capabilities are (1) primarily internal to the ﬁrm, (2) ﬁrm-speciﬁc, (3) knowledge-based,
and (4) not easily replicable.12 More important, these knowledge capabilities manifest in
routines, management practices, specialized departments, or assets that are acquired by
ﬁrms internally or externally, that can be measured, and that are the result of speciﬁc
investments in learning and know-how accumulation over time. A key element in these
frameworks is that innovation is seen as a product of the ﬁrm’s “combinative capabilities
to generate new applications from existing knowledge” (Kogut and Zander 1992), or as
a change in established routines (Nelson and Winter 1982). Even for more basic tech-
nologies, this requires investments in capability building that increase ﬁrms “absorptive
capacity” (Cohen and Levinthal 1990) to facilitate the process of technology transfer.


Notes
 1. This strategy is based on the creation in these countries of an institutional framework, involving
    both public and private sectors, that provides a capacity not just to receive the imported tech-
    nologies, but to absorb, adapt, diffuse, or disseminate them and ultimately improve them through
    the efforts of indigenous technologists and engineers. Technological capability is acquired and
    enhanced through a process of organizational learning at the level of the ﬁrm and at the level

        of the industry. The whole process can be described as one of “economic learning” (Cho and
        Mathews, 2000, p. 4).
     2. This is consistent with ﬁndings that developing countries lag across all sectors and the recent lit-
        erature that casts doubt on the policy maker’s capacity to identify sectors with desirable externali-
        ties (Lederman and Maloney 2012, Maloney and Nayyar 2017) or whether the efforts to choose
        sectors were an important part of the Asia growth miracle (Noland and Pack 2003). Dodgson
        (2000, p. 261) states, “An important policy question for less technologically developed nations,
        such as Malaysia and Indonesia, is whether the present emphasis on electronics is likely to produce
        any longer-term sustainable comparative advantages. One might justiﬁably ask whether emphasis
        could be better placed on more traditional and historical, but still potentially high technology,
        high value-added industries, such as tropical cash crops in Malaysia and textiles in Indonesia.”
     3. Dynamic capabilities are closely linked to organizational processes (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000),
        particularly organizational learning, which can lead to the alteration of capabilities through
        external sourcing as well as through internal knowledge creation. Innovation depends on the
        leveraging of organizational capabilities, processes, and resources. Organizational capabilities are
        often explicitly linked to different innovation activities (Grant 1996), including the commercial-
        ization of new products or the implementation of new (or improved) processes (Chandler 1992).
        Organizational capabilities in a broad sense include the human capital of the ﬁrm’s employees
        (management and others) as well as the structure of organizational incentives that enable evalu-
        ation and transmission of skills and knowledge within the organization (Ulrich and Lake 1990).
        Among organizational capabilities, the use of knowledge management policies and practices
        within ﬁrms has become increasingly widespread. This includes various management techniques
        and tools that are being deployed by ﬁrms to optimize their use of knowledge in support of their
        innovation activities (OECD 2003; Kremp and Mairesse 2004).
     4. Visits to ﬁrms in the auto parts sector in Colombia revealed the wide variance in such capabili-
        ties across ﬁrms. Faced, again, with increased competition from Asia, some ﬁrms simply lowered
        their prices, which over the long term is not a viable strategy. Others sought to retail the low end
        of the Asian products but maintain market share at the higher end, hoping that competition
        would not extend there soon. The most adept organizations were able to seek out new sectors that
        could repackage or reapply their existing technological abilities to markets with more slope in the
        demand curve. One, for instance, moved into the metal skeletons of the vertical gardens that are
        ubiquitous in Bogotá but that require tailoring to local context and hence are not susceptible to
        being mass-produced abroad.
     5. Bell (2009, p. 11) highlights the dynamic nature of these technological and innovation capa-
        bilities that reﬂect the “capacity [of ﬁrms] to create new conﬁgurations of product and process
        technology and to implement changes and improvements to technologies already in use.”
     6. Lall (1992) distinguishes three uses of technological capabilities: (1) investment: relating to the
        initial phases of technology acquisition and deployment; (2) production: quality control, main-
        tenance, research, design, innovation; and (3) linkage capabilities: enabling effective inward and
        outward knowledge ﬂows.
     7. Other studies include Bartz, Mohnen, and Schweiger (2016), who show for a sample of countries
        in Europe and Central Asia that better managerial practices increase innovation incidence and
        productivity. Cosh, Fu, and Hughes (2012) study the relationship between organization structure
        and innovation in the United Kingdom’s small and medium enterprises. The authors ﬁnd that
        having a formal organizational structure of decentralized decision making and written business
        plans is an important predictor of the ability to innovate.
     8. Firms in South Asia in the radical innovation group are an exception. However, there are very few
        radical innovators in the sample and average differences across groups are not signiﬁcant.
     9. Because the R&D and management variables are in different units—management is a standard-
        ized score and R&D is a dummy whether the ﬁrm invests in R&D—we cannot compare their
        relative effects.

10. This continuous index is calculated by Iacovone and Pereira-Lopez (2017) based on data from
    ENAPROCE (2015) on different innovation inputs and outputs, such as the use of intellectual
    property and investments in technology. The index measures whether a ﬁrm: purchases licenses
    over products, processes, or machinery and equipment aimed at updating, upgrading, and
    improving its production processes and uses them as they are; assimilates and documents the
    technologies comprised by the licenses; adapts and modiﬁes technologies purchased to increase
    efﬁciency; generates its own technology; ﬁles for patents over technologies developed; and sells
    the technology it generates to other companies.
11. See, for example, the discussion of the role of organizational practices in the development of
    capabilities in the experience of ﬁrms catching up in East Asia and Latin America (Bell and
    Figueiredo 2012).
12. While our focus is on ﬁrm-level capabilities, capabilities have also been considered at the level of
    countries. See for example Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) and Hausmann and Hidalgo (2011)
    who model the link between country capability endowments and product capability requirements, or
    Daude, Nagengast, and Perea (2016) who examine the determinants of national export capabilities.

5. Building and Accumulating
   Managerial Capabilities


Introduction
In the previous chapter, we argued that management and organization capabilities are
critical to innovation. We offered evidence that management practices are essential
complements to other inputs, such as research and development (R&D), and have an
independent effect on product and process innovation, and patenting. For developing
countries, capabilities in this area are not only critical to production efﬁciency but also
constitute the building blocks of innovative capabilities. Thus, innovation policy in
developing countries should prioritize the accumulation of managerial capabilities for
countries at the bottom of the capabilities escalator.

    In this chapter the report focuses on how ﬁrms can build and acquire these capabili-
ties. The recent availability of data on management quality enables the identiﬁcation of
factors that determine managerial capability: in particular, human capital, competi-
tion, and ownership structure, which are discussed in the ﬁrst part of this chapter. Also,
outward orientation or links to multinational enterprises (MNEs) can contribute to
build these managerial capabilities. In the second part of the chapter, we discuss how
integration with global value chains (GVCs) offers a valuable source of learning for
building these capabilities.

What Determines Managerial Practices
In chapter 3, we discussed how ﬁrms’ ability to innovate depends on the overall
incentives framework. Innovation could be constrained by innovation-related market
failures, such as a weak intellectual property regime, or by basic problems in the busi-
ness environment, such as barriers to investment or high costs of doing business. In this
section, we describe the process of accumulation of managerial capabilities and the role
of external and internal factors in explaining differences in the quality of management
across ﬁrms.

What Underlies the Differences in Average National Management Scores?

Managerial capabilities in the frontier countries, such as Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the
United States, greatly exceed those in Africa and parts of Asia (see ﬁgure 2.12 in chapter 2).



                                                                                                 91

     Average scores in monitoring, employment of just-in-time processes, internal feedback
     mechanisms, long-run planning and goal stretching, and human resource policies in poor
     countries are well below those in frontier countries.

        Moreover, these lower average scores reﬂect poorer management across the entire
     distribution of ﬁrms, not a plethora of poorly managed ﬁrms coexisting with an efﬁ-
     cient modern sector with ﬁrms performing close to the frontier (Maloney and Sarrias
     2017). The distribution of management scores in the United States is farthest to the
     right in ﬁgure 5.1, suggesting that management quality of the better-managed ﬁrms in
     the United States substantially exceeds that of the better-managed ﬁrms in developing
     countries. In fact, the vast majority of ﬁrms in all of the region-representative countries
     shown fall below the average ﬁrm in the United States. As Maloney and Sarrias (2017)
     show, the difference between the median standardized management (z) score (see
     box 4.2) in a country and that in the United States moves uniformly with the average
     country z-score (panel a of ﬁgure 5.2). This suggests that convergence to the frontier is
     a question of moving not just the worst ﬁrms but the whole distribution.

        Another way of demonstrating that lower average management quality in poor
     countries reﬂects problems across ﬁrms is to compare the average z-score in each
     country to the ratio of the difference in management quality with U.S. ﬁrms at the

90th percentile (best-managed ﬁrms) over the 10th percentile (worst-managed ﬁrms)
(panel b of ﬁgure 5.2). In theory, if the low average management quality in poor
countries reﬂects many badly managed ﬁrms but the good ﬁrms are at the frontier,
then this ratio should be below 1, as it is for Greece and Ireland. However, the ratio is
close to or above 1 for many countries, suggesting that the best ﬁrms lag as much as or
more than the worst ﬁrms. The ratio tends to be higher for richer countries, suggest-
ing that this lag of the best becomes more pronounced with development. Thus, the
United States marks the frontier not because its median ﬁrm is better managed—
these ﬁrms are in fact very similar to those in Germany, Japan, and Sweden—but
because its best ﬁrms are better by far. In some countries, like China and Turkey, the
management quality of the best ﬁrms is well below that of U.S. ﬁrms, compared to
countries with similar levels of average management quality (see also box 5.1). In
sum, management quality upgrading requires lifting performance across the entire
distribution.

        Why Do China’s Best Firms Lag in Management Quality?
        China’s rapid growth has been driven more by reasonable management skills across the bottom
        and center of the distribution combined with scale and low costs, rather than by stellar managerial
        performance at the top. Management quality at the 10th percentile (worst-managed ﬁrms) is only
        0.58 points below the worst of U.S. ﬁrms, roughly the same as in Great Britain. However, manage-
        rial quality in China’s top ﬁrms is 1.4 points below that of the top U.S. ﬁrms, among the worst ratios
        in the sample. Chinese managers are very good at some key capabilities for production, such as
        clarity of goals and measurement scores. However, in some key practices for innovation, such as
        just-in-time management and long-run strategic thinking, the scores are farther from the manage-
        rial frontier.
             Similarly, a review of ﬁve prominent Chinese industries ﬁnds that, although aggregate produc-
        tion growth has been impressive, management quality at the individual ﬁrm level is well below
        the frontier (Cooke 2008, p. 25). In general, ﬁrms “rely on their low-cost advantage and mass
        production mode as their main competitive advantage instead of product innovation and quality of
        products and services.” Arguably, Chinese managers are astute in terms of short-run assembly
        line management but often lack vision or plans for long-term technological advancement. Further,
        performance management often is based more on morality, political attitudes, seniority, and main-
        tenance of harmonious relations with colleagues than on productivity-related indicators.



     What Factors Affect Management Quality?

     Bloom and Van Reenen (2007, 2010) exploring the World Management Survey (WMS),
     identify competition, human capital, ownership structure, the business environment,
     and learning spillovers as drivers of ﬁrm management scores. and Bloom et al. (2017)
     argue that these account for about a third of the dispersion of structured management
     practices across U.S. plants. We take several of these in turn.

     Competition
     Competition plays an important role in explaining differences in managerial practices
     for four frontier countries, either by forcing the worst ﬁrms to exit or by stimulating
     ﬁrms across the distribution to work harder (Bloom and Van Reenen 2007, 2010).
     Maloney and Sarrias (2017) conﬁrm this effect for the frontier countries but ﬁnd it less
     signiﬁcant for developing countries. This may be because the proxy used to represent
     competition is less well measured in developing countries. However, like any type of
     innovation activity, the impact of competition on managerial practices is theoretically
     ambiguous. Competition can stimulate efforts at upgrading, particularly for ﬁrms
     close to the frontier (Aghion et al. 2005). For example, a signiﬁcantly greater number
     of ﬁrms in European Union (EU) manufacturing sectors that were more affected by
     Chinese competition upgraded their technology, did more R&D, and increased patent-
     ing (Bloom, Draca, and Van Reenen 2016). On the other hand, competition reduces the
     rents resulting from innovation and hence reduces the incentive to improve practices.

Competition may even force ﬁrms furthest from the frontier to exit.1 To some degree,
this weeding-out effect is a normal process of improving quality. However, ﬁrms “close”
to this threshold are unlikely to have the resources to invest in upgrading.

    Case studies offer support for the view that the impact of competition on upgrading
differs according to distance from the frontier. More competition likely would force
improvements in operations in state-owned enterprises in China (see box 5.1) or large
protected companies in many countries (see Rijkers, Freund, and Nucifora 2015 on
Tunisia, for example). However, many Colombian small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) faced with increased competition from Asian imports found it difﬁcult to
develop a counter strategy, including the necessary upgrading, until supported by out-
side consulting ﬁrms with more experience.

Human Capital
Human capital is an important determinant of management practices (see Bloom and
Van Reenen 2007, 2010; Maloney and Sarrias, 2017). For instance, ﬁrms with manag-
ers who have attended college tend to show higher management scores. However,
there is also evidence that ﬁrms invest in on-the-job managerial upgrading in the styl-
ized fact that longer-lived ﬁrms tend to have better management.2 As ﬁgure 5.3
shows, the median managerial practice from the Enterprise Survey (ES) data is higher

Building and Accumulating Managerial Capabilities                                                                                                     95
     for ﬁrms that have been in business more than 20 years than in younger ﬁrms, for all
     regions except the Middle East and North Africa. It is difﬁcult to reach robust conclu-
     sions about the accumulation of managerial capabilities without longitudinal data,
     but this can be suggestive that management quality changes over the life cycle of the
     ﬁrm, and external factors and own upgrading efforts could play a role in improving
     management practices over the life cycle.

         Foreign experience can also improve human capital by exposing managers to fron-
     tier practices, and managers who studied abroad score much better in management
     quality. This exposition to best practices by the top managers who set the vision and
     standards of the ﬁrm can have an appreciable impact on ﬁrms; performance.3

        In sum, learning through education and experience can drive improvements in
     managerial quality. In part, this may reﬂect better-educated entrepreneurs displacing
     existing ﬁrms. However, ﬁrms appear to improve over the life cycle, and, as is discussed
     in chapter 7, business advisory interventions can have important effects on manage-
     ment quality and productivity. Convergence to the managerial frontier requires not
     only competition to remove badly managed ﬁrms but also, and potentially more
     important, programs to support the diffusion and adoption of good managerial
     practices.

     Ownership Structure
     Ownership structure is consistently found to be significantly associated with man-
     agement quality (see, for example, Bloom and Van Reenen 2010; Maloney and
     Sarrias 2017). Government-owned companies tend to be managed badly. Firms
     with diffuse ownership (many shareholders) tend to be among the best. Family-
     owned firms, which are prevalent in developing countries, tend to have substan-
     tially worse managerial performance. Family owners may not contract professional
     managers, in part because they wish to pass management to elder sons, who may
     be less talented (Lemos and Scur 2016). Alternatively, family owners may be unwill-
     ing to hire professional management because weak contracting environments
     make it difficult for owners to maintain control (Bloom and Van Reenen 2007;
     McKenzie and Woodruff, 2012).

         Iacovone, Maloney, and Tsivanidas (2017), employing the Bureau van Dijk Orbis
     and the World Value Survey (WVS) data for Europe, show a strong relationship
     between family ownership and the contracting environment measured either as the
     rule of law index by the Worldwide Governance Indicators (ﬁgure 5.4) or as reported
     levels of trust in individuals from the World Values Survey. They ﬁnd that weak trust
     is associated with more family management and having 25 percent lower productivity
     levels. Reluctance to bring in the necessary professional skills limits learning, the scale
     of operations, and the upgrading and innovating that can be undertaken.

External Sources of Learning
The value of external sources of learning has been long stressed by the innovation litera-
ture. This has been emphasized by the open innovation paradigm (Chesbrough 2003),
establishing the importance of external collaboration and using external ideas in the
process of technology adoption and technology generation. In this section, we focus on
a speciﬁc set of channels that can facilitate learning and the accumulation of managerial
and technical capabilities through participation in international markets and links to
MNEs and GVCs.

Learning through Participation in International Markets

Firms that trade or operate across borders have better management practices (Bloom and
Van Reenen 2010; Maloney and Sarrias 2017). Determining to what extent ﬁrms are learn-
ing from their international contacts or whether only better ﬁrms can operate successfully
abroad is challenging. However, a sizeable literature explores this relationship.

Trade and Capabilities Building
As stressed in Chapter 3, ﬁrms can learn and accumulate capabilities for innovation by
participating in international markets. First, openness to trade increases competition
and increases the incentives for knowledge accumulation and innovation discussed
earlier. Second, openness increases access to technology via imported inputs.4




Building and Accumulating Managerial Capabilities                                                                               97
     In addition, access to export markets enables ﬁrms to upgrade their capabilities by
     learning about more sophisticated and contested markets, and enabling increases in
     scale.5 Using ﬁrm-level data across 43 developing countries, Almeida and Fernandes
     (2008) ﬁnd that exporters and importers are more likely to introduce technological
     innovations than nontrading ﬁrms are.

         Firms that neither export nor import are less likely to introduce product innova-
     tions, appear to be worse managed, and are less likely to do R&D than ﬁrms that
     export, import, or do both (ES data for 44 countries in four regions—ﬁgure 5.5).
     Innovation and R&D incidence are higher in ﬁrms that both export and import, while
     managerial practices are also generally good for this group and for ﬁrms that import
     but do not export. Firms that export but do not import also show higher innovation
     activities incidence and are better managed than ﬁrms not exposed to trade—although
     less so than the other trade groups, perhaps because of being concentrated in low-
     value-added sectors.

        The direction of causation between trade exposure, better quality management, and
     innovation may differ depending on the form of exposure to international markets.
     Importing ﬁrms learn through access to foreign inputs and technologies, whereas
     exporting ﬁrms can learn from competing in more demanding markets. At the same
     time, better-quality ﬁrms tend to have greater success in meeting the more stringent
     standards faced in international markets. Having these capabilities is key for competing
     in quality in world markets.6

        There is some microevidence for the view that the direction of causality runs from
     upgrading capabilities to trade. Iacovone and Javorcick (2012), using detailed informa-
     tion on a sample of Mexican ﬁrms over the period 1994–2004, ﬁnd evidence of quality

upgrading (indicated by an increase in unit values) prior to entry into export markets.
Also, Cirera, Marin, and Markwald (2015), using a unique dataset of Brazilian ﬁrms,
show how innovative efforts and the strategic positioning of ﬁrms in the domestic
market are key elements in explaining ﬁrms’ export diversiﬁcation (innovation). Thus,
although there is evidence of learning through participating in international markets,
improving ﬁrm capabilities also improves innovation via upgrading and export
diversiﬁcation.

Learning through Links to Foreign Direct Investment

Foreign Direct Investment and Spillovers
Links to foreign direct investment (FDI) can also provide important learning opportu-
nities to ﬁrms. Firms with at least 25 percent foreign ownership7 tend to be better
managed, and are more likely to perform R&D and introduce product innovations
(ﬁgure 5.6). Foreign ﬁrms may be a source of capabilities for domestic ﬁrms, but this
cannot be measured on the basis of the ES dataset.

    FDI can bring new technologies to a country through direct investments in subsid-
iaries. In some cases, this can trigger spillovers to local ﬁrms via supply links or by
training staff that then create spin-offs or work for local companies. In a set of case
studies, Chandra (2006) shows that FDI played a critical role in diversiﬁcation and cre-
ation of new sectors in various developing countries (examples include electronics in
Malaysia and Taiwan, China; salmon in Chile; ﬁsheries in Uganda; and, to a lesser extent,
horticulture in Kenya). FDI designed to serve local markets can also have positive effects
on innovation via supplier linkages8 and by offering products at lower prices, which
increases competition facing some ﬁrms and lowers the cost of inputs for others.

Building and Accumulating Managerial Capabilities                                                                                                                                          99
          However, in many cases large MNE presence has not induced any domestic capabili-
      ties spillovers. For example, there was little knowledge transfer to domestic SMEs from
      large electronics MNEs in Mexico. In addition, part of the justiﬁcation of Singapore’s
      aggressive policies to develop skills and ﬁrm capabilities was the lack of spillovers from
      existing MNEs.

          Technology transfer from exposure to international markets and foreign-owned
      ﬁrms requires complementary capabilities on the part of domestic ﬁrms. Lall (1992)
      stresses the importance of linkage capabilities to effectively use and internalize knowl-
      edge ﬂows. The ability to learn and adopt new capabilities and technologies requires
      the appropriate skills and managerial processes. Fu (2008) provides evidence that the
      spillovers from FDI in China are larger in regions with more educated workers. In most
      of the case studies of new sectors reviewed in Chandra (2006), local industrial develop-
      ment, training, and R&D activities play an important role in absorbing know-how
      through FDI. In this regard, capacity-building programs for local ﬁrms are critical to
      gaining beneﬁts from FDI.

          Capabilities transfer, however, has some differences from technology transfer.
      Technology transfer tends to be more sector speciﬁc, whereas capabilities, especially
      managerial practices, can be transferred from other sectors. In one of the few papers
      analyzing directly the transfer of managerial practices from MNEs to domestic ﬁrms,
      Fu (2012) ﬁnds evidence of the transfer of managerial practices from MNEs to
      U.K. ﬁrms. Domestic ﬁrms appear to adopt some managerial practices, and the transfer
      is not only intrasector but also occurs thorough upstream and downstream links to
      MNEs in other sectors. There is, however, some heterogeneity in adopting these mana-
      gerial practices, and absorptive capacity and commitment from managers are critical to
      effectively adopt these practices and facilitate learning. In addition, these positive
      spillovers generally occur in capabilities that are more likely to be codiﬁed and that
      require less tacit knowledge (Fu, Helmers, and Zhang 2012).


      Learning and Upgrading through Participation in GVCs

      Perhaps one of the most valuable external sources of capabilities is participation in
      GVCs. GVCs are complex production systems made of multiple ﬁrms located in differ-
      ent countries linked together by multilayered sourcing networks and fast-evolving,
      technology-enabled business models (Gerefﬁ, Humphrey, and Sturgeon 2005). Firms
      in such production networks, whether linked through “arm’s-length transactions”
      where the buyer and seller act independently or through intragroup investment and
      trade, enjoy signiﬁcant opportunities for transferring capabilities and absorbing for-
      eign technology and innovation. Firms embedded in multinational production earn
      higher returns on innovation, face lower costs for R&D, and exploit scale better than
      ﬁrms selling to domestic markets (Guadalupe, Kuzmina, and Thomas 2012). As GVC
      participation becomes more stable, opportunities expand for supplier ﬁrms to become

acquainted with newer, more advanced technologies, skills, and processes (Kugler and
Verhoogen 2012), thereby boosting process innovation and even product innovation.

    At the same time, relationships within GVCs differ, which affects the form and
extent of technology transfer. For example, “captive” GVC relationships, where low-
competence suppliers are heavily dependent on lead ﬁrms for highly codiﬁed, complex
technical speciﬁcations, may offer little transfer of capabilities. By contrast, GVC rela-
tionships may be characterized by high interdependence between competent suppliers
and lead ﬁrms, where upgrading opportunities are substantial and occur in both direc-
tions. Mariscal and Taglioni (2017) describe the degree of technological upgrading that
is likely to occur in GVCs, depending on the level of technical dependence, forms of
competition, costs of switching to alternate producers, codiﬁcation and complexity of
technical instructions, and competence of suppliers (table 5.1).

          Mariscal and Taglioni (2017) describe how the different stages of GVC engagement
      have different implications for the capabilities requirements and learning opportunities
      (a more detailed description of the different stages of GVCs and how these affect capabili-
      ties can be found in annex 5A). These stages can be divided into: (1) the protoconnecting
      stage, where the ability to reach a minimum scale of transactions is key; (2) the connected
      stage, which requires a few basic capabilities (for example, production or managerial abil-
      ities, cheap access to key inputs of the production process) and the ability to correctly
      evaluate and leverage the ﬁrm core competences; (3) the upgrading stage, which requires
      high standards of quality and delivery and accordingly deep relationships with other par-
      ticipants in the chain; and (4) the mature stage, where the ﬁrm is in direct relationship
      with, or becomes, a lead ﬁrm, turnkey supplier, trading platform, or global buyer, requir-
      ing sufﬁcient organizational capital and the ability to align own and buyer product mar-
      ket development and procurement strategies. Figure 5.7 summarizes the different types
      of innovation required at each stage, which can be used to guide innovation policy efforts.

          At the initial stages of GVC engagement, ﬁrms need to have a correct understanding
      of their own capabilities and the basic skills they can provide. As connections to GVCs
      are established, more emphasis should be placed on fostering adaptive change and
      innovation through imitation of a narrow set of activities. Training by the lead ﬁrm or
      turnkey suppliers in a GVC and fostering turnover of managers from the foreign-
      owned ﬁrms to domestic ﬁrms may accelerate the process of learning.

         As GVC engagement deepens, the institutional set-up to foster learning and upgrad-
      ing should focus on policies that enable ﬁrms to acquire high-quality inputs at interna-
      tional prices to boost the quality of production, and that support the learning of

frontier business practices. Some of these instruments are discussed in chapter 7. Public
support may be beneﬁcial for ﬁrms’ efforts to meet international standards, to auto-
mate production, and to achieve other adaptive improvements. Upgrading at the higher
stages also requires the sort of complementary factors that were discussed in
chapter 3—educational systems that focus on teaching advanced skills, improving the
quality of vocational training, and promoting a general culture of meritocracy at all
skill levels. Frederick’s (2016) work on the apparel GVC in China provides a sector-level
illustration of some of these dynamics (see box 5.2).



     BOX 5.2
   Lessons from China for Apparel Sector Innovation and Upgrading
   China has been remarkably successful in the apparel industry, improving in all key areas and
   growing rapidly. China has performed well on numerous measures of upgrading (process, product,
   end-market, function, and intersectoral) by having a broad range of product categories, full-
   package offerings, “good-enough” compliance, and a distinct value proposition that entailed
   affordability, reliability, and the development of a good reputation (Frederick 2016).
       Frederick (2016) attributes this to the following innovation policies and complementary
   factors:
       ■    Industrial polices geared toward upgrading and assessing global dynamics, including
            grants and loans for technological upgrading; incentives for machinery to make more
            advanced products while removing incentives for lower-value products; targeting markets
            other than the EU and the United States, as well as the domestic market; investments in
            textile capabilities and technology and growth in key material segments; a “go-out” policy
            to encourage investment in low-value-added segments in neighboring countries; and
            support for domestic brand development
       ■    A functional division of labor between sales and production, making use of agents and
            intermediates to promote manufacturers and link up with global buyers
       ■    Investments in connectivity through sourcing ofﬁces in Hong Kong SAR, China and near
            airports in mainland China that enable buyers to be both close and comfortable
       ■    Continuous innovation and modiﬁcations in production processes to keep costs low and
            keep up with emerging competitors
       ■    Developing long-term relationships that build on improvements in quality, speed, and price
            competition
       ■    Correctly assessing the tipping point for buyers (where they may be inclined to change
            suppliers) and not exceeding those
   Although China’s success cannot directly be replicated, it does offer lessons for other countries,
   including the importance of developing long-term relationships and ties with foreign ﬁrms, target-
   ing emerging markets without highly developed buyer–supplier relationships, and targeting niches
   within a highly diversiﬁed industry. China’s success also offers opportunities for other countries
   through partnering with Chinese ﬁrms, both to transfer skills and knowledge and to access the
   Chinese market, and taking advantage of rising labor costs in China to undercut these suppliers.

      Concluding Remarks
      In this chapter, we have examined factors that drive the accumulation of managerial
      capabilities. This is a learning process affected by, among other factors, capital, compe-
      tition, and ownership structure as well as learning opportunities outside the ﬁrm:
      international trade, links to MNEs, and participation in GVCs. Getting the most of
      these interactions requires complementary investments from the recipient ﬁrms to
      improve absorptive capacity, especially in the case of links to MNEs.

         One external factor missing in this chapter is the critical role of government policies
      to support capability upgrading. Convergence to the managerial frontier cannot be
      achieved only by getting rid of badly managed ﬁrms; it also requires ﬁrms across the
      distribution to innovate in their organization and management practices. The instru-
      ments to support this upgrading in the context of the overall policy mix supporting
      innovation are discussed in the next part of the report.

Annex 5A Capabilities at Different Stages of Connection in GVCs
In the framework proposed by Mariscal and Taglioni (2017), engagement starts with
the protoconnecting stage, in which reaching a minimum scale of transactions is key.
This is the case both in the sourcing and in the selling functions. The existence of
intermediaries that play a matching role can help ﬁrms move the ﬁrst steps toward
international engagement (Ahn, Amiti, and Weinstein 2011). After having achieved
signiﬁcant size, the large intermediaries may become themselves companies engaging
in GVCs, as traders or by gradually adding value through expanding into processing
for some of the immediate upstream or downstream functions (Blum, Claro, and
Horstmann 2010).

    The actual initial stage of GVC engagement is the pure connection stage. At this stage,
engagement in GVCs is not a robust situation but a rather unstable one and subject to
market forces that may exclude the ﬁrm from continuing the connection (Blum, Claro,
and Horstmann 2013). In this initial stage of engagement there will be important sunk
costs of entry, which are partially determined by the organizational and managerial abil-
ity of ﬁrms (Arkolakis 2010). The relatively basic degree of capabilities needed to enter
GVCs makes entry and exit from engagement pervasive, likely, but also ﬂickering and
unstable. At such a stage, it is mostly about meeting several minimum requirements, that
is, a few basic capabilities that allow the ﬁrm to connect to either a foreign market or a
lead ﬁrm. Basic capabilities (for example, production or managerial abilities, cheap access
to key inputs of the production process) and the ability to correctly evaluate and leverage
the ﬁrm core competences are the crucial elements to connecting to GVCs. From a sourc-
ing perspective, this means that the ﬁrm is able to streamline its processes and product
scope while also complementing well its production with a proper and effective access to
the market of inputs (Csillag and Koren 2011; Goldberg et al. 2010). From a selling
perspective, the key capability is about learning to align its goals to those of its actual and
potential buyers and modulate its processes to ﬁt seamlessly in their production pro-
cesses (Kasahara and Rodriguez 2008; Van Biesebroeck 2005; De Loecker 2006).

   As ﬁrms slowly move toward better connectivity, their learning processes as well as
capabilities to target demand (Dhingra 2013) and absorptive capacities (De Loecker
2007, 2013; Iacovone and Crespi 2010) become key in shaping decisions. Examples of
ﬁrms moving toward better connectivity include ﬁrms that evolve from occasionally
supplying materials, components, or services to a global buyer (lead ﬁrm, trader, or
turnkey supplier) to becoming registered suppliers of the same buyer. Alternatively,
ﬁrms may go from being engaged marginally and intermittently in export/import
activity to sourcing foreign goods and services and exporting to the global markets as
part of the core business.

   Upgrading (stage 3, ﬁgure 4.7) will rely on capabilities of handling greater ﬁrm size
and complexity, increasingly effective sourcing strategies, and more sophisticated
learning. An increase in ﬁrms’ average size and productivity through more abundant

      capital and skills use is important for upgrading (Bustos 2011). Greater product com-
      plexity can be achieved by reinforcing intermediate management layers relative to
      plant workers (Caliendo et al. 2015). Sourcing is also key for upgrading. As part of this
      process, the organization of procurement practices and sourcing becomes an integral
      part of a ﬁrm’s strategy and an increasingly important part of its competitive advan-
      tage (Antràs and Yeaple 2014). It matters not only which country you source from but
      also which domestic supplier links you create (Fieler, Eslava, and Xu 2014). On both
      the buying and the selling sides, feedback loops are strong for ﬁrms that manage to
      upgrade. On the selling side, connection to demanding and reﬁned customers sup-
      ports such learning (Fieler, Eslava, and Xu 2014). These have high standards of quality
      and delivery, and accordingly engage in deep relationship development with their
      suppliers. Selling to such customers already leads to upgrading inputs and skills, but
      the ﬁrm’s ability to absorb quickly new technology and know-how, and to improve
      quality, determines the difference in performance relative to competitors (Costinot,
      Vogel, and Wang 2011).

          The more ﬁrms upgrade toward the most mature stages of GVC production (stage 4,
      ﬁgure 4.7), the more they are in direct relation with, or become themselves, lead ﬁrms,
      turnkey suppliers, trading platforms, or global buyers. The two core capabilities of
      ﬁrms in the mature stage of GVCs are organizational capital and the ability to align
      own and buyer product market development and procurement strategies (or strategies
      of vertical and horizontal integration, within and across the boundaries of the ﬁrm).
      A most deﬁning element for MNEs is the type of ownership (Yeaple 2013). Here core
      competences acquire a bias toward organizational capital because MNEs are deﬁned by
      their broad spectrum of goods in manufacturing and services. Firms at this stage of
      engagement narrowly focus on core competences, which characteristically involves
      a strong focus on R&D, quality, brand, and strategies of vertical and horizontal integra-
      tion (Di Comite, Thisse, and Vandenbussche 2014); and their comparative advantage
      will be based on offering highly specialized products (goods, services, and business
      models) at the technology frontier (Schott 2004). Of course, productive knowledge also
      matters, but this is applied so broadly across industries and products that product-
      speciﬁc expertise is not the deﬁning capability of these ﬁrms anymore.

          Such strong interdependence between buyers and suppliers comes with large ben-
      eﬁts for all parties concerned. Suppliers connect to the most technologically relevant
      buyers with a large learning potential and virtuous feedback loops through direct
      and indirect exposure to new ways of managing and organizing production
      (Kee 2015). Product complexity also increases, with products themselves being both
      more elaborate and containing more value added, often in the form of embedded
      services and sophisticated technology (Kee and Tang 2016). From the skills perspec-
      tive, companies increasingly specialize in nonroutine tasks (while outsourcing rou-
      tine ones), and such nonroutine tasks become the key comparative advantage of
      the ﬁrm and increasingly central in the ﬁrm’s organization. In fact, they are the

worker-level reﬂection of a more complex organizational culture and structure, with
multiple layers of high and middle management, where very specialized skills are
transmitted through on-the-job learning and formal and informal training (Caliendo,
Monte, and Rossi-Hansberg 2015). This is accompanied by functional upgrading,
which is the process of altering the set of functions in which the ﬁrm is engaged. It
involves increasing the set of functions the ﬁrm is doing and/or abandoning others,
and it notably includes moving beyond purely production activities to more service-
intensive and organizational tasks, like marketing, ﬁnance, innovation, product
development, and so on.

Notes
 1. Because of these two competing effects, Aghion et al. (2005) suggest that the relationship between
    innovation and competition follows an inverted U shape. See also Hashmi (2011) for the U-shape
    relationship revisited.
 2. Data that track managerial performance over time for a consistent set of ﬁrms are generally
    unavailable, but an approximation for the degree of managerial quality over the life cycle can be
    based on the age of ﬁrms in each survey cross-section.
 3. To name just two titans in late industrializing management history: Godai Tomoatsu, the father
    of Japanese industry, was one of a handful of Satsuma students who, against imperial law, studied
    in the United Kingdom to learn Western techniques. Dorabji Tata, a major founder of the Tata
    group in India, studied at Cambridge.
 4. An empirical literature deals with the impact of increased openness on technology adoption
    indirectly by analyzing the impact of trade reform and increased imports on productivity.
    The main ﬁnding is that trade reform increases productivity by enabling ﬁrms to adopt better
    technologies thanks to cheaper imports, or by increasing competition. See Amiti and Konings
    (2007) for Indonesia, Kasahara and Rodriguez (2008) and Kasahara and Lapham (2013) for
    Chile, Luong (2011) for Mexico, and Muendler (2004), Schor (2004), and Cirera et al. (2015)
    for Brazil.
 5. See Clerides, Lach, and Tybout (1998) for a deﬁnition of learning by exporting. Silva, Africano,
    and Afonso (2010) provide a detailed survey of the literature on learning by exporting. Further,
    Martins and Yang (2009) provide a meta-analysis for 33 empirical studies testing the hypothesis
    that ﬁrms become more productive after entering export markets.
 6. Sutton (2007) develops a general equilibrium model where country capabilities are the core ele-
    ment of competition, and different costs and quality advantages determine market structure and
    incomes. In this model, the ability of countries to develop or accumulate these capabilities to
    compete in quality is a key determinant of their income per capita.

                                      PART II
            Government Capabilities and Policy

The evidence presented in part I of this report describes the nature of innovation in
developing countries, the elements that explain the innovation paradox, and the criti-
cal role of managerial and organizational practices as a key innovation capability. In
this second part, the report focuses on how governments can better support the accu-
mulation and development of innovation capabilities. This requires confronting what
we label the innovation policy dilemma: for developing countries, the greater magnitude
of the market failures to be resolved and the multiplicity of missing complementary
factors and institutions increase the complexity of innovation policy, at the same time
that governments’ capabilities to design, implement, and coordinate an effective policy
mix to manage these failures and gaps are weaker.

   Part II proposes a set of principles for agencies and the design of instruments to
overcome this innovation policy dilemma. Chapter 6 describes a set of key principles
for innovation policy making, and discusses how to strengthen policy capacity and
agencies to effectively implement policies that enable ﬁrms to climb the capabilities
escalator. Chapter 7 discusses the set of instruments that can facilitate the accumula-
tion of innovation capabilities at different stages of technological development and,
more important, the process through which the policy mix should be developed.
6. Supporting Innovation: Agencies
   and Government Capability


Introduction: The Innovation Policy Dilemma in Developing Countries
The previous chapters have established that countries farther from the frontier are
more likely to lack critical innovation complementary factors across many markets
and, in particular, ﬁrm capabilities. The logical extension of the innovation paradox is
then why, given the potentially high returns, governments do not more actively engage
in redressing these shortfalls.

   Arguably, the answer is found in the fact that, while this increasing number of
market and institutional failures in poorer countries augments the complexity of inno-
vation policy, government ability to manage it decreases. As with ﬁrm capabilities,
government capabilities are weaker farther from the frontier. This has often led to the
absence of innovation on the policy agenda, ill-considered mimicking of advanced
country institutional setups that may not respond to local issues, and, more generally,
poor execution.

   The chapter discusses some key principles, processes, and lessons to strengthen the
capabilities needed in innovation agencies to develop an effective policy mix that
supports innovation. It draws substantially on speciﬁc examples from recent evalua-
tions using the Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) in Science, Technology, and
Innovation (STI) that have been implemented by the World Bank in a few Latin
American countries (see box 6.1).

Core Elements of Good Innovation Policy Making
Governments require capabilities for policy making across four key dimensions:

   1.   Rationale and design of policy
   2.   Efﬁcacy of implementation
   3.   Coherence of policies across the National Innovation System (NIS)
   4.   Policy consistency and predictability over time

   The chapter takes up each of these in turn. Each dimension requires a set of govern-
ment competencies in terms of human capital and policy processes that need to be
built over time. The ﬁrst refers to the ability to identify market failures and design



                                                                                           113
          BOX 6.1
         The Public Expenditure Review of Innovation Policy
         The Public Expenditure Review (PER) on Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) is an integrated
         and holistic evaluation of STI policies by the World Bank to help countries improve the quality of
         their policy making in innovation and allocate public resources to innovation more efﬁciently and
         effectively (see Correa, 2014, for an overview). By supporting the adoption of good practices in
         design, implementation, and coordination of innovation policy instruments, the PER facilitates
         strengthening the innovation policy mix, eliminating redundancies, and leveraging complementari-
         ties across the portfolio of instruments.
              Speciﬁcally, the PER evaluates four stages of innovation policy interventions:

             1. General evaluation of the quality and coherence of the policy mix based on the
                conditions of the country and its innovation system, including the portfolio mapping of STI
                programs and their assessment based on the coherence with existing innovation policy
                objectives
             2. Evaluation of the quality of design, implementation, and governance (functional
                analysis) of existing instruments based on good practices
             3. Evaluation of the efﬁciency of existing instruments, meaning their ability to produce
                the expected outputs with reasonable levels of resources
             4. Evaluation of the effectiveness of existing instruments and the system, by analyz-
                ing their ability to generate the desired impact

         Unlike traditional PERs, in the PER STI the unit of analysis is the individual innovation policy instru-
         ment, which allows evaluators to identify what is spent and with what objectives, as well as
         efﬁciency and effectiveness at a more detailed level.




      appropriate policies. The second requires policy makers to be able to implement
      policies effectively, including evaluating, adapting, and modifying or terminating poli-
      cies when needed. The third demands the ability to take an overview of the overall
      system and coordinate across ministries. The fourth needs policies that can maintain
      focus on the innovation agenda over time, overcoming ﬂuctuations in political econ-
      omy. None of these capabilities is easy to generate or maintain.

      Rationale and Design of Innovation Policy

      Designing policies appropriate to the local context requires a solid diagnostic of a
      problem to be redressed. Treating innovation policy in a systemic context does not
      imply that policy should be made by “organogram”—importing the same institutional
      boxes found in advanced country organizational maps (see Rodrik 2008; Andrews
      2015; Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock 2013, 2017). Rather, as chapter 3 highlights,
      innovation can be low because of failures in many markets, some unrelated to the
      problems commonly facing advanced countries. Hence, a substantial effort is necessary
      to guarantee that policy solutions are aimed at the correct problem.

Market Failures
In the neoclassical tradition, policy is directed to resolving identiﬁed market failures.
This both disciplines policy and informs its design. The traditional justiﬁcation of
innovation policy is based on some key market failures in knowledge markets (Arrow
1962; Nelson 1959):

   1. Knowledge as a public good, spillovers, appropriability, and indivisibility.
      Knowledge shares some characteristics of public goods, such as nonexclusivity in
      consumption or nonexcludability in its use, which prevents agents that develop
      it from fully appropriating all the beneﬁts generated. In other cases, innovation
      activities can generate positive technological or knowledge externalities or spillovers
      in other ﬁrms in the same cluster or location, such as the diffusion of a new
      technology, which also cannot be fully appropriated by the innovator. In addition,
      some of the knowledge investments needed for innovation are indivisible and
      may require large up-front investments that ﬁrms may not be able to do or afford
      by themselves.
   2. Imperfect and asymmetric information. High uncertainty around the
      development, implementation, and commercialization of knowledge can
      generate signiﬁcant information asymmetries1 that result in lack of adequate
      ﬁnancing of these activities or lack of ability to develop innovation projects.
   3. Coordination failures. More generally, there can be signiﬁcant coordination
      failures among actors in a system. As discussed in chapter 3, ﬁrms do not innovate
      alone and require the availability of complementary factors. In some cases, ﬁrms
      could coordinate their efforts in the provision of speciﬁc services such as
      certiﬁcation or technology extension, but large information asymmetries prevent
      them from coordinating their efforts.

   4. Missing or underdeveloped markets. In many developing countries, some of the
      important inputs needed to build ﬁrm capabilities, such as technical skills or
      business development services (BDS), are likely to be missing in the market.

   Most innovation policies in advanced countries are driven by the need to resolve
one or more of these failures. The ﬁrst set of failures related to the characteristics of
knowledge as a public good were developed in the context of a linear view of innova-
tion that puts science and research and development (R&D) at the center stage, and
that looks at innovation as primarily invention and technology generation. Although
these are still important justiﬁcations for innovation policy, as introduced in part I, the
ﬁrst stage of the capabilities escalator is about developing the capabilities to be able to
adopt existing technologies and knowledge and imitate existing product characteristics
and attributes. In this context, some of these market failures, especially regarding
imperfect and asymmetric information, can be more accentuated in countries farther
away from the technological frontier.

      False Failures: Lessons from the Expanded NIS
      Figure 3.4 in chapter 3 suggests that low rates of innovation may be driven by failures
      in any number of markets working directly or through complementary factors. Firms
      may not innovate, not because of appropriation externalities, but because of weak ﬁrm
      capabilities, capital markets that do not permit longer-term borrowing, labor market
      barriers to reorganizing the workplace when new techniques are introduced, product
      market regulations or unfair playing ﬁelds that stiﬂe demand. Alternatively, trade bar-
      riers may prohibit the import of necessary complementary machinery, or training pro-
      grams may not be available to provide complementary labor. Hence, developing
      countries need to be especially careful in ensuring that they are solving the true prob-
      lem and not simply assume a diagnosis common in advanced countries.

      Systemic Failures
      The NIS literature has expressed skepticism about the market failure approach and sees
      the innovation system as an array of interactions between ﬁrms and entrepreneurs—
      with bounded rationality—and institutions that are in constant evolution.2 This
      approach is extremely useful in encouraging governments to think systematically about
      how a variety of necessary elements interact and need to be considered when designing
      innovation policies, much as chapter 3 encourages us to do.3

          This report does not attempt to conclusively resolve the differences in these two
      approaches. Rather, it stresses that they cover a lot of common ground. Both accept
      the centrality of the ﬁrm and the importance of complementarities with factors of
      production and institutions to foster innovation activities (Maloney 2017). Many sys-
      temic issues can be recast through the lens of information asymmetries and coordina-
      tion failures. For example, weak ﬁrm capabilities are seen in the NIS literature as
      reﬂecting systemic failures. These, in turn, may be manifestations of classic market
      failures: if ﬁnancial markets are not lending for upgrading activities in SMEs, or if
      ﬁrms lack credible benchmarking of their managerial capabilities, an information
      asymmetry needs to be resolved. Infrastructure failures, such as missing research cen-
      ters or quality certiﬁcation (see chapter 7 for a more detailed description of these
      instruments)4 can also be recast as problems of appropriability or coordination.
      Network failures again may be a problem of coordination among multiple actors, or
      information issues.5

          These market failures, however, may in fact be much larger than those customar-
      ily assumed in the mainstream approach and hence justify the special emphases
      received in the systems literature. We can argue, as in the next chapter, that weak ﬁrm
      capabilities may be the result of asymmetric information (not knowing how to accu-
      mulate capabilities) or poorly functioning ﬁnancial markets, but this does not in any
      way minimize the divergence from the standard view—that these are rational actors
      with full information—that such failures imply. Resolving them may be a very large
      task indeed.6



116                                                                        The Innovation Paradox
Working around Weak State Capability
A second reason for focusing on understanding the problem rather than on importing
an institution from an advanced country organogram is that the agencies and minis-
tries executing innovation policy are limited in their capabilities and this constrains the
feasible set of policy measures to be taken. Hence, the public policy problem is how to
resolve a documented failure subject to government capability constraints.

    Clearly, improving the diagnostic, design, and execution capabilities of the gov-
ernment increases the set of possible policies. Unfortunately, the record on doing
this is not encouraging. Some have even seen adverse outcomes from top-down
initiatives where “a government succeeds in passing laws or creating new boxes in
organization charts or declaring new administrative processes, but these ‘reforms’
are frequently not implemented or used” (Andrews and Pritchett, 2013, p. 1; see
also Andrews 2013; Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock 2013). Furthermore, adding
a steady supply of development aid or other finance triggered by nominal advances
toward best practices can lead to “capability traps” where reforms are permanently
ongoing but advances in functionality are small. Andrews, Pritchett, and Woolcock
(2013) stress the perils of “isomorphic mimicry,” where the outward forms of
functional states and organizations are adopted to camouflage a persistent lack of
function.

   The critics of such top-down approaches stress that efforts to build capabilities
should aim to solve problems in the local context as nominated and prioritized by local
actors. These proponents of Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA) prescribe
experimentation with solutions to problems with iterative feedback, while engaging a
broad set of actors in the ﬁrst instance to ensure a given reform’s viability and rele-
vance, but in the second instance as a key part of a scaling strategy (Andrews, Pritchett,
and Woolcock 2017). Here again, identifying the particular failure that needs to be
remedied is the starting point of this iterative process.

   The limitations of transplanting foreign good practices do not mean that those good
practices are uninformative and should be rejected. First, good practices contain much
insight into the kinds of incentives and design features that in other contexts have gen-
erated successful interventions. The diagnostics may often be similar, and the mecha-
nisms proposed to remedy are potential building blocks for local policies. Second, it is
not always so easy to identify what the relevant problems are. As Rodrik (2004) notes,
the information ﬂow from the private sector to policy makers is often poor. Where they
exist, large business associations may represent only a small part of the private sector
(not SMEs, for example). Careful surveys and focus groups can help, but, more funda-
mentally, ﬁrms often do not know what they do not know (see ﬁgure 7.5 in the next
chapter). For example, the ubiquitous response that “taxes are too high” as the greatest
obstacle to growth by ﬁrms with truly rudimentary management practices suggests a
limited understanding of what is needed to improve ﬁrms’ performance.



Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                     117
          Finally, there may be several ways of resolving identiﬁed failures, and the best
      solution may depend on the context. For example, Camagni and Capello (2013) ﬁnd
      that standard European innovation policies, such as R&D funding, facilitating foreign
      direct investment, or encouraging private-public R&D collaboration, among others,
      produce differing results across countries. Letting policy makers experiment and adapt
      on the basis of ongoing evaluation is most likely to allow for the evolution of appropri-
      ate solutions.

      Managing High Levels of Complexity When Governments
      Lack the Capability to Do So
      Although this governance dilemma has no simple resolution, there are several design
      lessons (see also box 6.2) that can be drawn to minimize policy failure.

          Reducing failure dimensionality. The more complex the innovation project the
      more likely it is to fail. Although the NIS sketched in ﬁgure 3.4 suggests the large num-
      ber of markets that need to function to maximize the returns from technological catch-
      up, minimizing to the degree possible the number of components of a particular
      initiative offers a higher probability of policy success. In early phases, a policy package
      focusing on raising ﬁrm capabilities while improving access to longer-term capital may
      be sufﬁcient to generate substantial productivity gains (see chapter 7).

         Good Innovation Policy Design Checklist
         The project management and innovation literatures identiﬁes the following key dimensions of
         good innovation policy design (RIME). These are evaluated in the PER review process.

             1. Rationale:
                ■   Is there a documented market or system failure to be addressed?
                ■   Is there a clear statement of goals, beneﬁciaries, and measurable outcomes?
                ■   How will the proposed solution interact with the rest of the policy mix?
                ■   Does the proposed solution take into account how local context may make an alterna-
                    tive policy more efﬁcient?
                ■   Does the measure consider the relative strengths of the public and private sectors?
                ■   Has the proposed solution anticipated potential capture in its design?
             2. Intervention model:
                ■   Is there a logical model integrating theory, assumptions, and how inputs lead to out-
                    comes and impacts?

             3. Monitoring and evaluation methods:
                ■ Are there monitoring and evaluation (M&E) approaches and systems set up at the
                  design stage?
                ■ Are there clear procedures for M&E feedback to inform the evolution of policy?

   Weigh the relative strengths of markets and government (see, for example, Wu and
Ramesh 2014). Choosing policies that minimize the need for high bureaucratic
capabilities may lead to second-best design but better outcomes. In this regard, relying
on private sector provision of services where possible or public-private partnerships and
employing the capabilities of the latter can reduce the demands on the government.

    Experiment with external services if domestic capabilities do not yet exist. Often
the supply of services will be limited until a market is established. For instance, Italy
drew on U.S. providers of extension services after World War II, and Singapore hired
the Japanese Productivity Center to set up its ﬁrm upgrading program (See chapter 7).
Another country recognized that it lacked the managerial capability to successfully
staff a venture capital program and bought a share in a San Francisco venture capital
fund with the understanding that its portfolio would include a large number of local
projects.

   Employ market incentives where feasible. In cases where government is required
to redress a failure, for instance in ﬁrm upgrading or training schemes, employing
market-type incentives is likely to lead to better allocation of resources. For example,
the design of ﬁnancing mechanisms is critical—whatever the subsidies the govern-
ment provides, the marginal costs of training or extension policies should be paid by
the beneﬁciaries so that the policy clearly fails if its beneﬁciaries do not subscribe.
Several such mechanisms are discussed in more detail in the agencies section below.

    Design to avoid capture. The likelihood of policy capture is also higher in coun-
tries with less established institutions, ﬂedgling ability to monitor, and weaker
autonomy so that mechanisms are necessary to prevent it. Science and technology
ministries are often heavily lobbied by academic departments that lack a vision of
how their research will help industry to achieve productivity growth. Countrywide
training programs can become politically useful as “universities of the poor,” but may
be unaligned with private sector needs. Innovation support programs can often be
captured by the same set of ﬁrms, some of which may be already performing R&D
and innovation activities with little or no additionality from public funding. Having
a broad set of actors supporting the design of such policies can be a mechanism for
minimizing capture. For example, private sector participation on boards of directors
or research institutions can help guide the overall direction toward industry collabo-
ration.7 Or, given that the academic community in many emerging countries is
small and interconnected, research proposals may be vetted outside of the country.
Market mechanisms in allocation aids in transparency and responsiveness.


The Need for Evaluating and Learning8
The previous discussion highlights the importance for policy design of a dynamic
feedback loop, from design to implementation to evaluation and back to design.
Building in an impact evaluation from the inception of the program, especially for


Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                   119
      policy instruments that are considered experimental or small-scale9 pilot versions for
      informing future full-size or longer-term policies, will aid in programs design, and
      facilitate the termination of unsuccessful ones. Further, given that imported policies
      may function differently in the local context, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) also
      is important to tune up or locally test successful policies. For example, matching
      grants for innovative projects in Finland may have proved very successful in resolving
      the appropriation failure while encouraging collaboration among different agents in
      the system (Czarnitzki, Ebersberger, and Fier 2007). However, evaluations suggest that
      such approaches have not always been successful in developing countries (Campos
      et al. 2012) or in improving ﬁrm performance (see, for example, Becker 2015).

         Evaluation can also provide a useful check on the political economy forces leading
      to the fragmentation and duplication of policies identiﬁed above, and helps instill a
      culture of justiﬁcation and evaluation that encourages a more transparent and profes-
      sional innovation policy.

          Again, weak government capabilities can limit the impact of evaluations. First, they
      require high-level human capital to be implemented properly and specialized units to
      distill the main ﬁndings and integrate what is learned into policy design. Ideally evalua-
      tion departments should evolve to “perform six types of brokering activities: identifying
      knowledge users’ needs, acquiring credible knowledge, feeding it to users, building net-
      works between producers and users, accumulating knowledge over time and promoting
      an evidence-based culture” (Olejniczak, Raimondo, and Kupiec 2016; p. 1).10 Hence, the
      evaluation function becomes tightly integrated with the design and information dissemi-
      nations tasks. Partnering with external academia or multilateral agencies with installed
      capacity can help kick-start the evaluation agenda. Over time, the evolving network can
      offset the fact that, in practice, policy makers often cannot recognize the value of the feed-
      back, and evaluation results are often underutilized in decision making.11

          Critically, a greater embedding of evaluation can also ensure that policies are not
      only started but are also continued or terminated for solid empirical reasons (Teirlinck
      et al. 2013). Often, these decisions are driven more by ideological concerns, pressures
      from interest groups, or perceptions of program ineffectiveness than as the result of
      analytical performance assessment (Krause, Yi, and Feiock 2016). Programs survive for
      decades with no demonstration of efﬁcacy. Proof of this can be found in the myriad
      instruments in many countries with budgets below US$100,000, a scale precluding any
      meaningful impact. Ongoing evaluation thus provides discipline in constructing and
      pruning the policy mix.

          In sum, the design of the appropriate policies requires several elements (an example
      of design challenges facing even a good innovation policy performer is given in box 6.3).
      An empirical diagnostic can consider the possibility of false failures and show how

inputs, activities, and outputs lead to outcomes and impacts, and affect speciﬁc stake-
holders and audiences. Policy design also should reﬂect lessons from existing evidence
and a consideration of the capabilities of the private and public sector agencies involved
in executing the policy. A strategy for considering the views of targeted beneﬁciaries
and procedures to minimizing capture are also necessary. Measurement and experi-
mentation with iterative feedback should be used to modify the intervention in an
ongoing fashion (see Dutz et al. 2014 for a description of learning and experimentation
in innovation policy.) This is facilitated by having from the onset of the policy a clear,
logical framework that lays out the problem to be solved, how the intervention is sup-
posed to work, why it is preferred to plausible alternatives, how success will be mea-
sured, and how feedback from evaluations will alter design over time.

Implementing Innovation Policy Effectively

As is the case in the private sector, design and planning must be followed by effective
implementation and this, too, tends to lag in developing countries. Many of the
issues important for implementation are not speciﬁc to innovation but are rather

   Challenges in Innovation Policy Design in Latin America
   Evaluations using the PER methodology (see box 6.1 for a description) of STI policies implemented
   in a few Latin American countries suggest that design is the weakest element in innovation policy.
   Figure B6.3.1 summarizes the quality of design, implementation, and governance of the innovation
   policy mix in a good innovation policy performer. Each dimension is evaluated on a scale from
   1 to 5, with 5 indicating the full adoption of a good practice. Although this country shows the high-
   est innovation design quality in the region, two key weaknesses emerge in the design stage,
   which are common in most countries in the region:
       ■   The design lacks a fully developed logical model and articulated theory of change for the
           different instruments. How the intervention is supposed to work is not fully articulated and
           there are no clear and measurable objectives, which makes monitoring difﬁcult and evalu-
           ation of whether the policy is having the desired impact challenging.
       ■   Some policies have ad hoc justiﬁcations and are not based on robust diagnostic exercises
           of the main market failures.
        Another common weakness is the failure to consider alternative instruments and mechanisms
   of intervention. The typical procedure for design among program managers is to adopt existing

                                                                        (Box continues on the following page.)

      mechanisms from other countries, especially in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
      Development (OECD), instead of looking at the local problem and assessing the different instru-
      ment possibilities.
           The PER reveals that most mechanisms of intervention—up to 80 percent—used to support
      innovation projects are matching grants, highlighted in ﬁgure B6.3.2. It is very unlikely that match-
      ing grants are the mechanism of intervention to optimally address most innovation failures, espe-
      cially if they are not tightly linked to technical assistance, given the large information asymmetry
      and lack of knowledge in SMEs to implement innovation projects.
           A ﬁnal important weakness in these countries is the lack of appropriate M&E frameworks and
      impact evaluations. Many innovation programs lack a well-deﬁned, logical framework that could
      inform M&E efforts. In addition, impact evaluation in innovation programs is in a very early stage,
      with only a handful of evaluations available for the whole Latin American region.

part of a larger agenda of improving public sector management, a topic too vast for
this volume. However, the new public management strand of the public policy and
administration literature has emphasized performance management, and in par-
ticular issues of measurement and tracking, as key for public policy implementa-
tion.12 This is primarily because there is evidence that the application of good
management practices in government can produce beneﬁts. An early meta-analysis
of 70 studies ﬁnds that the adoption of management by objectives, an early version
of performance management, had a positive impact in public and private sectors
(Rodgers and Hunter 1992). A more recent study supported the notion that proper
implementation of performance management improves education outcomes
(Sun and Van Ryzin 2014). Application in the context of developing countries has
also showed positive results (Rasul and Rogger 2017).

   The key practices that can improve the efﬁciency of policy management and
contribute to effective implementation, and which are used to evaluate the quality of
innovation policy management in PERs, can be divided into three main dimensions:
(1) learning, (2) tools for implementation, and (3) quality of managerial practices
(box 6.4).

      Learning and Adaptation
      As discussed earlier, measuring and evaluating are critical for designing effective
      innovation policy. However, an appropriate learning system is also key for verifying
      efﬁcacy of implementation and ensuring that knowledge generated in M&E systems
      and impact evaluations is preserved and that policy lessons are learned. The key pro-
      cesses to ensure effective learning are documentation of experiences and decisions to
      adapt to new circumstances, identiﬁcation of challenges for implementation that were
      not addressed in the original design, documentation of the speciﬁc solutions that

         The Good Implementation Model of Innovation Policy: A Checklist

            1. Learning
               a. Knowledge management. Clearly deﬁne knowledge management systems and provide
                  codiﬁed and accessible information.
            2. Policy tool implementation
               a. Solicitations and project management. When solicitations and calls for proposals are
                  not originally planned, provide a good justiﬁcation and explanation of how changes
                  align to the original plan.
               b. Participant selection practices. Disseminate criteria for selection ex ante, deﬁne the
                  appeal mechanism, and provide for evaluation by external experts.
               c. Application procedures. Requirements to apply should be easy to understand, and
                  documentation requirements should be minimal, focusing on what is necessary for
                  the program.
               d. Program information management. Digital database with all the information on appli-
                  cants should be systematized and accessible.
               e. Finalization of participation in the program. Establish ex ante when a beneﬁciary’s
                  participation in a speciﬁc policy support program ends, and ensure that the end is con-
                  nected to an assessment of the achievement of the policy’s goals and that collection

            3. Management Quality
               a. Budgeting. Provide resources that are sufﬁcient to implement a policy and support the
                  desired level of beneﬁciaries, without cutting the quality of services.
               b. Organization management. Clearly deﬁne the management structure, with a small
                  number of layers between decision making and implementation.
               c. Role deﬁnition and autonomy. Deﬁne clear roles for management and supervision
                  positions, and ensure technical autonomy for design and implementation to limit
                  political interference.

            d. Human resources and training. Allocate talent to the most appropriate task, and
               provide adequate internal and external training opportunities.
            e. Incentives management. Introduce performance-based rewards as well as adequate
               accountability.
            f. Process monitoring. Ensure that processes are monitored accordingly, facilitated by
               central information systems.
            g. Program monitoring and evaluation. Ensure that M&E frameworks are in place and
               used, and that data on inputs, products, and outcomes are collected.

   a. Project performance assessment during the funding period is rarely factored into decisions to end the participation of
   grant awardees. Some large grant programs are the exception. Multiyear funding of research facilities often includes the
   appointment of expert review panels that may recommend termination of funding if performance does not meet minimum
   requirements. Conditions and procedures of termination or discontinuation are a recommended practice in funding
   mechanisms since they avoid wasting resources when it becomes clear that the activity will not meet minimum expectations.
   Furthermore, without such predetermined criteria and procedures, program managers and the funding organization may face
   legal challenges when addressing wasteful use of resources by participants. An example of termination conditions that in
   principle apply to all grant funding may be found in U.S. National Science Foundation 2016.




were adopted and of the problems that remain, and relevant data showing how the
solution improved performance. This learning capability is especially important in
many developing countries, where rotation of civil servants is the norm because of
political changes and human resource policies, which severely constrains institutional
memory and learning. Learning is not conﬁned to the implementation of individual
policy instruments, but rather is a component of the entire organization and a feature
of its culture.

Tools for Implementation
Innovation policies are heavily dependent on grant funding schemes with a com-
mon basic structure. They involve the design and publication of a solicitation or
request for proposals that contains basic information about the type of projects to
be funded, level of funding, participant eligibility criteria, and application proce-
dures and requirements. This needs to be done in a way that maximizes participa-
tion from the desired beneﬁciaries. Too often, however, application procedures
require excessive documentation or cumbersome application forms, which imply
signiﬁcant costs for applicants and act as a deterrent to apply for government sup-
port. Thus, in some countries some consultants have specialized in ﬁlling applica-
tions, which can result in these programs being captured by those same ﬁrms that

      have developed a good understanding of the application processes or that have
      hired these consultants.

          Avoiding this capture and reaching out to the main policy beneﬁciaries requires
      light application processes, with clear and transparent requirements that are evaluated
      by externally qualiﬁed evaluators with previously designed appeal mechanisms.
      Ensuring good quality evaluation of projects and applications is often challenging in
      developing countries because of a lack of local capacity. As suggested in the next section,
      cooperation with international partners can facilitate access to external experts for the
      evaluation process.


      Management Quality
      Effective management requires appropriate ﬁnancial and human resources. Regarding
      the latter, human resource policy is key. Favero, Meier, and O’Toole (2016) show that
      best practices in internal management, namely, setting goals for staff, building trust
      with employees, meaningful feedback, and employee motivation, among others, have
      measurable effects on the outcomes of policies. Jacobson and Sowa (2015) show in
      the context of municipal governments how strategic human resource management
      (SHRM) has signiﬁcant effects on performance.13 Human resource practices signal
      management’s commitment to employees and breed trust. Practices that focus on
      autonomy, compensation, communication, performance appraisal, and career devel-
      opment are associated with trust in public organizations (Cho and Poister 2013).
      More important, having good incentives is key for bringing innovation into the
      public sector (Borins 2008) in terms of process improvement and creating value in
      the services provided (Moore 2013).

          This human resource management is often missing in developing countries
      (see Finan, Olken, and Pande 2015 for an overview), but it is critical for attracting
      staff with some degree of industry expertise. In most developing countries, poor
      human resource policies, significant wage differentials between the public and
      private sectors, and large turnover in public management positions severely con-
      strain the recruitment of the talent needed to design and implement innovation
      policies. As we will see in the next section, some innovation agencies have
      addressed this challenge by having different governance status than line minis-
      tries, which enables them to pay higher wages and attract talent.

         These weaknesses undermine innovation policy effectiveness (box 6.5 provides
      examples from Latin America) because, as Rasul and Rogger (2017) show in the case of
      Nigeria, good project management practices impact the quality of the outcomes
      achieved. The good news is that the evidence from PER exercises suggests great hetero-
      geneity in policy quality within countries and even within agencies. There are good
      practices in many agencies, which therefore can be leveraged for improving worse-
      performing programs.

     BOX 6.5
   Weak Implementation in Latin America: Lessons from the PERs
   Several challenges have been identiﬁed when evaluating the quality of implementation of
   innovation policies in Latin America.
       ■    The lack of an M&E system in the early stages of policy formation cascades into a lack of
            implementation of monitoring both of implementation processes and of policy instrument
            performance. Impact evaluation is in its inception in most countries, and there are few
            specialized units of evaluation or formal learning processes. Evaluation is thought of
            mostly as an auditing or legitimizing tool applied at the tail end of policy implementation.
            Little attention is paid to the complementarity of external and internal evaluation to
            maximize learning and improvement, as opposed to ﬁnal adjudication of effects and wor-
            thiness of the policy as a whole.
       ■    The quality and use of documentation for improving instrument management is low. In
            general, documentation is formulaic rather than practical, and is rarely included system-
            atically in internal reviews of performance progress. The use of information and com-
            munications technology is limited and below potential, given the availability of standard
            systems. It is often difﬁcult to share information across programs and agencies.
       ■    The appropriate management of human resources and accounting of administrative costs
            per intervention is another challenge. In general, incentives for staff are not aligned with
            the performance of the policy instruments they manage. Furthermore, the resources of an
            agency are pooled across many policy instruments with varying relations to each other and
            distributed in temporary patterns that respond to short-term bureaucratic priorities. Thus,
            the true administrative costs of each instrument are unknown, making it almost impossi-
            ble to improve management efﬁciency.

Coherence

To say that policy is coherent is to say that policy solutions match the diagnosis of the
problem, target populations and beneﬁciaries are clearly connected to the public good
beneﬁts that the policy is to address, the focus and resources pertaining to the instru-
ments match policy objectives, and the elements of the policy mix reinforce rather than
duplicate or offset each other. In practice, however, such coherence is often violated as
policy instruments evolve by accretion in multiple interactions and budget negotia-
tions or are driven by the political considerations discussed above.

Need for Effective Coordination
The need for coherence extends both horizontally across the government and vertically
within ministries. Chapter 7 lays out a set of programs to support progressively more
sophisticated capabilities, beginning with basic managerial extension and training


Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                                  127
      programs, and moving up, for instance, to technology centers and institutes. Singapore’s
      ladder of programs is a good example of a well-articulated and coherent set of programs
      seamlessly resolving the market failures facing progressively more sophisticated ﬁrms.
      The initial interface with the ﬁrms is a costless diagnostic of ﬁrm performance and
      approved consulting services work, up to S$20,000. This is intended to resolve the ini-
      tial information market failures about own capability and the quality of providers.
      It also provides the government information on likely growth-potential ﬁrms. More
      specialized services are facilitated in subsequent stages, albeit with fewer subsidies.
      At the top of the pyramid are interactions with specialized government-supported
      research institutes.

          However, in much of the developing world, policies are frequently balkanized,
      lacking coherence across ministries and alignment across instruments. Innovation pol-
      icy is often formally relegated to a ministry of science and technology, which may focus
      resources on nonapplied academic research, with no coordination with the ministry of
      industry’s policies focused on the private sector. Further, political economy consider-
      ations often lead to duplicative and fragmented policies allocated across industries,
      with different agencies tasked by distinct and conﬂicting laws with management of the
      NIS, leading to confusion within the private sector about who is responsible for provid-
      ing support. As box 6.8 later in the chapter shows, governments often focus on, for
      instance, the supply of a particular kind of knowledge without concerning themselves
      with the demand. The section below on agencies discusses some of the mechanisms
      that may help in aligning both sides of the equation.


      Coherence in Allocating Funds to Desired Objectives
      The allocation of funds is the key mechanism to align objectives and link elements of the
      NIS, generate quality outputs, and provide competition, as opposed to establishing privi-
      leged actors in the system. This is often not the case. For instance, the evidence uncovered
      in the PER exercise reveals a major incongruity between policy statements and the actual
      budgets across instruments. The stated priorities of innovation policy often mention
      large-scale and long-term goals, such as diversiﬁcation of the economy, establishment of
      a more entrepreneurial and innovative business culture, and strengthening the links
      between various sectors to create synergies. However, the actual expenditures allocated
      do not correspond to these priorities. Figure 6.1 shows previous allocations of STI expen-
      diture by broad economic objective in a Latin American country. Although diversiﬁca-
      tion of the economy was the main objective of innovation policy, most of the allocated
      budget did not support diversiﬁcation.14 The assessments suggest a lack of coherence of
      stated priorities and expenditure commitments, volatility in budget allocations that
      undermine medium- to long-term change and impact processes, disparity in budget
      sizes across programs that do not reﬂect expected efﬁcacy of the instruments, and a lack
      of diversity in the menu of instruments despite the diversity of innovation policy prob-
      lems, reﬂecting inertia from experience with a single instrument.

   Preventing such mismatches occurs at the policy planning process stage, but then
requires ongoing checking against the original objectives and how the program evolves.
Appropriate logical frameworks and stated goals, as well as mid-term reviews of existing
policies, can help to redirect ﬁnancial resources toward stated policy goals. A systematic
overview of instruments and how they ﬁt together coherently is essential.

    More generally, there is the challenge of broader oversight of the system and getting the
various involved ministries to coordinate and enforce coherence. Often, high-level minis-
terial committees are established to this end. However, without a strong mandate from the
public and the highest public ofﬁcials, these committees can degenerate into ineffective
zombie institutions attended by mid-level bureaucrats with no higher-level support.

    A ﬁnal coordination challenge occurs across different levels of government. Local
governments are often less prepared to implement innovation policies and, except for
highly developed regions, do not have a tradition of including innovation objectives
among their policy targets. National policies in developing countries are starting to
address the geographical concentration of innovation capabilities, but the application
of this priority to the speciﬁcs of innovation policy design and implementation is still
challenging and underdeveloped.

Policy Consistency over Time

Building a well-conceptualized, efﬁcient, and coherent innovation system is a project of
decades, if not centuries. The major research universities of the West have accumulated
the human capital, interconnections, and links with the private sector that enable them
to play the role they do over very long periods. Developing a dynamic private sector has
taken the Koreas and Singapores of the world decades of deliberate policies. Establishing
a business consulting industry that can facilitate ﬁrm upgrading and a reputation that

      ﬁrms will trust takes time and effort. Venture capital ﬁrms require both resources and
      ways of supporting managers with experience in high-tech and risky start-ups, which
      are available only when such an industry already exists. In sum, building national
      innovative capacity takes sustained effort and oversight over a long period.

         This implies long-term and predictable ﬁnancial and institutional commitment,
      which is difﬁcult to obtain when policies and ﬁnancing shift with the political cycle. In
      many developing countries, institutions experience frequent leadership changes with
      corresponding changes in innovation policies and strategies. Lack of isolation of even
      very modest STI budget funding from the business cycle implies large volatility of
      innovation budgets and often reductions to the point of inefﬁcacy. Such volatility also
      limits the ability of policy managers to learn from existing instruments, which may
      have no calls for proposals for over a year or two, and then start from zero when the
      budget allocation is more favorable.

          Measures such as ring-fencing budgets or ﬁnancing from dedicated funds can help
      support consistency across time in innovation policy. However, at core, long-term cul-
      tivation and vigilance of the system require broad-based support across the political
      spectrum. Some countries are extremely deliberate about building a consensus around
      innovation policies. In Finland, all new parliamentarians are required to pass through
      a course on the “Finnish Model” to understand previous thinking and coherence. In the
      1980s, Singapore developed a productivity strategy with the help of the Japanese
      Productivity Center meant to build public consciousness around the importance of
      productivity and innovation, spearheaded by high-proﬁle institutions such as SPRING.
      Box 6.6 offers an example from Latin America about how consistent support in the
      political discourse, in this case, the state of the union addresses of the head of state,
      translates into higher innovation indexes and growth.

      Agencies and Institutions to Support Innovation
      Innovation policy is often implemented through institutions dedicated to such tasks as
      public research, ﬁrm support, or ﬁnance. The advantage of such specialized agencies, as

         Innovation and Political Commitment
         Political commitment is important for policy. Calvo-González, Eizmendi, and Reyes (2017) analyze
         political commitment in Latin American countries by looking at state of the nation speeches. The
         authors ﬁnd that, in countries where there is more variance in topics across speeches, there is also
         less growth in income per capita (ﬁgure B6.6.1), suggesting little focus on and commitment to
         existing policies.

        One can use this data on political commitment and analyze how often “innovation” is a topic
   of the speech as a commitment to innovation policies. Figure B6.6.2 shows the correlation for
   selected Latin American countries of the share of “innovation” in these speeches in the 2010s and
   the Global Innovation Index. The results show a clear positive correlation between the proxy of
   political commitment and the degree of innovation of the country.



Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                                                                                131
      opposed to line ministries, is that they can have a clearer mission orientation to focus
      on fewer objectives and at the same time have more independent and ﬂexible structures
      to hire and retain talent. The four dimensions highlighted in the previous section
      remain salient for these supporting institutions.

      Rationale and Design: Deﬁning Their Mission

      As emphasized earlier regarding policies, there is no single successful model for an inno-
      vation agency (Glennie and Bound 2016); what matters is how effective the agency is in
      redressing a perceived failure in the system. Again, many policy makers seek to emulate
      good-practice institutional models observed in countries such as Finland, Israel, or
      Singapore; and certainly there are important design principles that these will share. But
      within these design parameters, local context will ultimately drive the form the agency
      will take.

         To this end, it is central to have a clear justiﬁcation for the institution, and both NIS
      and mainstream literatures focus on the speciﬁc gaps that institutions are designed to ﬁll.
      Edquist (2004) argues that there should be more emphasis on the functions that these
      institutions provide in supporting the innovation ecosystem, such as supporting R&D,
      competence building, incubation, consultancy services, and ﬁnancing of enterprises. The
      mainstream perspective will ask what market failures, such as appropriation externality,
      information asymmetry, or coordination problem need to be resolved in each case.

         As an example, in box 6.7 Link and Scott (2009) identify failures underlying the
      motivation for the several roles of the public research institutions (PRI), one of the
      innovation institutions that form part of the capabilities escalator. Identifying these fail-
      ures forces policy makers to specify the beneﬁciaries and goals. Link and Scott (2009)
      emphasize that PRIs are most likely to be successful when they frame their activities in
      terms of outputs, outcomes, and measured impacts for research projects that address
      market failures. Examples of outputs include contributions to underlying science, devel-
      oped generic technology or infrastructure technology, documented use in industry of
      generic technology or infrastructure technology, intellectual property, and the promul-
      gation of industry standards. Examples of outcomes include industry R&D investment
      decisions, market access and entry decisions, industry cycle time, productivity, market
      penetration of new technology, product quality, product and systems reliability, and
      reduced transaction costs. The impacts are the social beneﬁts, which can be measured
      with metrics such as rates of return, net present values, and beneﬁt-to-cost ratios.

          The problem is that often rationale and success metrics are unclear. Link and Scott
      (2009) were surprised that none of their Latin American case studies seemed to think
      in terms of the outputs and outcomes from public research; hence, it was difﬁcult to
      identify a public good aspect to their research. This is a common problem for this type
      of institution. Historical inertia from a period when PRIs in Eastern Europe served a
      preassigned client, such as a large state-owned enterprise, has made it difﬁcult for some

     BOX 6.7
   The Rationale for Public Research Institutes
   Public Research Institutes (PRIs) are prominent features in most NISs. Link and Scott (2009)
   identify several roles they play, addressing particular market failures:

       1. Advanced technical extension services. PRIs can facilitate technology transfer in sectors
          such as light industry or agriculture when, for example, small ﬁrms face limited appro-
          priability from their investments in new technologies that would provide large external
          beneﬁts to the economy as a whole.
       2. Developing appropriate knowledge to transfer. Institutions such as the U.S. National
          Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) can foster the technology transfer provided
          by extension programs through their knowledge of the key technologies and working
          relationships with the industries supplying the technologies, and can assist the transfer of
          technologies without opportunistic exploitation of small ﬁrms, allowing them to grow as
          independent sources of initiative and growth.
       3. Coordination of research efforts. PRIs can serve as honest brokers, helping to facilitate
          cooperative efforts by industry, universities, and government in research that is subsidized
          by the government (see Hall, Link, and Scott 2003). To play this role, the PRI needs to have
          a research capacity itself. For example, the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) at NIST
          relies on the research capability of NIST to ensure sound oversight of competitions for
          government research funds.
       4. Bridge from basic to applied science. PRIs can facilitate the diffusion of advances from
          research, such as in biotechnology, chemistry, materials science, and pharmaceuticals. In
          many cases, government funds will have been used by universities to develop the basic
          science because the ideas have a strong public good component and there would not have
          been sufﬁcient incentive to develop them without government funding. Once the basic
          science is available, the knowledgeable public research institution with expertise in both
          research and connections to industry can help to disseminate the information widely.
       5. Standards setting. For more advanced countries, PRIs can participate in the development
          of standards, which helps to reduce the risk associated with adopting new technologies.




of them to evolve to supporting SMEs or start-ups. The tendency to import organo-
grams can also imply misalignment of mission with sophistication of the economy.
Without this clarity of mission and outputs, their research is likely to be irrelevant for
the private sector. Further, as Nelson (2005) notes, innovation institutions also need to
evolve over time, and design needs to facilitate the receipt of signals that change is
needed and in which direction.

Ensuring Independence and Preventing Capture
As discussed earlier in this chapter, ensuring responsiveness to the target client and
preventing capture remain central design challenges. Having diverse and, particularly,


Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                                133
      private sector participation on boards of directors contributes to maintaining the
      initial mission and the alignment of goals with the needs of business. For example,
      the 17-member board of Singapore’s ﬁrm upgrading program SPRING comprises
      members from leading private sector companies as well as government ofﬁcials. The
      Malaysian Technology Development Corporation includes three individuals from
      the private sector on its nine-member Board.

          In addition, ensuring substantial independence from government bureaucracy
      can shield agencies from political considerations (Glennie and Bound 2016).
      Robust and transparent governance improves relevance and legitimacy and is an
      important component of accountability. Agency independence can be codified in
      many ways, including legislatively by an act of government, through its founding
      documents, governmental “ownership” structures and reporting lines, or the
      authority afforded to its advisory/management boards as well as the composition
      of its funding bodies.15

          In small countries, the interlocked nature of the elites can undermine this strategy;
      hence, international review can buy additional measures of objectivity. Chile’s research
      funding agencies often present scientiﬁc proposals to international experts for review.
      Finland’s Tekes has its program funding externally reviewed every 3 years. Both are
      countries with above average levels of social capital and relatively transparent processes,
      yet they still rely on these additional guarantees of objectivity to prevent capture.


      Financing Structures and Market Discipline
      As with policy, the design of ﬁnancing and exploiting market forces helps ensure that
      resources are aligned with intended beneﬁciaries, and encourages more transparent, efﬁ-
      cient, and effective decision-making bodies sensitive to ﬁrm needs and longer-term mar-
      ket trends. For example, government support is often best allocated inframarginally
      whereas private sector contributions are best made at the margin: to offset standard
      externalities arising because worker mobility means ﬁrms are unable to capture the full
      value of their training investments, the Penang Skills Center in Malaysia receives
      government funding for equipment and infrastructure; but private ﬁrms pay the indi-
      vidual student fees. Thus, if the private sector does not value the services provided, the
      center will not survive. O’Connell et al. (2017) shows how a version of PRONATEC
      (a technical and vocational training program in Brazil, that explicitly takes input from
      ﬁrms in determining the location and skill content) has much larger employment effects
      than nondemand-driven programs. Colombia’s National Training System (SENA) offers
      a contrasting model in which the government underwrites the full cost of government-
      designed training programs and ﬁrms cannot choose among providers with their man-
      datory training budgets. In the absence of market discipline, ﬁrms complain of poor
      alignment of training classes with corporate needs, and they have no recourse to alter-
      nate providers.


134                                                                          The Innovation Paradox
    This also raises the issue of what the overall subsidy should be, particularly in applied
research institutes. The appropriation externality—that a ﬁrm cannot fully recoup the
beneﬁts of research it may do because other ﬁrms can use the new ideas as well—is often
resolved by having a publicly subsidized research institute undertake the provision of this
public good. At one extreme, many public research institutions in developing countries
enjoy full grant funding by the state, which, combined with unclear missions, offers little
incentive to be relevant to the private sector or pressure for quality control. At the other
extreme, the New Zealand Crown Research Institutes for a while had very little public sec-
tor ﬁnancing, leading them to behave like a private sector consulting ﬁrm and generating
insufﬁcient public goods. The Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) occupies an
intermediate position, where the state provides a third of basal ﬁnancing, another third
comes from competitive grants, and a third comes from private sector contracts. This
helps to guarantee both the quality of public goods and alignment with industry needs.


Implementation: Attracting, Retaining, and Retraining Staff

After clarity of mission, attracting high-quality human capital and motivating it with
well-aligned incentives are critical to meeting output and quality goals. Recruiting staff
with the needed technical skills requires competitive salaries, insulation from political
considerations, and incentive structures that demand excellence.

    In keeping with the greater specialization of agencies that is part of their raison d’être,
staff need to have particular skill sets: innovation agencies in Israel; Taiwan, China; and
the United Kingdom recruit individuals from industry or with particular technical expe-
rience, typically eschewing policy generalists (Glennie and Bound 2016). At a minimum,
front-line staff need to be able to identify private sector providers that can implement
support programs. For example, most extension consultants in the Colombian National
Productivity Center have experience in working with large Colombian ﬁrms or multina-
tional enterprises. Recruiting such staff is more challenging in Africa, for instance, where
there is less experience with either frontier local ﬁrms or multinational enterprises. As
another example, clients of venture capital ﬁrms, while conﬁrming the importance of the
ﬁnancing provided, also stress the importance of the experienced management support
that accompanied it (De Carvalho, Calomiris, and De Matos 2008). Countries without
experience in risky industries are unlikely to have many such managers. One alternative
may be to draw on foreign talent embodied in multinationals, as discussed in chapter 5,
or directly contract foreign specialists, including those from the diaspora. To attract
international experts requires higher levels of compensation. To this end, some innova-
tion agencies are established to be able to offer attractive recruitment packages.16

   International partnerships can also help innovation agencies in emerging economies
to develop capabilities, cultivate human capital, and use global funding and knowledge
networks to design better programming that is aligned with ongoing global trends and
good practice. As chapter 3 noted, fundamentally, the NIS must be international—that


Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                         135
      is where most knowledge, including how to run successful agencies, is found. In addi-
      tion to attracting funds, agencies in small, nascent ecosystems can establish their
      credibility by afﬁliation with more reputable agencies and associations globally.

      Coherence and Continuity

      Collaboration and Alignment with Other Agencies and Actors
      As with policy more generally, how a particular institution will interact with the rest of
      the system (or policy mix) is critical. This has been a focus of the NIS literature, which
      has extensively studied the importance and dynamic nature of links, for instance,
      among government institutions, the private sector, and universities. Successful agencies
      network with domestic and international partners and particularly with the private
      sector. For example, SPRING Singapore works closely with other agencies, such as the
      Economic Development Board, which focuses on economic development planning,
      attracting foreign direct investment, and facilitating industrial development. The
      Serbian innovation agency works with other national agencies, for example the Serbian
      Development Fund, which provides subsidized loans to businesses, and the Serbian
      Development Agency, which provides grants and technical assistance to businesses.
      Close collaboration among these agencies conserves resources and helps ensure that
      enterprises receive much needed support services (Kapil and Aridi 2017).

         However, in developing countries this is often not the case. As one crude measure,
      ﬁgure 6.2 graphs the private sector’s perceptions of the degree of collaboration between
      the scientiﬁc research institutions and the private sector. Clearly, collaboration is much
      higher in the more technologically advanced countries. Healthy interactions cannot be
      mandated by law; they are often driven by professional values of a nonmaterial nature that
      may take years to establish. However, the ﬁgure shows a high degree of correlation between
      the perceived quality of the scientiﬁc establishment and the degree of interaction, suggest-
      ing that ﬁrms may see no beneﬁt in collaboration. Digging deeper, low-quality research
      may reﬂect political considerations distorting the mission and selection of agency person-
      nel, or poor ﬁnancial design as discussed in the previous section. On the other side of the
      NIS, weak ﬁrm capabilities may prevent ﬁrms from seeing the beneﬁt of what research
      centers are producing. Box 6.8 shows an example of how to break the mismatch between
      the demand and supply of knowledge, and to provide the incentives to adapt programs to
      the objective of supporting research–industry collaboration.

      Securing Long-Term Government Commitment
      As with innovation policy in general, building effective institutions requires, in addi-
      tion to establishing clear mission and effective design, government commitment over
      the medium to long term. As discussed above, over the long term, the optimal ﬁnancing
      of agencies is likely to combine government and private sector funding to ensure align-
      ment with objectives and quality. However, as Kapil and Aridi (2017) argue on the basis
      of their analysis of agencies in seven middle-income and two high-income countries,17

                         Matching the Supply and Demand for Knowledge in the Republic of Korea
                         Increasing ﬁrm capabilities is essential to adopt technologies from abroad or from multinational
                         enterprises and to ensure the efﬁcacy of government-sponsored research. As an example, Oh
                         (1997) reports bottlenecks that impede the diffusion to ﬁrms of knowledge ﬁnanced by the Korean
                         government: 42 percent of public research institute and university respondents to a survey on
                         research diffusion pointed to a lack of technological capacity on the part of ﬁrms to use their
                         research. On the other side of the equation, the private sector felt that universities and PRIs did
                         not produce appropriate knowledge.
                              Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute concluded that direct technology transfer from
                         PRIs and universities was the best approach to ensure better alignment of the supply and demand
                         for new knowledge. Rotating personnel from the research sector into ﬁrms or having masters and
                         doctoral students work in ﬁrms were sound forms of technology transfer. Similarly, in Finland, the
                         highest ranked university–ﬁrm interactions were rotations of masters and PhD students through
                         ﬁrms. At the same time, Korea developed its own system of ﬁrm upgrading analogous to those in
                         Japan and Singapore.




Supporting Innovation: Agencies and Government Capability                                                                             137
      in the “start-up” period policy makers are likely to need to secure ﬁnancial resources for
      operations, capacity building, and rigorous piloting—that is, with sufﬁcient resources
      to evaluate program efﬁciency and additionality.

         Sustainability can be achieved only through precommitments to operational budgets
      or scale-up funding for successful pilots. Securing some precommitments for opera-
      tional funds from the government for a 3–5-year horizon provides an agency with
      breathing room and the ability to raise funds for other programs, and to hire and retain
      capable staff. Over the longer term, the government’s contribution to ﬁnancing needs to
      be placed on a solid and predictable footing (see Kapil, Piatkowsi, and Navarrete 2014).18

          Natural resource–rich countries, such as Colombia, set aside 10 percent of extrac-
      tives revenues to support subnational innovation programs. Set-aside provisions based
      on a stated percentage of a larger budget can provide stability in medium to large coun-
      tries. For example, funding for the U.S. Small Business Innovation Research program,
      a small business innovation support program administered by the 11 largest innova-
      tion agencies, is based on a set percentage (about 3 percent) of each agency’s external
      R&D budget. Finally, programs might allow the transfer of unspent program funds
      across ﬁscal years, providing greater ﬂexibility for funding decisions.

         In some countries, government commitment also encourages agencies to build
      public-private partnerships for agenda setting, program design, and funding, where
      feasible. In Poland, for instance, the European Union’s Smart Specialization fueled by a
      stable 7-year cycle of Structural Funds prompted the National Center for R&D to pro-
      actively engage the private sector to design speciﬁc instruments. Agency responsiveness
      to private sector needs is critical in bolstering its relevance and reputation with ecosys-
      tem stakeholders.


      Concluding Remarks
      Academic and policy discussions about innovation policy often omit the question of who
      actually implements it. The role public servants, ministries, and agencies play in ensuring
      or undermining the effectiveness of policy instruments is rarely considered. This is a criti-
      cal part of the resolution of the innovation paradox: as the complexity and scope of the
      interventions necessary to resolve the failures that impede exploiting the gains from tech-
      nological catch-up increase with distance from the frontier, the capabilities of governments
      to design and implement the interventions tend to diminish. Overall, the issue of capabili-
      ties in innovation policy making and how to improve them is probably one of the most
      pressing, yet unacknowledged agendas in innovation policy in developing countries.

          In this chapter, we have offered a set of considerations and guidelines that can help
      to ensure effective design and implementation of innovation policies and agencies. The
      next chapter focuses particularly on policies and agencies dedicated to upgrading ﬁrm
      managerial and technological capabilities.

Notes
 1. Asymmetric information triggers three problems that severely affect the ability of ﬁrms to
    ﬁnance innovation activities. Adverse selection—the inability of a party to observe the other
    agent’s private information—can reduce innovation contracts between ﬁrms or bank ﬁnancing
    for innovation activities, given the perceived risks. Signaling and screening problems arise as a
    response to asymmetric information. Firms with more information may face difﬁculties in sig-
    naling less-informed ﬁrms of their strong ability to conduct innovation activities. Less-informed
    ﬁrms may face difﬁculties in designing reliable mechanisms to determine which ﬁrms have the
    ability to carry out innovation projects. In both cases, multiple equilibria are possible, some of
    which result in good ﬁrms not engaging in any collaboration in innovation activities. Principal–
    agent problems/moral hazard problems arise when one of the parties to a transaction may be
    unable to monitor the performance of the other party. For example, ﬁnancial institutions may
    lack the capacity to monitor compliance with an innovation ﬁnance contract, or one member of
    a research consortium may be unable to monitor research efforts by the other party. Again, this
    can limit innovation ﬁnance and impair cooperation in innovation contracts or in setting basic
    infrastructure and services.
 2. The NIS has emphasized that the ability of ﬁrms to engage in innovation does not depend solely
    on the ﬁrm but is highly dependent on existing framework conditions—the range of markets,
    institutions, and policies that constitute the NIS. This approach adopts an evolutionary lens and
    sees the NIS as the historical development of a system that is path dependent (Fagerberg 2015)
    and where ﬁrms learn by interaction (Lundvall 1992), rejecting the notion of market failure and
    optimality.
 3. There are several types of system failures identiﬁed by the literature that are relevant when build-
    ing innovation capabilities. Firms may have insufﬁcient access to human capital, infrastructure,
    or technology. For example, ﬁrms in developing countries can be trapped in markets with low
    technological development that lack the complementary factors important for innovation, such
    as research centers or quality certiﬁcation. There is, therefore, a big infrastructure failure that
    cannot be addressed only by the market. Like coordination failures, links between ﬁrms and
    nonmarket institutions may be limited, reducing opportunities for learning and the creation
    of new products and new technologies. More important, there are systemic failures associated
    with weak institutions and inadequate regulations, which may distort and constrain ﬁrm inno-
    vation activities. For example, distortions that undermine capital investments also constrain
    investments in innovation activities, or a lack of research incentives in the university system
    may constrain science and R&D activity (BIS 2014). The role of innovation policy is, therefore,
    to make sure that all these different sources of knowledge and know-how are connected in the
    system (Dodgson et al. 2011).
 4. In the NIS literature, Edquist (2004) stresses that institutions should be thought of in terms of the
    problem they are solving, rather than the institution per se.
 5. Bleda and Del Río (2013, p. 1049), in trying to integrate both perspectives, suggest that “neoclas-
    sical market failures can be conceived within this framework as evolutionary market failures that
    take place at the last stage of the market formation function. Put simply, they are coordination
    failures that occur in an evolutionary market at its operational level.” In other words, this “last
    stage” occurs when knowledge and technology have been formed but have not been diffused or
    adopted.
 6. When fostering innovation capabilities in ﬁrms in low- and middle-income countries, not only
    systemic elements are important, but so is the extent to which information asymmetry is so
    large that ﬁrms do not know how to manage the learning process. Lee (2013) labels this as a
    capability failure, which implies that innovation policy needs to not only incentivize the accu-
    mulation of these capabilities but also directly support access to knowledge and help in the
    learning process.

       7. This can help avoid, as one large Latin American ﬁrm said, that the innovation agency is “run by
          Bolsheviks who despise the private sector and just ﬁnances university research for art’s sake.”
       8. The focus on experimentation ﬁts well with a compatible strand in the literature on evidence-
          based policy (EBP). This strand is strongest in public health policy because of the inﬂuence of
          evidence-based medicine, which sought to systematize all the available evidence for speciﬁc treat-
          ments to recommend only those that had strong experimental evidence. Two approaches used in
          the health area have been adopted in policy: randomized controlled trials (RCT) as the gold stan-
          dard for evidence, and systematic reviews of available studies that collate and rank all evidence
          produced on interventions of interest. These are the types of studies that are most relied on in
          chapter 4 to validate the efﬁcacy of extension programs.
       9. The idea of smaller-scale experiments to inform larger investments in a policy is attractive.
          However, studies have found that success requires careful design. Van der Heijden (2014) stud-
          ied the use of experiments in policy design of new building sustainability policies in Australia,
          the Netherlands, and the United States. Two areas stood out for successful experimental design.
          First, deﬁning the expected outcome of a successful experiment may be difﬁcult. For example,
          the number of buildings using the sustainability recommendations is one measure of the success
          of the policy. However, attracting signiﬁcant numbers of participants in the experiment is also
          a measure of success because it reveals buy-in. The conditions under which companies or indi-
          viduals are motivated to join an experiment and follow through until completion are critical and
          difﬁcult to achieve.
      10. Gambi (2012) reviews the role of the centralized evaluation agency in Chile, which has carried
          out evaluations of several programs. The author concludes that the evaluations have not had any
          effect on decisions about these programs.
      11. Teirlinck et al. (2013) argue that this arises from a lack of early involvement of stakeholders and
          an inadequate selection of indicators and methods that allow comparisons with other programs
          and previous versions of the one in question.
      12. However, very little is devoted to speciﬁc practices that lead to high performance; most of the
          practices recommended in this perspective relate to the deﬁnition of performance indicators,
          data gathering, monitoring, and reporting of performance results.
      13. Traditional human resource policies usually attempt to match candidates to a speciﬁc role and
          conditions of the job. SHRM, on the other hand, engages in a partnership with the workers to
          leverage their own talents to contribute to the strategic goals of the organization.
      14. This mismatch between budget allocation and objectives is being addressed in the new innova-
          tion strategy of the country aimed at supporting innovation and productivity growth and align-
          ing existing instruments to those goals.
      15. An innovation agency can be part of a larger government ministry (for example, BICRO is
          part of the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education, and Sports), or it may be an independent
          organization owned primarily by the government (for example, SPRING Singapore) or a quasi-
          governmental institution (MTDC is owned by Khasanah Nasional Berhad, Malaysia’s sovereign
          investment fund).
      16. For example, Croatia’s BICRO, Serbia’s IF, Sri Lanka’s SLINTEC, and Colombia’s INNpulsa tend
          to pay higher wages that inline ministries.
      17. The innovation agencies analyzed are BICRO in Croatia; BIRAC in India; EIF in Armenia; IF
          in Serbia; INNpulsa in Colombia; Kafalat in Lebanon; MTDC in Malaysia; and SPRING in
          Singapore.
      18. Agencies often face budget challenges because either they are directly dependent on a region or
          country’s tax income, which is difﬁcult to predict, or they are at the whim of annual budgetary
          decisions, which may introduce uncertainties related to program deployment and sustainment.
          Given the uncertain nature of government funding, agencies have found creative ways to support

    their operations. Kafalat presents itself as a platform for donor-funded projects with little money
    coming from its government. Serbia’s IF is similarly funded by donors, including the European
    Union (EU) and World Bank, and the Serbian government has agreed to fund the program once
    donor commitments end. Poland’s NCBIR and other European state agencies rely heavily on
    EU Structural Funds. Other countries, like Malaysia and Colombia, are not normally eligible for
    international development funds, so INNpulsa and MTDC have presented themselves as plat-
    forms for other domestic agencies to fund innovation-related projects.

7. Instruments to Support Firm
   Capabilities for Innovation


Introduction
Resolving the innovation policy dilemma requires choosing the appropriate combina-
tion of innovation policy instruments—the policy mix. This is likely to differ and evolve
in complexity as capabilities are accumulated and ﬁrms transition from technology
adoption/absorption toward technology and product generation, as described in
chapter 2. In this chapter, we describe the different stages of the capabilities escalator
and the set of instruments that are both critical to ﬁrm needs at each stage and feasible
given government capacity to design and implement policy.

The Instruments of the Innovation Policy Space
The policy response to the set of failures described above needs to consider a combina-
tion of instruments, the policy mix.1 Commonly, policy makers use this term to refer to
the set of instruments being implemented under the umbrella of science, technology,
and innovation (STI) policy. However, as discussed in chapter 4, the deﬁnition needs to
be broader, both in terms of relevant instruments and in terms of reﬂecting the com-
plementarities among instruments.

    To frame the subsequent discussion, ﬁgure 7.1 shows a schematic diagram of the dif-
ferent policy instruments populating the policy space. On the vertical axis, we move from
outcomes related to the supply of knowledge and research to outcomes related to ﬁrms’
demand for research and development (R&D) and non-R&D innovation activities.
Along the horizontal axis, we present a range of government measures, including indi-
rect and direct ﬁnancial support, other services, and requirements or recommendations
for ﬁrm behavior. Along this axis, we also divide the type of support into categories of
market-based incentives such as tax exemptions and subsidies, nonmarket incentives
such as prizes and awards, the direct provision of services and infrastructure, voluntary
measures to improve collaboration and ﬁrm conduct, and regulations.

   Figure 7.1 is meant to illustrate the breadth and complexity of the instruments
that can support ﬁrm innovation, as well as the potential for complementarities
between instruments.2 At the same time, it is a snapshot of a mature policy mix, and
represents the ﬁnal destination of the capabilities escalator, rather than the beginning.

Many developing countries strain their governance capabilities for implementation
and coordination trying to occupy the policy space all at once, and imitate the National
Innovation System (NIS) of more advanced countries. This can result in a misalignment
of the policy mix with the present need of industry, in particular, to build innovation
capabilities, and lead to a fragmented and undirected set of instruments. The next sec-
tion proposes a gradual path of expanding the mix that is aligned with the capabilities
of both the private sector and of policy makers and institutions.


Supporting the Capabilities Escalator: Innovation Policy Mixes and
Convergence to the Technological Frontier
Countries at similar stages of development share common challenges related to the
nature of innovation activities, implementation capacity, and framework conditions,
and these constraints dictate the policy mix. Although the combinations of instruments
vary over a continuum of capabilities building, in this section, for simplicity, we high-
light three key stages of this capabilities escalator: (1) production and management
capabilities, (2) technological capabilities, and (3) invention and technology-generation
capabilities. In the background, as discussed in chapter 4 with respect to the expanded
NIS, across all stages, governments need to remove barriers to the accumulation of all
types of capital—human, physical, and knowledge—and this will entail structural
reforms to improve education and training, ensure access to ﬁnancial markets, open
trade, and establish a supportive business climate and competition framework.

    The demands for public support differ by stage (ﬁgure 7.2), reﬂecting the innova-
tion trajectories described in chapter 2 and the typologies of capabilities summa-
rized in chapter 4 and represented in Figure 1.2. In stage 1, most ﬁrms in developing
countries are on the lower end of this path (Bell and Pavitt 1993; Lundvall et al. 2009;
Bell and Figueiredo 2012; Zanello et al. 2013). Innovation involves ad hoc efforts that
include the adoption of basic managerial and organizational practices, machinery
upgrading, and basic process improvement, but little formal R&D. Innovation activ-
ities are usually dispersed and less systematic than in advanced countries, and tend
to be more incremental because of the lack of complementary factors, and the fact
that demand for novel local goods in these markets may be low or innovations may
be difﬁcult to protect. Under these conditions, policy needs to ensure that technol-
ogy is accessible, to help strengthen ﬁrm capabilities to absorb technology from
advanced countries.

    As countries move toward the technological frontier in stage 2, the intensity of R&D
increases, and the types of innovation introduced by leading ﬁrms (particularly those in
trade-exposed sectors) tend to increase in sophistication and quality to meet increasing
internal demand and standards for participation in export markets. In this transition,
instruments that support business R&D projects and, in some cases, collaboration between
researchers and industry become more relevant. However, broader policies to support

      Note: NIS = National Innovation System; NQI = national quality infrastructure; R&D = research and development; STEM = science,
      technology, engineering, and mathematics.

      ﬁrm capabilities remain important because the ability to innovate is not uniform across
      the economy and most sectors are still dominated by basic innovation activities.

         Finally, in countries where a signiﬁcant number of ﬁrms have reached the techno-
      logical frontier and with a more mature NIS, innovation policies focus on promoting
      the generation of new technologies and supporting increasingly complex innovative
      projects, while continuing to build absorptive capacity in laggard small and medium
      enterprises (SMEs). It is important to highlight that the institutions appropriate to this
      stage take decades to build. Though we have stressed basic capability building as the
      priority in the early stages, laying the groundwork for an advanced science and technology
      (S&T) capability must also begin at this stage.

          Table 7.1 proﬁles these development stages, describing symptoms that may war-
      rant policy intervention, with probable causes, ecosystem conditions, and combina-
      tions of instruments that could be used in response. A graphic illustration of these
      stages and the implication for the policy mix is shown in ﬁgure 7.3. The important
      message of the ﬁgure is that the policy mix of innovation policy instruments is cumu-
      lative and evolves from little to more sophistication, as ﬁrms advance in the capabili-
      ties escalator. In line with the signiﬁcant capabilities failure described in the ﬁrst
      section of chapter 6, the policy mix starts with building basic managerial and organi-
      zational capabilities via management extension that bridges large information
      asymmetries and supports learning. It also combines incentivizing collaboration
      between ﬁrms, via for example vouchers for innovation (see box 7.1 for a descrip-
      tion of this instrument), and focusing on developing key complementary factors
      such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills and early
      stage infrastructure.

            BOX 7.1
           Innovation Vouchers to Foster Innovation Activities and Collaboration
           One pervasive failure in low-capabilities countries is the lack of collaboration between ﬁrms and
           between ﬁrms and knowledge providers. Innovation vouchers are one way of addressing this
           failure. Vouchers are small grants allocated to SMEs to purchase services from external knowledge
           providers. The main objective is usually to entice non-innovator SMEs to start collaborating with
           knowledge organizations and providers. Vouchers also can be used for SMEs already innovating,
           to encourage them to enter new areas. Through voucher schemes, non-innovative SMEs or SMEs
           engaged in simple forms of innovation are expected to start engaging in innovation activities and
           increase the sophistication of their activities.
                Unlike grants, voucher schemes are often entitlement-based rather than competition-based,
           which means that applicants can receive vouchers as long as they meet the eligibility requirements.
           This reduces administrative costs for applicants and the government. Also, vouchers often involve
           smaller amounts than matching grants because they aim to provide an incentive to start collabo-
           rating and to develop small projects. The advantages of vouchers can be summarized as follows:
           simplicity in their management, ﬂexibility in the type of collaboration incentivized, and demand
           orientation.
                On the other hand, innovation vouchers present several potential risks. First, it is difﬁcult to
           ensure that collaboration is not a one-off transaction, and, in some cases, the incentive pro-
           vided is too small to attract the intended target group of noninnovators. More important are the
           risks associated with lock-in to a small number of knowledge providers and fraudulent use of
                                                                                                (Box continues on the following page.)

    schemes, whereby BDS providers search for partner SMEs with no intention of developing
    cooperative projects.
         Despite the recent popularity of voucher programs in many developed countries, very few of
    them have been formally evaluated. Little solid evidence on effectiveness is available from devel-
    oping countries. However, evidence from evaluations in developed countries suggests signiﬁcant
    additionality in the number of innovation projects in the short run. A randomized control trial of the
    Creative Credits program in the United Kingdom ﬁnds a positive impact on additional projects
    being conducted in the short run; recipients were statistically more likely than nonrecipients to
    have introduced product/process innovations (72.4 percent versus 55.9 percent for product innova-
    tion; 63.8 percent versus 47.2 percent for process innovation). However, the difference was not
    statistically signiﬁcant after 12 months. There was also a signiﬁcant, positive impact on ﬁrm
    performance equal to short-term additional sales of approximately £3,430 per voucher.
         Voucher schemes require some minimal competencies from SMEs to identify their challenges
    that can be addressed by external knowledge providers. Also, the schemes require program manag-
    ers who can facilitate the matching between ﬁrms and knowledge providers and act as brokers. This
    requires dedicated staff who can ensure professional delivery and avoid conﬂicts of interest, which
    is often challenging in some lower-income countries.

    The second stage focuses on strengthening technological capabilities via technologi-
cal extension or technology centers, and direct and indirect support to R&D projects,
while continuing to strengthen existing complementary factors and infrastructure for
innovation. In the ﬁnal stage, the focus is on facilitating advanced technological devel-
opment capabilities and invention, while supporting basic innovation capabilities in
laggard ﬁrms. So, in this ﬁnal stage the policy mix has matured to resemble the broad
scope of ﬁgure 7.1.
   In what follows, we focus in more detail on some of these key innovation policy
instruments that are required to build these capabilities.3

Building Managerial and Organizational Practices for Innovation
Policies supporting management and organizational capabilities need to be at the cen-
ter of innovation policy in stage 1. Supporting these capabilities is particularly impor-
tant at an early stage of technological development. However, the quality of these
practices varies enormously within and between countries. In this section, we focus on
some successful experiences of management extension programs, as well as describing
some of the key challenges when implementing these programs.

      Addressing the Capabilities Gap

      As discussed in chapter 4, there are several reasons why ﬁrms do not invest more
      in innovation. Low capabilities prevent ﬁrms from identifying productive opportunities,
      evaluating their feasibility, managing their risk, and allocating human resources
      effectively. This explains the ubiquity of business advisory services, originating in the
      agricultural sector and now very popular in, for example, Europe, Japan, Singapore,
      and the United States (see Ezell and Atkinson 2011; Maloney 2017a). Typically, these
      comprise a group of consultants that:

         ■   Benchmark ﬁrm management along some of the dimensions already discussed
             in the World Management Survey, including operations, ﬁnancial management,
             planning, and human resource policy.
         ■   Design an improvement plan over the next year or 18 months, typically done
             jointly with management on the basis of the diagnostic and the areas that are
             most critical to improving ﬁrm performance.
         ■   Accompany management in the implementation of the plan.

         In the process, there is learning by the ﬁrm, and by the consultants about the ﬁrm,
      that can subsequently be used to tailor support in other areas. For instance, once the
      foundations in terms of core capabilities are in place, the ﬁrm can be directed toward
      more sophisticated innovation support, such as developing R&D projects. A key char-
      acteristic of this type of instrument, management extension, as opposed to more tradi-
      tional business advisory services, is the more proactive role of the industry specialist or
      “extensionist” in engaging with the ﬁrm and guiding it though the learning process.


      The Origins of Management Extension
      Extension systems enjoy a long pedigree. The Morrill Land Grant College program that
      established many of the great U.S. universities was established partly to redress the fact
      that the United States had no systems of agricultural or mechanical extension such as
      were found in Europe at the time. In both regions—Europe and the United States—pro-
      ductivity and quality studies would advance throughout the nineteenth century.

          Extension services would play a central role in the recoveries of the post–World
      War II period. Japan during the war had established the Japan Management Association
      in 1942 to upgrade industry quality and develop new methods to promote technologi-
      cal coordination between large and small ﬁrms. After the war, the awareness of an
      almost tenfold lag in productivity relative to the United States, a lag exceeding that
      faced by most contemporary middle-income countries, highlighted the need for a
      concerted effort to adopt labor management, training, and quality control (QC) tech-
      niques (see box 7.2), especially from the United States, which was then recognized as
      the world leader. The U.S. government also used the Marshall Plan as part of a goal of
      worldwide dissemination of U.S. managerial techniques. In conjunction with local

     BOX 7.2
    Post–World War II Recovery and Firm Upgrading in Japan
    Exiting World War II, not only did Japan have a tenth of the productivity of the United States and
    a third of Germany, but its exports also had a reputation for poor quality. In recent years, the gov-
    ernment’s emphasis has shifted somewhat from catch-up to one of supporting ﬁrms with high
    innovation potential. However, for the second half of the 20th century, programs were focused on
    narrowing the productivity and quality gap of ﬁrms with their larger counterparts in Japan and
    with peers in the advanced world.
         The Japanese government approached this task with several instruments. In 1948, the Small
    and Medium Enterprise Agency was established under the Ministry of International Trade and
    Industry (MITI). The Export Inspections Act of 1957 established inspections by government organiza-
    tions to improve quality, which helped all Japanese ﬁrms by improving the reputation of Japanese
    products. The Industrial Standardization Law introduced a special JIS (Japanese Industrial
    Standards) mark that certiﬁed the standards of quality control. This signal appears especially impor-
    tant in helping SMEs secure contracts (Kikuchi 2009). Public research organizations (Kosetsushi,
    presently about 600 in the country) were set up to conduct public testing and research to meet the
    industrial needs of local communities (Wada 2009).
         Of great importance was the establishment of the system of publicly registered SME manage-
    ment diagnosticians/consultants (chusho kigyo shindan-shi or Shindan Shi where shindan means
    “diagnostic”) that evaluate SMEs’ business performance and provide them with advice and con-
    sultation. The Shindan Shi system was adopted by MITI’s regional and prefectural ofﬁces—10,000
    consultations were provided to companies in 1950 alone (Wada 2009). In addition, a system of
    direct ﬁnancial support and guarantees for private sector lending was established. Three private
    institutions, the most well known being the Japanese Productivity Center, were critical to capabili-
    ties formation.
         Japan has had particular success in promoting these programs on the operational side, and
    terms like “5s” and “Kaizen” are now used around the world. The 5s methodology consists of ﬁve
    steps—seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, and shitsuke broadly translated as “sort,” “set in order,” “shine,”
    “standardize,” and “sustain”—which are considered basic building blocks for just-in-time manage-
    ment systems. They begin with extremely basic issues, such as organization of tools and eliminating
    distractions on the work ﬂoor, and work up to standardizing practices and maintaining high quality in
    production. The Kaizen or “continuous improvement” approach sees productivity as improving pro-
    cesses and ﬂow in a continuous fashion, interspersed with occasional bursts of innovation.

executives, this would result in what was called the “productivity movement” and the
creation in 1953 of the Japan Productivity Center, a public-private partnership with
the goal of dissemination of new technologies and managerial ideas to Japanese indus-
try. The statistical techniques for QC developed by the American W. Edwards Deming
were also propagated in person in conjunction with the Japan Union of Scientists and
Engineers and Japan Management Association. They became the basis for subsequent
QC techniques that Japan became famous for in subsequent decades (Morris-Suzuki
1994; Kikuchi 2011).


Instruments to Support Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                         155
          Similar efforts were important to Europe’s recovery. Bureau of Labor Statistics Chief
      of Productivity and Technology Development James Silberman claimed that inefﬁcien-
      cies in management were a more severe problem than war damages (Giorcelli 2016).
      Between 1952 and 1958, as in Japan, the U.S. Productivity Program organized
      study trips of European managers to U.S. plants, followed by consulting sessions of
      U.S. experts in European ﬁrms. Giorcelli offers perhaps the most systematic study of
      how the program rolled out in Italy, combined with part of the Marshall Plan, where,
      as in Japan, European managers were invited to learn modern management skills
      through study trips to the United States. The program gave visiting Italian managers
      the opportunity to participate in formal training and internships in U.S. ﬁrms, as well
      as providing equipment loans.

          These techniques would be unevenly disseminated throughout the developing
      world in the next decades. Most notably, in the 1980s, Singapore had become disap-
      pointed with the productivity gains arising from its growth model. In particular, the
      country had been successful in attracting multinational enterprises (MNEs), but local
      ﬁrms had not yet been able to link into these value chains. Singapore contracted with
      the Japanese Productivity Center to set up what is now known as SPRING (the
      Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board), which now delivers a menu of ﬁrm
      capability support programs. SPRING offers a wide array of programs, ranging from
      basic to advanced, including incentivizing the private sector through awards and prizes,
      making equity investments or co-investments, and building capacity in the entire eco-
      system through multiple national and international partnerships (see box 7.3 and
      annex 7A). The Republic of Korea, also faced with a lagging SME sector in a very dual-
      istic economy, has developed its own Korea Productivity Center. Below, we discuss
      several other more recent interventions in emerging economies.




          BOX 7.3
         National Quality Infrastructure
         The national quality infrastructure (NQI) is part of a country’s framework conditions for innovation.
         As such, the government can play two main roles. The ﬁrst is developing an NQI and guaranteeing
         a minimum level of functionality and service provision from it. The second is supporting the devel-
         opment of local standards, or at least participation in the development of international standards,
         and then potentially their uptake by industry where relevant.
              The NQI comprises public and private parties that deliver speciﬁc functions to determine
         whether a product, process, or service meets a deﬁned set of requirements. These functions are
         delivered through a group of services that support standardization, including measurement,
         inspection, certiﬁcation, accreditation, and conformity assessments. The use of standards for
         innovation is a central element of the NQI system. The NQI represents a system of interrelated
         institutions that facilitate the diffusion of standards in the economy.
                                                                              (Box continues on the following page.)

        Conformity assessment is the group of procedures to evaluate whether a product, process, or
    service fulﬁlls certain standards, linking the standards with the product, processes, and services
    themselves. These procedures include some—and sometimes all—of the following:
        1. Testing and inspection. Measures to evaluate a product, process, or service, according
           to a speciﬁed procedure
        2. Calibration. Determines the relationship between instrument inputs and the magnitude
           of response in its outputs
        3. Certiﬁcation. Provides independent assurance that a certain product or service complies
           with a certain standard, and can help manufacturing and service ﬁrms to differentiate from
           less reputable suppliers.
        Standards specify characteristics or performance, convey information, or provide means of
    communication. In their most general deﬁnition, they can be regarded as a reference that has been
    established by some form of authority, custom, or general consent (Guasch et al. 2007). Standards
    codify know-how and market requirements, enable interoperability between products and pro-
    cesses, set a minimum level of quality, and reduce variety, enabling economies of learning and
    scale (Guasch et al. 2007). See for Eastern Europe, Racine (2010).

The Returns to Management Extension

Recent studies ﬁnd that management extension services tend to generate very high
rates of return. For the United States, Jarmin (1999) ﬁnds that ﬁrms that participated
in manufacturing extension partnership (MEP) programs in the United States experi-
enced between 3.4 and 16 percent higher labor productivity growth between 1987 and
1992 than nonparticipating ﬁrms. In addition, Ehlen (2001) ﬁnds that Illinois MEP-
afﬁliated centers generated US$10 million in revenues in 1999: while the cost to the
state was US$6 million, or US$1.66 in tax revenue for each public dollar invested.
The Georgia MEP-afﬁliated centers reported US$4.44 in tax revenue per dollar spent in
public support.

    Although a prime disseminator of such techniques, Japan has published no public
studies of their efﬁcacy. However, Giorcelli (2016) has studied the analogous policies in
postwar Italy. Using archive data, she ﬁnds that businesses participating in the produc-
tivity program increased sales and productivity and stayed in business longer than
comparable companies that were not part of the program. Management practices had
larger and more persistent effects than machinery purchases or technology and had a
compounding effect on business success, with impacts increasing over time and per-
sisting even 15 years after the program ended. The key channel through which these


Instruments to Support Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                  157
      new capabilities impacted ﬁrm performance was by helping managers make better
      investment decisions—investing in new plants or new machines, for example—which
      made their production more efﬁcient.

         In a randomized control trial in India where textile ﬁrms were provided extension
      services, Bloom et al. (2013) ﬁnd a dramatic increase in the adoption of good manage-
      ment practices by treated plants (ﬁgure 7.4). The control group, which received only
      the diagnostic, also improved substantially, suggesting, again, that limited access to
      information is a major barrier. The rate of productivity growth was 11 percentage
      points higher in the treatment group (ﬁrms that adopted these new practices) than in
      the control group, enough to afford the full cost of expensive consulting for one year.

         A similar study by Iacovone, McKenzie, and Maloney (2017) ﬁnds that locally pro-
      vided consulting services—provided by the National Productivity Center in Cali,
      Colombia—have a positive impact on management practices in Colombia. Panel b of
      ﬁgure 7.4 shows a dramatic difference between those ﬁrms accompanied by in-ﬁrm
      consultants (in green) and those who were given only a diagnostic (blue).

          The positive returns of management extension do not only apply to more estab-
      lished SMEs. For micro and small enterprises in Mexico, Bruhn, Karlan, and Schoar
      (2016) ﬁnd that productivity more than doubled after one year of local consulting

They show that the women who receive the services are 8–11 percent more likely to
introduce a new product than the control group.4

   The type of intervention appears to matter as well. Anderson-Macdonald et al.
(2017) offered marketing or ﬁnance training to microﬁrms in South Africa. After a
year, the ﬁnance group saw proﬁts increase 41 percent relative to those with no
training, mostly through efﬁciency gains; the marketing group saw proﬁts increase
61 percent by adopting a growth focus on higher sales, greater investments in stock
and materials, and hiring more employees. With a slightly different take, Brooks,
Donovan, and Johnson (2017) show that proﬁts of inexperienced female microen-
terprise owners in a Kenyan slum grew by 20 percent with mentorship by an experi-
enced entrepreneur in the same community focusing on localized speciﬁc
information (like ﬁnding suppliers) rather than on abstract general information
(how to keep books).

   In general, the small but incipient evidence related to management extension and
business advisory, much of it randomized control trials and hence the gold standard,
appears to be positive across different types of ﬁrms.

          Another type of intervention supporting business upgrading is the provision of
      quality-enhancing programs oriented to the adoption of existing quality standards (see
      box 7.3 for a description of the national quality infrastructure). The available evidence
      of the impact of quality enhancement programs and standards setting is less solid but
      also positive. Guasch et al. (2007) cites a United Kingdom’s DTI 2005 study showing a
      signiﬁcant long-run contribution of standards to economic growth in the United
      Kingdom: from 1948 and 2002, standards contributed to 13 percent of the growth in
      labor productivity. A similar, but older, study in Germany indicates that standards con-
      tributed 0.9 percentage points of an average overall growth rate of 3.3 percent. Other
      European studies show that standards are as important as patents for productivity,
      but the impact differs across sectors, suggesting that standards have greater impact in
      mature sectors than in R&D-intensive industries where patents proved more important.
      Using ﬁrm-level surveys, Escribano and Guasch (2005) ﬁnd that standards (proxied
      by International Organization for Standardization certiﬁcation) increased productivity
      by some 2.4–17.6 percent in four Central American countries, less than 1 percent in
      four Southeast Asian countries, and 4.5 percent in China.


      If Extension Programs Yield Such Positive Rates of Return, Why Don’t Firms Pay
      for Them Themselves?

      The logical question is why, if returns are so high, ﬁrms do not upgrade themselves. The
      NIS literature argues for a systemic failure in inducing ﬁrms to learn, and the neoclassical
      tradition offers speciﬁcs on how. For example, the European Commission’s Study of
      Business Support Services and Market Failure offers several reasons, two of which ﬁnd
      increasing support in the recent empirical literature.

      Firms Don’t Know What They Don’t Know
      First, consistent with biased self-evaluations found by Bloom and Van Reenen (2007),
      ﬁrms may not know what they do not know and hence do not perceive the value of
      investing in themselves. As ﬁgure 7.5 shows, not only do entrepreneurs in most coun-
      tries overestimate their abilities, but the magnitude of their overconﬁdence also increases
      with distance from the managerial frontier.5

         McKenzie and Woodruff (2013) examine several additional hypotheses to under-
      stand the lack of investments in managerial and organizational practices, ranging from
      deﬁcient information to credit and insurance market failures. If true, these explana-
      tions, again, suggest the need to avoid false diagnoses in designing policy: if innovation
      in managerial practices is limited by a lack of credit, then creating a government insti-
      tution to train managers is unlikely to be the efﬁcient solution.

          However, although such failures are presumably less important in advanced coun-
      tries, subsidies to support introductory advisory services nonetheless remain huge:
      100 percent in Korea, Singapore, and Scotland, or 60 percent in Japan. This is suggestive

of an important role for information asymmetries about the true managerial quality
and the potential for improvement, which could explain the lack of willingness to
pay for these services. The heavily subsidized initial consultations provide a benchmark
of ﬁrm managerial quality and areas of potential improvement, and then serve as a
gateway to a broader set of ﬁrm support programs of progressively higher technologi-
cal sophistication.6

    They also reveal information about potential high-performing ﬁrms and ﬁrms that
are less likely to succeed; indeed, in both Japan and Singapore (see box 7.4) gaining
such intelligence is a deliberate part of the escalator infrastructure. This role is espe-
cially important in developing countries, where signiﬁcant distortions may pre-
vent allocative efﬁciency, allowing some less-productive ﬁrms to remain in the market
(Hsieh and Klenow 2009). Indeed, it may be asked whether it would be better to just
encourage the entry of better new ﬁrms than trying to upgrade existing ﬁrms with
expensive consulting services. There is no ready answer here, except that about half of
productivity gains in advanced countries appear to occur within incumbent ﬁrms, and
the measured rates of return discussed above appear to justify the intervention. On the
basis of the India evaluation above, if we imagine that ﬁrms pay a 20 percent tax rate,
then a 100 percent subsidy of consulting services could easily be recouped from the
productivity gains in under ﬁve years. The U.S. studies suggest the return in taxes to
range from 60 percent to 400 percent. Further, to the degree that government gains

      The Capabilities Escalator in Singapore
      The National Productivity Board (NPB) was established in 1972 to improve productivity in all sec-
      tors and levels of the economy. The NPB followed a total productivity approach, which emphasized
      productivity measurement, product quality, a ﬂexible wage system, worker training, and assistance
      to small- and medium-sized enterprises.
           To promote productivity in both the public and the private sectors, the board used mass media
      publicity, seminars, conventions, and publications to remind Singaporeans that productivity must
      be a permanent pillar of the economy. The board sponsored a productivity campaign each year
      with such slogans as this one for 1988: “Train Up—Be the Best You Can Be.”
           A critical motivation for Singapore’s support was related to better leveraging of MNEs’ pres-
      ence in the country. Singapore has relied to a great extent on large inﬂows of foreign MNEs rather
      than on indigenous companies. Into the 1990s, about 75 percent of its manufacturing output and
      80 percent of exports came from foreign MNEs, with large parts of the services sector, such as
      ﬁnancial services, hotels, and transport, foreign owned. The realization in the 1980s that spillovers
      from MNEs to domestic SMEs were weak, and that the domestic SME sector was badly lagging,
      gave new impetus to the productivity focus.
           Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew asked the Japanese Productivity Center directly for support to
      bolster this sector, which they did from 1983 to 2000. As in Japan, his goal was to change not only
      behavior but also the mindset of the managers, workers, and general population. Unlike in Japan,
      the core organizations were established by the government, and what became known as
      the Productivity Movement was introduced not only to the business but also the public sector. The
      success of the program is attributed to the prime minister’s strong personal commitment. Further,
      the establishment of technological extension services was accompanied by a massive public
      awareness campaign. As in Japan, the program was undertaken with tripartite cooperation among
      government, industry, and labor unions.
           SME Centers, formerly Enterprise Development Centers, offer one-stop information, advice,
      and assistance from relevant government agencies, in particular SPRING (the Standards, Productivity,
      and Innovation Board) and private sector organizations. SPRING, the descendent of the original
      1990s National Productivity Board, sits under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and is broadly in
      charge of supporting ﬁrms, both SMEs and larger. More generally, as in Japan, the government
      underwrites consultancy and other services to resolve progressively more sophisticated problems.
      This allows ﬂexibility and tailoring to individual ﬁrm needs.
           The ﬁrst step is for the ﬁrm to go to the SME Center, which is generally run by the trade asso-
      ciation (chamber of commerce). SPRING underwrites the costs of outreach services the SMEs
      undertake. The business advisor visits the ﬁrm and recommends what needs to be done and then
      may suggest a private sector consultant. As ﬁrms grow more sophisticated, they may be matched
      with an account manager in SPRING. This may occur because the trade association thinks the
      ﬁrm has potential and calls it to the attention of SPRING but also because the SPRING account
      manager is always scoping his sector for potential.
                                                                          (Box continues on the following page.)

    The Capabilities Escalator in Singapore (continued)

         The key element of Singapore’s approach is that policy support is aligned to the position of the
    ﬁrm in the escalator, ensuring that the SME has available a broad menu of policy instruments
    tailored to its needs to support and ﬁnance upgrading. At a higher level of sophistication, once the
    ﬁrst step of the escalator has been climbed, SMEs can access A*STAR (Agency for Science
    Technology and Research), which provides a broad range of instruments to support technological
    upgrading. Annex 7A describes the full menu of instruments for upgrading management and tech-
    nology in SPRING and A*STAR.

information on the barriers to potential high-growth ﬁrms, it also increases the likeli-
hood that new industries and sectors emerge. This said, efﬁciency considerations when
selecting the beneﬁciaries of these programs in terms of merits and ability to upgrade
need to be seriously considered, and the information gained also informs which ﬁrms
not to offer subsidies to in subsequent stages of the escalator. For instance, the family-
managed ﬁrms discussed in chapter 5 may be structurally handicapped in ways that are
revealed in the initial diagnostics.

Supply-Side Constraints
The second barrier may emerge on the service supply side. SMEs may lack the scale to
assess the value of these services or the quality of providers, which in turn prevents the
emergence of a support industry even if ﬁrms desire to upgrade. There is, thus, both a
coordination and information asymmetry in the market for management and exten-
sion services. In all advanced countries, the government has had a role in creating the
market for these services. The various agencies appear central to the story of postwar
recovery in Italy, as well as the subsequent Asian miracles. Japan still supports this mar-
ket, posting the rankings of service providers on the Internet, for instance, precisely to
resolve the information asymmetry surrounding quality.

   Other countries have also experimented with extension programs, many on the
Japanese Productivity Center model, with greater or lesser success (see Ezell and
Atkinson 2011 and Racine 2004 for descriptions of country experiences). The Japanese
Productivity Center set up several productivity centers in Latin America, although they
for the most part have not received political backing nor did they occur in the context
of a larger productivity movement found in the cases discussed above. Others have
been stymied by the limited availability and poor quality of management extension
specialists and service providers. The most successful extensionists have experience in

      best-practice companies, usually large national or multinational enterprises. In poor
      countries, there will be few such companies and even fewer employees willing to leave
      them to work as consultants. Yet the quality of extensionists is absolutely central to the
      success of such programs; they cannot be replaced by recent business school graduates
      as is the case in some countries or, by career government staff.7 Training and extension
      programs are better implemented by a network of competitive private providers who
      face incentives to provide services most aligned with the changing needs of the private
      sector across all levels of ﬁrm sophistication. Hence, extension programs need to help
      potential private sector providers expand their competencies through training and
      quality certiﬁcation of their technical skills.


      Subsequent Steps on the Capabilities Escalator
      Technological Transfer and Extension

      As ﬁrms master basic competencies, adoption of existing technologies from abroad
      becomes a priority. However, such dissemination is subject to the usual appropriation
      externalities. Hence, there is an argument for government to redress this market failure.
      This is often done by technological transfer extension. Because it is often necessary to
      adapt foreign technologies to the local context, such extension systems are frequently
      paired with technology centers or Public Research Institutes. There has been a long
      tradition of technology extension in agriculture, most famously with the U.S. land-
      grant universities, continuing to the present day. As box 7.5 shows for the case of
      EMBRAPA, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation in Brazil, these services
      can have signiﬁcant effects on upgrading in agriculture.

         A similar phenomenon exists in the industrial realm, where technology centers
      can support technological upgrading in SMEs. Some of these centers offer both man-
      agement extension and more specialized technology extension. One example is the
      U.S. MEPs, which, while focusing on constant improvement in management and pro-
      duction processes, can also direct SMEs toward more specialized technological support.
      A different model of technology extension was developed during the 1980s and 1990s
      in some European regions specializing in speciﬁc sectoral clusters (see box 7.6 for a
      description of a technology center in Catalonia). These responded to the technological
      upgrading needs of important sector clusters.

          There are two key lessons of these models of technology extension. First, they often
      are the result of public-private partnerships. This ensures both industry knowledge and
      alignment with speciﬁc needs of industry, and addresses coordination failures. Second,
      they tend to be subnational and close to speciﬁc sector clusters, ensuring proximity and
      engagement with local ﬁrms. This implies some degree of capabilities maturity in the
      sectors to organize themselves in clusters that may be hard to ﬁnd in stage 1 of the
      escalator process.

     BOX 7.5
    Agriculture Extension: The Case of EMBRAPA
    EMBRAPA generates and transfers new technologies and techniques tailored to Brazil’s climate
    and soil conditions. The use of these technologies by Brazilian farmers facilitated the expansion
    of Brazilian agriculture and increased exports at internationally competitive prices—ﬁrst, by
    expanding the supply of arable land and, second, by improving the productivity of selected crops.
    New techniques to improve the quality of the otherwise inhospitable Cerrado soil opened a vast
    tract of newly arable land, keeping marginal agricultural costs down and enabling an increase in
    agricultural production, while improvements in the cultivars of soybeans and cotton ultimately
    yielded biannual harvests. Both activities increased the productivity of land.
         Why did EMBRAPA succeed where other research organizations failed? EMBRAPA’s mission
    orientation, focusing from the outset on the improvement of agricultural productivity rather than
    the production of scientiﬁc work, was a key driver of its success. Integration into the international
    ﬂow of knowledge increased research efﬁciency and accelerated training. An open intellectual
    property rights policy—and a network of ofﬁces spread throughout the country—facilitated the
    dissemination of EMBRAPA’s discoveries. Funding was kept at adequate levels for more than two
    decades. Investments in human capital were highly prioritized. A meritocratic culture was actively
    promoted by the organization. As a result, research dealt with the practical problems of agricul-
    ture, and farmers quickly deployed technology and innovations sourced through EMBRAPA.
    By reacting to market signals and focusing on activities for which demand was increasing in
    international markets, EMBRAPA avoided the usual challenges of purely “supply-push” technology
    transfer policies.

Supporting Links and Trade Upgrading

The correlation between interaction with world markets and productivity and quality
is long established. Exporters and ﬁrms participating in global value chains (GVCs)
tend to perform better across a range of dimensions. The direction of causality is prob-
ably bidirectional. As discussed in chapter 5, trade links are important sources of capa-
bilities for innovation through access to inputs and markets, competition, and
technology transfer (see, for example, Eslava et al. 2013). However, beneﬁting from this
channel also requires capabilities to compete and manage the risk inherent in entering
new markets. Firms need to upgrade their capabilities to introduce a new export prod-
uct (Cirera, Marin, and Markwald 2015) and, as the case studies in Chandra (2006)
document, these include ﬁnancial, management, and technical skills that are often dif-
ﬁcult to acquire. The same is true for non-exporting ﬁrms facing new competition
from imports in the context of free trade agreements. Interviews with Colombian auto
parts ﬁrms reveal that many lacked the ability to develop a strategy to manage the
lower-priced Asian products entering their markets. Hence, increasing international
exposure and upgrading capabilities are complementary agendas.

         Technology Centers: The Case of ASCAMM
         The Association of Enterprises Mould-Makers and Die-Makers (ASCAMM) is a design and indus-
         trial production technology center set up in 1987 by the Catalan Association of Mould and Die
         Manufacturers. In 1997, it became an independent entity and has the form of a private nonproﬁt
         foundation. ASCAMM Foundation is located in the Vallès Technological Park and stretches over an
         area of 11,000 square miles. It has 130 employees, most of whom are technical staff.
              ASCAMM’s objectives are as follows:
             ■    To generate, through their own research and development activities, technological knowledge
                  in the production technologies ﬁeld; and
             ■    To transfer this knowledge to the industry and facilitate its usage.
              Annually, more than 200 companies are involved in over 70 ongoing, collaborative research,
         technology development, and innovation projects, in which ASCAMM is the leader or a technical
         partner. To date, the center has generated 8 patents of industrial application, 4 technology-based
         start-ups, and 12 innovative technological products. Most of ASCAMM’s know-how focuses on
         design and production technologies, in particular those related to polymers and metals (ferrous
         materials and light alloys), and composites.
              The second objective of knowledge transfer is accomplished through contract R&D projects,
         technological services, advisory services, training, and the dissemination of knowledge through
         conferences, publications, and other means.
              ASCAMM Foundation actively collaborates with more than 500 companies in transport (in the
         automotive, aeronautics, and railway sectors), industrial equipment, energy, biomedical and
         health care (devices and equipment), packaging, consumer goods, plastic and metal transformers,
         and other sectors. It collaborates with many industrial, technological, and training organizations
         throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
              ASCAMM has evolved independently from the mould makers’ industry and has become one of
         the leading technology centers in Europe. Originally it specialized in plastic injection and molding,
         but later the center enlarged its interest into new areas, such as business creation.
              The ability of the management to obtain funding and the good results of their services and
         research projects paved the way to ﬁnancial self-sufﬁciency (60 percent from services and 40 percent
         from competitive research), and eventually to recognition as an Advanced Technological Center (CTA)
         by the Catalan government. This made it eligible for an annual noncompetitive subsidy covering
         about 12 percent of its budget. In exchange, ASCAMM committed to promote technologically based
         ventures, which it did until transforming into a venture capitalist ﬁrm.

          Finally, as discussed in chapter 5, for local ﬁrms to beneﬁt from links to MNEs requires
      meeting price, quality, and timeliness targets achievable only with advanced ﬁrm capa-
      bilities. As the discussions of Singapore above and the Czech Republic in box 7.7 suggest,
      not having these capabilities can lead to a dualistic market structure where low-capability
      local ﬁrms remain entirely separate from developing linkages to MNEs.

     BOX 7.7
    Czech Supplier Development Program
    The Czech Republic had been one of the most successful locations in attracting foreign direct
    investment (FDI) following the fall of communism in the 1990s, but relatively little of the beneﬁts
    potentially connected with FDI had been felt in the local economy. MNEs drew few of their inputs
    from Czech suppliers. An effective mechanism was required to widen FDI beneﬁts to the local
    economy. There was a need to strengthen local suppliers’ capacities so that they could cope
    with European Union single market forces and succeed in becoming internationally competitive,
    following enterprises’ isolation from world markets and comparative advantages under central
    planning.
         The Czech government implemented a pilot National Supplier Development Program (SDP)
    in 2000–02. The program focused on developing and promoting links between MNE inward
    investors and local SMEs. The program was demand driven and aimed at improving the competi-
    tiveness of Czech SMEs to the level required to enter GVCs by becoming suppliers to MNEs.
    A related objective was to develop a local world-class supplier base. A dozen MNEs were
    involved throughout the project, and 45 SMEs received targeted training based on needs
    revealed during business reviews.
         The SDP was implemented by CzechInvest, the Czech investment promotion agency. It was
    designed by the World Bank Foreign Investment Advisory Services and funded by the European
    Union preaccession PHARE Program. The program built on the United Kingdom and Irish experience.
    A team of two U.K. advisors joined the CzechInvest team for the pilot phase to ensure transfer of
    experience and build implementation capacity.
         The Czech SDP strengthened local companies’ skills and enhanced the beneﬁts of FDI to the
    local economy. Process and product upgrading have been evident at the supplier level. Business
    reviews showed an increase in company performance in areas required to meet MNE require-
    ments. An evaluation undertaken 18 months after the end of the 2000–02 period, surveying all
    45 companies participating in the pilot (with 42 responding), showed that 15 companies had gained
    new business, which they attributed to the program, with these contracts worth US$46 million for
    the period 2000–03. Four companies had also found new customers abroad, and three companies
    had obtained contracts for higher-value-added content. The share of components sourced from
    Czech companies by the MNEs participating in the program correspondingly increased, from a rate
    of 0–5 percent at the start to 2.5–30 percent by 2004.
         Following the success of the pilot SDP in electronics, the program was replicated in three
    other sectors. This expansion led to an increased focus on the local beneﬁts of FDI in national
    policy making, with CzechInvest playing a key policy advocacy role. The program also informed the
    development of the follow-on Czech national cluster policy.
         Driven by supply-side improvements in export performance, the Czech Republic experienced
    signiﬁcant gains in global market shares in the late 2000s. Export growth was driven by motor
    vehicles and machinery and electrical equipment sectors. Both have grown at double-digit rates
    over the last decade, and have shown continuous improvement in product quality, although clearly
    there is room for further progress.

Instruments to Support Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                   167
          Developing these capabilities is plagued by information asymmetries and coordina-
      tion failures. As with any other type of knowledge, there are important externalities asso-
      ciated with the gathering of foreign market information related to consumer preferences,
      business opportunities, quality and technical requirements, and so on. Private ﬁrms
      alone will not undertake this research if competitors can free ride. The same applies to
      pioneer exporters, who make a considerable investment in attempts to open foreign mar-
      kets, cultivating contacts, establishing distribution chains, and undertaking other costly
      activities that can be used by their rivals. Hence, there is a role for a dynamic export pro-
      motion effort that addresses these issues (see, for example, Lederman, Olarreaga, and
      Payton 2010; Lederman, Olarreaga, and Zavala 2013; Eaton et al. 2007).

          There are also more tailored skills involved in exporting. In the 1960s, after the
      liberalization of the Irish economy, the export promotion board in Ireland started a
      program to help domestic ﬁrms face tougher competition and enter export markets.
      The program provided a highly subsidized service, with two days of support services in
      market research, which included working with the companies on how to use market
      information. Artopoulos, Friel, and Hallak (2013) analyze case studies of successful
      Argentinean exporters and ﬁnd evidence that exporters to developed country markets
      adopt a new set of business practices that are very different from those used in the
      domestic market. The authors argue that export pioneers absorb the tacit knowledge
      about foreign markets by interacting with the business community of the export market.
      Exports then emerge as this tacit knowledge is disseminated throughout the sector.

         As discussed previously, developing an NQI (see box 7.2) involves not only helping ﬁrms
      improving their quality but also signaling this quality with standards compliance. This
      requires domestic infrastructure for testing and certiﬁcation; otherwise, ﬁrms are forced to
      be certiﬁed in third countries, increasing signiﬁcantly the sunk costs of exporting.

          Many of the programs to raise capabilities for trade and participation in GVCs are
      similar to those discussed earlier. Some MNEs provide an initial diagnostic of manage-
      ment and production functions, and then work with suppliers in upgrading their capa-
      bilities with more emphasis on quality and value chain issues. These programs have
      proliferated primarily around the automotive sector (see box 7.7) and electronics, and
      are currently implemented in most high- and middle-income countries. In other cases,
      technological centers such as those described above have focused on upgrading within
      existing linkages. These linkage programs offer powerful incentives for SMEs to invest in
      upgrading their production and technology, given the lower risk of efforts associated
      with a signiﬁcant increase in demand combined with reliable upgrading services.

      Other Instruments to Support Innovation

      One ﬁnal set of instruments pertains to the last stage of the capabilities escalator:
      supporting more complex R&D projects and the development of new technologies.
      Throughout this report we have documented the lack of formal R&D activities in most


168                                                                            The Innovation Paradox
ﬁrms in developing countries, and we have argued that much of the policy debate has
focused on how to increase R&D, without acknowledging that such activities require
complementary management capabilities. Firms must walk before they can run. It is
nonetheless the case that there are ﬁrms that have climbed the escalator and are ready
to undertake sophisticated R&D projects, and policy makers need to explore how best
to support them.

   Three instruments have traditionally been used to offset the externalities associated
with R&D: (1) tax incentives, (2) direct grants, and (3) research centers. Tax incentives
(see box 7.8) are pervasive in middle- and high-income countries. Although there is some



     BOX 7.8
    Tax Incentives to R&D Projects
    R&D tax incentives reduce the tax burden of ﬁrms that invest in eligible R&D activities, represent-
    ing an indirect way of supporting investments in R&D. On the basis of R&D tax incentive database
    deﬁnitions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),a we can
    differentiate between the following two main types of tax incentives for R&D:
        1. Tax incentives based on expenditures in R&D. This is the most common type of tax
           support for R&D, including corporate tax income beneﬁts, social security withholding tax
           incentives, reductions in tariffs for imported research equipment, and reimbursements of
           value added tax.
        2. Tax incentives based on results from R&D or related innovation activities. This type
           of tax support is generally applied to income generated from R&D activities and intellec-
           tual property (that is, income-based provisions). These schemes grant a lower corporate
           tax rate to ﬁrms on proﬁts generated from patents, licensing, or asset liquidation linked to
           R&D. Although the state of implementation of this type of instrument is incipient and
           its impacts have not been extensively evaluated, its popularity is increasing, particularly
           among OECD member states.
         Policy makers have used both narrow and broad approaches to the scope of support and eligi-
    bility of R&D expenditure.b Most schemes have taken into consideration the deﬁnitions of R&D
    expenditures under the OECD Frascati Manual, the 2015 edition of which provides guidelines on the
    measurement of government tax relief for R&D (OECD 2015). Considering the implementation expe-
    rience from OECD countries, policy makers have shown a preference for granting eligibility to R&D
    labor, subcontracted and collaborative R&D, and materials and overhead. The rationale appears to
    be the potential loss of embedded knowledge when physical assets are subsequently disposed of,
    and the fact that investments in R&D personnel can facilitate knowledge diffusion in the domestic
    economy. Although evidence suggests that generic and early-stage research is often more risky
    than applied research, only a few schemes reward basic over applied research. Designing these
    differentiated schemes is complex. Success depends, among other factors, on whether the imple-
    menting agency can manage the increasing complexities of schemes that rely on differentiation of
    spending by type of R&D or beneﬁciary, and on tying incentives closely to R&D spending.

         Tax Incentives to R&D Projects (continued)

         Overall impact
         Most studies indicate that tax incentives for R&D tend to have a positive impact, leading to addi-
         tional R&D investment. The impact, however, tends to focus on ﬁrms that already do R&D and
         larger ﬁrms. Impacts are larger for volume-based incentives because they tend to be more gener-
         ous. However, a recent important study (Lokshin and Mohnen 2013) indicates that these addition-
         ality effects tend to disappear over time, particularly for large ﬁrms as they crowd out private
         investments in R&D. Appelt et al. (2016) ﬁnd that smaller ﬁrms are more responsive to R&D tax
         incentives than larger ﬁrms. However, a worrying concern in the cases of Colombia and Malaysia
         was the lower participation among small ﬁrms than larger ones. This reduced participation may
         relate to the inherent characteristics of SMEs. SMEs tend to enjoy lower taxes in the ﬁrst place,
         for example, because they are often subject to simpliﬁed tax treatments or to a reduced bracket.
         In addition, although tax incentives seem to present stronger results among ﬁnancially constrained
         ﬁrms (Kasahara, Shimotsu, and Suzuki 2014), SMEs facing ﬁnancial constraints are less likely to
         use R&D tax credits when compared to direct support (Busom, Corchuelo, and Martinez-Ros 2014).
         SMEs may also be less informed and unaware of the availability of the scheme (in Colombia, only
         15 percent of ﬁrms knew about the existence of ﬁscal incentives). Finally, Appelt et al. (2016) sug-
         gest that the predictability of tax incentives matters. Results from a recent Finnish study indicate
         that tax deductions are below expected levels with temporary measures, supporting the premise
         that R&D investments imply signiﬁcant initial costs, and that returns take time to mature.

      evidence of additionality in generating more R&D investment, these incentives tend to
      concentrate in larger ﬁrms and, especially, in those ﬁrms that already carry out R&D.
      In addition, the ﬁrst two instruments do not tend to encourage interactions among actors
      in the system, with the exception of grants that are designed for collaborative projects.

         The institutions that design and implement tax incentives require certain capabilities.
      The ﬁrst requirement is a mature and agile tax system. If ﬁrms can avoid scrutiny by
      the tax authorities as to how the resources are really being spent, the impact will be
      minimal. In addition, some schemes require coordination between a line agency with
      R&D responsibilities and a tax authority that can process applications through the tax
      collection system. Sophisticated designs, such as those that differentiate between spend-
      ing categories and beneﬁciaries, will increase the complexity of implementation and
      thus pose challenges for policy makers.

          Grants and matching grants have always been the most common type of direct support
      instrument used to increase business R&D and non-R&D innovation activities (ﬁgure 7.6).

They usually ﬁnance speciﬁc expenditures of innovation projects, including proof of con-
cept, prototyping, testing, machinery, technical assistance, and so on. In the case of match-
ing grants, public agencies match a percentage contribution of the project made by the
applicant. Grant schemes can vary from very simplistic, one-off funding allocations to
complex strategic programs built on formal public-private partnerships. Very often grants
function jointly with other types of instruments to achieve particular policy objectives.
In theory, matching grants foment partnerships and the densiﬁcation of innovation net-
works in the NIS. However, again, they require capable partners in the private sector, and
these have often been scarce in developing countries. Grants not delivered in conjunction
with mentoring or technical assistance are effective only if ﬁrms can design good innova-
tion projects but lack ﬁnancing.

   The evidence on these schemes is mixed, although a signiﬁcant number of studies
ﬁnd a positive impact of grant schemes on business innovation, especially regarding
input and behavioral additionality. The evidence regarding output and outcome addi-
tionality is positive, although scarce, especially in developing countries. Syntheses/
meta-analyses, such as García-Quevedo (2004), Zúñiga-Vicente et al. (2014), and Becker
(2015), all conclude that most of the evidence focuses on input additionalities—impact
on innovation expenditure—and hardly any evidence focuses on innovation outcomes


Instruments to Support Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                                                                       171
      and ﬁrm performance. Some evaluations of grants in the OECD suggest that these can
      be more effective in supporting R&D projects than tax incentives (Arqué-Castells and
      Mohnen 2015). A recent evaluation by Bruhn and McKenzie (2017) of Poland’s In-Tech
      program, a grant to projects that are carried out by consortia of ﬁrms and research enti-
      ties, shows that the program leads to more science–industry collaboration, higher prob-
      ability of applying for a patent or publishing a research paper related to the project, and
      positive effects on commercialization of products related to the proposed project.
      However, more evidence is needed given the huge popularity of these instruments in
      supporting innovation to establish its effectiveness in supporting innovation.

         Public research institutes constitute a ﬁnal instrument used to support both
      applied and basic R&D. As we discussed above in the case of EMBRAPA in agricul-
      ture, these tend to be sector speciﬁc and perform contract R&D on demand. Perhaps
      the most well-known centers are the Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany, which func-
      tion as a complex network that helps ﬁrms develop technological capabilities as well
      as perform R&D projects of different complexity. This model is difﬁcult to replicate,
      given the very large in-house technological capabilities required, but a signiﬁcant
      number of applied R&D centers have been implemented in developing countries.
      Evidence is thin on their impact, although Link and Scott (2009), looking at Latin
      American case studies of similar models discussed in the previous chapter, show
      unclear mission orientation and poor design, suggesting that in many cases the
      impact is likely to be limited.

         Lack of impact of these instruments is exacerbated when countries mimic the
      organograms of advanced countries but do not design institutions with an idea of
      resolving a local problem. For this reason, this report has proposed a gradual building
      up of innovation instruments with adherence to a framework that focuses on failures to
      be redressed and the appropriate accompanying incentives system. Only following this
      gradual approach can these institutions generate quality knowledge relevant to the
      needs of the private sector.

          While the focus of the report is primarily on existing ﬁrms, ideally, the policy mix
      would offer support across all stages of the ﬁrm life and innovation cycle, including
      start-ups (see ﬁgure 7.7), given that productivity growth is driven both by upgrading
      within existing sectors as well as by start-ups. However, two key issues should be kept
      in mind in allocating resources between incumbents and new entrants. First, the
      potential impact of these early-stage instruments, such as incubators and accelerators,
      or equity instruments that target start-ups in the tech sector is constrained by the
      limited contribution of this sector to the overall economy, in terms of both employ-
      ment and ﬁrm growth. Second, the most important support is often missing in the
      most difﬁcult phase of ﬁrm growth, the scale-up phase after the ﬁrm has been estab-
      lished (Isenberg 2012).

Instruments to Support Firm Capabilities for Innovation                                                                173
      Concluding Remarks
      This chapter has highlighted the set of policy instruments that can support the building
      of innovation capabilities. As discussed in the previous chapter, innovation policy in
      developing countries is more challenging and complex than in advanced countries
      because the market failures and missing complementarities are likely to be more acute.
      A way of reducing the demands on government capabilities is to engage in a gradual
      process of accumulating instruments. This results in an inverted pyramid (as suggested
      in ﬁgure 7.3), where the instruments available increase as both ﬁrm capabilities for
      innovation and government capabilities for design and implementation increase.

         Dividing the capabilities escalator—the process of transition to the technological
      frontier—in three stages offers heuristic help in deﬁning the set of instruments that
      should be prioritized. Economies at the base of the escalator beneﬁt more from support to
      management and production capabilities, and then evolve toward technology extension
      and support to R&D projects as knowledge and capabilities are accumulated. While
      there is heterogeneity in sophistication of ﬁrms so that the stages may not be so clearly
      deﬁned, the approach that has been traditionally followed by many countries of jump-
      ing right to the ﬁnal stage and focusing primarily on R&D is unlikely to be effective.

          Although this report has focused on a subset of instruments deemed to be more
      important for capabilities accumulation, clearly there is a much broader range of innova-
      tion support instruments. A detailed overview of such instruments highlighted in
      ﬁgure 7.1, with a description of the conditions of implementation and evidence on impact,
      is provided in a parallel volume to this report: Instruments to Support Business Innovation:
      A Guide for Policy Makers and Practitioners. Further, in the background remains the
      broader agenda of removing the barriers to all necessary complementary factors—human
      and physical capital—through an ongoing process of structural reform.

          One ﬁnal priority for innovation policy is closing the evidence gap. The evaluation
      agenda in innovation policy is still in its inception and tends to be focused primarily in
      OECD countries and on a few instruments, such as R&D tax incentives or grants for inno-
      vation. To date, there is very little evidence on innovation programs in developing countries.
      It is thus critical to systematize impact evaluations of innovation policies in innovation
      agencies and even coordinate in a global overall knowledge strategy perhaps through
      international organizations, so lessons can be shared across the practitioner community.

Annex 7A The Capabilities Escalator in Singapore: The Menu of
Instruments
Singapore provides a suite of instruments to SMEs that want to upgrade their capa-
bilities. SMEs start the engagement at the SME Centre, which is generally run by
the trade association (chamber of commerce), where SPRING covers the costs of the
business development services that they undertake. As a ﬁrst step, a business advisor
visits the ﬁrm and provides a diagnostic suggesting the upgrading area and matching
the SME to a local private sector consultant. As ﬁrms grow more sophisticated, they
may be matched with an account manager in SPRING who acts as their “general
practitioner” doctor.

   Singapore provides a broad menu of instruments to support upgrading though
SPRING and A*STAR, depending of the sophistication of the SME’s capabilities.
The former provides support to management upgrading to those ﬁrms primarily at the
bottom of the escalator, whereas the latter combines instruments for upgrading tech-
nology in ﬁrms with more sophisticated capabilities.

  Speciﬁcally, SPRING offers the following schemes to support and ﬁnance upgrading
Maloney (2017a):

    ■   Support and Toolkit Online. EnterpriseOne is a Single Window portal that helps
        ﬁrms navigate the government’s programs. Further, SPRING has an online Toolkit
        that includes Self-help guides on Customer Service, Financial Management,
        Human Resource Capability, Marketing, and Productivity.
    ■   Innovation and Capability Voucher (ICV): The entryway to government pro-
        grams is a S$5,000 voucher to upgrade and strengthen core business operations
        through consultancy projects in innovation, productivity, human resources, and
        ﬁnancial management.
    ■   Loans. These include the Micro Loan Program, Local Enterprise Fund Scheme,
        and Loan Insurance Scheme—the government pays 50 percent of the cost of
        insurance through a third party for trade credit or working capital. The Local
        Enterprise Finance Scheme (LEFS) helps SMEs secure ﬁnancing for productive
        assets, working with a partner ﬁnancial ﬁrm to get SMEs loans of up to
        S$15 million, with tenure of up to 10 years.
    ■   Capability and Development Grant (CDG). This program covers from 0 to
        70 percent of costs—up to S$100,000—for technical upgrading. Eligible activities
        include consultancy, manpower, training, certiﬁcation, upgrading productivity
        and developing business capabilities for process improvement, product develop-
        ment, and market access. There are 10 areas: (1) Brand Development, (2) Business
        Innovation and Design, (3) Business Strategy Development, (4) Quality and
        Standards Enhancement, (5) Financial Management, (6) Human Capital Devel-
        opment, (7) Intellectual Property, (8) Franchising and Productivity Improvement,

             (9) Services Excellence, and (10) Technology. Firms may apply to SPRING, and
             may be recruited by SPRING directly or through the chambers of commerce,
             which are on the lookout for promising ﬁrms.
         ■   Productivity and Innovation Credit scheme (PIC). Firms may either deduct
             40 percent of investment or receive a cash payout of 60 percent up to S$100,000
             for each year in all six qualifying activities of investment, including acquisition
             of information technology and automation equipment, training of employees,
             registration of patents, trade market designs and plant varieties, acquisition and
             in-licensing of intellectual property rights, project design, and R&D.

         At a higher level of sophistication, A*STAR provides a range of products to support
      technological upgrading:

         ■   Growing Enterprises with Technological Upgrade. GET-Up is an industry pro-
             gram managed by the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) that
             seeks to upgrade technological capabilities of local SMEs to enhance global com-
             petitiveness. It involves numerous agencies that together provide a holistic and
             concerted assistance. T-Up (Technology for Enterprise Capability) seconds
             research scientists to companies to build in-house R&D/technical capabilities
             through projects deﬁned and managed by the companies. This can include new
             products and processes, setting up a new technical department, or technological
             transfer from oversees.
         ■   Operational and Technology Roadmapping (OTR). Firms can hire experts from
             A*STAR to help create operations and technology roadmaps, through ﬁve half-
             day sessions that seek to align ﬁrm technology acquisition with business goals.
             Payment can be with the ICV.
         ■   Technology Adoption Program (TAP). This program seeks to match ﬁrm needs
             with existing technologies. A*STAR works with ﬁrms to pilot new technologies
             and adapt them to the business needs of the local SMEs.
         ■   SIMTech, the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology. This institu-
             tion operates within A*STAR and offers a basic lean implementation program
             through lean techniques and continuous improvement (Kaizen). It includes a
             4.5-day classroom session and an 8.5-day mentoring session onsite in basic lean
             techniques such as 6S workplace organization, plant-re-layout, SMED (Single-
             Minute Exchange of Die) and TPM (Total Productive Maintenance). SIMTECH
             predicts that completion of the program can help achieve a 30–50 percent reduc-
             tion in inventories, a 20–50 percent reduction in cycle times, a 20–40 percent
             reduction in delivery lead times, a 10–40 percent increase in labor productivity,
             a 20–40 percent reduction in space use, and a 20–50 percent reduction in defects.
             The total cost is estimated to be S$12,000. SPRING ﬁnances 70 percent, and
             an additional PIC cash payout reduces it even further to S$2,280, for roughly an
             80 percent subsidy.

    Other resources available for upgrading and innovation:

    ■   Centers of Innovation. These offer technical advice in six areas. There have been
        efforts to make them self-sustaining, although in practice they are heavily ﬁnanced
        by matching grants.
    ■   Local Enterprise and Association Development Programme (LEAD). This is a
        multiagency effort to enhance industry and enterprise competitiveness via trade
        associations and chambers of commerce (TACs). The TACs drive initiatives to
        upgrade capabilities and lead internationalization efforts.
    ■   Partnership for Capability Transformation (PACT). This program fosters
        collaboration between SMEs and large enterprises (deﬁned as >S$100 million).
        The state underwrites up to 60 percent of approved projects in knowledge trans-
        fer from the large organization, capability upgrading of the large ﬁrm’s new or
        existing suppliers, development, and testing of innovative solutions between
        large ﬁrms and at least one SME.
    ■   The PACT now encompasses an earlier program that created incentives for MNEs
        to mentor local ﬁrms into world-class suppliers, especially for technologically in-
        tensive industries. As part of this effort in 1986 the Economic Development Board
        (EDB) implemented the Local Industry Upgrading Program (LIUP). In this pro-
        gram the EDB enters remunerative contractual relationships with MNEs to sec-
        ond experienced engineers to work with the EDB as an LIUP manager. The LIUP
        manager works with engineering and technical employees of a local ﬁrm to create
        necessary technology and skills for the local ﬁrm to become a supplier to the men-
        toring MNE.
    ■   Programs for building SME human capital. Singapore has a variety of other
        programs for building future SME leaders, strengthening existing management,
        and strengthening middle management and promising executives.
    ■   Several ﬁnancial and technical assistance schemes were set up. The Local Industry
        Finance Scheme (LEFS) described above gave loans to buy machinery and equip-
        ment. The Local Enterprise Technical Assistance Scheme (LETAS) gave grants to
        engage external experts to upgrade operations and management.
    ■   Human capital upgrading. EDB also worked with MNEs to set up training cen-
        ters for skills that could be of use across many industries, thus promoting inter-
        industry spillovers. Government ﬁnances the project but decided to leave the
        training to the MNEs rather than setting up public sector training centers and
        schools (Blomström, Kokko, and Sjöholm 2002). The Skills Development Fund
        (SDF) shared the costs of investing in skills upgrading of the workforce.
    ■   Cluster Policy. The government identiﬁed and supported 14 clusters, many
        cross-cutting, including commodity trading, shipping, precision engineering,
        electronics, information technology, petroleum and petrochemical, construc-
        tion, heavy engineering, ﬁnance, insurance, general supporting industries, and
        tourism. Each cluster was subjected to the market test for efﬁciency and

            competitiveness, and each has some common core comparative advantage in
            terms of natural advantages, created competitive advantages, or industry struc-
            ture. These clusters undertook higher-end tasks, while assembly work was pro-
            gressively off-shored. A*STAR also sponsored 12 research institutes that
            undertake R&D related to industry needs.


      Notes
      1. The term “policy mix” was traditionally used in the macroeconomics literature (Flanagan,
         Uyarra, and Laranja 2011). The use of different instruments has been an important element of
         public policy for many decades. A good example is Tinbergen’s well-known rule that there must
         be as many policy instruments as policy goals (Tinbergen 1952). The use of the term “policy mix”
         in innovation policy gained traction especially after the emergence of the National Innovation
         System literature in the 1980s and 1990s (Cunningham et al. 2013), and has become a dominant
         part of the innovation policy jargon.
      2. At a higher level of aggregation and given that constraints to any type of investment will also
         discourage investments in ﬁrm capabilities and innovation, policies to spur innovation need
         to include policies to improve the investment climate. Thus, as chapter 2 stressed, innovation
         policies need to be coordinated with policies governing education, competition, macroeconomic
         stability, and labor market institutions (see Aghion, David, and Foray 2009). At the policy instru-
         ment level, complementarities are also important. Instruments that ﬁnance early-stage product
         development often will not be effective without instruments that ﬁnance commercialization.
         Inducing more research–industry collaboration can be supported by demand-side measures, for
         instance using vouchers that encourage ﬁrms to collaborate with universities. Supply-side mea-
         sures, such as setting up technology transfer ofﬁces or placement programs for researchers, can
         also be used. Moreover, overall success may require policies to reward researchers for working
         with industry or perhaps for participating in business ventures, as well as an intellectual property
         system that rewards commercialization.
      3. A more detailed description of these instruments and practical considerations for their imple-
         mentation can be found in the parallel document to this report, the innovation policy guide
         (World Bank 2017).
      4. The literature focusing on informal microenterprises also has looked at the impact of changing
         entrepreneurial traits. In an experiment looking at supporting personal initiative traits in a sample of
         109 Ugandan businesses, Campos et al. (2017) show that ﬁrms that went through training to instill a
         mindset of greater personal initiative have introduced more new products than a control group.
      5. The subjective scale ranges from 1 to 10 and the objective from 1 to 5. We have simply divided the
         former by two and this may lead to a misalignment of means. Nevertheless, the downward slope
         would remain however we center the data.
      6. As Petar Stojic, the former Director of Business Support Policy for Britain’s Department for
         Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), which oversees the Manufacturing Advisory Service, com-
         ments: “After they have worked with MAS, they understand the value of lean principles and/or
         better innovation practices and the value of external expertise in general, so when they have to
         pay the full rate in the future, they now know what to look for and have greater conﬁdence in
         approaching the market. In reality, far from supplanting private market advisory services, coun-
         tries’ manufacturing extension services tend to help SME manufacturers understand their value.”
         Cited in Ezell and Atkinson (2011).
      7. For example, Suzuki and Igei (2017) show how an intervention in Thailand aimed at improving
         the efﬁciency and quality of BDS providers, by creating and supporting a network of providers,
         had positive impacts on both BDS providers and SME performance.

8. The Continuing Challenge of
   Innovation and Capability Building
   in Developing Countries


The adoption of new processes and products by ﬁrms constitutes a central dimension
of productivity growth and hence of economic development. The fruits of innovation—
Mokyr’s (2002) “Gifts of Athena”—have powered the advanced countries to levels of
prosperity unimaginable even a century ago. And, as Schumpeter noted, the ability of
lagging countries to tap into a now massive stock of global know-how and technical
knowledge—to be able to adopt what has already been invented—is a potential transfer
of wealth from rich to poor of historic proportions.

   Yet relatively few developing countries have proven able to leverage this stock of
knowledge to achieve sustained catch-up with advanced countries. This report begins
by offering novel and detailed evidence on innovation patterns across developing
countries. Although many ﬁrms report innovating in some way, more standardized
measures, such as novel innovations and licensing or research and development
(R&D), suggest very little is done by poor countries. These low rates of technological
adoption represent a missed opportunity for reducing global poverty and inequality of
equally historic proportions. Indeed, the apparent reluctance of ﬁrms and govern-
ments to pursue these opportunities in an aggressive and sustained manner poses an
“innovation paradox”: low investment in projects that by some measures would yield
returns exceeding any other investment that poor countries could consider.

   The report argues that this is not due to some irrationality on the part of developing
country ﬁrms and governments. Nor is it simply a question of remedying the com-
monly articulated knowledge-related market failures. Rather, innovation in the devel-
oping world faces barriers that are orders of magnitude more challenging than those
found in the advanced world along three key dimensions.

    First, the dimensionality of the innovation problem is much greater. The advanced
country literature can focus on appropriation externalities and other market failures
affecting the accumulation of knowledge as a justiﬁcation for a relatively narrow set of
interventions because it can assume that most other markets function well and the
necessary complementary factors are available. This is emphatically not the case in




                                                                                            183
      developing countries, which implies that the scope of the National Innovation System
      that policy makers must keep in their heads is much larger than in advanced countries
      and must include everything that affects the accumulation of all types of capital—
      physical, human, and knowledge assets—such as the business climate, the trade regime,
      labor regulations, tax regimes, or macroeconomic volatility.

          It also implies that what looks like an innovation problem, such as a low rate of
      investment in R&D, may not be so, but rather reﬂect barriers to accumulating other
      factors, including physical and human capital. A ﬁrm may not invest in R&D because it
      is unable to import or ﬁnance the necessary machinery or to staff the project with the
      right technicians. Either shortage will depress the return on investment in R&D and
      thus validate the low rates of investment we see. Therefore, in determining the appro-
      priate rate of innovation activities for an economy, it is important to consider the avail-
      ability of other types of capital and complementary factors. For example, the common
      comparisons of gross domestic expenditure on R&D, under the assumption that more
      is better, are not justiﬁed.

          Second, ﬁrm capabilities ranging from basic managerial skills to engineering capac-
      ity constitute a key missing complementary factor. They are critical ingredients of the
      absorptive capacity needed to facilitate technological adoption and to manage more
      complex innovation and R&D. The report shows that basic ﬁrm capabilities, too,
      diminish with distance from the frontier; hence, constructing the entire capabilities
      escalator is a central goal of developing country innovation policy. As the cover paint-
      ing by Remedios Varo “The Creation of Birds” captures, metaphorically we need to
      teach ﬁrms how to ﬂy. As we show, interventions in this realm are a standard part of the
      policy tool kit in the advanced world, and the upgrading of ﬁrm capabilities is the
      central ingredient of the Asian miracle in many narratives.

          Third, weak capabilities on the government side compound the difﬁculties involved
      in constructing a functional National Innovation System (NIS) and building private sec-
      tor capability. That is, the complexity and depth of the problems involved in innovation
      are greater in developing countries, while government capabilities to manage them are
      weaker. Innovation policy thus requires an honest balancing of capabilities with tasks,
      which demands working on a selective set of issues at a given moment rather than trying
      to import a full set of institutions and policies. More important, the common policy bias
      toward focusing mostly or exclusively on supporting R&D in low- and middle-income
      countries is likely to be misplaced. R&D is an important input for innovation, but it
      requires a set of capabilities that are unlikely to be met by many ﬁrms in developing
      countries. The report attempts to take a systematic look at how policy should be formu-
      lated across the different stages of the capabilities escalator.

         To this end, it also, implicitly, makes a plea for more accurate measurement to help
      policy makers understand innovation in their economies and better benchmark per-
      formance of ﬁrms and the NIS. The analytical work here brings to light important

shortcomings in the way statistical agencies are collecting and interpreting data.
The lack of consistency in how ﬁrms interpret product and process innovation leads to
poorer countries often appearing to be more innovative than more advanced countries,
when other measures, such as the low productivity growth associated with innovation,
suggest that the measurement of innovation needs to be revisited regarding both sur-
vey design and implementation.1 In addition, although the World Management Survey
employed here has been central to generating comparisons of capabilities across coun-
tries, we lack measures of higher-order technological capabilities. Even basic measures,
such as presence of engineers in ﬁrms, are scarce, let alone measures of practices that
support more sophisticated innovation.

   Both better analytical frameworks and better data are necessary as developing
countries face the dramatic and unpredictable evolution of the world economy.
Numerous authors highlight rapid automation, a shift away from manufacturing
and more toward services, and a less sure path of following the ﬂying geese that the
Asian miracles followed with such success (see, for example, Brynjolfsson and
McAfee 2011, 2014; Rodrik 2016; Maloney and Molina 2016; Hallward-Driemeier
and Nayyar 2017).
    Some see a shift in technological paradigm to industry 4.0—characterized by the
integration of big data with production processes (see OECD 2017)—that may
change the parameters on how innovation is implemented, potentially allowing leap-
frogging by developing countries (see also Lee 2016). It is still too early to identify
what changes to production structures will become predominant, although some
important changes are already occurring. The move from ﬁxed and mass production
to more ﬂexible and mass customization production will require different sets of
skills but also strong organizational and managerial practices to process and use data
integration, manage leaner stocks and logistics systems, or coordinate production
processes. Similarly, more ﬂexible production systems are likely to require additional
capabilities for information technology engineers, as well as new business models
and customer relationships.

   The shift toward services will also require a different set of capabilities in some
dimensions from those required in manufacturing. Speciﬁcally, the literature on
innovation in services suggests a more important role for human, design, and organi-
zational factors than in manufacturing, and less reliance on R&D and scientiﬁc knowl-
edge, because innovation in services is often more employee led than technology
driven. Managerial and organizational practices are thus at least as important for
services as they are for manufacturing.

   Much of this literature is necessarily speculative beyond the general consensus
that the rate of change appears to be accelerating. We cannot know with assurance
which sectors will offer rapid routes to prosperity or what technologies will drive
them. However, Pasteur’s counsel that “fortune favors the prepared mind” remains as

      vitally relevant for countries as for people, and we have attempted to provide a map
      of areas where policy makers need to ensure they are ready. Raising the capabilities of
      ﬁrms to manage this uncertainty and chart their way forward, ensuring that the inno-
      vation system provides necessary complementary inputs and ﬂows of knowledge, and
      strengthening government capabilities to manage a large and expanding set of chal-
      lenges are all keys to resolving the innovation paradox and preparing countries for
      the opportunities ahead.

      Note
       1. In this regard, current efforts in the new edition of the Oslo Manual to better measure innovation
          through innovation surveys are very important and should be treated as a global public good,
          especially in relation to improve the way innovation is measured in developing countries.
