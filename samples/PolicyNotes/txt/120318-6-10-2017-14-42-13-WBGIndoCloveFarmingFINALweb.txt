EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Indonesia is the world’s largest clove producer, cultivating more than 70% of the
world’s crop. The vast preponderance of Indonesia’s annual clove harvest, around 90%, is pur-
chased each year by the Indonesian tobacco industry to produce kreteks.

Many thousands of Indonesian households grow cloves, but it typically comprises
only a small proportion of their total economic activity. Recent government data suggest
that more than one million farmers grow cloves in Indonesia (IAKMI, p. 67). Given that clove
production is a fraction of broader household production/resources of most clove-farming
households and the labour involved in clove farming is intermittent and concentrated only at
specific relatively brief times of the years (e.g., harvest), actual full-time equivalent employment
is much smaller.

This report on the economics of clove farming is motivated by the recent evolution
of the taxation of kreteks and other tobacco products in Indonesia. Over more than a
decade, the Indonesian government has slowly been raising excise taxes on tobacco products.
More recently, the government has considered reforming the excise tax structure even further
by collapsing the number of tiers of taxation rates while also generally raising these rates. The
government has articulated concern that these tax reforms, while mitigating consumption of a
harmful product, could also affect the economic lives of those in the kretek value chain. Clove
farmers are part of this value chain.

This report aims to inform the current debate over the taxation of kreteks in Indone-
sia by examining clove-farming livelihoods. It presents results from a comprehensive,
household-level, economically-focused survey of 600 clove farmers across the two largest
clove-growing regions, Sulawesi and Central Java. The survey examines the role that clove
farming plays in these households’ economic lives, among other
related topics.

This report is part of the Indonesia Tobacco Employment Studies implemented by the
World Bank and the American Cancer Society. The findings from this report complement
the findings from three closely-related reports focusing on specific segments of tobacco sector
employment in Indonesia: tobacco farmers (World Bank 2017b), kretek workers or “hand-roll-
ers” (World Bank 2017c) and tobacco manufacturing more broadly (World Bank, 2017d).

The main findings of this report include:

   •	 Though hundreds of thousands of farmers grow cloves in Indonesia, tobacco tax
      reform is unlikely to cause a large economic disruption for most clove-growing
      households because more than half of households derived less than 20 percent
      of their income from cloves. Clove farming is not the primary source of economic
      livelihood for most households that grow cloves;




4 // Executive Summary
   •	 Clove farming is not highly lucrative for many farmers, particularly in certain
      regions such as Minahasa. After incorporating the costs of household labor, the aver-
      age clove-farming household was losing more than two dollars per kilogram;

   •	 Individuals in clove-farming households in the survey were on average poorer
      than the average Indonesian household—11.1 percent of Indonesians fall below the
      national poverty line compared to 37 percent of these clove-farming households;

   •	 A loss to a household from lower clove production should not be presumed
      because many clove-growing households with their varied economic activities
      are likely to be able to effectively reallocate factors of production (including capital,
      land and/or labour) to other productive activities such as alternative crops or a small
      business;
      {{   Land might be better allocated to more proven economically-lucrative pur-
           suits, particularly in places where there are clear viable options such as growing more
           of locally-grown cash crops (e.g., rice, corn, and green vegetables, among others).


Recommendations
In terms of considering what might happen if there were a change in tax policy that affected
demand for Indonesian cloves, it is important to emphasize that clove farming is not particu-
larly profitable for most clove-producing households in at least a couple of major clove-pro-
ducing districts. The government needs to research which alternatives could be viable and tar-
get the least-profitable areas for switching and help these farmers make successful transitions
to growing other crops and/or economic activities.

   •	 In case of negative effects from higher tobacco taxes, the government could
      help clove farmers to identify other economically fruitful pursuits.
      {{   Research which alternative locally-grown crops are most viable on former
           clove-producing land;
      {{   Enhance supply and value chains for these alternative local crops;


   •	 Support research to identify the areas where clove production is least viable
      (e.g., Minahasa) and target those areas for alternatives first;
   •	 Improve agricultural extension services for non-clove crops;
   •	 Provide educational grants for improving clove farmers’ agricultural management skills;
   •	 Improve access to credit for farmers to grow other crops or pursue other small economic
      enterprises such as a small shop, fish farming, or a local transportation business.
      {{   Provide grants or low-interest loans to farmers willing to switch to alternative
           crops; and
      {{   Introduce financial programs or economic development programs as forms of transi-
           tion assistance away from clove cultivation.

O                            Indonesia is the largest producer of cloves in the world. The Food and Agriculture
                             Organization’s (FAO) most recent statistics on clove production (from 2013) report that
                             Indonesia produced more than 70% of the world’s cloves, largely by smallholder farmers




N
                             (i.e., not plantations). In contrast, the next largest producer, Madagascar, produced ~16%
                             of the world’s cloves. Important to the broader inquiry of this research, the vast prepon-
                             derance of Indonesia’s annual clove harvest (usually ~100,000 metric tons)—typically
                             around 90 percent—is purchased each year by the Indonesian tobacco industry to pro-
                             duce kreteks. Figure 1 shows smallholder (less than four hectares) production from 1990
                             to 2015 by ton.

                             Because of the large domestic demand for cloves, in most years, only a small pro-
                             portion, ~5 percent, is exported. Occasionally, after a strong yield over one or more




L
                             years, Indonesian clove exports increase. For example, in 2016, the UN trade statistics
                             database reports that approximately 40% of the value of total world clove exports were
                             from Indonesia, which was atypical. Inversely, in the occasional low yield year, clove
                             imports have increased to meet domestic demand. See Figure 2 below to track trends in
                             clove imports and exports from 1990 to 2013.

The Indonesian clove crop is typically grown on around 500,000 hectares of land,
though the monetary value of the crop fluctuates with price. In early 2016, the Indo-
nesia Clove Farmer Association (APCI) estimated that the average price was around $7.19/
kg. The same association suggested that this was a profit margin of more than 25% for
farmers. The results from the survey reported below do not match in terms of price—
farmers consistently reported average lower prices.

Many thousands of Indonesian households grow cloves, but it typically comprises
only a small proportion of their total economic activity. Though employment statis-
tics are scarce, perhaps because growing cloves is only a small part of these households’
economic activities, according to a recent report from the Indonesian Public Health Asso-
ciation (IAKMI, p. 67), the government reported that more than one million Indonesian
individuals were contributing labour to growing cloves in 2012. It is critical to note—a
dynamic supported strongly by the survey results presented in this report—that clove
production is a fraction of broader household production/resources of most clove-farm-
ing households. Furthermore, clove farming is by nature very rarely the source of full-
time employment for most of these individuals, since the labour involved in clove farm-
ing is intermittent and concentrated at specific times of the years, such as at harvest.

This report aims to inform the current debate over the taxation of kreteks in
Indonesia. As the Indonesian government considers reforming its excise tax structure
and rates, there have been concerns that these tax reforms could also affect the eco-
nomic lives of those in the kretek value chain. Clove farmers are part of this value chain.
Accordingly, in this report, we examine empirically the economic livelihoods of clove
farmers in Indonesia, largely by analyzing the results of a comprehensive, household-level
economically-focused survey of 600 clove farmers across the two largest clove-growing



12 // Introduction
regions, Sulawesi and Central Java. The survey examines the role that clove farming plays
in these households’ economic lives, among other related topics. This report is part of the
Indonesia Tobacco Employment Studies implemented by the World Bank and the Amer-
ican Cancer Society. The findings from this report complements the findings from the
other reports which focused on other specific segments of the tobacco sector employ-
ment in Indonesia, more specifically tobacco farmers (World Bank 2017b), kretek workers
(World Bank 2017c) and tobacco manufacturing more broadly (World Bank, 2017d).

The report is structured as follows: the next section, section 2, presents a summary of
survey methods and the analysis undertaken. Then the following section, section 3,
presents the results of the analyses of the survey data. It begins with an examination of
the socio-demographic characteristics of the households. Next, it tracks the economic
situation of the households including their broad economic endeavors, costs of growing
cloves, prices of and incomes from cloves, credit and debt to grow cloves, and alterna-
tives to cloves. It also tracks household assets. The subsequent sections focus on specific
issues, such as farmers’ wellbeing, child labour, health and food security. The final sec-
tions, discusses limitations of the study and present conclusions, respectively.

    METHODS
    The report utilizes a household-level survey of a nationally representative sample
    of clove-producing households. To examine the economic livelihoods of clove-farming
    households in Indonesia, we developed a survey instrument derived in large part from
    previous surveys used to evaluate the economic livelihoods of tobacco farmers in Africa
    and Southeast Asia, and the World Bank’s Living Standards Measurement Survey (see
    Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016; World Bank,
    2017). The survey was particularly focused on collecting data on household economic
    activity, including all sources of clove-farming revenue and production. At the same time,
    it queried respondents comprehensively on the costs of running both their agricultural
    and non-agricultural businesses, including both hired and household labor, to provide a
    complete snapshot of each household’s economic life.

    To implement the survey, we purposively selected the two top clove-producing
    provinces, North Sulawesi and Central Java, which typically account for more than
    70 percent of clove production. In each province, we selected the two highest-produc-
    ing kabupaten (districts). In each kabupaten, we randomly selected one top-producing
    kecamatan (subdistrict) and one second-tier producing kecamatan. Within each selected
    kecamatan, we chose the three highest-producing villages. In each selected village, we
    selected the sub-village with the largest number of farmers according to the village infor-
    mant. We went door to door to verify that the farmers listed were indeed current farmers.
    If we verified 50 farmers in the first sub-village, we stopped and used that list to draw our
    sample. If we could not find and verify 50 farmers, we went to the next sub-village to get
    the additional ones. From the sub-villages in which we could list 50 farmers, we randomly
    selected 25 to interview. A complete list of these districts and municipalities is available
    in the supplementary appendices available upon request. The report utilizes mainly thick,
    descriptive statistics of the survey results, but also utilizes causal analysis where appropri-
    ate, particularly for food security.

         RESULTS

O        3.1 - Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Clove Farmers
         Clover farmers’ households are typically headed by married males, usually older




N
         than average and with an elementary school education or less. In Table 1, we pres-
         ent the basic socio-demographic characteristics of the heads of the clove-farming house-
         holds—household heads were overwhelmingly male (95.5%) and married (88.2%). They
         tended to be older than the average population with 69% between 36 and 60 years of
         age (the average age in 2016 in Indonesia was 27), and another ~25% who were older




O
         than 60 years. The majority (~60%) had an elementary school education or less. More
         than two-thirds (69%) reported agriculture as their principal activity.

Clove-farming households average four people. In Table 2, we present the size of
clove-farming households. The median household size was four, typically with two peo-
ple older than 36 years, one between 21 and 35, and then one who was younger than 21.
Households were as few as one and as large as 10.

3.2 - Household Assets
Most clove-farming households demonstrated some asset accumulation. For exam-
ple, as presented in Table 3, approximately 90% of households reported having a TV and/
or a mobile (cell) phone. More than three quarters of households owned at least one
motorcycle. Nearly half of households had a VCR/DVD player or similar device.

Many clove farmers reported other agricultural assets, particularly poultry and/or
small livestock. In Figure 3, we report on households’ livestock assets. Slightly more than
half of the clove-farming households reported owning chickens while nearly 40% indi-
cated owning small livestock such as goats and sheep. Only approximately 20% reported
owning large livestock such as buffalo, cows or horses, which is lower than for the general
agricultural population which is appoximately 40 percent according to the most recent
Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS, 2016).

Most clove farmers reported a variety of non-livestock agricultural assets. In Table
4, we report clove farmers’ non-livestock agricultural assets. More than half (57%) of
farmers reported owning a cangkul (a “hoe” in English) used to loosen earth, among other
activities. More than one quarter of households reported owning a chopping machine
that can chop raw agricultural products. Roughly one quarter of households reported
owning a sabit (a “sickle” in English), which is a hand-held agricultural chopping imple-
ment. Very few households reported owning more expensive agricultural assets such as a
pump, a plough or a tractor.

20 // Results
The total size of land of clove-farming households owned and cultivated for cloves
varied within and across regions. As Figure 4 reports, the median size of the land plots
owned and cultivated was generally much greater in Sulawesi. In Bolaang Mongondo
and Minahasa, the median household owned 2 hectares. In Minahasa, they cultivated
most of it (on average about 1.75 ha). In Bolaang Mongondow, farmers on average cul-
tivated about three-quarters of their land. In Java, the median plot sizes were smaller, 1
hectare in Wonogiri and just over half of a hectare in Pemalang. In Pemalang, perhaps
due to the small plot size, all farmers reported cultivating all of their
cultivable land.

Most clove-farming households owned the land on which they are growing cloves.
As Figure 5 illustrates, households owned the vast majority, ~92%, of land parcels that
they used to cultivate their cloves. Only 1% of the parcels were rented to grow cloves,
while approximately 5% of the parcels were someone else’s land but the farmers reported
that they did not pay rent to grow cloves on the land.

3.3 - Economic Livelihoods of Clove-Farming Households
Clove-farming households demonstrated a wide variety of principal economic
activity, but rarely actual clove farming. In terms of the reported main livelihoods of
household members (all, head and otherwise), there was considerable heterogeneity,
with no one category capturing more than 15% of the survey respondents. As Table 5
illustrates, agriculture was the largest represented sector. Clove farming comprised 15
percent of those respondents who answered the question, as did non-clove farming.

Clove farming is not the primary source of economic livelihood for most house-
holds that grow cloves. In the column on the farthest right, the table reports the
average daily income of individuals from the survey working in that sector and the aver-
age number of months worked in that sector in the previous 12 months. Individuals
reporting clove farming as the main source of livelihood averaged $7.93 per day in daily
income, which was slightly above the average of all survey respondents, $7.32. However,
on average, respondents worked fewer than four months at clove farming. Respondents
reporting non-clove agriculture as a main livelihood generated an average of $4.77 per
day from this activity. Importantly, many of these activities were not full time (perhaps
especially some agricultural activities), which must be considered, particularly when eval-
uating/comparing these values across sectors (for a version of Table 5 for all household
members, please see the online appendix).

 Most members of clove-farming households participated in clove farming, though
 it was usually a small proportion of their total economic activity. In Figure 6, we
 report the percentage of all adult household members who indicated participating at
 some point in the previous year in clove production. Across all age categories, participa-
 tion rates in clove farming were very high. Thus, though only a small proportion reported
 clove farming as a main activity, it was an activity for most individuals living in the sur-
 veyed households.

                 Proportion of Clove Income in Total Household Resources




 24 // Results
Most clove-farming households are cultivating cloves as a secondary economic
pursuit. In Figure 7, we examine the proportion of total household resources generated
by farming cloves. The results demonstrate that more than half of these clove-farming
households generated less than 20% of their total household resources from clove farm-
ing.  At the same time, less than a quarter of the clove-farming households in the survey
generated more than half of their overall resources from clove farming. The nature of
cloves as a relatively low-maintenance perennial plant reasonably lends itself to this
dynamic, though there are bursts of more labor-intensive activity during the year,
particularly at harvest and postharvest times.

               Hectares of Land Cultivated


Most households—nearly two-thirds—reported cultivating less than one
quarter of a hectare of land to grow cloves. In Figure 8, we present the number
of hectares that the surveyed households dedicated to clove farming. There are two
caveats to this finding in that we observed that many farmers had difficulty assigning
the size of the land for clove trees because they were above the ground. Also, some
farmers reported using some of the land under the canopy of the clove trees for other
productive agricultural purposes (i.e., growing other crops).

Clove farmers reported growing a wide variety of crops, which varied by region.
The survey also asked about all the crops the households were cultivating across all grow-
ing seasons. In many districts, respondents reported three growing seasons. As reported
in Table 6, there was significant variation among regions. For example, in Pemalang and
Wonogiri, cassava was relatively widespread (46.7% and 44% respectively). In Pemalang,
56.7 percent of farmers reported growing bananas, and another 44.7 percent reported
cultivating bamboo or wood. In Wonogiri, 71.3% reported growing paddy (rice). In gen-
eral, clove-farming households in Bolaang Mongondow Timur and Minahasa reported
growing a smaller variety of crops beyond cloves.

3.4 – Costs of Clove Cultivation
Mean and per kilogram nonlabour costs varied by region. In Tables 7 and 8, we exam-
ine mean and per kilogram nonlabour costs. The average costs varied among regions and
major categories of expenses (depreciation of equipment, inputs, interest, levies and land
rental). On average, households spent $231.76 on clove farming. Physical inputs (e.g.,
fertilizer, pesticides, equipment, etc.) were typically the largest cost both per kg, but also
varied, from 0.35/kg in Wongiri to $1.69/kg in Bolaang Mongondow. Rent was only a large
cost in Bolaang Mongondow ($3.37/kg). The other major cost in at least two regions was
interest on loans—$0.66/kg in Minahasa and $0.50 in Pemalang. We also calculated costs
per hectare but we found the calculations fundamentally problematic because farmers
have difficulty assigning a value to the size of the land dedicated to love farming.

The Economics of Clove Farming in Indonesia




Fertilizer, fuel and/or transportation were the most common costs associated with
clove farming. Table 9 reports in further detail on the physical (i.e., nonlabour) inputs that
clove farmers reported using. In total, the average per household dollar amount spent
on clove inputs was $99.21. Almost all (93%) farmers reported buying a sickle and nearly
two-thirds indicated purchasing bamboo sticks. Nearly 60% reported paying in some way
to transport their cloves to market. Most clove farmers bought fertilizers, both nonorganic
(56%) and organic (50%). Half of farmers purchased gasoline for vehicles and equipment
related to clove farming activities. The highest average cost of a widely-used input was
nonorganic fertilizer at $58.79. The average cost of equipment rental was higher ($85.13),
but only 12 percent of farmers reported such a cost.

 Most clove farmers reported total nonlabour costs of less than $200. Figure 9 is a
 graphical representation of the distribution of average costs related to clove farming by
 region. Across all four regions, we can observe that most households report clove-related,
 nonlabour input costs below $200 per year, which was comparable to the mean costs of
 the tobacco farmers from the companion survey.

 Older household members were likelier to dedicate the most hours to clove
 farming. The survey queried respondents about the number of hours of labour the
 individuals in the survey dedicated to cultivating their cloves. On average, households
 dedicated an average of 479 hours per year to clove cultivation. Figure 10 demonstrates
 that male household members spend about 281 hours on average, with particularly older
 men expending more hours, on clove farming. The less physically-intensive nature of this
 work—mainly pruning, weeding, and watering compared to ploughing and other labo-
 rious field preparation—may help to explain this finding. For example, men older than
 60 years spent on average 332 hours, while those between 21 and 35 spent 195 hours.
 Women spent fewer hours than men, on average about 170 hours, and with the same
 pattern that older women dedicated more hours than younger women.

 The total value of labour varied by age and sex with the labour of men older than
 36 years demonstrating the highest value. In Figure 11, we report the average labour
 costs of household members. We calculated the value of the labour by first establishing
 the district-level agricultural minimum wage (Government of Indonesia, 2016), then con-
 verted the number of total hours into the appropriate units (e.g., day, week, month, etc.)
 and multiplied by the wage rate. The value of labour for men older than 60 was the
 highest at approximately $260 for the year.

Most clove farmers hired some external seasonal workers, particularly for harvest.
The results presented in Figure 12 demonstrate that many clove-farming households
hired laborers to help with clove cultivation. It was particularly common for households
to hire help during the harvest season. Nearly 90 percent of households hired men to
work in this season, while nearly 19 percent hired women.

The amount of hired labour varies widely across regions. Table 10 furnishes more
information about hired labour. The total number of hours varies by region with farmers
in Minahasa hiring for the most hours at 354. As illustrated in Table 11, farmers were more
likely to hire men. On average, a hired male laborer will work 135 hours at harvest time,
significantly more than the average hired woman (57 hours). Field tending is the next
most labor-intensive activity with hired men laborers averaging nearly 67 hours and hired
women laborers 98 hours. The postharvest hours for child labourers is a potential issue
and is explored in a later section of the report.

3.5 - Clove Prices and Income
There is significant variation in the price of cloves depending on the variety and
grade. For example, Table 12 reports that white cloves earned the lowest prices with
Grade A White cloves earning on average $3.27/kg. In contrast, Sikotok and Zazibar Grade
A cloves earned nearly $6/kg. Notably, Sikotok Grades B and C cloves earn about the
same, while lower quality Zanzibar cloves earn significantly less. Note that none of these
prices matches the $7.19/kg estimate of the Indonesia Clove Farmers Association.

There was wide variation in clove prices and income reported, both within and
across regions. The survey asked each household to report on average clove production,
price and income. As Table 13 suggests, average clove production varied considerably,
from 203.61 kg in Minahasa to 320.72 kg in Pemalang. The average price received by the
farmers depended on the type of clove and varied among regions. The cloves grown on
Sulawesi (Bolanng Mongondow and Minahasa) are typically of the Zanzibar variety and
fetched higher average prices—between $6.50/kg and $7/kg USD—than in Central Java
where farmers in Pemalang received an average price of $3.14/kg and those in Wongiri,
$1.96/kg. In Central Java, farmers grew both white clove and Zanzibar clove (and at least
a couple of other types, too). Partly because of price (and total cultivation per house-
hold), average income from cloves ranged widely among the districts from $439.13 in
Wonogiri to $2,575.72 in Minahasa. Another variable that affected price was whether the
farmer sold the clove bud dry or wet. Dry bud—more common in Sulawesi—typically
fetched a higher price.

Profits from clove cultivation varied widely by district. In Figure 13, we examine the profits
per kilogram by region. The red bars indicate profits in terms of “perceived” profits or what
most agricultural economists would term “gross margins,” which is the gross revenues from sell-
ing cloves less the direct costs incurred to grow them including physical inputs (e.g., fertilizer
and pesticide), hired labour, marketing expenses and transportation. The blue bars represent
what we term “realized profits” because they assign a value to the household labor dedicated
to clove cultivation. We determine this value using the regional agricultural minimum wage.
Overall, we observe that the average profit per kg using the gross margin method was $4.84.
This was driven in large part by the high prices paid to clove farmers in Bolaang Mongondow
where the gross margin was $12.34/kg. The lowest gross margin was in Minahasa where it
was $0.26/kg. In the blue columns, we incorporate the value of labour in the cost calculations.
Overall, we find that average realized profits from cultivating cloves were negative for the sur-
veyed households at –2.24/kg. We find that Pemalang is the most profitable at $1.45/kg, while
Bolaang Mongondow is the least profitable at –$2.72. Considering this district’s higher average
prices, labour costs for clove cultivation are clearly very high in this area.

3.6 - Credit and Debt
Less than one-third of clove farmers sought credit to cultivate cloves. In Figure 14,
we report the number of survey respondents who were seeking credit—ostensibly—to
grow cloves. We find that the proportion never exceeds one-third and drops as low as
22.7% in Wonogiri. It appears that clove farming is not an economic activity that farmers
commonly seek credit to pursue.

Clove farmers typically reported seeking credit for broader business and house-
hold reasons than to support clove production directly. Figure 15 illustrates why
some of the clove farmers are borrowing money and suggests that many of the reasons
that they borrow do not pertain to actual clove farming. The most common explanation
for borrowing money was a rather general explanation of “investing” in their clove-farming
business (21.3%). But, the two next most common explanations were not farming-re-
lated: to pay for school fees (11.3%) or to purchase a vehicle (11.3%). These findings are
similar to patterns with tobacco farmers in the Philippine (Briones, 2013; Chavez et al.,
2016) and Sub-Saharan Africa (Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016).
Notably, only five percent mentioned that they wanted to borrow to pay for the inputs to
cultivate cloves.

Clove farmers most typically borrowed from commercial banks or microfinance
institutions. In Figure 16, we examine the sources of clove farmers’ loans. The most
                                4.86% banks (28.5%). The next most common source
common source of credit was commercial
of credit was microfinance institutions (21%). The third most common source of credit
was from relatives (16.7%). In a related dynamic, we found that 33 households were
under contract to sell their cloves to a buyer. In seven of those cases, the buyer had pro-
vided them with inputs such as fertilizer, which was then deducted from the sales to that
buyer; notably, none of these farmers reported this as a loan even though it effectively
was because, on average, they paid above market prices for these inputs.

3.7 – Household Economic Situation
We generate and compare per household median and mean resources and
incomes of clove-farming households. As presented in Figure 17, we calculated each
household’s total resources, which includes all revenues and other production (e.g., food
cultivated and consumed), and generated a per household measure. Similarly, we calcu-
lated household income, which was resources less all expenses incurred by the house-
hold to produce the goods/services (either sold or consumed).

Poverty among clove-farming households is widespread. In Indonesia, generally,
8.3% of households fall below the World Bank poverty rate of $1.90/day (PPP), while 11.1%
fall under the Indonesian government’s poverty line of ~$22.60 USD per month. In Figure
18, we illustrate the proportion of clove-farming households that fall below these pov-
erty lines. Using the measure of household total resources, which does not incorporate
any agricultural or other business costs, the poverty rate for clove-farming households is
16.5% at the World Bank threshold and 21.83% at the Indonesian government threshold.
When we use the more realistic measure of household total income, which subtracts all of
the expenses incurred to farm or to run other household businesses from total resources,
the poverty rate of clove-farming households increases to 34.17% at the World Bank line
and 37% at the official government line.

Farmers provide a variety of explanations for choosing clove farming. The chal-
lenging economic situations described above reasonably beg the question: why do clove
farmers choose to cultivate this crop? As Figure 19 shows, the most common reason—
given by just over a quarter of survey respondents—is that clove farming is lucrative. The
results above from Bolaang Mongondow support this perspective. About 20% of respon-
dents indicated that it was the only viable cash crop while another 20% reported that it
had more to do with the availability of land to cultivate cloves. In order to determine how
accurate their perception was, we cross-referenced perception and reality and those who
identified clove farming as lucrative (either as a primary or “ever mentioned” reason) were
not any more profitable (either per kilogram or per hectare) on average than those who
did not identify it as lucrative. One weakness is individuals may define lucrative differently.

3.8 - Alternative Livelihood Options
Most clove farmers were not considering alternatives to clove farming. As Figure 20
illustrates, nearly 70 percent of clove farmers were not considering switching. Less than
20 percent of farmers indicated being serious or very serious about switching to an alter-
native livelihood.

We also used logistic regression to examine which farmers were willing to try alter-
natives to clove farming. The survey inquired about the possibility of farmers switching
from clove cultivation to another crop. Some farmers indicated a willingness to switch, a
process that has been happening involuntarily in some parts of the country due to chal-
lenges with clove disease and insect infestations (Rachman, 2016). In Table 14 we present
the results from a logistic regression. The dependent variable is dichotomous with a “1”
value representing those who are actively switching their clove crops to some extent
already or have thought recently about switching. We used the previous literature on
switching from tobacco growing as a starting point (e.g., Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al.,
2015; Magati et al., 2016; Makoka et al., 2016), and then used machine-learning methods
and stepwise regression to further identify relevant independent variables from the
survey results.

Farmers who farm fewer cloves or who have larger agricultural enterprises were
the most willing to switch away from cloves. We report only the statistically signifi-
cant coefficients in the table, though all the foundational analyses are available in our
online appendices. We found that clove farmers who cultivated smaller amounts of land
for cloves are more likely to be willing to switch from cloves to another crop. Farmers
who cultivate more land in general are also more likely to be willing to switch – perhaps
because they have flexibility to hedge each season and grow different crops and/or they

have more experience cultivating other crops. Similarly, farmers who already make more
money selling crops other than cloves are more likely to be willing to switch. Farmers
who had successful non-agricultural enterprises (and low-cost ones) were also more
willing to quit. If the government wishes to move farmers away from clove production to
decrease supply, this analysis gives several reasonable starting points in terms of whom
to target.

    HOUSEHOLD WELL-BEING

    4.1 — Asset to Social Safety Nets
    Nearly half of clove farming households in the survey received a social assistance
    benefit. In Table 15, we examine the proportion of households receiving social protec-
    tion. We observe first that the total percentage of the surveyed households that received
    benefits either under a Social Security Card (KPS) or a Family Welfare Card (KKS) was just
    under 15 percent. In terms of a cash assistance/transfer, 3.7 percent of the total surveyed
    households received this benefit and had a KPS/KKS card. Another 1 percent of the
    surveyed households received this benefit but did not have the card. The largest benefit
    received by these farmers was through the rice for the poor program: 11.7 percent of
    surveyed households were receiving the rice benefit and had a KPS/KKS, while another
    31.7 percent of households were receiving the benefit and did not have a card. Rates of
    receiving the other two major benefits—health and education assistance—were fairly
    similar to the cash assistance rates. These rates were below national averages—nearly a
    quarter of Indonesians are eligible for KKS and nearly 70 percent of households receive
    “rice for the poor” benefits.

    Enrollments in government health programs were higher among clove farmers
    than in the general population. As shown in Table 16, approximately 16 percent of
    individuals in clove-farming households were beneficiaries of KIS while approximately 13
    percent benefits from BPJS. Enrollment in each program nationwide is about 10 percent.

4.2 – Food Security
Most clove farmers report “usually” or always having access to sufficient food.
Food security, as presented in Figure 21, is an important well-being–related issue among
some farmers in Indonesia (e.g., Hanie and Tsegai, 2016) and among tobacco farmers in
many parts of the world (Eriksen et al., 2015). Approximately 12 percent of individuals
from clove-farming households reported serious food insecurity, which was comparable
to what we found in the companion survey in several tobacco-growing regions though
considerably less than in Lombok where food security was a serious challenge for many
tobacco farmers.


Less than one-third of clove-farming households grew their own food. Among the survey
respondents, 32 percent reported producing their own food. The survey asked house-
holds for how many months the cultivated food fed the household (see Table 17).
Thirty percent reported that they grew enough for the entire year. Importantly, this does
not necessarily equate to a lack of food security. In many cases in the FGDs, farmers
reported growing other cash crops and using the monetary proceeds of the cultivation
to buy food in the marketplace. This dynamic was similar to what others found in recent
surveys of tobacco farmers (e.g., Chavez et al., 2016; Goma et al., 2015; Magati et al., 2016;
Makoka et al., 2016).

Clove farmers who cultivated more cloves were more likely to be food secure.
We also examined food security through multivariate analysis. As a dependent
variable we used a dichotomous measure of whether a household always had enough
to eat (a “1” value). We used the previous literature on food security (Eriksen et al., 2015;
Khisa, 2011), machine-learning methods and stepwise regression to identify the relevant
independent variables from the survey results. In Table 18, we report only the statisti-
cally significant coefficients, though the foundational analyses are available in our online
appendices. We find that clove farmers who use more land to farm cloves are more likely
to be food secure, though we find that the coefficient for the overall hectarage cultivated
(for all crops) is negative and statistically significant. Household size is positively and
significantly related to food security suggesting that larger households are more likely
to be secure.

There was limited variation in the amount of staple rice crops grown by clove
farmers. We examined the decision to grow the staple crop, typically rice. First, only 170
households grew rice out of the 597 households that reported rice as their staple food,
suggesting that the majority of households buy their rice and grow other crops on their
land. In Figure 22, we observe that most households regardless of their overall resources
grow about the same amount of rice, and typically not a sufficient amount to feed the
household. Recent reports suggest that the average individual in Indonesia eats between
114 kg (Wall Street Journal, 2015) and 163 kg (OECD-FAO 2015) of rice. We also examined
broader decisions to grow all food crops. Accordingly, in Figure 22, we plot the number
of households by their total resources and all of the food crops that they grow. We find
a slightly different finding here wherein lower resource households are much likelier to
grow other food crops to feed their families. In brief, the results suggest that the relation-
ships between cropping decisions and food security are complex.

         CHILD LABOUR

O        Child labour in clove farming occurred in only a small proportion of surveyed
         households. The International Labour Organization estimates that up to 1.5 million
         Indonesian children, aged 10-17, work on farms (ILO, 2015). A recent Human Rights




N
         Watch report examined this dynamic on tobacco farms specifically (see HRW, 2016).
         Accordingly, we asked respondents about each household member’s contribution to
         farming cloves, including children. Recognizing that child labour is prone to underreport-
         ing because of possible social stigma and children contribute to the work on farms to a
         certain extent in most countries in the world, we particularly sought to determine if chil-
         dren were working consistently during school hours. In Table 18, in the columns under




O
         “# of Case Worked,” we report any time a respondent indicated that a child (both under 18,
         and under 15, which is the more common age of adulthood in Indonesia) had worked at
         the specific agricultural activity pertinent to clove farming. In the second set of columns,
         we report the number of times that a child was reported working more than nine times
         in a month during official school hours at each activity. We were able to cross-reference
         working and school attendance because the survey asked whether the child went to
         school in the morning or afternoon, and then asked when each individual was working
         at clove farming at specific times. We found that a child working occurred in less than 10
         percent of cases for harvest and postharvest activities. For children working consistently
         during school hours, the proportion dropped to 0.2% for harvest and postharvest activi-
         ties. It is important to reinforce that this was not a focus of the survey, and child labour is
         a very difficult phenomenon to measure in a survey (for example, the HRW (2016) report
         was observational of a random selection of tobacco farms).

    LIMITATIONS
    The findings from this report provides a comprehensive picture of the farmers’
    economic livelihoods in Indonesia, when considering these findings a few con-
    siderations are necessary. First, the survey coverage included Central Java and the two
    largest-producing areas of Sulawesi, which is about 70% of national production. Produc-
    tion is widely dispersed otherwise and it was too costly to include other areas. However,
    we do not have any a priori reasons to believe that clove farmers in other parts of the
    country are different than those in this survey.

    Many clove farmers were older than the average Indonesian so calculation of their
    replacement wage may be affected. The oldest household members—especially
    those over 60 years—would be most likely to replace clove farming with either other agri-
    cultural endeavors or household-based microenterprises and not wage-based employ-
    ment. More research into the age dynamic of clove farming is necessary.

    Similarly, the survey generally did not deeply examine the specific alternatives that
    clove farmers might undertake if they stopped clove farming. It would be useful
    in future research to explore what options farmers perceive and place them into other
    research or economic opportunities by region.

    CONCLUSION
    Clove production is a widespread agricultural activity in Indonesia, particularly in
    Central Java and Sulawesi. Accordingly, policy makers are concerned that changes in
    the tobacco product tax structure, including the minimization of tiers and the increase
    of excise tax rates on kreteks, will negatively affect consumption and therefore the live-
    lihoods of clove farmers. The research undergirding this report finds several crucial fea-
    tures of clove farming that should help policy makers to better evaluate any potential
    disruptions to the clove supply and value chains that might affect these farmers.

    First, for most clove-farming households, clove farming is a small fraction of the
    household’s broader economic activity. Thus, a decrease in demand for kreteks that
    might lead to a decrease in demand for cloves is only going to affect most clove-farming
    households to a small extent economically. This effect could also be mitigated or elimi-
    nated if farmers re-allocated their resources to other economically fruitful pursuits and/
    or if the government helped these farmers to shift to other activities. A “loss” should not
    be presumed, particularly considering that the evidence here suggests that most of these
    households have varied economic activities to which they could reallocate capital, land
    and/or labour.

    Second, clove farming does not appear to be highly lucrative for many of these
    farmers, particularly in certain regions (e.g., Minahasa). Even the gross margins
    reported by most households suggest that clove farming is, at best, a small side business
    for the vast preponderance of these households. Even in the unlikely scenario that farm-
    ers were not able to grow something else on their land and/or use the time previously
    allocated to clove farming for new economically productive activities, the loss to the vast
    majority of these households would be small because the contribution in real terms was
    typically small. In fact, it is quite possible that clove farmers could easily use their land just
    as or more productively growing other crops, and/or use their time more productively
    either economically or for other enriching purposes such as education, family, or recreation.

    Third, individuals in clove farming households, on average, are poorer than the
    average Indonesian household, which reinforces the idea that land and/or time
    might be better allocated to more economically lucrative pursuits, particularly in
    places where there are more viable options.




                                                                                                     53

RECOMMENDATIONS
In terms of considering what might happen if there were a change in tax policy that af-
fected demand for Indonesian cloves, it is important to reiterate that clove farming is not
particularly profitable for most clove-producing households in at least a couple of major
clove-producing districts. The government needs to research which alternatives could be
viable and target these least-profitable areas for switching and help these farmers make
successful transitions to growing other crops and/or economic activities.


   •	 In case of negative effects from higher tobacco taxes, the government could help
      clove farmers to identify other economically fruitful pursuits.
      {{   Research which alternative locally-grown crops are most viable on former clove-pro-
           ducing land;
      {{   Enhance supply and value chains for these alternative local crops;

   •	 Support research to identify the areas where clove production is least viable (e.g.,
      Minahasa) and target those areas for alternatives first;

   •	 Improve agricultural extension services for non-clove crops;
   •	 Provide educational grants for improving clove farmers’ agricultural
      management skills;

   •	 Improve access to credit for farmers to grow other crops or pursue other
      small economic enterprises such as a small shop, fish farming, or a local
      transportation business.
      {{   Provide grants or low-interest loans to farmers willing to switch to alternative
           crops; and
      {{   Introduce financial programs or economic development programs as forms of
           transition assistance away from clove cultivation.
