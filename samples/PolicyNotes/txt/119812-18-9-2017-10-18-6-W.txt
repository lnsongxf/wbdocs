                        AGUAS PUBLICAS DO ALENTEJO, PORTUGAL
Context                 •	 High-income country

                        •	 Aggregation covering urban and rural areas

                        •	 Medium level of WSS performance

Purpose                 Performance, professionalization, environmental benefits, solidarity (cross-subsidies among municipalities)

Scope                   Water production and transport; Wastewater treatment

Scale                   •	 Administrative boundaries

                        •	 Localities covered: 20

                        •	 Population covered: 235,192 inhabitants for water and wastewater

                        •	 Coverage: 100 percent for water and 100 percent for wastewater

                        •	 Network length: 1,008 km for water and 128 km for wastewater

Process                 Voluntary and Incentivized (EU funds)
