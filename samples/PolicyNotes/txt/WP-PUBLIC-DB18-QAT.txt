About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    3   Open bank account and deposit the capital                                       1 day                no charge
        Agency : Bank

        According to Commercial Companies Law No 11 of 2015, the shareholders
        determine the capital of the company. This paid- in minimum capital must be
        deposited in a Bank in order to register the company. Once the startup
        capital is deposited, the entrepreneur receives a con rmation letter from
        the bank which is then taken to the Companies Registry and submitted with
        the application. This amount cannot be withdrawn until the company is
        incorporated.


        Alternatively, the company can decide to open the bank account and deposit
        the paid- in minimum capital after the registration process. In this scenario
        the entrepreneur would need to deposit the capital of the new company
        within a period of 15 days after the issuing of the Commercial Registry
        certi cate of the new company. In order to guarantee that the capital of the
        new company will be deposited at the bank after the issuance of the
        Commercial Registry certi cate, the MEC requires to be remitted the
        documents needed for the incorporation of the new company, an
        undertaking letter signed by any of the managers of the new company, which
        provides that he undertakes to deliver to the MEC, within 15 days as of the
        issuing of the Commercial Registry of the new company, a certi cate from
        the bank showing that the capital of the new company was deposited at the
        bank.
        In the event the capital is not deposited within the period mentioned above
        and no certi cate is submitted to the MEC proving such deposit, the
        Commercial Registry will then block the Commercial Registry certi cate of
        the new company until such submission is made.

      Architects apply to obtain planning permission on any working day but can
      receive the planning permission only on Sundays, Tuesday, and Thursdays.
      The cost of obtaining a planning certi cate (QAR 100) has not changed since
      1998.
      The application to obtain planning permission must include the documents
      below. These documents are usually available within the company, causing
      no need for further procedures to be recorded:
      • Ownership Certi cate: The government owns all lands in Doha and leases
      them to private citizens. A rent payment is paid on an annual basis to the
      MIA. The architect should only bring the receipt of last year's payment. This
      receipt is a proof that all previous payments have been made. No stamp is
      needed.
      • Land plan showing the location, area, and neighboring plots of land.
      • Copy of the applicants ID card
      • Copy of company's registration certi cate
      • Form of the Supervising engineer
      Planning permission includes a location clearance from the Municipality of
      Industrial Area, set of design guidelines for construction work from the
      Municipality of Industrial Area, and a land plan with site map.

      Agency : Civil Defense Department

      The law requires the Fire Department to issue permission to build a
      warehouse within 15 days. Usually the re department does not take more
      than 15 days to issue such permissions if all documentation is correct. To
      obtain clearance, BuildCo must submit re drawings showing the re exit
      strategy, location of re alarms, etc.

  4   Submit documents and obtain preliminary approval (Design Control 1)                 10 days            QAR 100
      from the Municipality
      Agency : Municipality of Industrial Area

      The documents required to open a le and obtain the preliminary approval
      (Design Control I) are:
      - Copy of the owner's ID card
      - Owner's letter authorizing the architect
      - Certi ed copy of the land ownership document
      - Planning permission
      - Architectural drawings on the building plans, elevation and section


      The municipality reviews the documents and issues the Design Control 1
      (DCI) approval.

      The customer needs to hire an electrical consultant to design the internal
      installation and later inspect its execution, and an electrical contractor to
      execute the internal wiring. Both need to be approved by the electricity
      utility, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa).


      The approved electrical contractor completes, signs, stamps, and submits an
      application (‘Service Note’ and ‘Meter Card’) to the Installations section of the
      Customer Services department at Kahramaa for electricity supply.


      After the submission, the form is forwarded to the relevant Kahramaa
      departments for the initial approval of the application (the client deals with
      the Installations Section of the Customer Service; the application is
      forwarded internally to other departments, such as Planning & Distribution
      that is in charge of the network design, etc.). The approval will be indicated
      on the bottom of the back side of the form.

      When the approval is obtained, a copy of the form is given to the contractor
      to ful ll the said conditions in order to receive the requested service. Any
      charges to be paid by the client as a result of the required service will be
      received from the concerned Kahramaa departments on a separate letter
      and will be collected prior to performing any work.

      The client will need to attach the following documents to the application:
      • ID card
      • Copy of Policy Plan
      • Copy of ‘Land Deed’
      • One set of approved Building Permit drawings
      • Copy of Building Permit
      • If the execution of the client request requires the construction of a
      substation, the client is requested to submit electrical drawings signed and
      stamped by an approved electrical consultant (which is not the case for 200
      A)

      Thanks to the drawings submitted and the utility’s up-to-date maps, no
      inspection of the site is necessary to determine the speci cs of the
      connection.

      Agency : Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA)

      In this case, a service cabinet is needed. The customer’s approved electrical
      contractor will need to submit the drawings for the cabinet to Kahramaa for
      approval and then install it (normally in the property boundary wall facing a
      street, and as close as possible to the LV main which will supply it).

      After the internal works have been completed, the client will need to set up
      an appointment with the Installations Section at the Customer Service
      department for inspection.

      The utility makes a general check of the internal installations that a ect

       This test shall be made and passed satisfactorily before any completed
       installation or alteration to an existing installation is connected to the Qatar
       General Electricity And Water Corporation (Kahramaa) supply.


       Where practicable, so that all parts of the wiring may be tested, all lamps
       should be removed and all current using apparatus should be disconnected
       and all local switches controlling lamps or apparatus should be closed.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                      the debt. Even if Mirage's management initiates insolvency proceedings at the same time,

Outcome             piecemeal sale    The court will appoint a financial expert, who will evaluate the assets of the company. The
                                      financial expert will produce a report advising the court whether the company is viable.
                                      Under the case assumptions, the hotel will most likely not be able to operate as a going
                                      concern after sale. It is not common for a hotel to be sold by public auction in Qatar and
                                      there are no publicly known precedents.

Time (in years)     2.8               It will take 2.75 years to complete foreclosure proceedings. Foreclosure proceedings will
                                      start with the Bank filing the application, after which several court hearings will take place.
                                      Qatari courts are rather slow, so all steps that need approval of the court will take a long
                                      time. The court will appoint a financial expert to evaluate the assets of the company and
                                      prepare a report on whether the business is viable. Based on this report, the court will
                                      decide whether to sell the hotel as a going concern or whether to sell it piecemeal. Hotel's
                                      assets will be sold at a public auction. It is likely that at least two auctions will be held before
                                      the hotel is sold. The auction procedure is likely to take at least one year.

Cost (% of          22.0              Major expenses will include attorneys' fees (up to 20%) and fees of other professionals and
estate)                               service providers involved in the proceedings.
