About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

                      signed by an engineer. However, the type of engineer is not speci ed, so they

      Agency : City Council

      The general procedure for obtaining the approval of the project plan is as
      follows:


      1. BuildCo arranges for a private engineering consultant to complete the
      building plans. The plans must be prepared by licensed architects and
      signed by an engineer. However, the type of engineer is not speci ed, so they
      do not have to know anything about construction. There is an abusive
      practice of architects / engineers signing plans prepared by technicians who
      worked independently without actually reviewing them simply to obtain the
      payment.

      2. BuildCo completes the “application for permission to develop or to
      subdivide land” and a by-laws form, and submits the forms and the plans to
      the City Council with payment of a fee based on the size of the building and
      the assessed value of the land.

      3. The plans and application are then forwarded to a technical panel for
      consideration. The panel’s members are representatives from the following
      organizations:


      • Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi
      • Malawi Telecommunications Limited
      • Water Board
      • City Council - Physical Planning Department
      • City Council - Engineering Department
      • City Council - Parks and Recreation Department
      • City Council - Health and Environment Department
      • City Council - Building Department
      • Occupational Safety, Health, and Welfare Department of the Ministry of
      Labor
      • Malawi Housing Corporation
      • Ministry of Transport and Public Works


      The panel reviews the building plans and application and either approves the
      development or suggests amendments. If the panel requires amendments,
      BuildCo is noti ed by mail of the changes required. BuildCo can also contact
      the City Council by phone or in person to inquire about the status of the
      application.


      A water connection application is led along with the site plan. If the panel
      accepts the application, it is forwarded to the Town and Country Planning
      Committee, which meets monthly. The committee noti es BuildCo by mail
      and a notice of decision, a legally binding document, and the by-laws form
      are issued.


      The meeting of the City Planning Committee takes place only once a month,
      and the Technical Panel meets only once every 2 weeks. However, companies
      may choose to opt for a fast-track option which allows companies to
      convene an emergency meeting of the Town and Planning Committee at a
      higher fee charged on top of standard fees. The fee for a fast-track option                                          Page 13  
      would be MWK 50,000. In this case, the meeting will take place within about

       convene an emergency meeting of the Town and Planning Committee at a
       higher fee charged on top of standard fees. The fee for a fast-track option
       would be MWK 50,000. In this case, the meeting will take place within about
       one week of the payment being made. BuildCo will receive an oral decision at
       the end of the meeting. If there is an a rmative decision, construction can
       begin right away. The o cial document will be issued soon after. In practice
       however, this option is seldom used seldom by companies. Many companies
       plan ahead of the time and have prior consultations with the municipal
       o cials.


       Under normal circumstances under Town and Country Planning Act, the
       Planning Committee should either approve the application or inform the
       applicant why it cannot be approved within 60 days of the application being
       submitted. In reality, this does not happen often. However, the silence-is-
       consent rule applies. If after 60 days there is no response, construction can
       begin.


       As of May 1, 2004 the cost according to Blantyre City Council is 0.8% or
       construction cost + MWK 800.00 (local tax) + MWK 100.00 (application fee).

   2   Submit project brief and obtain certi cate of EIA (environmental impact                15 days   MWK 5,000

       Department
       Agency : Environmental A airs Department

       Unless a project is likely to have a signi cant environmental impact, project
       developers can prepare and submit a project brief with little or no assistance
       from environmental specialists. Since projects and their stage in the project
       cycle vary widely, detailed guidelines for the content of a project brief are not
       possible. However, Section 24 of the Environmental Management Act
       requires that a project brief should at least state:

       1. The nature of the project;
       2. The activities that shall be undertaken;
       3. The possible products and by-products anticipated;
       4. The number of people the project shall employ;
       5. The area of land, air or water that may be a ected; and
       6. Any other matters as may be prescribed.


       More generally, a project brief should also contain:

       1. A basic description of the project purpose, size, location and preliminary
       design, including any alternatives which are being considered (i.e., site,
       technology, construction and operation procedures, handling of waste).
       2. The stage of the project in the project cycle.
       3. A location map of the project site or site alternatives, and a site plan as it is
       currently known. Maps and plans should conform to the standards
       discussed below.
       4. A discussion of which aspects of the project are likely to cause
       environmental concerns and the proposed environmental management
       measures.

       During the construction phase of an approved project, the City Assembly
       sends out inspectors at various stages of construction. Inspectors from the

      During the construction phase of an approved project, the City Assembly
      sends out inspectors at various stages of construction. Inspectors from the
      City Assembly’s Departments of Building, Environment and Health, and Fire
      join the national-level Occupational Safety, Health, and Welfare Department
      to inspect the construction site approximately ve times. These inspectors
      come as a team, and there is no charge for these visits.


      The Building Department issues six cards that specify when a building should
      be inspected. BuildCo noti es the inspectors by sending a card at the
      appropriate stage of construction. The City Assembly inspectors come within
      2 days to 2 weeks of noti cation. However in reality many do not come due
      to scarcity of resources. In practice, builders continue construction after
      submitting the notice without waiting for the inspection.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                      Agency : Lands Registry

                      Parties conduct a search at the Deeds Registry to ensure that no
                      encumbrances are still pending on the property. The search can be
                      conducted either by the title number (faster) or by plot number (slower).
                      Malawi still has two systems of land title registration i.e. Title registration
                      under the Registered Land Act and Title registration under the Deeds
                      Registration Act. The former is simpler and searches are also simpler and
                      quicker. If it is just one property search it takes no more than 15 minutes in
                      the Title Registry but it may take longer in the Deeds Registry because of
                      cross-referencing. For one property it could take on average about an hour.
                                                                                                                                                          Page 27

  2   Obtain City rates clearance certi cate                                                  1 - 3 days            MWK 500
      Agency : Blantyre City Council

      A letter is sent to the City Assembly to obtain a City rates clearance
      certi cate. The parties search for unpaid city taxes on the property at the
      Municipality, which is free of charge . The system is computerized and it is
      just a matter of punching in the Rate Payer's details and the account comes
      up on the screen with all outstanding taxes. One can call to obtain the basic
      information, but this information cannot be used for o cial purposes.
      However, a written certi cate is required to be signed by the Chief Executive,
      which substantially extends the time.

      Parties apply to the Ministry of Lands for consent to transfer the property.
      The application now is done directly in Blantyre since The Ministry must give
      its approval of the transaction. The process starts with an application to the
      Regional Commissioner for Lands, who then forwards the application with an
      accompanying memo to the Principal Secretary at the Ministry of Lands, who
      then passes it on to the Minister’s o ce. The application is also sent to the
      Anti-Corruption Bureau.

This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.               Page 45

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

                                                           several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the            - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                        and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

                                                           - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                           - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                         equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                 - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                           commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                           - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                    - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
