Note: There is an uncertain overlap between tropical cyclones and floods, making it difficult to disaggregate the various hazards. However,
sensitivity analyses have shown that this overlap does not affect results significantly. Tropical cyclone losses are presented as constant,
as there’s is a large uncertainty in future cyclone behaviour, frequency and intensity. These numbers also assume a stable population.

Fiji generally performs well in terms of infrastructure access

the objectives of the 20-year Development Plan, especially
in rural areas and for water and sanitation. To ensure
sustainable development in Fiji, existing infrastructure gaps
need to be bridged in ways that ensure resilience to climate

                                     “Vunisavisavi is the original home of the ‘Tui Cakau’

TC WINSTON: RAIVOLITA’S STORY           After travelling the world, Raivolita Tabusoro, 43, says there’s
                                        no place like home. His home, Nabukadra on the northern
                                        coast of Viti Levu, is vulnerable to a range of hazards,
                                        including increasing sea levels and storm surges.

                                        Raivolita has worked hard to improve conditions for people

“I enjoy living in my village.          in his village, and district. His most recent term as Village
                                        Headman began in 2016, right before TC Winston, hit Fiji.

It’s a beautiful place, fresh           “We got a shock when our ceiling collapsed. My wife and
                                        daughter ran, and my mother and I were left in the house.

                                        At the same time, a storm surge entered the village. “We
                                        looked on helplessly as our belongings washed away. It was
                                        as if a bomb was dropped in the village because there was
                                        nothing left.” Long after TC Winston, the impact of such a
                                        destructive disaster is still being felt across Nabukadra.

                                        “Before TC Winston, there was an abundant supply of
                                        coconut, I had lots of pigs, and honey boxes. Now after

         Fiji is a small island nation in the South Pacific
            Ocean with a population of about 900,000.

                                                              According to the very limited data available, the average

Over half of Fiji’s population (54 percent in 2017) is
urbanized and is concentrated in three rapidly growing
urban areas. These include Suva-Lami-Nasinu-Nausori
in southeast Viti Levu; Nadi-Lautoka-Ba in northwest Viti
Levu; and Weilevu-Labasa-Nasea in northwest Vanua Levu.
Urbanization is not a new phenomenon in the country.
Rapid rates of urban in-migration were well under way
in the 1960s and 1970s and, for the past three decades,
urban population growth has outstripped rural growth.

Note: The SSBN Global Flood Hazard Model uses regional flood frequency analyzes derived from historical records of river flows to drive two-
dimensional (2D) hydraulic models built at a 90m spatial resolution over the MERIT DEM (digital elevation model). The river networks are derived
automatically from the DEM, and channel geometries are estimated using river width databases, local bed slopes from the DEM, and bankfull
discharge estimates from the flood frequency analysis. Small rivers are simulated using a subgrid method that allows rivers smaller than the 90m
grid scale to be represented by the model, with water from the subgrid river network appearing on the visible model grid only when water levels
exceed river bank heights and flooding starts to occur. Note that 100-year losses from fluvial and pluvial floods cannot be directly added, as the
100-year events do not necessarily occur simultaneously.

unsealed), 1,342 bridges/crossings, and 47 jetties.56

The land and marine networks have suffered from a lack
of systematic maintenance and strategic planning prior to
FRA’s establishment in 2012, which has left a large portion
of the network in urban, rural, and coastal areas in poor
condition. A continuing maintenance backlog combined with
already aging assets makes the network highly vulnerable
to disruption from damage to or failure of sections of roads
and other assets.

        THE RISK TO LIVELIHOODS AND WELL-
        BEING IS HIGH AND NATURAL HAZARDS
        KEEP PEOPLE IN POVERTY
Vulnerability to natural shocks depends on socioeconomic
characteristics. The actual impact of natural hazards and
disasters on the population does not depend only on the
direct impacts of those disasters, and on the damages to
assets such as houses and infrastructure. It also depends
on whether reconstruction can be done swiftly and
efficiently, whether the population has access to savings
or not, and whether aid is received from the community
or the government.

Fiji’s traditional crops and production systems are,
in general, relatively resilient to variations in climatic
conditions.94 However, many traditional farming practices
have declined in recent decades, often in response to
commercial production needs. As a result, Fiji’s food and
commodity production systems have likely become more
vulnerable to climate variability,95 which may threaten
food security.

Changes in rainfall patterns                 Changes may disrupt planting, flowering patterns, vegetative growth,

       Note: Direct jobs include only the jobs in the tourism industry (for instance, workers in hotels); indirect jobs include jobs that provide goods and

       generated by income from direct and indirect jobs (for instance, the car dealer who is selling cars to hotel employees). In the absence of tourism

In each of these areas for intervention, it will be critical to
consider the specific needs of vulnerable groups, including
women, children, the elderly, people with disability, and
minorities. Age is an important vulnerability factor, as
demonstrated by the fact that 37 percent of the mortalities
from TC Winston were among the elderly (above 65 years),
who comprise only 4 percent of the population. Elderly
people and children are especially vulnerable to high
temperature, and people with a disability may not be able
to follow all evacuation guidelines given to the population.
The gendered power relationships that determine access
to endowments, economic opportunities, resources,
and agency (as discussed in chapter 3) must also be
considered. Without gender sensitivity in climate and
disaster risk management, there is a significant risk that
interventions will be less efficient, and that climate change
and natural disasters will exacerbate existing political,
economic, and social inequalities between women and
men in Fiji society.                                              124.	 World Bank 2012.

the Minister of Local Government directed all municipal

Every council has now established a Town Planning Unit

than modeling) to identify vulnerable areas. As illustrated

that can be prioritized for development.

To better understand and manage system vulnerability, it
is critical to further upgrade asset management systems.
In urban areas, WAF has effectively digitized its asset
database. To turn this system into a fully operational tool
to assess risks and plan interventions accordingly, it will
be critical to access not only an assets’ location and basic
description, but also their capacity, condition, history of
failures, etc. In rural and peri-urban areas, the lack of
detailed inventory of existing systems undermines the
planning of adequate resilience interventions.

These vulnerabilities and the need to urgently address
them are increasingly recognized in the water sector.
For instance, an Urban Water Supply and Wastewater
Management Investment Program—cofinanced by the
Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank,
and Green Climate Fund for a total amount of US$255
million—was approved end-2016 and features a strong
focus on climate change adaptation to floods, droughts,
and salinity intrusion due to sea-level rise. WAF has
initiated, with the technical support of Sydney Water and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a holistic risk
assessment of the utility’s activities. It is updating internal
manuals and procedures to better incorporate climate
change resilience considerations. National sector policies
are increasingly taking account of water stress and
climate change impacts as strategic sector challenges             134.	 Precise cost estimates are not available, and those presented

            will be challenging to implement. Two
         important requirements will need to be met
       to ensure that the interventions are successfully
