Migration and Development Brief reports an update on migration and remittance flows as
well as salient policy developments in the area of international migration and development.

The Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD) is a
global hub of knowledge and policy expertise on migration and development. It aims
to create and synthesize multidisciplinary knowledge and evidence; generate a menu of
policy options for migration policy makers; and provide technical assistance and capacity
building for pilot projects, evaluation of policies, and data collection.

KNOMAD is supported by a multi-donor trust fund established by the World Bank.
Germany’s Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), Sweden’s
Ministry of Justice, Migration and Asylum Policy, and the Swiss Agency for Development
and Cooperation (SDC) are the contributors to the trust fund.

     his Migration and Development Brief reports global trends in migration and remittance flows, major policy
     developments, and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators for reducing remittance costs and
     recruitment costs. The Brief reports new data on recruitment costs, a potential indicator for the SDG of
     promoting safe and regular migration. The special focus of the Brief is return migration, a challenging issue
around the world amid a rise in asylum seekers and undocumented migrants.

        BOX 2.1:  Definition and Measurement of Recruitment Costs

        Worker-paid recruitment costs can be defined as all the monetary costs incurred by workers (above and beyond
        those incurred by employers) to establish an employment relationship. Such costs broadly encompass placement
        fees paid to the recruitment agency or to their agents, documentation fees (such as to cover a passport, visa,
        medical certificate, security clearance, or language test), transportation costs, and informal payments. The cost of
        servicing migration loans is currently excluded.

        The proposed Recruitment Cost Indicator (RCI) is the average worker-incurred recruitment cost paid for securing
        an overseas job, expressed as a multiple of monthly foreign earnings. While numerous countries legally restrict the
        amount that workers should pay, poor enforcement often results in excessive up-front payments. The International
        Labour Organization’s (ILO’s) Fair Recruitment initiative calls for no recruitment fees or related charges to be
        incurred by workers.

        Until recently, there was no systematic effort to document worker-paid recruitment costs. Purposeful surveys con-
        ducted with migrant workers since 2014 as part of a joint initiative involving the Global Knowledge Partnership on
        Migration and Development (KNOMAD) and the ILO have produced new evidence on costs paid in more than 30
        bilateral corridors, involving interviews with over 5,500 workers. Surveys were conducted with migrants at various
        performance sites: in the destination country or in the origin countries at their residence or at the airport—both on
        arrival from abroad or prior to their departure for jobs overseas. Lessons learned from these experiences are being
        used to produce guidelines to support national statistical agencies in collecting data on a regular basis as part of
        efforts to monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals.

        While these data have greatly enhanced our understanding of recruitment costs, challenges remain in terms of
        identifying a representative sample, accessing migrant workers, and obtaining accurate and timely information on
        the various costs that are incurred by workers, who may not be willing to talk freely or may not be fully aware of
        what they paid for. Random representative sampling is nearly impossible to conduct, so a snowball sampling strat-
        egy was used. That is likely to have skewed the data reported here, as the most vulnerable migrants may not have
        responded, and as such the RCI reported above should be treated as a lower bound of actual recruitment costs in
        terms of monthly earnings.

   BOX 4.1:  Diaspora Bonds for Nigeria—Successes and Shortfalls


   The Government of Nigeria issued its first diaspora bond to raise $300 million on June 19, 2017. A diaspora bond
   is a retail savings instrument marketed only to members of a diaspora (Ketkar and Ratha 2010). The bonds were
   issued at a coupon rate of 5.625 percent for a tenure of five years. The Nigerian Government designated the
   Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and the Standard Bank of South Africa as joint lead managers for the sale. In July
   2017, Fitch ratings rated the bond at B+ with a negative outlook. The bond was oversubscribed by 130 percent
   indicative of investors’ favorable perspectives of the Nigerian economy’s future prospects. It is the first time that a
   Sub-Saharan African country reached such an important milestone in the stock market. Nigeria’s diaspora bond is
   also the first that a Sub-Saharan African country registered in the U.K. Listing Authority and the U.S. Security and
   Exchange Commission, specifically targeting retail investors (Vanguard 2017).

   Nigeria’s government issued this bond as a new alternative to finance development projects. This initiative follows
   a decline in foreign exchange earnings due to a sharp decline in the prices of global crude oil which reached a
   13-year low this year combined with a decline in oil production caused by the crisis in the Niger Delta. Nigeria’s
   economy is heavily dependent on the oil industry: in 2016, oil revenues accounted for 7 percent of total gross
   domestic product (GDP), 75 percent of foreign reserves, and 80 percent of total export earnings (Central Bank of
   Nigeria 2017). In the period 2010–15, oil revenues accounted on average for 75 percent of government revenues,
   but in 2016, this contribution dropped to 53 percent. This placed the public budget under distress and led to the
   devaluation of the naira.

   According to some critics, commercial banks may not know if buyers/investors are actually expatriate Nigerians or
   Nigerian migrants as the bonds were issued outside the country.

reducing remittance costs and recruitment costs. The Brief reports new data on recruitment
costs, a potential indicator for the SDG of promoting safe and regular migration. The
