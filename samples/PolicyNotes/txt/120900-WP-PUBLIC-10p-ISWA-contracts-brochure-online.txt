    Contract for the Design, Construction, Operation and Financing of Landfill Gas-to-Energy Plant in
    Mexico
    Contract Size: $10.84 million
    Description: Through a $5.1 million grant provided by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and $5.7
    million in financing from a private sector strategic partner, the World Bank worked with the Mexican
    government, the City of Monterrey, and private actors to form a cogeneration company that would
    design, construct and operate the facility and to sell the
    energy generated by the facility to the members of the
    company. The project is currently providing electricity to
    the city of Monterrey’s street lights during the night and
    its Metro system during the day. The project is reducing
    greenhouse gas emissions from the landfill. The project
    also contributed to the development of an innovative
    public-private-partnership that overcame regulatory
    limitations for investment in the power sector in Mexico.
    Selection Process: A joint venture agreement between
    SEMIPRODE, the landfill operator and a cogeneration
    company, “Bioelectrica” that included a private sector
    consortium, was reached to provide financing in the
    amount of $10.84 million for the construction of the plant
    and arrangements for operation and revenue sharing. The
    strategic private sector consortium was procured through
    an international competitive bidding process. SIMEPRODE
    organized the bid based on a selection process for pre-
    qualified bidders based on their experience in design,
    construction and operation of landfill gas facilities,
    their personnel and financing capabilities and included
    technical as well as financial proposals.

                                  Description: In May 2009, the World Bank approved the Southern West Bank
                                  Solid Waste Management project to improve solid waste disposal services
                                  for the communities and businesses of Palestinian municipalities. Unsanitary
                                  and uncontrolled solid wastes disposal has become a serious public health
                                  and environmental hazard of great concern to the Palestinian people in
                                  the West Bank and Gaza. The vast majority of solid waste produced by the
                                  Palestinian population in the West Bank, except in the northern region,
                                  is disposed of at unregulated dump sites. This project had stakeholder

                                  Procurement: A competitive bidding process was conducted through the

 Contract for Procurement of Solid Waste Equipment for Monrovia, Liberia
 Contract size: Six contracts between $16,500 and $49,500 for the supply of pickups, tow pickups, and
 skip bucket trucks
 Description: Through a grant from the Liberia Reconstruction Trust Fund (LRTF) supported by the
 International Development Association (IDA), the Government of Liberia contracted the construction and
 provision of municipal waste equipment as part of the Emergency Monrovia Urban Sanitation Project
 (EMUS). Liberia’s economy, institutions, and human capacity were completely devastated by the country’s
 14-year civil war, which ended in 2003. During the war, the extensive destruction of basic infrastructure
 contributed to the collapse of productive
 activities and a reversion, essentially, to a
 subsistence economy. Major public services,
 including sanitation, water supply, and
 electricity, were discontinued or shut off.
 Selection process: A competitive evaluation
 process was conducted through national
 competitive bidding using the World Bank
 procurement system following the World Bank
 procurement rules. The criteria were explicitly
 provided and the posting was advertised
 globally. The Project Implementation Unit of
 the Monrovia City Corporation contracted
 the selected firm.

                                   Description: Waste in 26 neighborhoods of San Fernando were being
                                   disposed of in uncontrolled landfills, causing health and environmental
                                   hazards for the 120,000 people living in the area. In addition, many of
                                   the local authorities do not have an independent waste management
                                   department. The World Bank piloted a Design, Build, and Operate
                                   contract of a managed landfill to address this challenge.
                                   Procurement: A competitive bidding process was conducted through
                                   national competitive bidding using the World Bank procurement system
                                   following the World Bank procurement rules. The criteria were explicitly
