      BOX 1.   Relevant Literature


      This report builds on previous work from the World Bank and others. It borrows significantly from the
      conceptual framework and practical typology proposed by the report, “Models of Aggregation for Water
      and Sanitation Provision.” (World Bank 2005). External literature also has been consulted substantially, for
      example on the issue of economies of scale. A complete literature review is available in the online toolkit,
      which provides resources to support aggregation processes.

There can be many reasons an
aggregation is not successful.
Despite the potential for econo-

term    transaction     costs    may
prevent the economies from
appearing.2 Aggregation also has
possible drawbacks, such as loss
in accountability and political
reluctance that may hamper the
process of aggregation, blocking
it before it takes off or damaging
it after it is launched. Clustering
of service areas increases the
distance between the service
provider and the end user.

unit might be adjusted to reflect
