              FOREWORD
We are pleased to share the latest edition of the Madagascar Economic Update, which reports up to the beginning of
October 2017, and provides our economic outlook for the medium-term. Despite a challenging start due to two climatic
shocks, we project growth at 4.1 percent in 2017, a continuation of the positive trend from last year. Key growth drivers in
2017 are expected to remain as services-related activities, construction works to partly support the reconstruction efforts
from the natural disasters, and strong demand for Malagasy textiles from abroad.

The severe drought in the first few months of the year affected agricultural activities and reduced hydroelectric power
supply. Output for key staples such as rice fell, contributing to higher inflation and an increase in food imports. And in
March 2017, Madagascar experienced its most severe cyclone in 13 years, where losses were estimated at US$ 400 million,
equivalent to approximately 4 percent of GDP.

These weather events have highlighted again Madagascar’s vulnerability to climatic shocks as well as its ability to act
swiftly when disasters strike. The Central Bank has continued to control inflation by tightening liquidity operations and
increasing the policy rate. The budget has been recast to incorporate emergency-related spending.

In this edition’s Special Focus Section, we discuss how Madagascar’s institutional environment is evolving, which the World
Bank measures through the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment. We are pleased to share that since the return
to constitutional order in 2014, we have noted a gradual improvement in the quality of Malagasy institutions, notably in
the areas of social protection and budgetary management.

This improvement to the institutional environment is critical given the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Following
a successful Donors and Investors Conference in December 2016, US$6.4 billion was pledged by development partners
for the 2017-2020 period, including US$2.1 billion of undisbursed commitments and US$4.3 billion in new commitments.
The private sector also announced US$3.5 billion worth of investment projects. In total, external financing is expected
to increase to an annual average of 16.7 percent of GDP over 2017-2021, assuming a steady scale-up. Building strong
institutions is key for ensuring these resources are used well.

We maintain a positive medium-term growth outlook, provided that the momentum for implementing key reforms continues.
In particular, efforts should continue to focus on improving the performance of state-owned enterprises, which pose a
significant drain on public resources, strengthening the business environment, and curbing corruption.

We hope that you enjoy reading this edition of the Economic Update.

1. Economic growth in 2017 is estimated at 4.1 percent                   of public works activities partly reflects emergency
despite two natural disasters. This growth rate follows                  construction works in response to the severe grade 4
the same trend as 2016. The current growth is favorable                  cyclone ENAWO that hit Madagascar in March 2017. The
in comparison with the average for the last ten years up                 secondary sector is expected to continue expanding, as
to 2016, which includes the political crisis period 2009-                textiles exports are forecast to remain strong following

average. The most important growth driver is the tertiary                Opportunities Act (AGOA).1 However, agricultural activities
sector, supported by public works and related activities                 are expected to contract by nearly 6 percent, following
such as trade, services and transport. The expansion                     the effects of the cyclone.

Madagascar is vulnerable to natural hazards and has the               each region. In the North-Eastern part of the country,
greatest exposures to cyclones in Africa.2 Between 1982               damages resulted mainly from strong winds reaching up

   Disbursement is expected at the start of 2018. In 2016 the AfDB agreed to provide a partial credit guarantee for a loan of US$55m from
Deutsche Bank to cover the financing gap, but disbursement was delayed to June 2017.

   Madagascar has an Extended Credit Facility arrangement with the IMF, where member countries can request augmentation of access
of quota when there are shocks. The IMF Executive Board approved a disbursement of $86 million, including an augmentation of $42
million, at its meeting on June 28, 2017.

   The Debt Sustainability Analysis assesses the risk of external debt distress. To assess debt sustainability, debt burden indicators
are compared to indicative thresholds over a 20-year projection period. A debt-burden indicator that exceeds its indicative threshold
suggests a risk of experiencing some form of debt difficulty. A moderate level of debt distress indicates that debt burden indicators are
below the thresholds in the baseline scenario, but stress tests indicate that thresholds could be breached if there are external shocks
or abrupt changes in macroeconomic policies.
22
   The latest available Debt Sustainability Analysis estimates JIRAMA’s long term and short term debt to be around 5.5 percent of GDP and
another 1 percent for a possible recapitalization of the Caisse d’epargne, the Madagascar Savings Fund.

ASSESSING CHANGES TO
MADAGASCAR'S INSTITUTIONS
AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT
               18
Since the return to constitutional order in 2014, there has been a steady improvement in the quality of Malagasy
institutions. Specifically, the institutional environment for social protection, and the quality of budgetary
management has improved. The World Bank measures the quality of policies and institutions through an
instrument called the Country Policy Institutional Assessment. The evidence shows that countries with stronger
institutions are likely to have better development outcomes. There is scope to further enhance the quality of
Malagasy institutions, particularly in the areas of property rights, and transparency and accountability in the
public sector.

   The distance to frontier score helps assess the absolute level of regulatory performance over time. It measures the distance of each
economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing
