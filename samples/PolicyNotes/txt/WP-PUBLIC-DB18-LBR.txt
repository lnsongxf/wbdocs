About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Private surveyor

      A topographical survey is done to study the slope of the land for the design
      of the building plans, mainly the water and sewage.

  4   Submit plans to Ministry of Public Works                                            1 day                    no charge
      Agency : Ministry of Public Works (MPW)

      The application le should include 2 copies of the site plan; letter of request
      addressed to the Deputy Minister; the land deed; and the architectural,
      structural, and mechanical drawings. These documents are passed from one
      o cial to another for approval at the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) before
      the building permit is issued. Physically all departments are located in
      di erent parts of the city which may delay the approval.


      The documents are submitted internally at the MPW in the following order:
      • O ce of the Deputy Minister, Technical Services
      • O ce of the Assistant Minister, Technical Services (initial recipient)
      • Land-Use Planning and Zoning Division (initial site plan and document
      review). There are no thorough checks with the National Archives on the
      authenticity of the land documents, ensuring that is the responsibility of the
      owner of the warehouse.
      • Chief of Zoning (physical site approval)
      • Chief of Architecture (design approval)
      • Chief of Electromechanical Engineering (electrical and mechanical approval)
      • Chief of Engineering (structural approval and billing)
      • Finance Section (payments)
      • Land-Use Planning and Programming (signature on permit)
      • O ce of the Deputy Minister, Technical Services (permit attached)


      A temporary building permit can be granted after the second step above,
      when the Land-Use Planning and Zoning Division conducts an initial site plan
      and document review. This temporary permit can be obtained within one
      week. It is granted for a maximum of 90 days, but this is an exception rather
      than the rule. In practice, a permit is accorded after all steps mentioned
      above have been completed. As a result of the weak enforcement of building
      regulations, partly a result of the post-con ict situation, many private
      construction projects take place without following the o cial guidelines.

       Agency : Ministry of Public Works (Zoning Division)

       It takes about 3 days for the Zoning Division to process an application. The
       Zoning Division will contact the applicant to inform them that they will need
       an inspection. There are only 4 inspectors and resources are limited, so the
       applicant has to provide transportation for them.

   6   Obtain payment slip from the Ministry of Public Works                             1 day     USD 700
       Agency : Ministry of Public Works (MPW)

       Once all the technical departments have reviewed the application, the
       Finance Department creates a payment slip. BuildCo must pick up the
       payment slip and then go the Central Bank to pay the fees. The fee for design
       approval for commercial buildings is USD 0.05 per sq. ft.

   7   Obtain construction permit from the Ministry of Public Works                      28 days   no charge
       Agency : Ministry of Public Works (MPW)

       BuildCo must return to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) with the payment
       receipt and the application is then processed for nal approval. The process
       at the MPW from submission of plans (procedure 1) to approval used to take
       3 months, but reforms introduced in 2008 reduced the processing time for
       simple building permits to 1 month. The MPW established a 30-day statutory
       time limit for the issuance of building permits. The MPW also introduced a
       checklist to clearly de ne all of the documents required to complete the
       application. Now all applications are scrutinized on submission to check for
       completeness and accuracy before being forwarded for processing. The
       reform eliminated the Minister’s signature on building permits for simple
       construction projects. By rule, the Minister's consent is only required for
       projects with a value greater than USD 1 million or that involve a foreign
       government. However, in practice the Minister or Deputy Minister still
       approves projects that are less than USD 1 million in value.

   8   Obtain construction clearance from the City Corporation of Monrovia               2 days    USD 560
       Agency : City Corporation of Monrovia

       After obtaining the design approval from the MPW, BuildCo must obtain a
       separate construction clearance from the Planning Department at the City
       Corporation of Monrovia. The Planning Department takes 1 day to review the
       plans and then prepares a payment slip which is usually paid the next day.


       City Corporation of Monrovia as of May 1, 2009 abolished 3% fee charge,
       based on project value, for issuing a building permit and replaced it with a
        xed fee of USD 0.04 per sq. ft. for new commercial and industrial
       construction projects.


       However, practitioners note that this fee is "negotiable". Applicants can pay a
       less amount, which is o cial, for a clearance that will last for a shorter
       period of time. There are no fee schedules posted at the City Corporation
       and often, builders are asked to pay much higher fees.

       The construction of the warehouse can commence after the building permit
       is obtained. There is no requirement to request inspections at any stage of
       the construction process. However, building inspectors and engineers are
       often dispatched from the Ministry of Public Works to inspect construction
       sites to see to what extent the construction conforms with the originally                               Page 14

       work stops only if the plans have not been complied with.

      Agency : Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC)

      Water connections can be made if existing pipelines pass through the
      construction site. If that is the case, then the water connection should take 1
      -- 2 weeks. The cost for water connection includes LRD 250.00 for the
      connection itself and USD 50.00 for the meter. If a water pipeline does not
      pass through the area, then BuildCo must buy all the necessary materials to
      extend an existing pipeline to the construction site before the connection is
      made. This will inevitably add cost and time to the utility connection process.

 24   Request and obtain occupancy permit                                                   10 days                     no charge
      Agency : Ministry of Public Works (MPW)

      In the recent year the Ministry of Public Works started more rigorously
      enforcing the regulations of the Zoning Law. According to article 5. A of the
      Zoning Law all new building must obtain an occupancy permit before being
      used. Stricter enforcement has led to wider practice by companies to obtain
      the occupancy permit. This is issued within 10 days.

 25   Register the building at the Probate Court                                            3 days                      LRD 300
      Agency : Probate Court

      This registration of the completed building occurs in two stages. First
      BuildCo must register the building with the Probate Court, similar to a
      notarization procedure. Registration at the Probate Court takes 3 days and
      costs LRD 300.00. The case considered here assumes that BuildCo does not
      employ a lawyer (lawyer’s fees would amount to USD 250.00). Registration is
      not required, but companies do so to increase the resale value.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

       Agency : Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), Monrovia

       The Technical Department will come out and inspect the premises.The main
       purpose of the inspection (as with most business-activity-related inspections
       in Liberia) is to prove that the business exists. The inspector will draw
       sketches of the location, etc. to determine Liberia Electricity Corporation’s
       capacity to deliver power. Inspectors submit a report to their department,
       which then gets forwarded to the Commercial Department. Once the
       Commercial Department approves the application, it noti es the Computer
       section to prepare an invoice. Once the invoice is prepared, it gets sent back
       to the Commercial Department and they contact the customer to come pick
       up the invoice. The customer comes to LEC and signs a ledger to accept
       payment invoice.

   3   Obtain external works from LEC                                                      75 calendar days        USD 8,400
       Agency : Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), Monrovia

       Only Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) can carry out the external works.
       The utility currently has the material readily available in stock, which has
       greatly reduced delays by many months.
       The works consist of expanding the overhead network by installing poles, a
       transformer and its accessories and extending wires to the warehouse.

   4   Obtain internal wiring inspection, meter installation and nal                       376 calendar days       USD 7,047.14
       connection from LEC
       Agency : Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC), Monrovia

       When the external works have been completed, and the electrician has
        nished doing the internal installation, the utility will inspect the wiring and
       turn on the supply.
       The client will need to pay a security deposit and a registration fee. The cost
       of the meter is included in the registration fee.

       Security deposit: based on one month of consumption

       Registration fee: There is also a registration fee equivalent to 20% of the Bill
       of Quantity. When the type of material and the quantity needed has been
       determined, and also what needs to be done, and the labor cost, the
       customer will be required to pay a registration fee equivalent to 20% of the
       Bill of Quantity.

      One of the requirements prior to transferring a property in Liberia is to
      conduct a survey of that property by a licensed surveyor. The potential
      buyer will contact a certi ed surveyor to conduct the survey of the property
      to be transferred. The property cannot be surveyed during the notice
      period. Any person wishing to introduce a claim of ownership on that
      property must come forward during the notice period. If there are no
      disputes recorded after the notice period, then the surveyor will conduct the
      survey of the property with the potential buyer as a witness, and anyone else
      who wishes to be present.

      By law, the surveyor must inform the public that the survey or re-survey of a
      particular property will be conducted on a set date. The notice will also
      provide the location of that property. The notice is published in local
      newspapers and is also aired for a period of 15 days. But the law is silent as
      to the length of this notice.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                     equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                 - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                       movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer             Explanation

Proceeding          foreclosure        Pursuant to Section 6.20 of the Liberian Commercial Code, after 60 days since Mirage's
                                       default on payment, BizBank is entitled to commence foreclosure by filing a complaint
                                       against Mirage, showing that a default has occurred in the obligations secured by the
                                       mortgage and requesting that the mortgage be foreclosed in a court-supervised sale.

Outcome             piecemeal sale     The hotel will stop operating and Mirage assets will be sold piecemeal in a public auction
                                       upon the completion of foreclosure proceeding.

Time (in years)     3.0                The foreclosure procedure takes approximate 3 years until BizBank is repaid some or all of
                                       the money owed to it. After 60 days as of Mirage's default on payment, BizBank would initiate
                                       foreclosure procedure by filing a written complaint to the Commercial Court with copies
                                       served on Mirage. Mirage would then file against the foreclosure. It will take approximate 1.5
                                       years for the Court to hold hearings, conduct pretrial conference, until a money judgment is
                                       issued with orders for public auction if not paid. This may followed by Mirage's appealing to
                                       the Justice in Chambers of the Supreme Court for review by way of certiorari or prohibition. If
                                       not satisfied with the ruling from the Justice in Chambers of the Supreme Court, Mirage can
                                       appeal the ruling to the Full Supreme Court Bench. The whole appealing process until the
                                       final ruling is made by the Supreme Court will take approximate 1.5 years. When the
                                       Supreme Court delivers a judgement, it will send it back to the Commercial Court which
                                       reads the mandate and approves it. After this, the sheriff proceeds with the auction. The
                                       execution of the assets sale usually takes place within a month and the sale proceeds will be
                                       paid to BizBank.

Cost (% of          30.0               The cost associated with the case would amount to approximately 30% of the value of the
estate)                                debtor's estate. The cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly includes court
                                       fees (5%), attorneys’ fees (15%), auctioneer's fees (5%), assessors' fees (4%), and other fees
                                       (1%).

   Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
