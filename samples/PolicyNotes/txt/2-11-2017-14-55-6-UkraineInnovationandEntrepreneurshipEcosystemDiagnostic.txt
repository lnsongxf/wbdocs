Executive Summary

This report is one of several analytical pieces developed by the World Bank’s Ukraine Technical Assistance
on Innovation Support project, supported by the Swedish Ukraine Financial and Enterprise Sector
Recovery and Growth Trust Fund. This report attempts to (a) identify the gaps that impede enterprise
innovation in Ukraine and (b) develop recommendations for policy reforms and support instruments. The
three supporting analytical pieces performed by the Ukraine Innovation Support project team are as
follows:

    •   Ukraine Science, Technology, and Innovation Public Expenditure Analysis, which attempts to
        evaluate the quality mix of public support programs for science, technology, and innovation (STI)
        and provide recommendations for the improvement of the support programs’ effectiveness
    •   Ukraine Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Regulatory Review, which attempts to
        identify regulatory and framework impediments for the commercialization of publicly funded
        research and recommends reforms and policies that could improve the framework conditions for
        intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer (TT)
    •   Fiscal Incentives for Science, Technology, and Innovation Best Practice Review, which reviews
        different international good practices in introducing fiscal incentives for supporting STI and
        provides policy recommendations relevant to the implementation of such incentives in Ukraine
This report adopts a comprehensive definition of innovation as the successful new application of
knowledge, in the form of new products, services, or processes. This application can be either new to the
world (first introduction anywhere in the world), new to the market (first introduction to a country’s
market), or new to the firm (first use by a specific firm). Innovation is strongly linked to productivity growth
and underlies improvements in a country’s standard of living. Over the long term, a country’s ability to
develop or adopt new technologies and put them to use is a major determinant of a country’s economic
health and standard of living.

Because innovation involves the introduction of products, services, or processes into use, companies are
the main innovators. Consequently, this report focuses on understanding the environment in Ukraine,
referred to as the ‘innovation ecosystem’, that affects companies’ ability to innovate. This includes the
business/market structure, government policies and programs, human capital, research and development
(R&D), the financial environment, and various kinds of infrastructure.

The report assesses the Ukrainian innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) ecosystem with respect to three
categories of companies:

    •   Existing Ukrainian companies
    •   New entrepreneurial companies
    •   Foreign companies making innovation-related investments in Ukraine
The report is based on available literature and previous studies, as well as interviews with domestic
companies, multinational companies operating in Ukraine, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and private
equity firms, business associations, universities, and researchers studying industry and innovation in
Ukraine. The team also met with representatives of the Ukrainian government and public sector
stakeholders such as the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT), Ministry of Education and

                                                 Page |2
Science (MESU), Ministry of Finance, the Presidential Administration, parliament members and
committees, the Reform Delivery Office, the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU), and some
Ukrainian scholars and researchers of business innovation (full list of interviewees in appendix I). The
scope of the study did not allow for in-depth examination of the regional aspects of innovation in Ukraine
or focus on a specific industrial sector. The main purpose of study was to provide a broad diagnostic of
the environment for innovation and entrepreneurship in Ukraine, as a precursor to assisting the
Government of Ukraine in implementing innovation-related policy reforms and the development of
innovation support organizations and programs.

 Findings
Innovation Potential of Ukraine: Toward an Innovation-based Economy

Ukraine has great potential to develop an innovation-based economy driven by its immense talents and
entrepreneurial skills. It has many features that other transition economies envy: a well-educated and
talented workforce; a long tradition of science and technology (S&T) research; significant natural
resources and agricultural production capacity; a successful information technology (IT) industry;
increasing access to markets in Europe; and a large and successful knowledge diaspora that can provide
knowledge and access. These features provide great potential for Ukraine to rapidly advance if some of
the challenges detailed in this report can be overcome on the sectoral level as well as economy wide. This,
of course, requires a clear government commitment at the highest levels to supporting innovation and
innovation reforms and a clear vision to transition the Ukrainian economy to a knowledge-based,
innovation-driven economy.

Innovation Ecosystem for Existing Companies

Innovation activity in Ukrainian companies is currently low by international comparison—just 17 percent
of companies are innovative (defined as introducing a new product or process, either in the market or just
in their enterprise) compared to a European Union (EU) average of 49 percent. Most innovation is ‘new
to firm’, most commonly through purchasing of equipment, rather than ‘new to the world’ innovation.

Innovation in Ukrainian firms is low for several structural reasons, including the following:

    •   Industry is concentrated in sectors that are usually characterized as low R&D sectors (metals and
        heavy engineering).
    •   The Ukrainian market provides little motivation for innovation due to low competitive pressures.
        The legacy of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and weak competition policy has led to lack of
        competition and market demand for innovation. Most firms are focused on the domestic market
        and, thus, are not facing pressures to innovate from the international marketplace.
R&D and innovation in Ukrainian industry have been declining. As trade has shifted from the Russian
Federation and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries toward the EU, industrial output
has shifted away from technology-based manufacturing toward commodity agriculture and metals,
resulting in a decline in R&D and innovation. The defense industrial complex (aerospace and aviation) has
also been hit by this shift.

Small and medium enterprise (SME) innovation is especially weak in Ukraine. SMEs are hurt by a lack of
skills, knowledge, and financing, as well as by weak competition policy. Because large SOEs and former


                                                Page |3
SOEs are not innovative in general, there is little demand for innovative SMEs as suppliers. There is no
functioning innovation support system to help provide SMEs with access to knowledge and technology.
SMEs are poorly integrated in western international value chains, which are often a source of knowledge
transfer.

Ukrainian companies that seek to innovate face a difficult environment. While each industrial sector has
its own set of issues, interviewees from each sector described how, in different ways, poor performance
of state institutions severely limited its performance. The issues included conflicting regulations, slow
permitting and approvals, delays at customs, and poor performance of SOEs (from railroads to blood
banks). These severely hamper the ability of companies to innovate and compete in international markets.

Research institutions and universities do not effectively support innovation in Ukrainian companies. Both
are structured to service the old, pre-independence economy and are in need of major reform to adapt
to the new private sector realities. However, there is little demand from business for such institutions to
support innovation.

A bright spot is the growth of the IT outsourcing industry, which provides software development services
for international clients. Most IT outsourcing firms have been using individuals as self-employed
contractors. The outsourcing service model avoids many of the problems of the weak business and policy
environment, and the use of self-employed contactors is encouraged by the Ukrainian tax policy. Although
this study did not examine thoroughly specific industrial sectors, other industries, such as agriculture and
foods, have great potential for innovation and growth. Further research and analysis of the innovative
potentials of the agricultural sector, especially in ways that it could harness the country’s IT talent to
increase productivity and efficiency, could be useful to guide sectoral innovation policy and program
design.

Ecosystem for Entrepreneurial Companies

The overall environment for entrepreneurship in Ukraine has many challenges; however, some
entrepreneurs are succeeding in building globally successful ventures. Ukraine has improved processes
for business formation, but licensing, permits, taxes, and corruption continue to be major problems.
Ukraine’s industrial structure with large noncompetitive SOEs, and high barriers to entry and exit, reduces
opportunities for entrepreneurs. Poor insolvency laws and weak IP increase the risks for
entrepreneurship.

Ukraine has a small but promising group of innovative entrepreneurial companies that are focused on
international markets. These high-growth potential firms have found ways to reach international markets,
acquire venture capital (VC) financing and business advice, and find manufacturing partners. They have
been aided by an informal mentoring network as well as the Ukrainian diaspora. These firms are strongly
encouraged by their financiers and mentors to incorporate their companies overseas, where rule of law
is stronger, managerial experience is available, and they can be closer to their leading markets (typically
the United States and western Europe). As foreign companies, they outsource services to individual
contractors in Ukraine. This strategy allows these start-ups avoid corruption, weak insolvency and IP laws,
and corporate taxes in Ukraine. While this approach is not ideal for Ukraine in the long run (due to
foregone tax revenue and likely increasing ‘brain drain’, for example), it is a workable approach that allows
entrepreneurial companies to grow and contribute some value to Ukraine, in spite of the weaknesses in
the Ukrainian business environment.



                                                Page |4
The culture in Ukraine has not historically been supportive of entrepreneurship, and there have been
relatively few entrepreneurial success stories to date, leading to a lack of role models that would make
entrepreneurship attractive. Recently, there have been a growing number of accelerators, incubators, and
events to support entrepreneurship, but there is potential to significantly expand these activities (see list
in appendix II). The number of entrepreneurial companies is primarily limited by the pipeline of potential
entrepreneurs with fundable ideas, which is in turn limited by the number of people with the motivation
and skills to be entrepreneurs. Interviewees suggested that based on the country’s amount of technical
and creative talent, the pipeline of fundable ideas could be greatly increased (by perhaps a factor of 10)
with more programs to encourage entrepreneurship and to provide training and seed funding.

Innovation Ecosystem for Multinational Companies in Ukraine

Foreign direct investment (FDI) is critical to bring technology, management skill, and capital to Ukraine.
FDI in Ukraine is low compared to peer countries (and declined in 2014–2015 due to the eastern crisis).
Most FDI is focused in relatively low-innovation sectors, such as machine building, metals, food
processing, and finance/banking.

Foreign multinationals limit their investments in Ukraine due to high business risk, including war, political
instability and uncertainty, corruption, and weak rule of law. Interviewees noted the risk of government
confiscation of property. Some international IT firms are not investing due to concerns about freedom of
speech/press and overly intrusive cybersecurity policies.

With some exceptions, Ukraine’s technology capabilities do not attract large foreign investments. IT is an
important exception. In addition to outsourcing firms, a significant number of international firms have set
up technology centers, often for software development. There is also some foreign investment in areas
such as aerospace, drawing on capabilities developed in the Soviet era.

Ukraine’s talent, low costs, and large market size could drive additional FDI if barriers to investment are
removed. Ukraine has been taking steps to remove barriers to investment, such as joining the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) declaration on investment and
multinational enterprises (MNEs). Some multinational companies operating in Ukraine, however, express
skepticism about the government’s commitment to fighting corruption.

 Cross-cutting Findings
Leadership, Governance, and Policy

Existing Ukrainian companies, entrepreneurial firms, and foreign firms operating in Ukraine all view
corruption, outdated or conflicting regulations, slow approvals, and poor functioning of state institutions
as barriers to innovation and business performance. Government bureaucracy either passively resists
innovation or actively inhibits change that threatens existing vested interests. Additionally, technical
regulations that are tied to the former Soviet Union rather than the west inhibit participation in
international value chains.

Current innovation-related policies are rarely coordinated among ministries and are poorly implemented
and funded. There is little coordination of innovation policy among the MESU, the MEDT, the Ministry of
Finance, and ministries with sectoral and regional responsibilities. Recommendations from previous
innovation studies have, in general, not been effectively implemented or funded.


                                                Page |5
The IP legal framework is sound, but there are issues with implementation and enforcement, including
lack of clarity regarding the responsibility of different ministries and lack of institutional capacity to
implement the framework (For a detailed discussion of the IP Framework, see the Ukraine Intellectual
Property and Technology Transfer Regulatory Review prepared by the World Bank team).

Innovation programs at the regional level are uneven and are, in general, poorly funded. However, there
are some examples of successful regional programs, such as the information and communication
technology (ICT) cluster in Lviv.

Some business organizations, including the IT Ukraine Association, the European Business Association
(EBA), and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, are actively advocating for an improved business
climate, but many industries lack associations that advocate for policies that promote innovation and
competitiveness.

Access to Knowledge and Technology

Ukraine’s once-strong S&T institutions have weakened since independence and are poorly structured and
funded for innovation. Most government R&D funding goes to the NASU, which is nevertheless poorly
funded and is in decline, with aging staff and facilities (for a detailed discussion of Ukraine’s public
expenditures on R&D, see Ukraine Science, Technology, and Innovation Public Expenditure Analysis report
prepared by the World Bank team). The structure of research institutes is tied to old areas of economy—
former state-owned companies, defense, and resource industries—rather than emerging areas of the
economy. IP protection and TT mechanisms are weak. Some companies work informally with NASU
researchers as individual consultants, which, while not ideal, does provide a mechanism for NASU
research to provide value to the economy.

Universities receive little research funding and are (with some important exceptions) poorly connected to
industry. As a result, many faculty are viewed as both out of date in their fields and unable to prepare
students for research or work in private companies.

Finance

Access to finance is rated by SMEs as a major barrier to growth. Debt financing is limited, and interest
rates are high. Most investments in innovation are internally financed by companies. Equity financing
through stock market is mostly unavailable due to weak institutions and rule of law. Ukraine has some
private equity firms and venture firms, which are funding some innovative companies.

International VC funds will invest in Ukrainian entrepreneurs if they see a good opportunity. In this sense,
VC funding is limited not by capital but by fundable companies. However, investors will want the company
to be established outside of Ukraine. VC funding for firms focused on the Ukrainian market is much more
limited.

Capital is relatively mobile in search of high returns; therefore, lack of finance for innovation in Ukraine
may be largely a symptom of other problems—perceived political instability, corruption, lack of
confidence in judicial system, and foreign currency control regulations—that prevent investment.




                                               Page |6
Human Capital

While Ukraine’s education system continues to have strengths in math and science, universities need
fundamental reforms. Universities are weak in matching education to meet the current skill needs of
employers and are insufficiently flexible and adaptive, especially in fast-moving areas such as IT. The
structure of universities and training institutes, as well as their curriculum, is matched to the old economy
not the future economy. Weak business and management education may be a barrier to innovation and
entrepreneurship.

Due to lack of job opportunities for university graduates, many highly skilled Ukrainians work in other
countries or work for companies based in other countries. However, even people with good job prospects
in Ukraine may seek to move to other countries where long-term opportunities are perceived to be better,
reflecting concerns about the ability of the government to improve the country.

Supports/Infrastructure

Transportation infrastructure in Ukraine—roads, railways, and ports— is viewed as weak and can be a
barrier to integrating Ukrainian industry into international supply chains and thus is a barrier to foreign
investment and innovation. ICT infrastructure is adequate in major cities, enabling the IT outsourcing
industry.

Research infrastructure (facilities and equipment) has declined significantly over the last 20 years.
Innovation and entrepreneurship infrastructure, such as S&T parks, incubators, and business accelerators,
have been established but many are inactive and only a few are successful. There is no broad system to
provide innovation support (knowledge transfer and technology transfer) to SMEs, although some EU
programs are focused in this area.

 Next Steps
The purpose of this I&E ecosystem diagnosis is to serve as a platform for developing recommendations.
The diagnosis suggests some priority areas.

First, it is clear that Ukraine has major systemic and structural issues to address to develop a well-
functioning I&E ecosystem in the long term. These include

    •   Broad governance reform, including reducing corruption, restoring trust in government,
        reforming the judiciary, improving regulations, and other institutional areas;
    •   Addressing issues of industrial structure, including strengthening competition policy, reforming
        SOEs, supporting SMEs, and supporting technology-based industries through cluster policies or
        ‘smart specialization’; and
    •   Fundamental reforms of public research institutes and universities, including reforming the
        NASU and piloting targeted programs that could bring research activities closer to the needs of
        local industries (for more details on reforming the NASU, see Ukraine’s STI Public Expenditure
        Analysis Report recommendations).
Reforms in each of these areas are critical for innovation and also for the overall performance of the
private sector and the investment attractiveness of the country. Developing comprehensive solutions to


                                                Page |7
each of these issues is beyond the scope of this report, and there are already efforts under way in most
of these areas, by the EU, the World Bank, and other development organizations.

Second, the report suggests some areas where shorter-term and more targeted interventions can improve
Ukraine’s I&E ecosystem. Previous reports on innovation in Ukraine led to numerous recommendations
but little sustained implementation, often due to lack of commitment or of budget allocated for programs.
Thus, this report focuses instead on a narrower innovation agenda that is intended to be implementable.
The goal is to provide sustained attention to removing barriers to innovation and to build on programs
that are already working to create momentum toward further reforms. The suggested actions could fall
into the following categories:

Strengthen Innovation Leadership and Coordination

Although innovation is critical to Ukraine’s future—ultimately determining the productivity of the
economy and Ukraine’s standard of living—currently, there is no institutional focus on innovation in
Ukraine’s government. Actions that affect innovation are spread throughout many ministries and public
institutions, and there is a lack of coordination and advocacy within the government for actions to remove
barriers to innovation and improve industrial competitiveness.

Ukraine should have an innovation agency that

    •   Develops, advocates, and publicizes a national vision of an innovation-based economy;
    •   Serves as a platform to (a) channel the voice of industry regarding identifying and removing
        barriers to innovation on the sectoral and horizontal levels and (b) advocate for innovation-
        related reforms, including steps to reduce corruption, implement reform regulations, support
        entrepreneurship, and expand public and private R&D expenditures and collaborations;
    •   Identifies working I&E programs and scales them up in coverage and magnitude through technical
        and financial support and
    •   Design, administer, and implement pilot support programs targeting enterprise innovation and
        entrepreneurial activities.
This agency should work closely with industry groups to understand what the industry needs to succeed
in innovation and should work closely across ministries of the government to remove barriers to
innovation and to implement innovation support programs. Importantly, it should work to earn the trust
of the industry—the low current levels of trust between the industry and the government constitute a
major barrier to effective innovation programs. As various government policy changes are considered, the
innovation agency should ensure that the reforms have industry input regarding how the reforms would
affect innovation and the competitiveness of firms. The agency should provide continuity in government
innovation reform efforts in contrast to the current disintegrated approach. It should advocate for
sustainable budgets for innovation programs and advocate for competition policy, universities, and public
research institutions reform.

Identify and Scale up Working Approaches

Given the uneven record of previous discontinued initiatives, we suggest a modest near-term strategy of
building on initiatives that already appear to be working. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential
focus programs:


                                                Page |8
    •   Expanding entrepreneurship support programs, such as building on the Science Park and
        entrepreneurship programs at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI). Our interviews suggested a strong
        potential and need for expanding the pipeline of new companies. Expanded entrepreneurship
        support programs targeting investment readiness of start-ups, including training programs, seed
        funds, incubators/accelerators, business plan competitions, and mentoring, could have an
        immediate impact. Building on the successful programs in universities can also be expected to
        support reforms and culture change at universities.
    •   Building on and expanding regional cluster programs. Regional strategies involving local
        government, industry, and universities’ approaches can develop strong regional innovation
        ecosystems. Often, effective industry-government-university collaboration is easier to build at the
        regional level than at the national level. The IT cluster in Lviv may be a good model to scale into
        other regions and industries. The EU-supported regional smart specialization strategy is a useful
        way to proceed with such programs.
    •   Addressing the identified and immediate needs of already growing and leading sectors. For
        example, the IT and agriculture industries have been growing and exporting but have identified
        research, educational/training, and logistical needs for improving productivity and
        competitiveness. The envisioned agency and/or the respective ministries could take the lead on
        working throughout the government bodies to remove the barriers and address these immediate
        needs.
Pilot New Innovation Support Programs

In addition to the immediate roles articulated above, the innovation agency could design, administer, and
implement pilot support programs to innovative enterprises and start-ups to scale up and grow. Currently,
there are few, if any, public support programs (other than European or donor-supported programs) that
innovative Ukrainian enterprises could apply and compete for. The pilot programs, such as innovation
vouchers, innovation grants, and research collaboration grants, to name a few, could follow or adapt
models implemented in several benchmark economies and learn from countries’ experiences in setting
up, implementing, and monitoring such programs. The ability of this new agency to lead such pilots
depends on the level of competence of its staff, access to financial and technical resources, its degree of
autonomy, and the commitment of the government to the innovation agenda, to name a few.

The World Bank team, through the Innovation Support project, has been providing technical support to
the MEDT and the Reform Delivery Office in the context of designing and setting up such an innovation
agency (currently labeled as the Innovation Development Office) based on a request from the Prime
Minister’s Office. The mission, governance and institutional structure, areas of focus, and pilot support
programs are all currently under consideration by the main stakeholders. This report helps make the case
for such an agency and its missing role in supporting enterprise innovation but intentionally holds back
from prescribing the details of the institution and its programs. The details of these programs will be
developed with stakeholders as a next step.

Introduction

 Purpose and Scope
This report is part of the World Bank’s Ukraine Technical Assistance Mission on Innovation Support
project, supported by the Swedish Innovation Driven Economic Recovery and Growth Promotion in
Ukraine Trust Fund. It summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of Ukraine’s innovation and
entrepreneurship ecosystem in three areas:

    •   Promoting innovation by existing Ukrainian companies
    •   Creating innovative new companies
    •   Attracting innovation-related foreign investments to Ukraine
Innovation is the successful new application of knowledge, in the form of new products, services, or
processes. This application can be either new to the world (first introduction anywhere in the world), new
to the market (first introduction to a country’s market), or new to the firm (first used by a specific firm).
In transition economies, such as Ukraine, importing ideas and technology from abroad are often the main
source of innovation.

Innovation is strongly linked to productivity growth in an economy and underlies improvements in
standard of living. Over the long term, a country’s ability to develop or adopt new technologies and put
them to use is one of the most important factors determining a country’s economic strength and standard
of living, as well as its ability to meet other societal needs.

Because innovation, by definition, is putting new products, services, or processes into use, companies are
the main innovators. Universities, research institutions, or individual inventors may develop a new idea
or technology (invent), but almost always, it is companies that put the knowledge to use in new products,
services, or processes (innovate).

This report focuses on innovation from the perspective of the companies. The ability of companies to
innovate depends on many things, including finances, human resources, access to markets, a supportive
legal environment, and other factors. A country’s environment that affects companies’ ability and
motivation to innovate is often referred to as the country’s innovation system, or often innovation
‘ecosystem’, implying an analogy to biological ecosystems. This report looks at the set of institutions,
programs, laws, and policies that affect innovation in Ukraine with the goal of identifying areas where the
World Bank can assist in strengthening the system. The purpose of the report is to provide a broad
background on the innovation system of Ukraine, to serve as a basis for informed discussions about
policies, programs, and organizations to support innovation.

 Methodology and Organization
To analyze Ukraine’s innovation ecosystem, we started with the entrepreneurship ecosystem framework
developed by the Babson College Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Program.1 This assesses the ecosystem in
six categories:

    •    Policy - Leadership and government institutions/programs
    •    Finance - Availability of different types of funding for entrepreneurs
    •    Markets - Availability of early customers and networks to sell products and services
    •    Culture - Societal norms regarding risk taking and entrepreneurship and availability of role models
    •    Human capital - Labor force skills and quality of education/training for entrepreneurs
    •    Supports - Availability of infrastructure, supporting services, and nongovernment institutions that
         support entrepreneurship
We used this framework for assessing the innovation system for entrepreneurial companies, in the
Innovation Ecosystem for Entrepreneurial Companies section of this report.

For existing Ukrainian companies (Innovation Ecosystem for Existing Companies section), we modified this
framework to incorporate some elements that are important for innovation in existing companies. In
particular, we expanded the ‘markets’ section to also include a discussion of industrial structure, and we
added a category on ‘access to knowledge and technology’ to cover industries’ connection to research
organizations and other sources of knowledge. We deleted the element on ‘culture’ because most of the
discussion of culture and innovation either occurs in the context of entrepreneurship, which is covered in
that section, or in the context of corporate culture, which is beyond the scope of this analysis. This led to
the following six categories:

    •    Industry and market structure - Does the industry structure and markets encourage innovation?
         This involves the industrial structure of the country, the access to markets and market demand
         for innovation, and the degree of competition that provides motivation for innovation.
    •    Leadership, governance, and policy - Is there a strategy and are there effective policies to support
         innovation? Do government regulations, intellectual property (IP) policies, and tax policies
         support or inhibit innovation? Is there coordination among key institutions—industry, academia,
         and government—in innovation policy?
    •    Access to knowledge and technology - How well do universities and research institutions provide
         knowledge and technologies to companies? How affectively do Ukrainian companies access
         knowledge and technology developed in the rest of the world?
    •    Finance - How available is finance, through a variety of mechanism and incentives, for technology
         and innovation?
    •    Human capital - What is the quality and quantity of skills needed for innovative businesses? This
         encompasses scientific and technical skills, business skills, and workforce skills. It depends

        primarily on the quality of educational and training institutions and their connection to business
        needs.
    •   Supports - This includes physical infrastructure, information and communication technology (ICT)
        infrastructure, research and development (R&D) and testing facilities, and networks among
        institutions and science parks/technology parks.
For the section on attracting innovative foreign companies (Innovation Ecosystem for Multinational
Companies in Ukraine section), we used the same framework as for existing Ukrainian companies.

There are, of course, many common features in the innovation ecosystems for existing, entrepreneurial
and foreign companies. In each section we have tried to focus on the factors that are different for each
category of firm, and have tried to minimize repetition of the common factors.

The strength of using this framework is that it provides a systematic way to examine the many elements
of a country’s environment that are known to be important for innovation, and we look at each element
from the perspective of different categories of company. The broad scope of the analysis, however, makes
it difficult to go into much detail in any specific area.

We reviewed extensive prior work that included
    •   Major innovation reviews and strategy documents,
    •   Academic papers on Ukraine innovation and industry,
    •   Global Competitiveness Index and Global Innovation Index reports, and
    •   Statistics and survey results produced by Ukraine Statistical Office, World Bank, and others.

The prior work on innovation in Ukraine includes several major studies: the European Commission Policy
Support Facility’s Peer Review of the Ukrainian Research and Innovation System (2016) (European
Commission 2016; Schuch et al. 2016), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Innovation
Performance Review (2013) (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013, 152), and the three-
volume project funded by the European Union (EU) (Rumpf et al. 2011; EU Project “Enhance Innovation
Strategies, Policies, and Regulations in Ukraine” 2011a and 2011b). These studies are collectively quite
comprehensive in their analysis and recommendations.

In addition to these studies that focus on Ukraine’s innovation system, other major studies also address
industrial innovation. The Export Strategy of Ukraine (International Trade Center and MEDT 2017)
provides much information on the competitiveness and innovation status of Ukrainian industry. The
Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development (Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine 2015,
213) and the Hi Tech Strategy (MEDT 2017) address innovation in important segments of Ukrainian
industry. In addition, as part of this overall project, separate studies were commissioned on fiscal
incentives and IP.

This study seeks to build on the prior work in two main ways. First, it takes a broad systematic view by
examining all elements of the innovation ecosystem. And second, based on the understanding that firms
are the principal innovators, it views innovation from a company perspective, considering the
environment for innovation for existing, new, and foreign companies.

We also conducted interviews with individuals from Ukrainian companies, foreign companies operating
in Ukraine, startup companies, industry associations, and academic experts. We also conducted interviews

                                              P a g e | 12
with individuals from relevant government ministries, members of parliament, universities, and NASU.
These are listed in appendix I.

At the same time, it is important to note the limitations of this study. We did not study or conduct
interviews in the different regions of Ukraine, and we did not go into any depth into individual industrial
sectors. Our interviews covered a small and nonrepresentative sample of Ukrainian companies and missed
many sectors. The regional and sectoral aspects of innovation ecosystems are not addressed in any detail
here.

The previous studies on innovation in Ukraine show a high degree of consensus about the nature of
Ukraine’s challenges with respect to innovation, as well as many of the necessary steps to address the
problems. However, these studies and strategies have frequently not led to effective action—few
recommendations have been implemented or sustained through changes in government, policy, and
personnel. Given the wealth of these prior studies and the paucity of implementation, we focused on
understanding the broad challenges and identifying concrete steps that can be implemented.

This study is organized in three parts:

    •   Innovation Ecosystem for Existing Companies
    •   Innovation Ecosystem for Entrepreneurial Companies
    •   Innovation Ecosystem for Multinational Companies in Ukraine
Each section begins with an overview of information about the category and then assesses the relevant
elements of the innovation ecosystem. A final section summarizes findings and assesses some options for
where the World Bank might focus its efforts.

Innovation Ecosystem for Existing Companies

 Overview
We discuss the innovation ecosystem for Ukraine’s companies in six sections. This section provides an
overview of some data on innovation in Ukrainian companies. The next six sections will discuss different
elements of Ukraine’s ecosystem: (a) industry and market structure; (b) leadership, governance, and
policy; (c) access to knowledge and technology; (d) finance; (e) human capital; and (f) supports.

The overall observation is that enterprise innovation in Ukraine is weak and generally declining, both in
large and small companies. Ukraine’s innovation survey, which follows EU Community Innovation Survey
methodology, found that the percentage of Ukraine industrial enterprises conducting innovative activity
in 2015 was 17.3 percent2 compared to an EU average of 48.9 percent.3 See figure 1.

As is expected in a transition economy, the bulk of Ukrainian innovation is ‘new to the enterprise’
innovation rather than ‘new to the market’ innovation. Of the 414 enterprises that reported introducing
product innovation in 2015, 114 introduced new to the market innovations while 342 introduced new to
the enterprise innovations. Similarly, on a per product basis, of the 3,136 innovative products introduced,
548 (17.5 percent) were new to the market while 2,588 (82.5 percent) were new only to the enterprise.

Note: Some enterprises may have introduced multiple types of innovation.

Of the funds that Ukrainian companies invest in innovation (UAH 13.8 billion), over 80 percent is for the
acquisition of machines, equipment, and software and only 15 percent is for R&D. The large proportion
of new technologies acquired with equipment suggests that the primary goal for the purchase of such
technologies was mainly the modernization of enterprises, and not the creation of products new to the
market or the enhancement of innovation activity. Ukraine is a net importer of technology—it purchases
more technology than it transfers out.4

 Industry and Market Structure
Ukraine’s industrial structure hampers its innovation performance. Ukraine’s main industries—
agriculture, metals, and heavy manufacturing—are ones that are not R&D intensive (in Ukraine or in most
other countries). Ukraine’s main industrial sectors are heavy engineering; ferrous and nonferrous
metallurgy; shipbuilding; automotive; aerospace; manufacturing and supply of power plants; and oil, gas,
and chemicals industry (Schuch et al 2016). Ukraine’s top five exported products in 2014 were maize;
crude sunflower seed and safflower oil and fractions; spelt, common wheat, and meslin; semi-finished
metals; and non-agglomerated iron ores and concentrates.5

High-technology exports, by contrast, are relatively weak. In 2015, high-technology exports were 7.3
percent of manufactured exports, which is low compared to the average of the EU (16 percent), the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members (17 percent), and the world
(18 percent). High-technology exports in current U.S. dollars in 2015 were US$1.4 billion, a sharp decline
from US$2.6 billion in 2012.6 According to the Global Innovation Index in 2016, high-technology exports
less reexports were 2.9 percent of total trade, which ranked 45 out of 128 countries.7

Ukraine’s concentration in low-R&D industry reduces Ukraine’s rate of business-supported R&D. Given
this, as well as Ukraine’s general economic development status, Ukraine’s gross domestic expenditure on
research and development (GERD) performed by business, is not particularly low at 0.4 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) (40th out of 128 countries in the Global Innovation Index).8 Similarly, in the Global
Competitiveness Index, Ukraine’s ‘company spending on R&D’ is ranked 68th out of 138 countries (World
Economic Forum 2016, 350-351). Ukraine ranks lower on ‘availability of latest technologies’ (93 out of
138) and ‘firm-level technology absorption’ (74 out of 138) (World Economic Forum 2016, 350-351).

Ukraine’s innovation performance has generally been deteriorating. Ukraine used to be more tightly
linked to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and was able to export R&D-intensive

goods to them. As trade with the CIS countries has declined and trade with Europe has expanded, exports
have become more concentrated in commodity agriculture and metals, which are less R&D intensive. As
a result, the sectors of the economy that have tended to be more innovative have shrunk. As the EU Policy
Support Facility study noted, two-thirds of business spending on R&D is concentrated in machine building,
an industry that has contracted since independence in 1991. Russia has been the main customer for
machine-building products of Ukraine, and it is assumed that this industry will further decline (Schuch et
al 2016).

A second key aspect of industry and market structure that affects innovation is the degree to which
companies face competitive pressures to innovate and the degree to which customers demand and expect
innovation (Porter 1990). Ukraine’s industrial structure is also weak in this regard. The Global
Competitiveness Index ranked Ukraine 99 out of 140 countries on ‘intensity of local competition’, 98th in
‘extent of market dominance’, and 136th in ‘effectiveness of anti-monopoly policy’.9 Judges and
prosecutors are inadequately trained to ensure that new legislation to improve competition is being
effectively followed (International Finance Corporation 2014). Large firms constitute 0.1 percent of
companies in Ukraine, but account for almost 50 percent of revenues and employ roughly 40 percent of
salaried workers.

Local competition is weak, and the lack of competitive pressure delays technology acquisition (United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013, 25). Large enterprises do not act as drivers for innovation
in the economy. The lack of demand for innovation from large firms limits the market for new technology-
based firms to serve as suppliers of innovative products to the large firms and limits the demand for local
innovation. Local competition and domestic markets are dominated by a limited number of business
groups, reducing competition. In addition, the sufficient size of the domestic market reduces firms’ need
to export, which would create pressures to innovate to face international competition. The overall
situation is one where most Ukrainian companies have little motivation for innovation and, consequently,
invest little in innovation.

The noncompetitive industrial structure is due in part to the presence and the history of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). Many sectors of the economy have a history of government subsidization and little
competition. Business skills needed for operating in competitive markets were underdeveloped. Many
SOEs have been privatized, but there are still 3,340 state-owned business entities, of which only 1,829 are
operating companies, employing nearly 0.9 million people.10 The SOEs are active in areas such as energy
and machine building and include such companies as producer of energy turbines Turboatom, energy
generator Centerenergo, and energy company Naftogaz. SOEs have been linked to corruption and are part
of a system that scares away potential investors, drives off international donors, and makes it hard for
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to compete (Hontz 2016).

Innovation varies substantially by industrial sector. This study did not examine the dynamics of different
industrial sectors in Ukraine. The industry sectors that had the highest percentage of firms reporting
innovations in 2015 were11

     •   Production of main pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical medicines - 47.5 percent;
     •   Production of automotive vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers - 38.2 percent;

     •   Production of computers, electronics, and optics - 37.5 percent;
     •   Other transportations - 36.1 percent;
     •   Production of coke and oil chemistry products - 28.6 percent; and
     •   Production of electric equipment - 28.2 percent.
One industry that deserves a special mention is the information technology (IT) industry, which does not
share the history of state involvement and in contrast to many other technology-related industries has
been growing substantially. Estimates for 2016 show 90,000 IT professionals, more than 1,000 IT service
companies, and exports of software outsourcing of at least US$2.5 billion.12 The number of people working
for the top five outsourcers has more than doubled over the past five years (Degeler 2016). This industry
includes many Ukrainian and foreign-headquartered firms that primarily provide software outsourcing
services for companies outside of Ukraine. Many of the software developers who work in this industry are
self-employed contractors, a situation encouraged by Ukraine’s tax policies.

 Leadership, Governance, and Policy

This section addresses the effectiveness of government strategy, policies, and institutions to support
innovation. It discusses both (a) the general environment created by the government that affects
companies’ ability to do business generally and (b) the government’s leadership, policies, and programs
specifically to support innovation. Ukraine has challenges in both areas.

With regard to the general influence of the government on the business environment, there is widespread
agreement that government performance inhibits business development and innovation in Ukraine. The
Global Competitiveness Index lists the 10 most problematic factors for doing business as13

     1. Corruption,
     2. Policy instability,
     3. Inflation,
     4. Inefficient government bureaucracy,
     5. Access to financing,
     6. Government instability,
     7. Tax rates,
     8. Tax regulations,
     9. Foreign currency regulations, and
     10. Inadequate supply of infrastructure.
Similarly, the Global Competitiveness Index ranks Ukraine in the bottom quarter of countries on a wide
range of indicators, such as property rights, IP protection, diversion of public funds, irregular payments

and bribes, judicial independence, wastefulness of government spending, efficiency of legal framework in
settling disputes, organized crime, and others.14

The Global Innovation Index also ranks Ukraine near the bottom of countries in measures related to the
quality of governmental institutions.15

A USAID-supported survey of SMEs generated a similar list of key impediments to business development
in 2015. These impediments were placed in 10 groups:

     “The first place in the ranking belongs to the group of factors which include the consequences of
     military aggression of the Russian Federation and the general political instability in the country
     (59%). Second largest group of problems relates to tax legislation, in particular the complexity of
     tax administration, permanent changes in the legislation, and frequent changes in the tax and
     other reporting forms (54%). The third group of problems which contributed to limited business
     activity in the SME sector is associated with unfavorable market conditions, low demand, and high
     level of competition (48%). The fourth group of problems marks the financial component of SME
     activities, including lack of funds, high interest rates for credits and other borrowed capital (36%).
     Fifth in the ranking is the group of barriers associated with high regulatory burden and corruption
     (36%). The sixth group of factors encompasses burdensome currency regulation and inflation
     (35%). The lack of skilled workforce and the necessary production capacity represent the seventh
     group of factors (20%). The eighth place in the ranking takes the inefficiency of the state apparatus
     (17%). The remaining obstacles account for less than 4%.”16

These issues are collectively a large drag on the innovative performance of companies. If companies
believe the benefit of innovation will be lost to corruption, they will not invest in innovation. Efforts
required to comply with regulations take energy and resources away from innovation. Policy instability
means that the government programs intended to support innovation will not be effective or sustained.
The corruption, regulatory burden, and ineffectiveness of the government means that the industry will
not trust the government sufficiently to work together to improve innovation in Ukraine.

Technical regulations, including many health, safety, environmental, and product regulations and
technical standards, are a subset of the government’s overall regulatory role that is particularly important
for innovation. Ukraine’s system of technical regulations is viewed as hindering modernization through its
complexity, lack of self-regulation, obsolescence, and huge scope for administrative discretion (United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013, 53). They often are not harmonized with international
standards, which creates barriers to trade. All local producers must manufacture products in conformity
with national standards, most of which were developed in the 1970s and 1980s (Gupta and Vnukova
2014). There is work going on to reform regulations and harmonize them with the EU. For example, a
project of EU4Business is working to support deregulation with a particular focus on SMEs in priority
sectors.17

An area of governance that is especially important to innovation is IP policy and institutions. As part of
this project, the World Bank commissioned a separate study to examine IP and technology transfer in
Ukraine (Stankovic 2017). A key conclusion from this report is that the main obstacle to the overall
effectiveness of the IP system is not the substantive law, but rather its implementation and enforcement.
The major issues are the lack of clear division of roles and responsibilities and poor coordination across
various ministries and other actors in IP and TT matters, as well as weak institutional capacity in
implementing the intended IP and TT framework. The IP ownership rules for publicly funded technologies
are scattered throughout different legal acts, which have conflicting provisions. This creates ambiguity,
uncertainty, and confusion. Ukrainian technology transfer intermediaries are not effective in their
commercialization efforts despite their official existence in most R&D-active institutions.

With regard to the government’s ability to develop and implement policies and programs specifically to
improve innovation, there have been multiple innovation-related studies and initiatives in Ukraine in
recent years, reflecting the recognition of the importance of innovation as a driver of growth and
competitiveness (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013). Ukraine officially recognizes
the importance of the National Innovation System (NIS) approach (adopted by the government’s act, June
17, 2009) that considers subsystems of government regulation, education, knowledge generation,
innovation infrastructure, and production (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013).

The implementation of innovation supporting policies, however, has been weak (United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe 2013). Many policies and programs to support innovation that were officially
adopted were not fully funded. Organizations were created but then changed when the government
changed. The lack of engagement of key innovation actors in the design process has also undermined
implementation. As a consequence, there is a substantial distrust of the motives of many people in the
government, as well as skepticism about the government’s ability to develop and implement useful
programs. As the EU-funded study noted in 2011, “The idea of knowledge-based economy, driven by
innovation, has been discredited in the Ukrainian society, due to many ineffective and inconsistent actions
by the public authorities and announced measures that were never been put in practice.”18 “A key
problem in Ukraine is the gap between the stated policy goals and actual implementation of policy
measures. Official declarations regarding the need for innovative development are not supported by
carefully tailored measures and, especially, by appropriate and efficient mechanisms, programmes and
framework conditions.”19

Coordination of government programs is also a major problem. Innovation-related activities are
distributed across a wide range of ministries, and coordination mechanisms are weak or missing (United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013). The Ministry of Education and Science (MESU) has the
lead responsibility for innovation, but the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) is
responsible for the R&D policy and competitiveness of industry, technology transfer to the business
sector, and some science and technology (S&T) programs targeting economic development. The Ministry
of Finance has an important role by determining the national budget for the research and innovation
sector. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is responsible for international agreements with other countries
and international organizations (which provide a substantial amount of R&D funding) (Schuch et al 2016).
The National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU), receives around 50 percent of the yearly state
budget allocated for S&T. Research and innovation activities are also carried out in research institutions
and universities subordinated to the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Internal
Affairs, Ministry of Culture, and Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food. All these ministries have some sector
budgets related to research and innovation activities (Schuch et al 2016).

There is poor coordination among these ministries and agencies, weak coordination between the national
and the regional level, limited cooperation between public research institutes and the higher education
sector, and weak science-industry cooperation (Schuch et al 2016). As a United Nations (UN) study noted,
“…there is not a clear governance structure to arbitrate conflicts, ensure the integration of different goals
and define consistent agendas. This weakness contributes to the proliferation of inconsistent and poorly
funded initiatives, and an inefficient complexity of legal rules.” (United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe 2013, xvi) There is a current plan to establish an Innovation Development Office, but the scope
and responsibilities of this office—and its ability to provide the needed coordination—are not yet clear.

Regional programs are another important dimension to the government innovation policy. Many aspects
of the innovation policy, such as industry cluster development strategies, support for SMEs and
entrepreneurship, S&T parks, and university-industry collaboration, are done at the regional level in many
countries, and regional governments are often viewed as more responsive to the needs of local industry.

Ukraine has varying resources and needs at the regional level.20 Many governmental powers, however,
are centralized. In particular, only the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine can pass laws; the regions can provide
funds from their own regional budget for research and innovation but have limited ability to fund
programs or design programs that require a change in law. Ukraine’s regions were asked in 2006 to
develop regional innovation plans. Most regions have tried to develop elements of local S&T and
innovation infrastructures (for example, research institutes, techno-parks, universities, and hi-tech
companies) but have had little capacity or funding to do so. Some of the regions and bigger cities have
their own departments and offices responsible for innovation issues. Some regions have special programs
on innovation; others support innovation as part of general programs of social and economic
development.

 Access to Knowledge and Technology

This section addresses the extent to which Ukrainian universities and research institutions provide
knowledge and technologies to companies and how effectively Ukrainian companies access knowledge
and technology developed in the rest of the world. The EU Policy Support Facility’s 2016 study looked



20   This section draws on chapter 12 in Rumpf et. al. 2011; and Schuch et al, 25.

                                                           P a g e | 20
extensively at how Ukraine’s research system contributes to innovation (Schuch et al 2016). Much of the
material here is derived from that report.

Ukraine had historically strong S&T institutions in the Soviet era, but these have been declining in post-
Soviet era. Ukraine’s GERD decreased from 1.17 percent of GDP in 2005 to 0.66 percent in 2014 (see Figure
2). This caused a decrease in the total number of researchers and led many researchers to seek work in
other countries. In spite of this decline, Ukraine’s R&D expenditures are still relatively strong compared
to countries at a similar level of development—the Global Innovation Index ranks Ukraine 54th out of 128
countries in GERD/GDP.21

Figure 2. GERD 2005–2014




Source: Schuch et al 2016, p. 28, data from OECD.

A further problem is that Ukraine’s R&D system is not currently well structured to support innovation. The
NASU consumes above 50 percent of the state budget allocated for R&D. Other specialized academies of
sciences, including the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the
Academy of Pedagogical Sciences, the Academy of Legal Sciences, and the Academy of Arts consume
another 25 percent of the state R&D budget (Schuch et al 2016, 32–33). The academies are largely focused
on basic research and are mostly supported with institutional funds rather than competitively awarded
project funds. Funding for the NASU has been declining, and the remaining funds have been focused on
supporting existing staff, with the result that both the facilities and staff are aging. Funds for research
equipment and materials are minimal, making it difficult to do high-quality work. While the academies
used to be closely tied to the needs of the Soviet Union, these connections declined with independence
and the academies shifted to more basic research. While some academies do some applied work for the
government or corporate sponsors, most work is basic research. The academies have technology transfer
offices, but patenting and technology transfer has been weak.

Universities account for only 7 percent of GERD but employ two-thirds of persons with doctorates.
Scientifically educated personnel at universities are mostly engaged in teaching, rather than research.
Only half of the around 350 universities perform any kind of R&D, and many of these do only limited R&D.
According to the national statistics, universities produce almost 78 percent of research papers, but the
NASU has more publications in internationally recognized journals (Schuch et al 2016, 32–33).



21   Global Innovation Index 2016. “Ukraine.”

                                                    P a g e | 21
The lack of research funding for universities is a problem because universities have advantages over
research institutes in how they contribute to innovation. In particular, universities have a built-in
mechanism for transferring knowledge to industry, in that they produce graduates who go to work for
industry or start companies.

Links between industry and the academies and universities are weak. Industry-academia co-authorship is
rare, and there is little technology transfer. An indicator of industry-academia relations is the number of
publications co-authored by researchers in both public and private institutions, per million of population.
While the EU average is typically in the 30s, Ukraine is typically around 1 (Schuch et al 2016, 35).

While, in general, universities do minimal research and contribute little to innovation, there are
exceptions. For example, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute (KPI) has industrial partnerships and creates spin-offs
and operates a science park that has mechanisms for facilitating interaction with industry.

Part of the weak technology transfer between research institutions and industry may be due to the lack
of connection with industry in setting R&D priorities. Public investment is oriented toward broadly defined
R&D priorities, rather than based on communication with industry about specific R&D needs. The
technological innovation priorities of Ukraine as stipulated by law are in the fields of energy, energy
efficiency, and transportation in general, but also specific fields (rocket and space; aircraft industries;
shipbuilding; armament; and military technologies), new materials with emphasis on nanomaterials, agro-
industry, biomedicine (medical services, treatment devices, and pharmaceuticals), cleaner production and
environmental protection, and ICT and robotics.

Another contributor to weak technology transfer is that, as discussed in a previous section, Ukrainian
industry has not been focused on innovation and has had little demand for R&D. As noted earlier, industry
gets new technology primarily in the form of purchases of machines and equipment.

Finally, for SMEs, the costs of developing relations with technology organizations are rather high, and the
frameworks for interaction are too rigid for their needs. Collaboration between science and business is
hampered by the lack of information on opportunities and the high costs faced by organizations in the
search for partnerships (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013).

There are also regional variations in the degree of cooperation between enterprises and S&T institutions.
In a survey of 600 Ukrainian businesses, firms were asked to assess the level of cooperation between
enterprises and S&T institutions in their region using a scale from 0 (no cooperation) to 9 (strong
cooperation). The average level among all regions was 3.9, which means weak cooperation. However, a
high level of standard deviation of this indicator shows that some enterprises have strong cooperation,
especially in Vinnitsa, Zaporizhia, Odessa, and Poltava regions and Kyiv city.22

In addition to the NASU and the universities, Ukraine has a variety of industrial research institutes,
engineering departments, and special engineering bureaus that are associated with specific economic
areas and focus on industrial R&D (Schuch et al 2016, 32). A heritage of the Soviet system, these
organizations are formally subordinated to the different ministries and state agencies but have been
partially privatized. These organizations receive some (typically less than 25 percent) of their financing
from the state in the form of block grants, giving the ministries the right to be involved in the nomination
of their directors. The rest of the financing is contracted both from state-owned and private companies.

Regarding getting access to international knowledge, Ukrainian companies have not been well connected
internationally. Most of the companies have been focused on domestic markets, and many international
knowledge links have been with Russia and have been declining. The lack of Ukrainian international
patents, especially in countries other than Russia, indicates a weak integration of Ukrainian companies in
global value chains.

With respect to international collaboration in research, Ukraine has low but steadily increasing levels in
international scientific co-publications per million population. The expansion of research collaboration
with Europe, and especially participation in the Horizon 2020 program, is a very positive development
(Schuch et al 2016, 6–7). For example, there is collaboration between the EU and Ukrainian aircraft R&D
organizations in the Aero-UA project, funded under the Horizon 2020 program.23

 Finance
This section addresses the availability of finance, through a variety of mechanisms and incentives, for
technology and innovation. Access to finance is rated by firms as one of their biggest obstacles. In the
2013 World Bank/International Finance Corporation (IFC) enterprise survey, ‘Access to Finance’ was most
frequently listed by firms as their biggest obstacle, slightly ahead of corruption and political instability.
Access to finance was especially a problem for medium-size firms.24 In the Global Competitiveness Index,
Ukraine ranked poorly in financial market measures, with rankings mostly in the bottom third of countries.

However, the Global Innovation Index scores Ukraine relatively well on some areas, ranking Ukraine 18th
on ease of getting credit.

According to Ukraine’s innovation survey, the main source of financing for innovation for existing firms is
the firm’s own funds (97.2 percent of the total volume of innovation expenditures). The other 2.8 percent
of funding includes very limited amount of state, municipal, international, and domestic investors.25

External financing of innovations is rarely used. Financing in Ukraine is mostly through the banking system,
and innovation projects are often not attractive for bank financing. Interest rates are high, and credit risks
are great (Vovchak and Rudevska 2016). Venture funds exist, but many fund profitable but not necessarily
innovative enterprises (such as hotels and retail stores, not technology-based firms) (Krasovska 2012).

A problem in assessing the adequacy of financing is that while often firms complain about access to
capital, investment firms often complain about not having good investment opportunities. Capital is

considered to be relatively mobile and will readily cross international borders if there are good investment
opportunities. Often, perceptions of lack of capital may reflect other problems. In the case of Ukraine,
lack of capital may reflect perceptions of high risk by the investment community, which may be due to
political instability, corruption, concerns about the legal system, currency controls, or other factors.

As part of this project, the World Bank supported an analysis of fiscal incentives for science, technology,
and innovation (STI) activities, such as tax incentives (Guceri 2017). The report identifies the costs and
benefits of a variety of fiscal incentives to support STI that have been widely used worldwide and considers
which might be relevant to the Ukrainian context. The report lays out a framework that maps government
objectives to the economic justification for intervention in areas related to STI. The report notes that there
are a variety of market failures that result in a suboptimal level of innovation activities, and it identifies
fiscal incentives that could address some of the market failures. However, the study cautions that
administrative inefficiencies, such as low state capacity, corruption, or simply the lack of resources may
make such initiatives ineffective. The study recommends that Ukraine focuses on ensuring
macroeconomic stability and improvements in the business climate before providing tax incentives to
support R&D. It also recommends that Ukraine invests in capacity building to implement fiscal incentives
in the future, which involves developing a suitable skill set within the Ministry of Finance to be able to
analyze the predicted cost and benefits of tax incentives, to collect reliable data on private R&D and
innovation efforts, and to be able to evaluate the effects of innovation incentives.

 Human Capital
This section addresses the quality and quantity of skills needed for innovative businesses. This
encompasses scientific and technical skills, business skills, and workforce skills. It depends primarily on
the quality of educational and training institutions and their connection to business needs.

Human capital is an area of relative strength for innovation in Ukraine. Ukraine inherited a relatively well-
developed education system from the Soviet Union, and university enrollment is very high (80 percent)
(Schuch et al 2016, 7). The education system has particular strengths in math and science education, and
this has led to a very strong IT workforce. On international indicators, Ukraine scores among top countries
on investment in education and on higher education enrollment.

While these are strengths relative to most other transition economies, these indicators also show
weakness in management school, availability of specialized training, and other areas. A recent World Bank
skills report also identified a range of areas where improvement is needed (Del Carpio et al. 2017),
including the following:

    •    Ukrainians have high levels of basic cognitive skills but the educational system does not produce
         enough people with practical skills, the right kind or level of skills, or up-to-date knowledge.
    •    The formal education and training suffers from weak governance and an inefficient funding
         system.
    •    Skills training outside the formal education system is limited. Partnerships between firms and
         education institutions are scarce, with only a fifth of the firms in key sectors maintaining regular
         contacts with educational and training institutions.
    •    Little reliable information is available on current and emerging skills demands that would allow
         students, educators, and training providers to make good decisions or make their program
         offerings relevant to labor market conditions.
    •    The labor code and other labor market institutions do not facilitate an adaptable labor market or
         foster conditions that are conducive for the creation of more and better jobs.
The study found that skills gaps significantly constrain firms’ performance in Ukraine: 40 percent of firms
in four key sectors (agriculture, food processing, IT, and renewable energy) report a significant gap
between the type of skills their employees have and those they need to achieve their business objectives.

Our interview results were consistent with these findings. While firms are able to hire people with strong
basic skills, universities are viewed as not well connected to industry and not providing relevant skills.
Industry representatives in diverse areas such as IT and agriculture advocated for major reforms in the
education and training system.

Other concerns are that

    •    PhD enrollment is low by international comparison, which indicates an overall low interest to
         pursue scientific careers. More students are shifting away from science and engineering degrees
         toward the social sciences and humanities (this is likely related to the declining funding for S&T).
    •    Although the level of tertiary education attainment is high, the absorption capacity of the
         Ukrainian economy is limited, and many Ukrainians are overqualified for the jobs they hold
         (Schuch et al 2016). Consequently, many talented Ukrainians seek work in other countries, which,
         at least in the short term, leads to a loss of human capital to Ukraine (in the long run, it may lead
         to greater international connections and perhaps return to Ukraine in the form of knowledge and
         capital).

                                                    P a g e | 25
In summary, while human capital is generally a strong part of Ukraine’s innovation ecosystem, it could be
stronger with reforms and better connections between education and industry. In addition, declines in
the R&D system may be weakening some of the historic strengths in S&T training.

Transportation infrastructure is viewed as deficient, with dangerous roads and inefficient railroads (OECD
2016). While this is more a barrier to business in general rather than innovation, our interviews indicated
some ways that infrastructure hurts innovation. For example, it is difficult for Ukrainian farmers to shift
to higher value-added crops, such as fruits and vegetables, without a better transportation infrastructure



                                                    P a g e | 26
to get their produce to export markets quickly. ICT infrastructure, on the other hand, appears to be
adequate to support the IT industry, at least in the major cities.

With respect to research infrastructure, Ukraine had nearly 20 percent of the experimental facilities of
the USSR, including nuclear reactors, astronomic observatories, and ships for marine research, but a
substantial part of this infrastructure has been lost or deteriorated (Schuch et al 2016, 33–34). Today, the
research facilities are outdated and underfunded. Ukraine still has some R&D infrastructures in operation
that are internationally recognized, mostly located at different institutes of the NASU, including 15, most
in the natural sciences, that are included in the European Research Infrastructure Observatory (Schuch et
al 2016, 33–34).

With respect to S&T parks and other innovation support infrastructure, Ukraine has created a significant
number of entities, but many are reported to be inoperative or ineffective. In recent years, Ukraine has
established 12 technology parks; 17 science parks; 28 business incubators; 25 innovation centers; 9
centers for science, innovation, and information; several technology transfer units at higher education
institutions; and a dedicated Ukrainian institute of scientific and technical expertise and information
(Schuch et al 2016, 30). In 1999–2005, a variety of tax incentives were available for firms in technology
parks, including exemption of custom duties on imports of material and equipment, tax credits, and lower
interest rates on loans (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 2013, 33). These benefits were
abolished in 2005, because the new government blamed some technology parks for unlawful activities.
As a result, the activities of technology parks declined.

One working university-based science park is the one at the National Technical University of Ukraine Kyiv
Polytechnic Institute (KPI) in 2007, which has had success in developing spin-off companies, attracting
foreign investment, and providing innovation and entrepreneurship training at other Ukrainian
Universities.26

With regard to broader innovation and business support services, Ukraine does not have comprehensive
programs. Innovation and business support infrastructure is underfunded and not equipped with tools,
methodologies, and knowledge to provide state-of-the-art support services.27 Startups and SMEs often
lack mechanisms to tap into the knowledge needed to innovate and to develop internationally
competitive products and services. As noted before, networks among industry and between industry,
government, and academia are weak.

Innovation Ecosystem for Entrepreneurial Companies

 Overview
The formation and growth of new innovative companies are a critical component of innovation in
countries. New companies are often the best way to bring new technologies to the market, and new
companies are often the first to apply new approaches in existing markets. Entrepreneurial companies
generally have less bureaucracy and are less constrained by conventions and past investments. The
presence of entrepreneurial companies creates a more dynamic marketplace and increases the level of
competition—and the motivation to innovate—for existing companies.

This section provides a summary of Ukraine’s entrepreneurship ecosystem. It follows a similar framework
to the one used in the previous section and analyzes the entrepreneurial ecosystem in six categories:28

     •   Policy - Leadership and government institutions/programs
     •   Finance - Availability of different types of funding for entrepreneurs
     •   Markets - Availability of early customers and networks to sell products and services
     •   Culture - Societal norms regarding risk taking and entrepreneurship and availability of role models
     •   Human capital - Labor force skills and quality of education/training for entrepreneurs
     •   Supports - Availability of infrastructure, supporting services, and nongovernment institutions that
         support entrepreneurship
In analyzing the innovation ecosystem for entrepreneurial companies, it is important to make some
distinctions between the types of companies and to note some problems in the data. There are several
types of companies that are similar to but different from the innovative entrepreneurial companies that
we are focused on. Some companies are new but not innovative—such as many new retail stores and
restaurants. There are also SMEs that are innovative, but are not new or entrepreneurial—such as long-
standing small manufacturers that may use new technology. Finally, there are self-employed individuals
who are microenterprises but essentially function as contract employees; while they provide services that
may be somewhat innovative, they are not growth-oriented entrepreneurial companies.

A further complication is that many of the most ambitious and innovative entrepreneurs in Ukraine—
those that provide products or services to international markets—choose to establish their companies
outside of Ukraine, for reasons discussed later. They tend not to employ people in Ukraine but rather use
self-employed contractors in Ukraine.

As a consequence of these distinctions, there is little reliable data on the innovative entrepreneurial
companies that we are most interested in. Data on SMEs and recently formed companies include many
non-innovative and non-entrepreneurial companies.29 Many of the most innovative entrepreneurial

companies formed by Ukrainians and using Ukrainian human resources are not registered as Ukrainian
companies and so are not included as such in government statistics.

 Leadership, Governance, and Policy
The policy environment for entrepreneurial companies is mixed. On the one hand, Ukraine has made
notable efforts to improve the ease of doing business and starting companies. On the other hand, many
barriers to starting new businesses remain, and fundamental problems with corruption and rule of law
remain major barriers to business. Many entrepreneurial companies that want to sell to international
markets establish themselves outside of Ukraine, in part to avoid the problems of working with the
Ukrainian government. These issues are expanded upon below.

In the World Bank’s Doing Business Report, in 2017, Ukraine ranks 80th overall compared to a ranking of
140 in 2013.30 Since 2009, Ukraine’s government has passed 27 reforms targeted at its business
environment. Of these reforms, the World Bank viewed 25 as improving the country’s business
environment and viewed 2 as hurting it. Of the 27 reforms, 6 were in the category of starting a business.

Ukraine reformed its business registering procedures, decreasing the number of procedures to start a
business. In 2016, the government amended the Law of Ukraine ‘On state registration of legal and physical
entities - entrepreneurs and civil organizations’ (U.S. Department of State 2016). This amendment
modified the business and property registration system (U.S. Department of State 2016). As a
consequence of reforms, Ukraine ranks 20th (out of 190 countries) with respect to ease of starting a

business.31 Similarly, Ukraine has also consistently improved in the area of property registration, currently
ranking 63rd, up from 88th in 2014.

While these reforms are positive, additional reforms are needed. Ukraine ranks 115th in trading across
borders, which indicates entrepreneurs face barriers in doing business across borders. Additionally, the
country ranks 140th and 130th overall in terms of dealing with construction permits and getting electricity,
respectively. Both of these factors impinge on entrepreneurs’ capacity to obtain basic resources needed
to run their business.

Rule of law is another key issue. As with existing Ukrainian companies, as discussed earlier, corruption
hurts entrepreneurs. In the World Bank’s 2013 enterprise survey on Ukraine, 15 percent of companies
indicated that corruption was a challenge, versus 3.4 percent in Poland, 1.4 percent in Belarus, 0.9 percent
in Latvia, and 2.6 percent in Romania.32 Transparency International stated that only 32 percent of private
and public companies in the country abide by transparency and accountability principles (Transparency
International 2017). Bribes and other corrupt practices are common and inhibit growth (Friedrich
Naumann Foundation for Freedom 2014). Corruption often is linked to the government’s business
supervision practices. State authorities create specific requirements for businesses and undertake regular
inspections to see if entrepreneurs are abiding by these requirements. According to the Friedrich
Naumann Foundation for Freedom, both the number of authorities dealing with business supervision and
the number of inspections per company are notably above the international averages (U.S. Department
of State 2016). In addition to imposing administrative burdens on entrepreneurs, this practice also
facilitates corruption as inspectors can more easily blackmail companies (U.S. Department of State 2016).
There is also a lack of confidence in the independence of the judiciary system.

To combat corruption, the government formed the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption
(NAPC) in 2015. In 2016, the Ukrainian parliament approved the legislative amendments to oblige
government officials to file electronic declarations and introduced criminal responsibility for providing
false information. As of February 2015, Ukraine also has an e-procurement system that improves
transparency in public spending and is intended to reduce corruption by eliminating or minimizing human
involvement in the tender process (U.S. Department of State 2016).

Another aspect of the environment for entrepreneurship is the tax structure, which has very low tax rates
(5 percent) for self-employed people. As a result, many businesses are structured to use contractors rather
than employees, although in many cases, they essentially function as employees and receive some
employee-like benefits. This encourages self-employment, but may discourage companies from growing,
at least with respect to hiring employees.

As noted in the previous section on the innovation environment for existing companies, IP laws are
adequate but the implementing institutions are weak.

In response to this environment, entrepreneurs, especially those seeking to sell their products or services
to international markets, form their companies in other countries that have less corruption and a stronger
rule of law.33 They then outsource services from individual contractors in Ukraine, taking advantage of the
low tax rates for self-employed individuals. This system is a workable response to the weak governance
and rule of law in Ukraine, but it prevents Ukraine from capturing the full benefits of startup companies.

They also protect their IP outside of Ukraine (often by filing a provisional patent in the United States,
which offers a low-cost way to establish an early filing date and allows the company to file a full patent
within a year). For entrepreneurs with first-to-the-world technology, their largest initial markets are likely
to be in the United States and Europe, and so, patent protection in these markets is more important than
in Ukraine.

 Finance
Funding is a critical resource for any private enterprise, particularly ones that hope to grow. Access to
finance is often cited as a barrier to growth for young companies. Many organizations, including
commercial banks, angel investors, venture capital (VC) funds, and private equity funds potentially
contribute to financing entrepreneurial firms.

Financing for entrepreneurship is low in Ukraine compared to other countries, and many SMEs believe
lack of financing is a barrier to their growth. On the other hand, venture capitalists operating in Ukraine
suggest that the key issue is the lack of fundable investments. They believe that ample money is available
for good investment opportunities. At least some entrepreneurs, whom we interviewed, have had little
difficulty in finding funding.

According to a variety of international indicators, financing for entrepreneurs and SMEs is tight. As
indicated in table 8, loans are less available, interest rates are higher than in benchmark countries, and
VC is not available. This deters many entrepreneurs from accessing capital (Baiashvili and Frewer 2016).

Note: a. World Development Indicators 2017;

With respect to financing of SMEs in general, according to research from the World Bank and European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), approximately 40 percent of SMEs in Ukraine state
that access to financing is a moderate, major, or very severe obstacle. While over 60 percent of SMEs
claim to need a loan, only 15 percent of small firms and 22 percent of medium-size firms have received
bank loans or lines of credit.34 The European Investment Bank (EIB) argues that these figures discourage
other entrepreneurs from approaching banks to seek funding. Large numbers of SMEs that need a loan

(over 70 percent) get discouraged even before applying. SMEs identified high interest rates, excessive
collateral requirements, and complex procedures as the main discouraging factors.35

A combination of capital inadequacy, asset quality, and governance issues prevent many banks from
lending. While the Central Bank is in the process of addressing these challenges, banks have minimal
engagement with SMEs. As of July 2015, the banking sector consisted of 126 banks, 3 of which are state-
owned (including EIB’s partners Ukreximbank and Oschadbank). The state plays a significant role in the
sector, especially following the recapitalizations in 2009. The number of banks decreased during 2014–
2015 as the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) declared more than 50 banks insolvent (Baiashvili and Frewer
2016).

The access-to-finance challenges are also observed in Ukraine’s foreign direct investment (FDI) barriers
(International Finance Corporation 2014). An estimated 87 percent of small firms and 82 percent of
medium-size enterprises stated that they are unable to attract foreign investment, increasing their
reliance on domestic financing.36 Foreign investors also face substantial challenges in accessing the
Ukrainian market. Beyond legal barriers, foreign investors must contend with a lack of transparency and
an uncertain regulatory environment in Ukraine. To that end, among Eastern Europe and Central Asia
countries in the World Bank’s Investing Across Sectors indicators, Ukraine’s restrictions on foreign equity
ownership are some of the most severe (World Bank 2010).

Financing for technology-based startup appears to be somewhat better. The Ukrainian Venture Capital
and Private Equity Association (UVCA) investors book lists 5 incubators/accelerators, 17 venture funds, 1
corporate venture fund, 6 private equity funds, and 5 other organizations, including the EBRD and an angel
investors network (UVCA 2017). These include both Ukrainian investment funds that operate
internationally, as well as foreign-based funds that operate in Ukraine. Similarly, Crunchbase data show
that there are at least 15 angel investors and 18 funds or firms with VC funds operating in the country (see
appendix I). Since 2009, there have been at least 195 investments made in Ukrainian start-ups. As shown
in figure 4, nearly three quarters of these investments were under US$500,000, suggesting that most are
early stage investments (although due to the lower cost of operating in Ukraine, investment funds go
much further than in the United States).

From our discussion with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, three points emerged. First, enterprising
entrepreneurs with good ideas in Ukraine are able to get access to capital. International capital is always
looking for good investment opportunities, and networks exist that give Ukrainian entrepreneurs the
opportunity to get their ideas presented to potential funders. Due to the exchange rate and salaries in
Ukraine, good ideas from Ukraine can be very attractive investments. The entrepreneurs we met with said
they were able to get funding from a variety of sources, including international accelerators, Kickstarter,
and seed funds.

Second, from the point of view of venture capitalists, the problem is not a lack of funding but a lack of
good deals to fund. They believe Ukraine needs more programs to encourage people to be entrepreneurs
and to provide the basic skills and seed funding to expand the number of ideas that get developed into
companies.

Third, a requirement of international finance is often to establish in a country outside of Ukraine. Investors
want their money in countries that have strong, predictable, and reliable legal and financial institutions.
They also want the companies to have a strong presence in their leading markets, which are more likely
to be the United States and Western Europe, rather than Ukraine. Thus, financing is available, but the
consequence is that the companies will not be headquartered in Ukraine.

 Markets
For entrepreneurs to succeed, they need access to customers—consumers, other firms, and the
government— that seek innovative products and services. Ideally, these markets will be local and
domestic—it is easier to produce innovative products that meet customer needs if one has close links to


                                                P a g e | 33
those customers, and it is easier for entrepreneurs to get products to the market if they do not have to
meet the requirements of international trade. However, if domestic markets are not favorable, it is
essential that entrepreneurs gain access to international markets.

As one of the largest countries in Europe, with 44 million people, Ukraine potentially has a sizable
domestic market. However, its relatively low GDP per capita and weak economy mean that there is
relatively little disposable income for buying innovative products and services.

Markets vary by industry, and this study did not look in detail at specific industries. As noted in the section
on existing industry, some general characteristics of Ukraine’s economy and industry are not highly
supportive of providing markets for entrepreneurs:

    •   The general (and increasing) orientation of the Ukrainian economy toward producing commodity
        materials and agriculture means that the economy is growing in sectors that are relatively less
        innovative and thus provides fewer opportunities for entrepreneurs.
    •   Weak competition policy and the dominance of state-owned companies (or large, formerly state-
        owned companies) makes it more difficult for startups to break into many markets. The lack of
        innovation of state-owned companies means they are not avid consumers of new technology and
        do not provide a good market for innovative startups.
    •   The government does not have procurement or R&D policies that favor startups (such as small
        business contracting preferences or a small business research program).
With respect to participation of Ukrainian companies in international markets, as noted before in the
section on innovation in existing Ukrainian companies, regulations can be a barrier for entrepreneurs to
export. Technical regulations that were harmonized with the former Soviet Union but not the EU prevent
selling of certain products in the EU.

Given the limitations of the Ukrainian market, many Ukrainian entrepreneurs, especially in IT-related
areas, see their markets as international rather than in Ukraine. We had discussions with several Ukrainian
entrepreneurs who saw the United States as their initial market, due to both the size of the market and
the receptivity of customers to innovation, and consequently, they typically set up marketing and business
operations in the United States. U.S. funds and accelerators such as Garage Technology Ventures and Y
Combinator have supported Ukrainian entrepreneurs. Additionally, support organizations in Istanbul and
London have welcomed Ukrainian start-ups while other young companies have already accessed foreign
markets such as Poland, Malaysia, Singapore, Moldova, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, Austria,
Netherlands, and Italy. Similarly, according to PwC, Ukrainian IT companies played a significant role in
developing blockchain technology enterprises throughout the world.

Yevgeny Sysoyev, managing partner of Ukrainian fund AVentures, estimated in 2014 the Ukrainian
technology industry market to be about US$5 billion, divided among outsourcing, R&D centers of global
companies, and e-commerce (Satell 2014). Sysoyev also pointed to a growing population of software
development firms that created their business models on designing, building, and marketing their own
products for the global market (Satell 2014). A common theme in Sysoyev’s discussion of the Ukrainian
start-up community is that, despite the country’s tech competencies and given its small size, the majority
of technology start-ups are forced to think globally from day one and primarily target global markets.

 Culture
It is widely understood that a nation’s or region’s culture is an important part of the environment that
promotes or restrains entrepreneurship. Some aspects of culture that are thought to be important are as
follows:

     •   The extent to which being an entrepreneur is accepted and admired (relative to working in large
         organizations or established professions). For example, do parents support their children being
         entrepreneurs, or do they discourage them and push them into more conventional jobs?
     •   The extent to which people are allowed to try something and fail, learn from it, and try again. Is
         failure looked on as a valuable learning experience or as a permanent black mark against a
         person’s reputation?
     •   The extent to which there are successful entrepreneurs who can serve as role models for potential
         entrepreneurs.
     •   The extent of social capital—the links, shared values, and understandings in society that enable
         individuals and groups to trust each other and thus work together.37
     •   The extent to which society supports creative and unconventional activities in general (versus
         conformity).
For the most part, we do not have solid data on these characteristics in Ukraine. The following discussion
is based on inferences from similar economies as well as observations from our interviews.

With regard to general attitudes to entrepreneurship, on the one hand, there are many microenterprises
and self-employed individuals, but these may not represent a culture supportive of entrepreneurship.
Many self-employed individuals are much like employees but with limited benefits and are categorized as
self-employed for tax purposes (Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom 2014, 28). Self-employment
may represent not entrepreneurship but rather a lack of other employment options.

The relationship between the outsourcing industry, with its many self-employed technology workers, and
entrepreneurship is mixed. On the one hand, some see the outsourcing industry as drawing talent away
from true entrepreneurship, which would ultimately bring greater value. On the other hand, the
outsourcing industry has provided jobs and developed skills for many technologists, and at least some of
these may be later motivated to form their own companies (Degeler 2016; GoalEurope 2013).

While the Soviet Union generally suppressed private enterprise and entrepreneurship, it did not eliminate
entrepreneurial behavior. The Soviet economy gave rise to a secondary, underground economy that was
quite entrepreneurial (Shvarts 2010). State enterprise managers also needed to behave in entrepreneurial
ways to acquire resources for their firms in the bureaucracy.

Successful entrepreneurs, especially the ones who have become wealthy through a successful exit (such
as an acquisition or initial public offering), can help to attract others who want to become entrepreneurs.
There have been a few role models of successful technology entrepreneurs in Ukraine. Jan Koum, co-
founder of WhatsApp, and Max Levchin, the co-founder of PayPal, are both originally from Ukraine.
Additionally, to date, Ukraine has had several small acquisitions, including Looksery, which was bought by

Snapchat for US$150 million, and Viewdle, which Google acquired for US$30 million (Seedstars World
2016). While these deals have undoubtedly helped to spur interest in entrepreneurship and helped to
bolster the ecosystem, more successes and recognition of this success can be expected to support the
development of an entrepreneurial culture.

Social capital is important to support entrepreneurship because entrepreneurs must work with—and
often need help from—many people outside of their family or organizational structures. One of the often-
cited reasons for the success of Silicon Valley is the willingness of people to help others through
networking and advice (Hwang and Horowitt 2012). Ukraine is generally viewed as being low in social
capital (Gatskova and Gatskov 2012), primarily due to the destruction of civil society in the Soviet era.
While this may be true in general in Ukraine, our impression from our interviews is that members of the
entrepreneurial community in Ukraine are very willing to assist others.

Other studies have noted that other characteristics of former communist countries are adverse for
entrepreneurship, with workers tending to be more interested in job security and avoiding uncertainty,
more likely to reject control and responsibility for work, and tending to show less initiative (Frese 1995).
Similarly, the cumbersome process for closing businesses increases the consequences of a failed business
and can deter entrepreneurs from taking the risk of starting a business. As noted earlier, the Global
Innovation Index ranks Ukraine near the bottom of all countries (113 out of 128 countries) in ‘ease of
resolving insolvencies’,38 and IFC has noted this as a challenge for entrepreneurs (IFC 2014). This
contributes to the overall culture of risk aversion.

The culture of corruption may hurt entrepreneurship in several ways. Entrepreneurs may fear that the
fruits of their work may be lost to corruption, either from payments for bribes, or hostile takeover of the
company by other firms that may have improper relationships with government. The fact that there are
prominent examples of people having become rich through government connections and acquiring
government assets and in some cases through corruption rather than through innovation-based
entrepreneurship may encourage people toward the former rather than the latter.

The prevailing culture in Ukraine does not seem to be overly favorable toward entrepreneurship although
there are pockets of support. This suggests that active measures are needed to support entrepreneurship
through training, support programs, and communications of successes.

 Human Capital
Ukraine has both strengths and weaknesses with respect to human capital for technology
entrepreneurship. On the positive side, as noted previously, Ukraine has a large population of individuals
with strong education in math, science, and engineering and a large number of people who have
developed IT skills and are working as IT professionals. As IT-related fields are promising for
entrepreneurship (for such reasons as low capital costs, high rates of technical change, and ease of access
to both information and global markets), this is particularly advantageous for entrepreneurship in
Ukraine. The IT outsourcing industry and the expanding number of multinational technology firms that
have opened R&D or technology centers in Ukraine are further evidence of the country’s talent pool. In
addition to the large pool of technical talent, the exchange rates and wages mean that technological talent

in Ukraine is less expensive than many other countries, including Russia or Poland (Satell 2014). This
means that it is less expensive to start IT companies using Ukrainian talent than elsewhere.

In addition, on the positive side, a few universities are supporting start-ups. Data from Crunchbase shows
that students from KPI and Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv have founded at least 80
companies, which account for about 40 percent of all companies founded by alumni in Ukraine on the
Crunchbase database. Additionally, Dnipropetrovsk National University, Kyiv National Economic
University, and National University of Kharkiv account for another 17 percent of companies created by
alumni. While the Crunchbase figures are not exhaustive or representative of the complete level of
university entrepreneurship in Ukraine, the fact that five universities are responsible for over 50 percent
of companies founded by alumni in this data set suggests that a few, but only a few, of Ukraine’s
universities are effectively supporting entrepreneurship.

There are also several weaknesses regarding human capital for entrepreneurship in Ukraine. First,
although math and science skills are strong, university training needs to be better. Universities, with few
exceptions, are not up to date in the fields and do not provide the IT training that industry needs. Many
IT people have math or science backgrounds, but are essentially self-trained in IT. Some higher-level skills
needed for senior software developers are lacking. IT developers also need a better understanding of
business needs. Interviewees strongly believed that universities need major reform to provide better
education in all fields, but specifically in fast-moving IT fields.

Second, business and management skills needed for entrepreneurship are weaker than technology skills,
and only a few universities actively promote entrepreneurship. Interviewees noted that skills in marketing
are hard to find in Ukraine. Financial skills are also needed. According to European Investment Bank
research, banks hesitate to lend to entrepreneurial ventures due to entrepreneurs’ lack of financial
literacy. Simultaneously, absent financial literacy, entrepreneurs do not understand the full range of
funding options from which they could benefit from and how to best work with banks and other financial
entities to obtain them (EIB 2016). Other studies have pointed out to a broader lack of managers and
managerial talent in Ukraine, which affects firms of all sizes and industries (Fuxman 2004).

Third, as noted above, while a few universities encourage entrepreneurship, most do not. University
support for entrepreneurship may affect the number of students seeking to be entrepreneurs. The
venture capitalists we interviewed believed there needed to be a much greater deal flow based on the
amount of talent in Ukraine. Many more people could be encouraged and given the training to start
companies, and this would increase the number of companies that VCs would be able to fund.

Finally, Ukraine struggles with both retaining its own human capital and in bringing foreign talent for
specialized skills. In the World Economic Forum’s 2016–2017 Global Competitiveness Report, Ukraine
placed 127th out of 138 countries in retaining talent and 93rd at attracting talent. In our interviews, many
people noted that the entrepreneurs are encouraged to relocate their companies outside of Ukraine and
that many IT professionals and others are seeking to move to other countries (especially Poland) where
wages may not particularly be higher but that there was a sense that the future may be brighter and the
government was working better.

 Supports
The ‘supports’ element of the entrepreneurship ecosystem includes supporting institutions and programs
specifically for entrepreneurship, such as incubators and accelerators, as well as more general

                                               P a g e | 37
infrastructure (transportation and communications) that may be needed for successful startup
companies.

In the first category, Ukraine has a small but growing number of accelerators, incubators, events, and co-
working spaces. Currently, accelerators and incubators total 10 in Ukraine, and there are at least two co-
working spaces in the country (GoalEurope 2013). Of the most active accelerators in Ukraine, two are
EastLabs and Happy Farm incubators, which had made a total of 47 investments between them as of 2016,
according to Crunchbase. Both institutions adhere to standard accelerator models, with EastLabs offering
four months of incubation, financial capital, networking opportunities, and mentorship. Happy Farm
specializes in mobile, gaming, social networking, and Software as a Service (SaaS), offering each start-up
US$15,000 and advisory services (Gani 2015).

Additionally, Kiev is home to several events that attract major players in Ukraine’s entrepreneurship
ecosystem. For example, IDCEE (Investor's Day Central and Eastern Europe) is a yearly investment
conference, for investors, executives, and entrepreneurs (Gani 2015). Likewise, iForum is one of the
largest conferences in Ukraine, drawing over 5,000 people and a number of international corporations
and local start-ups (Gani 2015). Lastly, Seed Forum Ukraine, part of the global Seed Forum network,
convenes incubators, accelerators, universities, the government, and large ICT corporations in the
country. Currently, the forum has built a network of 3,000 entrepreneurs, 270 SMEs/start-ups, and 1,000
ICT experts (Gani 2015).

The co-working spaces include KvivWorking, an initiative created by Startup Ukraine, which provides
workspace, office equipment, conference rooms, and networking opportunities. Additionally, iHUB
(Innovation Hub) offers start-ups a professional environment to work in and an opportunity to network
with its global network across 40 countries (Gani 2015).

to which the existing organizations meet the need, or potential need, for their services. At least some of
our interviews suggested that the potential exists to substantially increase the training and support for
entrepreneurs. In addition, most of the existing support organizations cater to IT-focused companies, and
there appears to be relatively little support for entrepreneurs in other businesses.

Innovation Ecosystem for Multinational Companies in Ukraine

 Overview
Attracting FDI is an important aspect of a country’s innovation strategy. FDI, in addition to bringing in
capital needed for innovation, usually brings with it new technology (such as manufacturing equipment)
and skills. These may include technical production skills as well as managerial skills and knowledge of the
requirements for operating in international markets. Foreign investments in research, through both
company R&D centers as well as investments in universities and research institutes, can help expand the
innovative capacity of the country by training and providing employment for scientists and engineers.

Ukraine has some assets to attract innovative foreign companies. These include its large, well-educated
workforce, especially with respect to ICT skills, and, at current exchange rates, relatively low wages.
However, there have also been serious barriers to investments by foreign companies, particularly with
regard to corruption and weak legal institutions. As a result, the potential of FDI to encourage innovation
remains largely untapped (Schuch et al 2016). This section looks at the environment for foreign
investment in areas that can contribute to innovation in Ukraine.

Data on FDI in Ukraine are complicated by several factors. The events of 2014 in east Ukraine and Crimea
both discouraged foreign investment and limited data on those parts of the country. The conflict with
Russia and the increased interaction with the EU have changed the patterns of trade. The depreciation of
the hryvnia also affects FDI statistics. Much of what shows up in government statistics as FDI in Ukraine
comes from Cyprus or other countries, where it is thought to not be genuine foreign investment but rather
domestic investments that have been routed through third countries for tax reasons (known as ‘round
tripping’). Moreover, as discussed previously, there may be substantial foreign expenditures on
technology development in Ukraine that take the form of services provided by individual Ukrainian
contractors to foreign entities (at least some of which are firms established by Ukrainian entrepreneurs
outside of Ukraine). As a result of all of these factors, FDI data in Ukraine may not provide a consistent or
accurate picture of the technology-related investments by foreign entities.

Regarding overall levels, FDI in Ukraine is low compared to the top-attracting FDI countries, such as Hong
Kong (China), Luxembourg, Mozambique, or Ireland, whose FDI inflows in 2013 ranged between 20
percent and 50 percent of the national GDP. In Ukraine, in the same year, FDI was only 2.13 percent of
GDP (Schuch et al 2016, 20). In 2012, Multinational enterprises (MNEs) from the EU employed about
200,000 people in Ukraine, while MNEs from the United States employed an estimated 26,000. One area
where foreign-owned enterprises dominate is mobile telephony (OECD 2016).

Funding for innovation in industry from foreign investors in 2014 was only 2 percent, a significant drop
compared to 2013, as shown in table 9.

The share of foreign investments in R&D in Ukraine has also dropped, but to a lesser degree, from a high
level of about 25 percent of GERD in 2010–2013 to 19.8 percent (UAH 2.2 billion) in 2014 (Schuch et al
2016). However, this share of foreign investments in Ukrainian R&D is still relatively high compared to the
other Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries.

 Industry and Market Structure
Ukraine, with a population of 45 million, has a significant market, and this encourages some foreign
companies to invest in innovation to meet the needs of the local market. For example, international food
companies adapt products for the Ukrainian market.41

In general, the industrial structure of Ukraine has not been favorable to technology-related FDI. As noted
previously, high- and medium-technology industries have been shrinking as trade has shifted from Russia,
which imported Ukrainian technology goods, to Europe, which imports mostly commodity metals and
food from Ukraine. Similarly, FDI is concentrated in areas that are not R&D intensive. Financial services
(26.5 percent) and manufacturing (26.2 percent) together account for 53 percent of the total inward FDI
stock, with trade and repair representing an additional 13 percent. Metallurgy accounted for half of the
total FDI stock in manufacturing (12.2 percent of the overall FDI stock). Food processing also has a
significant share. Despite the country’s comparative advantage in agriculture, this sector has a very
modest share of the total FDI (1.3 percent).

An area where there is substantial multinational presence is IT. Ukraine has a large and growing
population of multinational technology companies. According to figures published in the KyivPost,
Ukraine’s IT industry is worth over US$5 billion, with over 500 outsourcing companies, 50,000 engineers,
and 100 global R&D centers (Gani 2015). Samsung, Boeing, Oracle, Magento, and Ubisoft, among others,
have all created R&D centers in Ukraine. Approximately 45 percent of these corporations have
headquarters in the United States, with the others having their homes across four different continents
(Dev-Pro.net 2016). The Samsung R&D Institute Ukraine had a staff of over 1,000 employees in 2013 and
planned to expand to 2,000. Boeing’s design center in Kiev employed more than 200 people in 2013
(Alexandrova 2017).

 Leadership, Governance, and Policy
Barriers to FDI in Ukraine include unstable institutions, uncoordinated policies, and inadequate business
conditions. According to a European Business Association (EBA) Survey,42 foreign investors believe that
the biggest obstacles for investment in Ukraine are widespread corruption (average score - 8.5 points out
of 10 possible) and lack of trust in the judiciary (7.5 points). The military conflict in the east (6.1 points)
and unstable currency and financial system (6 points) were the next most highly ranked obstacles. Among
the most positive actions that the Government of Ukraine could take to attract foreign investment, survey
respondents mentioned relaunching the judiciary by vetting existing members and hiring new judges
(average score - 7.6 points out of 10 possible) and the prosecution of large numbers of high-level officials

and judges for corruption (7.4 points). At the same time, the third most highly ranked government actions
are ensuring the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program remains on track and liberalization of foreign
exchange controls (including canceling the dividend repatriation ban)—both received a score of 6.2
points.

A recent OECD study also pointed to corruption, the ongoing conflict in the Donbas region, political
instability, capital-account restrictions introduced to stabilize the exchange rate, weak competition/anti-
monopoly policy, and tax policy that puts high burdens on the formal sector relative to the informal sector
as major barriers to investment (OECD 2016). State involvement in the economy also deters foreign
investment (IFC 2014). For example, in 2010, the government created the State Food and Grain
Corporation, which secured state control over domestic food prices and grain export quotas, which has
discouraged FDI into the agricultural sector. The government is also known to show favoritism toward
domestically produced equipment, which again deters both foreign competition and investment (IFC
2014).

Our interviews with multinational companies in Ukraine supported these views. Interviewees pointed to
lack of confidence in anticorruption measures and noted the risk of government confiscation of property
(a concern highlighted by a government raid on Dragon Capital, a company we interviewed, during the
mission). Some international IT firms are not investing due to concerns about freedom of speech/press
and overly intrusive cybersecurity policies.

OECD also noted the progress Ukraine is making to improve the investment climate (OECD 2016). In 2016,
Ukraine was invited to become the 47th adherent to the OECD Declaration on International Investment
and Multinational Enterprises. This indicates Ukraine’s commitment to work toward improving integration
into the world economy and promoting responsible business conduct. In the past few years, Ukraine has
made significant progress in improving its investment policy framework, including adopting the principle
of nondiscrimination of foreign investment, including general provisions on foreign investment
protection, simplifying establishment and licensing procedures, and increasing transparency (OECD 2016).
Ukraine has also recently undertaken policy reforms in many of the areas covered by the OECD Guidelines
for Multinational Enterprises (Guidelines), including human rights, labor rights, consumer protection, and
corporate governance.

A study by Akholi Research (Hatch 2016) concluded that until Ukraine resolves ongoing corruption and IP
protection risk, Ukraine will not be able to materially develop high-tech and high-value manufactured
goods exports. It noted that the ICT service development and exports are less affected by these factors
and can continue to expand in the present environment.

 Access to Knowledge and Technology
Due to the long-term decline in research institutions, described in previous sections, technology
capabilities in Ukraine are not the main attractions for FDI. As mentioned above, some multinational firms
have set up software development labs in Ukraine, but for the most, the attraction is the human talent
and the relatively low costs rather than the knowledge or technology. Some foreign companies, including
Samsung, Boeing, and Siemens, are also investing and collaborating with Ukrainian universities. There has
also been some foreign investment in aerospace, drawing on capabilities developed in the Soviet era. For

example, the Ukrainian Research Institute of Aviation Technology received funding from Russia, China,
the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Czech Republic, Poland, France, and others.43

 Human Capital
The availability of a large, well-educated workforce at a relatively low cost is an attraction for FDI, as is
demonstrated by the number of technology firms that have set up office and labs in Ukraine and the
amount of IT outsourcing. Foreign companies in areas outside of IT are also able to find adequate talent.44
There is recognition of strong basic math and science education in Ukraine, as well as problem solving
skills. At the same time, the lack of top research universities and the decline of Ukrainian research
institutes means that Ukraine is not viewed as a place to find top researchers.

Conclusions and Next Steps

This assessment of the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems of Ukraine shows that Ukraine has
some positive aspects and substantial potential for innovation and also many challenges. The main
strengths are the high education levels and strong math and science skills, which are attracting IT work,
in the form of outsourcing, R&D centers of global companies, and new software companies.
Entrepreneurship is expanding, and many entrepreneurs are finding ways to sell to international markets.

Market conditions in agriculture and basic industries are driving growth and exports. While these are not
considered high-technology industries, there is substantial potential for innovation and technology to
improve productivity and competitiveness of these industries. The combination of high skills, low costs at
current exchange rates, and increasing connections to European markets should drive growth and
investment in a number of industries where innovation can improve productivity and living standards in
Ukraine.

However, Ukraine faces substantial challenges. One main challenge is the need for government reform.
Corruption, excessive and poorly designed regulations, lack of effective rule of law, lack of implementation
of programs, and frequently changing governments and policies all create a large drag on business,
prevent effective government-industry collaboration, and serve as barriers to innovation, foreign
investment, and trade. The weaknesses in government have also made effective innovation policies
impossible.

The second main challenge is industrial structure. As trade has shifted from the former Soviet countries
to western Europe, manufacturing industries have declined in favor of agriculture and commodities,
leading to less demand for R&D and innovation. The legacy of SOEs has led to non-innovative companies
and a lack of domestic competition, which is a stimulant to innovation. As a result of these features,
demand for enterprise innovation is low.

The third main challenge is the need for reform in key institutions that are critical for innovation: higher
education and research institutes. Universities are of prime importance because of their role in education,
transfer of knowledge, and entrepreneurship. In many countries, universities serve as the anchor
institutions of innovation ecosystems, generating ideas through research and transferring knowledge
through the training and graduation of students. Although Ukraine’s overall strong education in math and
science is a plus, Ukrainian universities are not research intensive, are not well connected to current
industry needs, and are not current in their curriculum or teaching styles.

Public research institutes are a more difficult problem. Government laboratories in many countries, even
when they are well funded, often have challenges in contributing to innovation due to weak linkages to
industry and poor technology commercialization mechanisms. Ukraine’s public research institutes
consume a large portion of national funds allocated for R&D, have aging staff and facilities, and are not
well matched to Ukraine’s current industrial needs.

These challenges suggest that Ukraine has major systemic and structural issues to address to develop a
well-functioning innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) ecosystem in the long term. These include

    •   Broad governance reform, including reducing corruption, restoring trust in government,
        reforming the judiciary, improving regulations, and other institutional areas;


                                               P a g e | 44
    •   Addressing issues of industrial structure, including strengthening competition policy, reforming
        SOEs, supporting SMEs, and supporting technology-based industries through cluster policies or
        ‘smart specialization’; and
    •   Fundamental reforms of public research institutes and universities, including reforming the
        NASU and piloting targeted programs that could bring research activities closer to the needs of
        local industries (for more details on reforming the NASU, see Ukraine’s STI Public Expenditure
        Analysis Report recommendations).
Reforms in each of these areas are critical for innovation and also for the overall performance of the
private sector and the investment attractiveness of the country. Developing comprehensive solutions to
each of these issues is beyond the scope of this report, and there are already efforts under way in most
of these areas, by the EU, the World Bank, and other development organizations.

Second, the report suggests some areas where shorter-term and more targeted interventions can improve
Ukraine’s I&E ecosystem. Previous reports on innovation in Ukraine led to numerous recommendations
but little sustained implementation, often due to lack of commitment or of budget allocated for programs.
Thus, this report focuses instead on a narrower innovation agenda that is intended to be implementable.
The goal is to provide sustained attention to removing barriers to innovation and to build on programs
that are already working to create momentum toward further reforms. The suggested actions could fall
into the following categories:

Strengthen Innovation Leadership and Coordination

Although innovation is critical to Ukraine’s future—ultimately determining the productivity of the
economy and Ukraine’s standard of living—currently, there is no institutional focus on innovation in
Ukraine’s government. Actions that affect innovation are spread throughout many ministries and public
institutions, and there is a lack of coordination and advocacy within the government for actions to remove
barriers to innovation and improve industrial competitiveness.

Ukraine should have an innovation agency that

    •   Develops, advocates, and publicizes a national vision of an innovation-based economy;
    •   Serves as platform to (a) channel the voice of industry regarding identifying and removing barriers
        to innovation on the sectoral and horizontal levels and (b) advocate for innovation-related
        reforms, including steps to reduce corruption, implement reform regulations, support
        entrepreneurship, and expand public and private R&D expenditures and collaborations;
    •   Identifies working I&E programs and scales them up in coverage and magnitude through technical
        and financial support; and
    •   Design, administer, and implement pilot support programs targeting enterprise innovation and
        entrepreneurial activities.
This agency should work closely with industry groups to understand what the industry needs to succeed
in innovation and should work closely across ministries of the government to remove barriers to
innovation and to implement innovation support programs. Importantly, it should work to earn the trust
of the industry—the low current levels of trust between the industry and the government constitute a
major barrier to effective innovation programs. As various government policy changes are considered, the
innovation agency should ensure that the reforms have industry input regarding how the reforms would

                                              P a g e | 45
affect innovation and the competitiveness of firms. The agency should provide continuity in government
innovation reform efforts in contrast to the current disintegrated approach. It should advocate for
sustainable budgets for innovation programs and advocate for competition policy, universities, and public
research institutions reform.

Identify and Scale up Working Approaches

Given the uneven record of previous discontinued initiatives, we suggest a modest near-term strategy of
building on initiatives that already appear to be working. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential
focus programs:

    •   Expanding entrepreneurship support programs, such as building on the Science Park and
        entrepreneurship programs at KPI. Our interviews suggested a strong potential and need for
        expanding the pipeline of new companies. Expanded entrepreneurship support programs
        targeting investment readiness of start-ups, including training programs, seed funds,
        incubators/accelerators, business plan competitions, and mentoring, could have an immediate
        impact. Building on the successful programs in universities can also be expected to support
        reforms and culture change at universities.
    •   Building on and expanding regional cluster programs. Regional strategies involving local
        government, industry, and universities approaches can develop strong regional innovation
        ecosystems. Often, effective industry-government-university collaboration is easier to build at the
        regional level than at the national level. The IT cluster in Lviv may be a good model to scale into
        other regions and industries. The EU-supported regional smart specialization strategy is a useful
        way to proceed with such programs.
    •   Addressing the identified and immediate needs of already growing and leading sectors. For
        example, the IT and agriculture industries have been growing and exporting but have identified
        research, educational/training, and logistical needs for improving productivity and
        competitiveness. The envisioned agency and/or the respective ministries could take the lead on
        working throughout the government bodies to remove the barriers and address these immediate
        needs.
Pilot New Innovation Support Programs

In addition to the immediate roles articulated above, the innovation agency could design, administer, and
implement pilot support programs to innovative enterprises and start-ups to scale up and grow. Currently,
there are few, if any, public support programs (other than European or donor-supported programs) that
innovative Ukrainian enterprises could apply and compete for. The pilot programs, such as innovation
vouchers, innovation grants, and research collaboration grants, to name a few, could follow or adapt
models implemented in several benchmark economies and learn from countries’ experiences in setting
up, implementing, and monitoring such programs. The ability of this new agency to lead such pilots
depends on the level of competence of its staff, access to financial and technical resources, its degree of
autonomy, and the commitment of the government to the innovation agenda, to name a few.

The World Bank team, through the Innovation Support project, has been providing technical support to
the MEDT and the Reform Delivery Office in the context of designing and setting up such an innovation
agency (currently labeled as the Innovation Development Office) based on a request from the Prime
Minister’s Office. The mission, governance and institutional structure, areas of focus, and pilot support
programs are all currently under consideration by the main stakeholders. This report helps make the case

                                                P a g e | 46
for such an agency and its missing role in supporting enterprise innovation but intentionally holds back
from prescribing the details of the institution and its programs. The details of these programs will be
developed with stakeholders as a next step.
