About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      for the location information.


      According to the Spatial Planning Act amended in 2008, the applicant is not
      obliged to obtain the location information any more. Also, according to the
      Construction Act amended in 2008, the location information is no longer a
      part of the project documentation for building permit. All data included in
      the location information must be obtained ex o cio by the local
      administration that issues the building permit. However, in practice
      obtaining the location information is still done by most applicants to provide
      an additional guarantee. Furthermore, the location information provides a
      clear list of project approvals that must be obtained in the process of
      obtaining the building permit for the area in question. Location documents
      can be obtained online on http://www.gu.gov.si/en. This has allowed anybody
      to obtain land maps and geodetic data directly online.

  4   Obtain project approval from water and sewage provider                               30 days             no charge
      Agency : JP Vodovod-Kanalizacija d.o.o

      The government of Slovenia amended its Construction Act in July 2012. The
      amended law eliminated the requirement for obtaining project conditions
      from the water and sewage provider company before completing the project
      design. An investor may now directly obtain the project approval from the
      water and sewage provider without obtaining the project conditions.


      The water and sewage provider must issue its approval (or disapproval) to
      the project solutions in 30 days from submitting the application. If the
      agency's approval (disapproval) is not issued within the 30 days, it is deemed
      that the agency has given its approval (i.e. the investor may start with the
      building permit obtaining procedure without attaching the project approval
      to the application).

      except for the land registry as a proof of ownership of the land) and
      previously obtained approvals to the project solutions. The project design
      must be prepared by the licensed architect. The project design includes data
      on location of the building, schemes, architectural plan, plan of building
      structures, plan on electrical installations, etc.

      • All required approvals have been obtained
      • Project design is prepared in accordance with the valid legislation
      • Contributions prescribed by law have been paid (i.e. administrative tax for
      the application for the building permit, public utilities charge, compensation
      for degradation of the environment)


      The building permit is no longer valid if the investor fails to commence
      construction of the building in three years (two years in the case of the less
      complex constructions) from the date the building permit became nal.


      According to the law, the administrative unit shall issue a building permit in 2
      months (60 days) from the day the application (including all obligatory
      attachments) was submitted. This can take longer in practice but the legal
      time limit of 60 days is generally met.

      An application can be submitted in person, by mail and by e-mail. The
      following approvals and contracts are needed in the process of connecting a
      new customer to the power grid:
      • approval of warehouse project (Statement that the warehouse matches
      requirements of the power connection conditions),
      • connection approval (Detailed technical speci cation; metering, rights and
      obligations of utility and investor-owner),
      • connection contract.

      The customer has to send applications for each of those approvals and
      contract at the same time to the utility and to the same department. In
      addition, the customer has to request the technical conditions from the
      utility. The technical conditions are needed to get information about the
      location, the point of ''hook up'', the nearest substation, and the distance.
      This information is necessary to design the connection. Documents to be
      attached to apply for those approvals and the technical conditions are:
      Location, electrical power needed, project documents and ownership
      documents. The documents do not need to be notarized. There are no extra
      costs associated. The customer gets the approvals by mail or can come and
      pick them up. There is no external inspection. If the external connection work
      is done by a private electrical contractor, an inspection by the utility is done
      during the connection works. The customer can apply for the internal
      inspection at this point by submitting an extra form.

  2   Conclude supply agreement                                                          1 calendar day      EUR 0
      Agency : Elektro Ljubljana

      The customer has to submit a separate application for the supply contract.
      The utility then sends an o er back and the customer signs the contract. The
      contract for the new connection and the supply contract must be signed
      before the physical connection works start. The separation of these two
      functions is regulated in the EC Directive (2003/54/EC and 96/92/EC).

      Transformers usually have enough capacity to accommodate an additional
      load of 140kVA inside and around the motorway ring (the area where
      warehouses usually locate). Therefore, no extra transformer needs to be
      built for the new customer and the warehouse is connected via simple hook-
      up to the next utility distribution transformer (usually 200 meters distance).
      Either the utility or an outside company is in charge of the external works
      including designing the details of the external connection works. Both are
      possible (works carried out by the utility or by an electrical contractor),
      however it is more common to have the utility carrying out the connection
      works. The material is provided by the utility or the electrical contractor that
      would carry out the connection works. The meter gets installed at the same
      time as when the connection is done. It is installed either by the authorized
      electrical contractor or the utility that carries out the connection works.

       An outside company that is registered for supervision con rms with a
       statement that the internal wiring is done according to regulations and
       standards. The utility is also authorized to inspect the internal wiring. The
       customer has to request the internal inspection with the application for
       connection to the network. Someone from the customer’s party has to be
       present.

   5   Apply for nal connection by utility                                             3 calendar days         EUR 0

      A land registry extract shall be obtained by the seller from the Land Registry
      as proof of ownership. Information regarding potential encumbrances on
      the property are a vital part thereof. Most real estate information is available
      online, therefore it is obtained immediately in the form of a .pdf le. In rare
      instances, however, relevant information has to be physically sought out,
      thereby taking a bit longer as well as being associated with additional
      (administrative) costs.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
