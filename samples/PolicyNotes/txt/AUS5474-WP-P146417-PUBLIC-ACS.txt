Executive summary
Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) provide a set of metrics to benchmark service delivery
performance. In sub-Saharan Africa, t h e o v e r a l l o b j e c t i v e o f SDI is to gauge the quality of
service delivery in primary education and basic health services. The SDI enable governments and
service providers to identify gaps and track progress over time and across countries in a region. This
report presents the findings from the implementation of the first round of SDI surveys for the health
sector in Niger.

From October to November 2015, surveys were conducted in 256 health facilities, which included
district hospitals, health centers, and health posts. Information was gathered from 1,355 health
providers who were representative of facilities across different settings of care, ranging from public
and private facilities, and facilities located in rural and urban settings.

The SDI survey provides information on four broad categories of information: provider effort (what
providers do); provider knowledge and ability (what providers know); inputs (what providers have
to work with); and management, supervision, and community engagement. The findings are
summarized below.

What providers do

Absence rate: during an unannounced visit, on average, 33 percent of health workers are observed
to be absent per day (of which 82 percent are approved), with higher absence rates recorded in
public facilities than private ones. Staff in health centers are 1.8 times more likely to be absent than
those in health posts. Absence is found to be positively correlated with remoteness, facility type (a
hospital has greater absence than a clinic than a post) controlling for staff size and staff composition.
Management feedback is related to absence as well (reduces when negative, increases when
positive).

Caseload: adjusting for provider absence, health providers in Niger see 9.8 outpatients per
provider-day. Public facilities (10.1) have higher volumes than private facilities (4.6). Hospitals have
significantly less (1.0) patients per provider-day than health posts (6.1) or clinics (17.2). A
verification with the 2014 annual report confirms the caseload rates for the majority of the hospitals
in the sample.

What service providers know

Diagnostic accuracy: on average, providers successfully diagnosed 31.5 percent of the five tracer
conditions (malaria with anemia, acute diarrhea with severe dehydration, pneumonia, pulmonary
tuberculosis, and diabetes mellitus). These pathologies are commonly seen by providers. There is
no statistically significant difference across public/private and rural/urban within public facilities.
Examining the individual conditions, private providers did more than twice as well (46.2 percent)
as public providers (20.7 percent) at identifying diabetes mellitus, but failed entirely to diagnose
acute diarrhea with severe dehydration (3 percent in public). Among facility types, health posts
were uniformly the worst, often by significant margins and at statistically significant levels from
hospitals and clinics.




                                                                                                          8
Adherence to clinical guidelines: on average, for the five tracer cases, providers asked less two in
five of the medically-necessary questions to diagnose the case according to the national guidelines.
In many cases, essential questions related to danger signs were not asked.

Management of maternal and neonatal complications: on average, 12 percent of the necessary
clinical actions to manage immediate post-partum hemorrhage and neonatal asphyxia were taken
by providers. Whether analyzed by ownership or by location within the public sector, rural public
providers have the highest rate, but only provide 12.2 percent of the necessary treatment actions.
Public providers diagnose immediate post-partum hemorrhage 70 percent better than private
providers. Among public providers, rural providers treat this condition 46.5 percent better than
urban ones.

First ante-natal care visit: providers were presented with a patient who was pregnant and
moderately anemic, yet 0.8 percent diagnosed both elements while 91.7 percent diagnosed only the
pregnancy. Public providers do better than private providers for danger signs, key questions,
physical examinations, and care. However, public providers are more likely to diagnose a pregnancy
without anemia than private providers. Regionally, providers in Tahoua are 9.5 percentage points
more likely than those in Niamey to identify only the pregnancy. Consistent with the child case
simulations, providers neglected relevant elements such as palmar pallor (14 percent of providers)
and hemoglobin examinations (4.8 percent when constrained by their routine environment, 6.5
percent unconstrained by their environment).

Severe pre-eclampsia: providers were presented with a patient who had clear signs of pre-
eclampsia and were expected to recognize the condition, its severity, and to take appropriate action.
Overall, 10.9 percent of providers diagnosed the pre-eclampsia as being severe, although 50.2
percent diagnosed the pre-eclampsia. Public providers do better than private providers for physical
and clinical examinations, and care. Relative to Niamey, the rate of correct diagnosis is 14.8 percent
in Maradi, 6.4 percent in Tahoua, and 11.6 percent in Zinder. Overall, the recognition of pre-eclampsia
without consideration of the severity, is still significantly different from Niamey in Maradi (42.3
percent), Tahoua (44.9 percent), and Zinder (45.8 percent).

What service providers have to work with

Drug availability: on average, facilities had 50 percent of tracer drugs available, with urban public
facilities having 22 percent greater availability than rural public ones. There were no significant
differences across public and private. Controlling for which drugs were to be found at what levels,
hospitals averaged higher tracer drug availability than health posts. Tracer medications for children
(54 percent) were generally more available than those for mothers (44 percent). Urban public
facilities had greater average availability of drugs for mothers and children than rural public
facilities.

Equipment availability: Approximately one in two facilities had functional basic equipment, 1 with
the lowest levels observed in health posts. Averaging across facility types, urban public facilities
were 86 percent more likely to have all equipment than rural public facilities. There are differences
in equipment types, with public facilities 5.5 times more likely to have infant scales than private
facilities.

clinics and hospitals. Annex A has detailed definitions of the indicators.


                                                                                                                       9
Infrastructure availability: 13.3 percent of facilities in Niger had safe drinking water, functional
sanitation, and power available on the day of the survey. Private providers were 2.3 times more
likely to have safe drinking water, functional sanitation, and power available on the day of the
survey, particularly power (1.8 times) than public ones. Similarly, urban public facilities are 6.5
times more likely to simultaneously have all three elements than rural public facilities. All elements
are more present in urban than in rural facilities, although sanitation is more equally available (43
percentage points less likely) than sanitation (50.7) or power (69.7).

Management, supervision, and community engagement

Leadership and management: facility heads are the ministry’s first supervision agents and are most
directly able to monitor service delivery. However, most facility heads do not report using incentive
methods, whether positive (33.5 percent use them) or negative (17.9 percent). More broadly, private
facility heads are more than twice as likely to cite or use positive incentives and 3.8 times as likely to
cite negative incentives.

Supervision: providers receive a visit per quarter on average, with larger teams in urban public than
in rural public facilities (three versus two people). There is greater use of supervision worksheets in
private versus public facilities (62.6 percent) and in urban relative to rural among public facilities
(40.2 percent more prevalent). Among supervision teams, disease focal points were most likely to
use supervision tools, to review staff presence, and to examine medical stocks, but not more likely to
leave written comments. The focus on quality of care decreases rapidly as the facility level decreases
from all at the hospital level to 54.8 percent in health centers and 18.6 percent in health posts. More
generally, quality of care is a greater focus for private facilities (87.4 percent) than public ones (38
percent).

Community engagement: while 96.5 percent of public facilities had a facility management
committee in 2014, only 6.8 percent of private facilities had one (p<0.01). By 2015, this had become
basically universal. However, the functioning of the COGES, as measured by the presence of meeting
minutes varied significantly; nearly 40 percent of public facilities did not have minutes compared to
none among private facilities. Rural public facilities are more than twice as likely as urban public
facilities to not have minutes of the last meeting.

 I.     Introduction
As the Country Status Report (2014) notes, there is variation among the key outcome indicators.
Mortality for neonates (27 percent over 2006-12), infants (60 percent over 1998-2012), and mothers
(14.5 percent over 2006-2012; 21 percent over 1990-2010) declined significantly, mortality rates
remain high and Niger’s maternal mortality (554/100,000 live births) exceeded that of most West
African Economic and Monetary Union states in 2010. The sharp declines in neonatal and infant
mortality raised Niger’s life expectancy at birth from 37 years (1960) to 58.4 years (2010), slightly
above the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 54 years and nearly at the low-income average of 59 years.

Provision of care is hindered by a very high centration of doctors (1 per 5,642 people) and nurses (1
IDE per 1,789 people) in Niamey to the detriment of highly-populated areas such as Zinder, Maradi,
Tahoua, and Tillabéri which have between eight and12 times less doctors per capita and roughly 3.6
times less IDE per capita than Niamey. The skill imbalances are one problem, as is the overall level
of ability to properly handle the various cases remains a concern. In addition, the gap between those
formally trained and trained on the job, particularly for adult care, is a further cause for concern. The
overall level of skills in the management of maternal and neonatal complications is in line with the
burden of mortality (535 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies; DHS 2012). Niger’s performance in
diagnostic accuracy, adherence to guidelines, and the management of maternal and child health
complications places it near the bottom of the table for SDI countries.

Human resource availability is a challenge, with a 33 percent national absence rate. This is 2.23 times
higher than in primary education, where teachers are absent from school 14.8 percent of the time
using the same methodology.

The SDI program (see Boxes 1 and 2) aims to document what results are obtained through public
spending in the health and education sector. The focus is on the individual dimensions, whether effort
(presence and workload) or knowledge (diagnostic accuracy, adherence to clinical guidelines, and
case management). These dimensions are not routinely measured and reported publicly in a
comparable fashion, yet are among the factors that influence policy outcomes in health.

The remainder of this document is organized into three major sections: methodology and
implementation; results; and implications for Niger. Annexes present details of the sampling strategy,
definitions of the indicators, and additional results. A final section presents the references consulted
or cited.

Box 1. The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Program
A significant share of public spending on education is transformed to produce good schooling outcomes.
Understanding what takes place at these frontline service provision centers is the starting point to
determining where the relationship between public expenditure and outcomes is weak within the service
delivery chain. Knowing whether spending is translating into inputs that teachers have to work with (e.g.
textbooks in schools), or how much effort is made by teachers (e.g. how likely are they to come to work),
and their competency would reveal the weak links in the service delivery chain. In general, reliable and
complete information on these measures is lacking.

To date, there is no robust, standardized set of indicators to measure the quality of services available to
citizens in Africa. Existing indicators tend to be fragmented and focus either on final outcomes or inputs,
rather than on the underlying systems that help generate the outcomes or make use of the inputs. In fact,
no set of indicators is available for measuring constraints associated with service delivery and the behavior
of frontline providers, both of which have a direct impact on the quality of services that citizens are able to
access. Without consistent and accurate information on the quality of services, it is difficult for citizens or
politicians (the principal) to assess how service providers (the agent) are performing and to take corrective
action.

The SDI provides a set of metrics to benchmark the performance of schools and health clinics in Africa. The
SDI can be used to track progress within and across countries over time, and aim to enhance active
monitoring of service delivery to increase public accountability and good governance. Ultimately, the goal
of this effort is to help policymakers, citizens, service providers, donors, and other stakeholders enhance
the quality of services and improve development outcomes.

The perspective adopted by the indicators is that of citizens accessing a service. The indicators can thus be
viewed as a service delivery report card on education and health care. However, instead of using citizens’
perceptions to assess performance, the indicators assemble objective and quantitative information from a
survey of frontline service delivery units, using modules from the Public Expenditure Tracking Survey
(PETS), Quantitative Service Delivery Survey (QSDS), and Staff Absence Survey (SAS).

The literature points to the importance of the functioning of schools and, more generally, the quality of
service delivery. The service delivery literature is, however, clear that conditional on providers being
appropriately skilled and exerting the necessary effort, increased resource flows for health can indeed have
beneficial outcomes for education.

The SDI initiative is a partnership of the World Bank, the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),
and the African Development Bank to develop and institutionalize the collection of a set of indicators that
would gauge the quality of service delivery within and across countries and over time. The ultimate goal is
to sharply increase accountability for service delivery across Africa by offering important advocacy tools
for citizens, governments, and donors alike; to work toward the goal of achieving rapid improvements in
the responsiveness and effectiveness of service delivery.

II.     Methodology and implementation
A. Implementation
In 2015, the Niger SDI survey collected information from 256 lower-level health facilities and 1,355
health providers (see Table 4). The survey was preceded by consultation with government on survey
design, sampling, and the adaptation of survey instruments. Pre-testing of the survey instruments,
enumerator training, and fieldwork took place between 2013 and 2015 in waves.

In the Niger health system, multiple types of facilities exist; of these the Health posts (case de santé),
clinics (centres de santé intégré) and district hospitals (hôpital de district) were included in the survey
population. These facilities account for the nearly 87 percent of the health service utilization as
reported in the 2014 household survey undertaken by the National Statistical Office (Institut National
de la Statistique). Annex A provides additional details on the sampling.

The results provide an assessment of the quality of service delivery and the environment in which
the services are delivered in rural and urban locations, in public and private health facilities. While
the term “private” largely include facilities owned by faith-based organizations, there are also some
facilities that are owned by nongovernmental organizations or for-profit entities.

The surveyed population comprised three types: Health posts (poste de santé), health centers (centre
de santé intégré), and district hospitals (hôpital de district). The survey used a two-stage sampling
strategy that allowed for disaggregation by geographic location (rural and urban), by provider type
(public and private), and by facility type (see Table 4). Since there were 28 first-level district
hospitals, a decision was made to sample 16 of them, which represents a 57 percent sampling
fraction.

There were 8 facilities where second visits were not undertaken in accordance with the SDI
methodology. These facilities, and their staff, are excluded from the absence rate calculations. The
visits in question were done during weekends instead of normal working hours.




                                                                                                        15
Box 2. Analytical underpinnings
Service delivery outcomes are determined by the relationships of accountability between policymakers,
service providers, and citizens, as documented in the 2004 World Development Report. Human
development outcomes are the result of the interaction between various actors in the multi‐step service
delivery system, and depend on the characteristics and behavior of individuals and households. The
delivery of quality healthcare is contingent foremost on what happens in health facilities, where a
combination of several basic elements have to be present in order for quality services to be accessible and
produced on the frontline. This, in turn, depends on the overall service delivery system, and these
institutions and governance structures provide incentives for the service providers to perform.

Service delivery production function
Consider a service delivery production function, f, which maps physical inputs, x, the effort put in by the
service provider, e, as well as his/her type (or knowledge), θ, to deliver quality services into individual
level outcomes, y. The effort variable, e, could be thought of as multidimensional and, thus, include effort
(broadly defined) of other actors in the service delivery system. We can think of this type as the
characteristic (knowledge) of the individuals who are selected for a specific task. Of course, as noted above,
outcomes of this production process are not just affected by the service delivery unit, but also by the actions
and behaviors of households, which we denote by ε. We can therefore write:

                                                y = f(x,e,θ) +ε

To assess the quality of services provided, one should ideally measure f(x,e,θ). Of course, it is notoriously
difficult to measure all the arguments that enter the production and would involve a huge data collection
effort. A more feasible approach is, therefore, to focus instead on proxies of the arguments which, to a first‐
order approximation, have the largest effects.

Indicator categories and the selection criteria
There are a host of data sets available in education. To a large extent, these data sets measure inputs and
outcomes/outputs in the service delivery process, mostly from a household perspective. While providing
a wealth of information, existing data sources (like Living Standards Measurement Survey [LSMS], Welfare
Monitoring Surveys [WMS], and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey [CWIQ]) cover only a sub‐
sample of countries and are, in many cases, outdated.




                                                                                                                 16
Box 2. Analytical underpinnings (continued)
The proposed choice of indicators takes its starting point from the recent literature on the economics of
service delivery. Overall, this literature emphasizes the importance of provider behavior and competence
in the delivery of health and education services (as opposed to water and sanitation services and housing
that rely on very different service delivery models). Conditional on service providers exerting effort, there
is also some evidence that the provision of physical resources and infrastructure has important effects on
the quality of service delivery.

The somewhat weak relationship between resources and outcomes documented in the literature has been
associated with deficiencies in the incentive structure of health systems. Indeed, most service delivery
systems in developing countries present frontline providers with a set of incentives that negate the impact
of pure resource‐based policies. Therefore, while resources alone appear to have a limited impact on the
quality of education and health in developing countries, it is possible inputs are complementary to changes
in incentives, so coupling improvements in both may have large and significant impacts (Hanushek, 2006).
While budgets have not kept up with the expansion in access in recent times, simply increasing the level of
resources might not address the quality deficit in education and health without also taking providers’
incentives into account.

SDI proposes three sets of indicators: (i) provider effort; (ii) competence of service providers; and (iii)
availability of key infrastructure and inputs at the frontline service provider level. Providing countries with
detailed and comparable data on these important dimensions of service delivery is one of the main
innovations of the SDI. Additional considerations in the selection of indicators are (i) quantitative (to avoid
problems of perception biases that limit both cross‐country and longitudinal comparisons), (ii) ordinal in
nature (to allow within and cross‐country comparisons); (iii) robust (in the sense that the methodology
used to construct the indicators can be verified and replicated); (iv) actionable; and (v) cost effective to
collect.

The indicators listed here are not the only metrics collected in SDI surveys. For example, here are some
examples of management and governance data included in the instrument: roles and responsibilities in
facilities, government supervision, time use, leadership, people management practices, user fees, financial
(cash) support to facilities by source, community involvement etc.

Note: eight providers are categorized as “other” without sufficient information to classify them per the groupings above.

The survey covered the entire country, with the exception of a few areas. The region of Diffa was in a
state of emergency declared by the Government of Niger during the survey and was excluded as were
the areas of Tesker, Tilia, Tassara (localized risks), and Bilma (few facilities, very great distances).

The survey used a sector‐specific questionnaire with several modules (Table A1), all of which were
administered at the facility level. The questionnaires built on previous similar questionnaires based
on international good practice for Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys, Quality of Service Delivery
Surveys, and observational surveys. The SDI team carried out a pre-test of the instrument with staff
from the Ministry of Health in February and June 2015, and two additional pilots were carried out in
September 2015. Table 5 provides a breakdown of the sample used for absence and competency rates
by health worker cadre.

A. Delivering health services

Most facilities are open nearly every day, with slight variation among lower-level facilities, primarily
in favor of urban residents and users of public facilities. Information is provided in Table 6 below.

The availability of basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (Table 7) shows
that access to a hospital is an important requirement, even for basic emergency obstetric care.
Leaving out the higher-level hospitals that were not part of this study, almost all hospitals offered
comprehensive emergency obstetric care, although a negligible proportion of health facilities offer it.
The most limiting factor is the instrumented births with forceps or suction devices, which is offered
by 15 percent of posts, 60 percent of clinics, and 98 percent of hospitals. Of the two signal functions
of the CEmOC, blood transfusion is offered in four percent overall, in all hospitals and 22 percent of
clinics, and 90 percent of hospitals and eight percent of clinics offered cesarean sections.

Table 8 shows that the allocation of providers is uneven across rural and urban areas. Better-trained
public providers are concentrated in urban areas. There are 1.8 nurses per doctor in private facilities
compared to 13.6 in public ones.

B. Caseload (external consultations)


 Methodological note

 The caseload indicator is defined as the number of outpatient visits (recorded in outpatient records) in the
 three months prior to the survey, divided by the number of days the facility was open during the three-
 month period and the number of health workers who conduct patient consultations (paramedical health
 staff such as laboratory technicians or pharmacists’ assistants are excluded from the denominator). In
 hospitals, the caseload indicator was measured using outpatient consultation records; only providers doing
 outpatient consultations were included in the denominator. The term caseload rather than workload is used
 to acknowledge the fact that the full workload of a health provider includes work that is not captured in the
 numerator, notably administrative work and other non-clinical activities. From the perspective of a patient
 or a parent coming to a health facility, caseload—while not the only measure of workload—is arguably a
 critically important measure.

Health centers provide the majority of care in Niger (Table 8). Consistent with a rural population,
more care if provided in rural than in urban areas. The public sector provides the majority of its care
in the rural areas, consistent with the population distribution. Very little care is recorded as being
provided in hospitals. Cross-verification with the 2014 health management information system
annual report shows that 10 of the 14 hospitals that may be compared have quarterly rates that are
within 10 percent of the implied quarterly rate from the 2014 annual consultation rates. 2

distribution was skewed left—in fact, 50 percent of the providers had fewer than 6 patients per
provider-day (Figure 2). A few facilities show adjusted caseloads that seem extremely high. Some of

2 This rises to 11/14 within 25 percent and 12/14 in 50 percent. Two hospitals have rates for 2015Q3 that are well above

the implied quarterly rates from the 2014 annual report. Two hospitals were missing data either in at least one of the
sources and could therefore not be compared. The 2014 annual report was the latest available.


                                                                                                                                             21
this is due to the adjustment, as when half the staff are absent on a day, that means that the adjusted
caseload is double. However, some may be data quality concerns, either from the survey data work
or the HMIS reporting. For example, a small health center with between three and five people and
nearly 9,700 consultations over the past three months effectively has roughly three consultations per
provider per hour before considering absences. Applying an absence rate of 20 percent (the facility’s)
results in an average caseload of 3.6 outpatients per hour each hour and day of the week for the entire
three-month period (eight hours per day).

C. Absence rate

    Methodological note

    The average rate of provider absence is measured by assessing the presence of at most 10 randomly selected
    clinical health staff at a facility during an unannounced visit. Only workers who are supposed to be on duty
    are considered in the denominator. The approach of using unannounced visits is regarded best practice in
    the service delivery literature. Health workers doing fieldwork (mainly community and public health
    workers) were counted as present. The absence indicator was not estimated for hospitals because of the
    complex off-duty arrangements, interdepartmental shifts etc.


In Niger, 33 percent of health workers were absent on a given day (Table 11). 3 The providers least
likely to be absent are the public providers in Health posts (18.9 percent). There is little variation
across rural and urban or public and private. When comparing across regions, there is no statistically-
significant difference.

The overwhelming majority—nearly 82 percent—of all absences were approved. The reasons for
absence are multiple, some excused and some unexcused (Figure 3). Beyond annual leave (41.1
percent), providers were on medical leave (26.5 percent) or in training (7.8 percent). Among the
unexcused absences, reasons not authorized were first (9.2 percent) followed by collecting salaries
because they are not paid directly to staff accounts.

             Notes: medical leave includes both sick and maternity leave. Totals may not add to 100 due to rounding.


Figure 4 shows the marginal effects for the correlates of absence, which are detailed in Table 37. The
correlations suggest a few key factors: remoteness, facility type and total staff, workload and peers,
and managerial influence play a role. Facilities that are more remote, whether requiring means of
transport such as boats/animals (+24.7 z-scores of absence; p<0.01) or vehicles (+5.1; p<0.01) are
more associated with absence. Hospitals (+21.5; p<0.01), despite a control for total facility staff (-1.5;
p<0.01) have a considerably higher correlation with absence than health posts. Caseload-adjusted
workload (0.2; p<0.01) and peer absence (0.2; p<0.01) have the same effects. Finally, when the
manager provides negative (-3.1; p<0.05) or positive (4.2; p<0.05) feedback, it has an impact.
Interestingly, in light of experiences in other SDI surveys, the absence of the head is not significantly
related to the absence of staff. In other cases, including education in Niger, the head’s absence has a
major impact on staff absence.

D. Diagnostic accuracy
Provider ability and knowledge. Having health professionals present in facilities is a necessary but
insufficient condition for delivering quality health services. For this reason, quality was also assessed
using two process quality indicators (the adherence to clinical guidelines in five tracer conditions
and the management of maternal and newborn complications) and an outcome quality indicator,
diagnostic accuracy, in five tracer conditions.

In Niger, these conditions are important, both for morbidity and mortality. Key burdens of disease
cited by the World Health Organization for children under the age of five include malaria (19
percent), acute respiratory infections (18 percent), diarrheal diseases (12 percent), and birth


                                                                                                                         24
asphyxia (8 percent). Overall, in Niger, the first three causes of death in 2012 were lower respiratory
infections (15.1 percent), malaria (10.4 percent), and diarrheal diseases (9.6 percent). Two of the
most important causes of death in Niger are preterm birth complications (5.2 percent) and maternal
conditions (3.1 percent). 4

    Methodological note

    The choice of tracer conditions was guided by the burden of disease among children and adults, and
    whether the condition is amenable to use with a simulation tool, i.e., the condition has a presentation of
    symptoms that makes it suitable for assessing provider ability to reach correct diagnosis with the
    simulation tool. Three of the conditions were childhood conditions (malaria with anaemia; diarrhoea with
    severe dehydration, and pneumonia), and two conditions were adult conditions (pulmonary tuberculosis
    and diabetes). Two other conditions were included: post-partum haemorrhage and neonatal asphyxia. The
    former is the most common cause of maternal death during child birth, and neonatal asphyxia is the most
    common cause of neonatal death during birth. The successful diagnosis and management of these seven
    conditions can avert a large share of child and adult morbidity and mortality.

    These indicators were measured using the patient case simulation methodology, also called clinical
    vignettes. Clinical vignettes are a widely used teaching method used primarily to measure clinicians’ (or
    trainee clinicians’) knowledge and clinical reasoning. A vignette can be designed to measure knowledge
    about a specific diagnosis or clinical situation at the same time gaining insight into the skills in performing
    the tasks necessary to diagnose and care for a patient. According to this methodology, one of the
    fieldworkers acts as a case study patient and he/she presents to the clinician specific symptoms from a
    carefully constructed script while another records the interaction. The clinician, who is informed of the case
    simulation, is asked to proceed as if the interviewer is a real patient. For each facility, the case simulations
    are presented to up to 10 randomly selected health workers who conduct outpatient consultations. If there
    are fewer than 10 health workers who provide clinical care, all the providers are interviewed.

    For more information on the methodology, see www.SDIndicators.org. There are two other commonly used
    methods to measure provider knowledge and ability, and each has pros and cons. The most important
    drawback in the patient case simulations is that the situation is not a real one and that this may bias the
    results. The direction of this potential bias makes this issue less of a concern—the literature suggests that
    the direction of the bias is likely to be upward, suggesting that our estimates can be regarded as upper-
    bound estimates of true clinical ability. The patient case simulation approach offers key advantages given
    the scope and scale of the Service Delivery Indicators methodology: (i) a relatively simple ethical approval
    process is required given that no patients are observed; (ii) there is standardization of the case mix and the
    severity of the conditions presented to the clinician; and (iii) the choice of tracer conditions is not
    constrained by the fact that a dummy patient cannot mimic some symptoms.


In this section, two process quality measures (adherence to clinical guidelines and managing
maternal and neonatal complications) and two intermediate outcome measures (diagnostic accuracy
and treatment accuracy relative to guidelines) are used. The results of the measures used to assess
provider knowledge and ability are presented below.

Providers made the correct diagnosis in approximately one-quarter (26.9 percent) of the tracer
conditions (Table 12), with doctors performing the best (51.5 percent). Private providers are better
than public ones, as are urban public relative to rural public providers. Disease-specific diagnostic
accuracy is captured in Table 43 in Annex C and diagnostic accuracy by region is in Table 47 in Annex
C.

Using as a proxy the ability to correctly diagnose the five tracer cases, Figure 5 and Figure 6 highlight
the wide spectrum of competencies in the Nigérien health system. Common conditions such as
diarrhea with severe dehydration and malaria with anemia are not well-diagnosed (Figure 5). Some
of this is due to the providers missing the co-prevalent condition, for example, the level of
dehydration with the diarrhea (severe) and the anemia with malaria. Consistent with medical
practice, the failure to identify these is defined as a failure to properly diagnose.

Figure 5. Tracer conditions diagnostic accuracy (percent)




Note: for doctors, medical assistants, and nurses only. Weighted estimates.

As there are few doctors at the levels studied, the focus is primarily on medical assistants and nurses,
who comprise the majority of the personnel (Figure 6). Medical assistants do worse than nurses and
have higher variation than the latter. Nurses tend to correctly diagnose two conditions, and this is




                                                                                                               26
consistent whether or not nurses are split into sub-categories. 5 Table 43 and Table 44 in Annex C
present additional information for disease-specific diagnostic accuracy by facility type.

Figure 6. Provider diagnostic accuracy for the tracers (number of cases; percent)




Note: data are weighted. Categories on the horizontal axis are the number of cases correctly diagnosed.

When comparing among facility levels, Table 44 shows a similar pattern: higher-level facilities handle
more complicated pathologies better. A striking case is that of malaria with anemia, where staff in
health posts and clinics are 40 percent (p<0.01) and 21 percent (p<0.05) more likely to identify only
simple malaria relative to hospitals. However, health posts provide 45.7 percent of the national
guidelines’ information on malaria compared with 17.7 percent in hospitals (p<0.01). More broadly,
the pattern of diagnosis of the various tracers is consistent with the desired one in a health system:
the most prevalent and simple conditions are treated at the bottom of the health pyramid, while more
complicated ones are treated at a higher level, with the caveat that that the diagnostic rates for
diarrhea with severe dehydration (3.0 percent) and malaria with anemia (5.2 percent) are very low.




5 In order, pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia are the simulations with the highest diagnostic accuracy rates for nurses.




                                                                                                                        27
E. Adherence to clinical guidelines

  Methodological note

  The assessment of process quality is based on two indicators: (i) clinicians’ adherence to clinical guidelines
  in five tracer conditions and (ii) clinicians’ management of maternal and neonatal complications. The former
  indicator is an unweighted average of the share of relevant history-taking questions, and the share of
  relevant examinations performed for the five tracer conditions. The set of questions is restricted to core or
  important questions as expressed in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI).

  The second process quality indicator is clinicians’ ability to manage maternal and neonatal complications,
  i.e. post-partum haemorrhage and neonatal asphyxia. This indicator reflects the unweighted share of
  relevant treatment actions proposed by the clinician. The set of questions is restricted to core or important
  questions as expressed in the IMCI and Niger’s Standard Treatment Guidelines for the tracer conditions.



Adherence to guidelines was positively correlated with levels of training: doctors do better than
medical assistants who in turn perform better than nurses (see Table 41 in Annex C). Among nurses,
there is generally no statistically-significant difference between the two types most found in the data,
the “Infirmier Diplômé d’Etat” and the “Infirmier certifié” even though the former complete three
years of secondary and three years of training while the latter complete primary then have two years
of training. The disease-specific results are shown in Table 43 and Table 44 in Annex C. 6

Figure 7 shows an example of results for one of five cases that was used to construct the adherence
to clinical guidelines indicator. Among the key signs to check according to the Guidelines for
Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses are the four shown in the figure. The diagram shows
that none of these signs are checked by more than half of the providers. The skinfold pinch is done
by 48 percent, whether or not the child is lethargic or unconscious is asked by 27%, and while less
than 10 percent offer water to drink (7 percent) or ask if the child is agitated or irritable (3 percent).
The diagnostic performance is, therefore, not surprising in light of the relatively low adherence to
the guidelines. In the case of dehydration, the evaluation of severity requires multiple positive
answers, which are not possible if providers rarely ask more than one question. Among the questions
that identify severity, two percent of providers asked about the skinfold test, the agitation or
irritability, and lethargy.




6 The survey showed that 52 percent of facilities had treatment guidelines with urban public facilities 1.65 as likely to have

them as rural public facilities (p<0.05) with a global average publication date of 2009.


                                                                                                                                           28
Figure 7. Adherence to clinical guidelines for diarrhea with severe dehydration




 Data presented are for those providers who correctly identified the clinical case, diarrhea with severe dehydration. The percentage
 after a question indicates the rate at which it was asked (e.g. 3 percent for “agitated and irritable?”). The percentages in the circles are
 the percentage of providers who asked two or more questions (e.g. zero percent offered a performed a skinfold test and checked if the
 child was agitated or irritable).



Figure 7 highlights those who succeeded. Since the child presented with diarrhea, the challenge was
the dehydration. The key questions in Panel A of Table 14, show that providers often failed to ask all
the key questions and then to interpret the responses. Nearly half of the providers asked for the
results of the skinfold test (“asked” column), but far fewer asked about sunken eyes (33 percent) or
if the child could drink when offered water (6.7 percent). However, two severity signs (identified
with an “(S)” in the table) are required to classify the child as severely dehydrated according to the
IMCI guidelines. Providers did better when asking at least two of the questions than when they did
not ask them, although the overall rates remain low.

Comparing pneumonia and diarrhea shows how the key questions can help. Severity questions were
asked more often and better-used as there were statistically-significant differences in interpretation
of the information relative to those who did not ask the questions. Nurses were the largest
beneficiaries of asking the right questions. Corroborating what appears in panel B of the table, those
who asked more of the key severity questions were more likely to correctly diagnose the pneumonia
case.

Similar analyses were done in Togo for diarrhea and show different results (Table 15). Providers
were generally both more likely to ask important questions and to produce the correct diagnosis once
they received the information. The severity questions are particularly important and providers were
generally better-able to use that information. Providers were also far more likely to ask all four
severity questions, although only half of the providers who asked all four questions reached the
correct diagnosis, which is troubling for Niger.

The link between guidelines and diagnosis is generally positive. However, the questions, physical
examinations, and lab work ordered by providers varies across the different simulations. Providers
generally ask questions about diarrhea, diabetes mellitus, and tuberculosis. However, where they do
quite well in using the tuberculosis information to diagnose the case, they do quite poorly on
diarrhea, missing the severity of the dehydration. Providers do not ask many questions about
pneumonia nor malaria. Although 92 percent of the evaluated providers test for malaria (either
microscopy or rapid diagnostic test), only 87.5 percent of those who test treat with antimalarial drugs
and 4.5 percent of those who do not test still provide antimalarial drugs. Providers generally diagnose
better when they follow the guidelines, but research in other countries suggests that they may find
adhering to guidelines to be tedious. 7 Given the caseload rates observed in Niger from the HMIS
reports, this should not be a major hindrance. Rather, as shown in Table 14, a significant proportion
of the providers seem to neither ask the key questions nor to correctly interpret the answers they
receive for a number of cases.

Problems linked to key questions are also addressed Figure 9 and Figure 10 in Annex C; roughly 10
percent of providers most of the key questions in the five tracer conditions. However, this is
counterbalanced by the finding that 71.8 percent of providers do not ask half of the key guideline
questions in any of the tracers and that 85.4 percent of providers do not ask three-quarters of the
key guideline questions in any of the tracer cases. Figure 8 explores this further in the context of
malaria with anemia through details related to the key questions, physical, and laboratory elements.
Among the questions which identify danger signs and rule out other pathologies, 40 percent of
clinicians look at three items or less, over 70 percent ask no more than four questions, and
approximately none ask more than eight questions. The distribution of questions in the lower panel
shows that roughly one in five clinicians asks about pallor (palmar, nail bed, or conjunctiva), which
makes it difficult to identify anemia and results in the observed diagnostic success rates. Even when
they ask about the pallor, only 21.4 percent of providers correctly diagnose the case (compared to
1.1 percent otherwise; p<0.01).

After the diagnosis, there are concerns with care, as shown in Table 16, which shows the
prescriptions delivered by the clinicians who correctly identified the case as a simple malaria with
anemia. Proceeding as they normally would in their work environment, only 49.6 percent of
providers gave a prescription for artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem; for malaria) and 59.5 percent
gave a prescription for a source of iron (iron or iron and folic acid; for anemia). Interestingly, although
all providers claim that they would prescribe antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine if they had it
(best-case prescription column), fully 43.2 percent of providers did not prescribe it when it was in
stock. Iron prescriptions follow a similar trend with 100 percent saying they would prescribe, but
39.9 percent not prescribing despite having at least one non-expired dose observed in the pharmacy
Since the sample is limited to those who correctly diagnosed the pathology, it suggests that adherence
to guidelines is insufficient.

Note: pharmacy availability means that there is at least one non-expired dose that is seen by the survey team in the
pharmacy. Deworming is specified as either Albendazole or Mebendazole in the questionnaire, so the prescription
information is repeated for each drug. The best-case for prescription is if providers had access to anything they might need.
In the sample, 34 clinicians correctly diagnosed the case. The significance levels are *** (p<0.01), ** (p<0.05), and * (p<0.1);
estimates and standard errors are weighted to account for the complex survey design.


F. Management of life-threatening maternal and neonatal complications
The second process quality indicator is clinicians’ ability to manage maternal and neonatal
complications (Table 17). This indicator reflects the unweighted share of relevant treatment actions
proposed by the clinician. Except for medical officers in rural public facilities, provider adherence to
guidelines is always lower than those of the tracer conditions. Midwives, who are specialized in
family planning and obstetric-related care, almost always perform at the level of doctors or better.
The only exception is examinations in the case of neonatal asphyxia, however midwives’ diagnostic
rate (91.4 percent) is 10.9 percentage points higher than doctors (closest second, p<0.05) and
generally more than 20 percentage points better than other provider categories. Although adherence
is generally low by facility type, it is 27.6 percent lower in health posts than in hospitals (p<0.01) as
shown in Table 46.

    Notes: there are 35 doctors in the sample, so a disaggregation is not meaningful. For purposes of comparison with other countries,
    a “technicien supérieur” is treated as a medical assistant. Comparisons within facility type are relative to public and rural public;
    comparisons across facility types are relative to hospitals. Levels of significance: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.


Looking at the breakdowns of the two cases (Table 45), there are high diagnostic rates and yet low
treatment levels. For immediate post-partum hemorrhage (IPPH), public providers diagnose 70
percent better (p<0.01), but treat worse that private providers. Among public providers, urban
providers perform 3.7 times as many tests (p<0.01), but do not diagnose as well, and treat 28.7
percent worse (p<0.01). Among facility types for IPPH (Table 45), health posts 62.5 percent worse
on key physical examinations for (p<0.01) and 92.2 percent worse on key tests (p<0.01) than
hospitals, but provide 47.9 percent more treatment, as measured by actions, than hospitals (p<0.01).
Health centers also do worse than hospitals on key tests (72.6 percent; p<0.01), but diagnose nearly
25 percent better (p<0.05) and provide 57 percent more treatment, as measured by actions (p<0.01).


                                                                                                                                            33
This result on the different rate of laboratory tests is interesting in that urban providers are more
likely to request them, but do not treat better overall. The survey did not include questions relative
to the equipment that was available to evaluate blood compatibility or hemoglobin levels, so the
hypothesis that equipment is a limiting factor must be addressed by taking advantage of the
questions asked of the providers once they had finished treating the case as they would normally do
in their facility. The following paragraph describes how this was done.

During the survey, providers were first asked to treat as they normally would in their facility.
Thereafter, the interview team asked them what else they might do if they had all necessary
resources. All those who either indicated the use of equipment or medications in their current
environment or still did not indicate the use of equipment or medications are grouped as “no”. Those
who added items are coded as “yes”. This allows an analysis of constraints to provider competence
from equipment, which differs from the rest of the analysis that focuses on the current context.

In this context, Table 18 summarizes what providers said they would have done had they the
necessary resources for the two laboratory examinations that were necessary for the post-partum
hemorrhage case. Overall, 2.5 percent of providers would have drawn blood for typing and
compatibility analysis and 9.4 percent would have done the hemoglobin levels. The differences are
primarily between public and private facilities, because private facilities do not ask for what they do
not use in their current practice.

In the case of neonatal asphyxia, management is generally worse than of IPPH. Public providers do
diagnose better (p<0.10), but are otherwise statistically indistinguishable from private providers.
Among public providers, the only difference is that rural providers perform 1.6 times as many
examinations as their urban counterparts (p<0.10), but the public rural providers, on average,
slightly less than one-half of one treatment action. This is still insufficient. The presence or absence
of equipment to unblock the upper respiratory passages or of a bag and mask do not seem to be a
factor, as very few providers say they would use them if they had access to all necessary equipment.

G. Special topics: first ante-natal care visit and severe pre-eclampsia
At the request of the Ministry of Health, two modules were developed specifically for Niger with the
participation of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Ariadne Labs. These vignettes were further
refined during the pilot testing phases to reflect the guidelines for Niger and were subsequently used
in the survey. The choice of vignettes was guided by the very high total fertility rate in Niger (7.6
births per woman) and an assisted birth rate of 83 percent. 8 Information is provided below about
each vignette. Broad results by region are presented in Table 47.


First ante-natal care visit
This vignette simulated the initial visit by a woman who was pregnant for the first time. Providers
had to undertake the necessary screening and evaluation steps, diagnose a pregnancy complicated
by moderate anemia, and estimate the gestational age. The questionnaire was based the revised ANC
protocol developed based on the latest WHO guidance. Given the number of elements, an aggregate
presentation is made in Table 19. Public providers do better (p<0.05) than private providers for
danger signs, key questions, physical examinations, and care. However, public providers are more
likely to diagnose a pregnancy without anemia than private providers (p<0.10 individually for all
three). From a regional perspective (Table 47 in Annex C), there is no statistically-significant
variation in the correct diagnosis. However, providers in Tahoua are 9.5 percentage points more
likely than those in Niamey to identify only the pregnancy (p<0.05).

Anemia, whether combined with pregnancy or not, was diagnosed only by 0.9 percent of providers
(0.8 percent of which diagnosed pregnancy with anemia). There was no statistically-significant
variation among provider types. As highlighted elsewhere in this report, part of the problem may
stem from providers’ approach to care: both palmar pallor (14 percent of providers) and hemoglobin
examinations (4.8 percent constrained, 6.5 percent unconstrained) were not frequently requested,
so it would have been hard to detect anemia. However, 15 percent of providers gave the patient a
prescription for a three-month supply of iron and folic acid. Providers who tested for anemia,
regardless of method and regardless of whether in the current or ideal situation, were more likely to
prescribe folic acid regardless of situation (p<0.01).

Severe pre-eclampsia
This vignette simulated the visit by a woman in the final weeks of pregnancy with signs of
hypertension. Providers were expected to recognize the urgency of the condition, to provide
immediate care and referral if they could not manage the case in their facility. Given the number of
elements, an aggregate presentation is made in Table 20. Public providers do better than private
providers for physical and clinical examinations, and care (all p<0.01). Among public providers,
urban ones do better than their rural counterparts on physical and clinical examinations, and
diagnoses in general (p<0.01 for all). Overall, the recognition of the problem remains low. As Table
47 in Annex C shows, providers in other regions do worse than Niamey. For example, the rate of
correct diagnosis is 14.8 percent in Maradi (p<0.10), 6.4 percent in Tahoua (p<0.01), and 11.6
percent in Zinder (p<0.05). Overall, the recognition of pre-eclampsia without consideration of the
severity, is still significantly different from Niamey in Maradi (42.3 percent; p<0.01), Tahoua (44.9
percent; p<0.10), and Zinder (45.8 percent; p<0.01).

H. Drug availability

 Methodological note

 This indicator is defined as the number of drugs of which a facility has one or more available, as a proportion
 of all the drugs on the list. The drugs have to be unexpired and observed by the enumerator. The drug list
 contains tracer medicines for children and mothers identified by the World Health Organization (WHO)
 following a global consultation on facility-based surveys (Table 50). Error! Reference source not found.


On average, health facilities in Niger had 50.4 percent of tracer drugs available (Table 21). Rural
public facilities have 22 percent less WHO tracer drugs available (p<0.05) than urban public facilities,
which is driven by the different for health centers (17 percent, p<0.05). Health posts have 41.7% less
drug availability (p<0.01) than first-level hospitals, but health centers and hospitals have the same
availability statistically-speaking. When looking at specific beneficiary populations, there are more
drugs for mothers (19.7 percent; p<0.05) and children (19.3 percent; p<0.05) in urban public than in
rural public facilities. However, there is no significant difference among public and private facilities.

Availability of vaccines is presented in Annex C, in Table 53, Table 54, and Table 55. Generally, vaccine
availability, estimated at 44.6 percent nationally, is hindered by the lack of PCV10 and tuberculosis
(BCG) vaccines, which are available in 54.6 and 72.4 percent of facilities, respectively. Gaps are felt
in PCV10 across rural and urban public facilities (49.1 percent more in rural; p<0.05) and across
facility levels, with the health posts generally having fewer vaccines than the health centers and
hospitals.

The Ministry of Health monitors a set of drugs by level, some of which are available in the SDI dataset.
At the health post, the drugs were artemisinin-based combination therapy, paracetamol, ORS in
sachets (not tracked in the survey; N/A), Cotrimoxazole tablets, amoxicillin, and chlortetracycline
(N/A). At the health center, the drugs were artemisinin-based combination therapy, quinine salts
(N/A), Cotrimoxazole tablets, paracetamol, injectable Diazepam, ORS in sachets (N/A), oxytocin, and
injectable ampicillin. At the hospital level, the drugs were injectable ampicillin, Ringer’s solution
(N/A), pethidine chlorhydrate (N/A), salbutamol, HIV test reagents (N/A), and 10% glucose serum
(N/A). The results are in Table 22 and are lower than the rates for the fourth quarter of 2015, which
had availability at 97.69 percent for health posts, 97.32 percent for health centers, and 98.01 percent
for district hospitals. 9

I. Equipment availability


 Methodological note

 The equipment indicator focuses on the availability (observed and functioning by the enumerator) of
 minimum equipment expected at a facility. The pieces of equipment expected in all facilities are a weighing
 scale (adult, child, or infant), a stethoscope, a sphygmomanometer, and a thermometer. In addition, it is
 expected that the following pieces of equipment be available at health centers and hospitals: sterilizing
 equipment and a refrigerator. Table 56 shows the availability of each of these types of equipment.


Table 23 presents availability of minimum equipment adjusted by level of facility, and Table 58 shows
the availability of each of these items of equipment across public and private and rural and urban
while Table 59 shows equipment availability by region. Nationally, equipment was available at
percent of facilities. Hospitals have more than other facility types, whether it be health posts (36,8
percent; p<0.01) or health centers (34,2 percent; p<0.01).

Notes: there are no hospitals in rural locations. Comparisons within facility type are relative to public and rural public; comparisons
across facility types are relative to hospitals. Levels of significance: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.


Even without considering refrigerators or sterilizing equipment, there are gaps in the availability of
basic items such as a scale (81 percent of facilities; 74 percent of health posts), sphygmomanometers
(58 percent of facilities, 44.1 percent of health posts, 83.2 percent of health centers), and
stethoscopes (69 percent of facilities, 56.4 percent of health posts, 92 percent of health centers). Only
thermometers (91.7 percent of facilities, 89.1 percent of health posts, 96.5 percent of health centers)
are in relatively high supply.

Comparisons across public and private and within public suggest that there is an urban bias. The
major public-private distinction is in sterilizing equipment; private facilities are nearly four times as
likely to have sterilizing equipment (p<0.01). When looking within public facilities, urban ones are
1.9 times as likely to have a scale (p<0.01), 1.6 times as likely to have a sphygmomanometer (p<0.01),
and 1.4 times as likely to have a stethoscope (p<0.01). However, among health centers, urban
facilities are less likely to have a refrigerator (0.7 times; p<0.05) and 2.2 times more likely to have a
sterilization device (p<0.01).

J. Infrastructure availability


 Methodological note

 The infrastructure indicator captures the availability of three inputs: water, sanitation, and electricity. The
 indicator is an unweighted average of these three components. Eligible sources are:

 Electricity sources: Electric power grid, a fuel-operated generator, a battery-operated generator or a solar-
 powered system as their main source of electricity.
 Water sources: Piped into the facility, piped onto facility grounds or comes from a public tap/standpipe,
 tube well/borehole, a protected dug well, a protected spring, bottled water or a tanker truck.
 Sanitation sources: Functioning flush toilet, ventilated and improved pit (VIP) latrine, or covered pit latrine
 (with slab).


Table 24 shows that on average, 13.3 percent of facilities had all three infrastructure items
(electricity, water, and sanitation). There are disparities across public-private and rural-urban
breakdowns. Private facilities are 3.8 times as likely to have the three elements (p<0.10), which is
because 2.5 percent of health posts have the three items. Among health centers, where the
comparison is most direct, all private facilities have electricity, while 56.7 percent of public ones have
it (p<0.01). Among public facilities, urban ones have far more infrastructure than rural ones
(p<0.01), even among health centers. Public health centers are approximately 82 percent more likely
to have electricity (p<0.01) and 22.5 percent more likely to have clean water (p<0.10) than their rural
comparators. Comparing across facility levels, the gap is evident (p<0.01 for comparisons with the
hospital).

Communications elements also matter in the health system. The survey assessed phone, computer,
and internet access. Phones were defined to be landlines or cell phones, broken down into three
categories: those owned and whose communication was financed by the facility, those privately
owned but whose communication was financed by the facility, and those privately owned whose
communication was not financed by the facility. Computers belonged to the facility or to individuals.
Internet access was not broken down by source of financing.

Almost all facilities had a phone available (95.2 percent) and that was functional (93.0 percent), with
no significant differences across public and private facilities or public facilities in rural and urban.
There were differences in availability of functional phones by level: 94 percent of health posts had a
functional phone (p<0.05), 90.9 percent of health centers (p<0.05), and 100 percent of hospitals had
one. Private facilities were 13 times more likely (30.8 percent; p<0.01) to provide phone credit to a
private phone but 2.5 times less likely to have a cellular phone owned by the facility (p<0.05). The
same tendencies applied for functional cellular phones.


                                                                                                                                     39
Computers were generally not available, with 16.9 percent of facilities reporting a computer and 15.3
percent reporting a functional computer. There were no significant differences among public and
private facilities in the availability of computers in general, although facility-owned computers were
10.3 times as likely to be functional in private facilities (p<0.10). Across facility levels, the patterns
are consistent for presence or functionality: 4.9 percent of health posts (p<0.01), 32.1 percent of
health centers (p<0.01) and 98.4 percent of hospitals, respectively, had functional computers.

Internet access was generally unavailable (4.3 percent) and non-functional when available (2.6
percent). There is no significant difference in functional internet across public and private facilities.
Public urban facilities (20.8 percent) were 20 times as likely to have functional internet as rural
public facilities (p<0.01). Functioning internet access varied strongly by facility level: 0 percent of
health posts (p<0.01), 4.0 percent of health centers (p<0.01), and 95 percent of hospitals,
respectively, had such service.


K. Incentives, leadership, and management
The Niger SDI survey tested a module on incentives, leadership, and management. The goal of the
module was to provide additional information on observed service delivery strengths and
weaknesses in the facilities. Work in Mozambique showed that directors’ knowledge of teacher
absenteeism seemed unrelated to what was observed in practice. However, work in a number of SDI
surveys showed that the most significant correlate of absenteeism, whether correlation or size, was
the absence of the head of the school or health facility. Therefore, this module was designed to gain
additional knowledge on the interplay of the formal institutional rules and the realities of the service
delivery units.


Leadership, management, and incentives
Heads of facilities were asked, among other topics, about their major constraints, the incentive tools
they have, and their experience in the sector. There are some differences across levels and ownership
structures. Globally, the most important constraint is drug availability, which is consistent with the
finding that facilities have 50.4 percent of drugs expected at their level. However, private facilities
cite medical equipment (nearly three times more; p<0.05) and, surprisingly, autonomy (35 times
more; p<0.05) as their primary constraints. Among public facilities, rural has greater constraints
from drugs (68 percent; p<0.05) and infrastructure (71.3 percent; p<0.05), while urban cites cost
recovery (123.7 percent more; p<0.1) as its primary constraint. As the section on Community
engagement below shows, the most-covered topics in the last health facility committee meeting is
the availability of drugs (82.5 percent of respondents), then infrastructure (56.6 percent) and free
health care (gratuité; 50.8 percent).

      comparisons across facility types are relative to hospitals. Levels of significance: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Another aspect of leadership is knowing the available incentives and using them. Managers were
asked about a set of standard incentives, both positive and negative. 10 Table 26 compares use of
incentives in the health centers, because these are both public and private. The knowledge and use
of incentives varies significantly across public and private. Unsurprisingly, private sector facilities
think of promotion (p<0.01) and use it (p<0.05), but they also are more likely to cite verbal warnings
(p<0.05) than their public counterparts. More broadly, private facility heads are more than twice as
likely to cite (p<0.05) or use (p<0.01) positive incentives and 3.8 times as likely to cite negative
incentives (p<0.05).

Finally, experience is often considered important. Nationally, heads of facilities have 9.5 years of
experience in health and 7.5 years as heads of facilities. Private heads have declared 80 percent more
experience than public ones (p<0.10) and urban public heads have 74 percent more experience than
rural ones (p<0.01). Among heads of public facilities, this is also driven by facility level: heads of
health posts average 8.2 years of experience (p<0.01), heads of health centers average 11.7 years,
and heads of hospitals average 13.4 years.




  Positive incentives were promotion or raise, written congratulations from outside leaders (e.g. provincial head), formal
10.

congratulations (e.g. at an annual meeting), and verbal encouragement. Negative incentives were dismissal, suspension,
written warning, and verbal warning.

Supervision
Supportive supervision is an important element of a well-functioning health care system. This
module focused on certain aspects of supervision, particularly the frequency, the type of supervision,
the team composition, what the supervision team examined, and what feedback they provided.

As shown in Table 27, providers receive slightly more than one visit per quarter, generally by two
team members, although urban public facilities have three-person teams on average compared to
two-person teams for rural public facilities (p<0.01). Interestingly, use of supervision worksheets
seems to be concentrated among private rather than public facilities (62.6 percent more prevalent;
p<0.01) and urban within public (40.2 percent more prevalent; p<0.05).

Three kinds of supervision were identified: by the district health team (DHT), by disease focal points
(DFP), and other. Table 28 shows some key facts about these visits. Disease focal points were most
likely to use supervision tools (p<0.05), to review staff presence (p<0.01), and to examine medical
stocks (p<0.01), but not more likely to leave written comments. The “other” supervisions were least
likely to leave written comments (45.4 percent less likely than the DHT; p<0.01). The general focus
on medical stocks is reflected in the written comments left as they were commented upon in 70.3
percent of facilities. Differentiation by supervision is visible; HMIS reporting is not a focus of disease
focal points (p<0.1), perhaps because they maintain parallel systems? Quality of care was always a
focus in hospitals, a focus in health centers 54.8 percent of the time (p<0.01) and a focus in health
posts 18.6 percent of the time (p<0.01). Private facilities (87.4 percent) were 2.3 times more likely
to show quality of care as a concern than public facilities (38 percent; p<0.01). The same patterns
and statistical significance by facility type and across public and private were observed for the
performance of providers and of the facility manager. To increase performance, there must be
feedback; although there is little variation across supervision types, the disease focal points were
most likely to provide comments or suggestions (p<0.05) and to share their comments with the staff.

Community engagement
Facilities exist to serve patients, who are generally organized in communities. Part of the governance
mechanism of the health sector is the engagement of the health facilities with their communities
through various planning and oversight bodies. Table 29 presents some key metrics of community
engagement and oversight. There is a striking change in COGES organization in the private sector
between 2014 and 2015, going from less than seven percent to 100 percent in one year, while the
public sector also reached nearly 100 percent, but from a far higher base. The duration since the last
COGES meeting in 2015 is at variance with the announced 2014 meeting numbers, unless they are
not distributed uniformly in the year. Rural public facilities are more than twice as likely as urban
public facilities (p<0.05) to not have minutes of the last meeting. On average, one public facility in
two informs its community about its finances, one in eight seeks community feedback (more than
three times as frequent in urban relative to rural areas; p<0.05), and roughly one in fifty made
changes in 2014 based upon user feedback (among those that had solicited feedback). When
comparing among health centers, which are both public and private, the duration since the last
COGES meeting worsens (210.6 days for public, 216.5 in rural public, and 174.6 in urban public).
Private facilities have larger average COGES sizes (6.5 vs. 4.4; p<0.05) and are more likely to have a
COSAN (2.0 percent vs. 1.2 percent; p<0.01), with meetings every trimester in both cases.

Mortality for neonates (27 percent over 2006-12), infants (60 percent over 1998-2012), and mothers
(14.5 percent over 2006-2012; 21 percent over 1990-2010) declined significantly, mortality rates
remain high and Niger’s maternal mortality (554/100,000 live births) exceeded that of most West
African Economic and Monetary Union states in 2010. The sharp declines in neonatal and infant
mortality raised Niger’s life expectancy at birth from 37 years (1960) to 58.4 years (2010), slightly
above the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 54 years and nearly at the low-income average of 59 years.

This is undertaken in a context of variable resources. The Creditor Reporting System of the
OECD/DAC allows the disaggregation of funds by sector. 11 External financing expanded from a low
base (below 10 percent of total net flows in 2001-5), but had consecutive years above 10 percent
only in 2013 and 2014. Health has faced higher net aid volatility (standard deviation is 120 percent
of the median) than all sectors (32 percent of the median). According to the annual health system
reports, presented in Table 30, government has executed relatively well on all categories of
expenditure except investment, which forces the ministry to rely more on volatile resources from
partners. This is corroborated by the publicly-available BOOST data, which show that the Ministry
of Health ranks in the middle of the execution table for public investment (ranging from 14th in 2010
to 37th in 2014), functional expenses (seventh in 2014, 40th in 2013), and transfers (11th in 2012, 28th
in 2014).

Provision of care is hindered by a very high centration of doctors (1 per 5,642 people) and nurses (1
IDE per 1,789 people) in Niamey to the detriment of highly-populated areas such as Zinder, Maradi,
Tahoua, and Tillabéri which have between eight and12 times less doctors per capita and roughly 3.6
times less IDE per capita than Niamey. The skill imbalances are one problem, as is the overall level
of ability to properly handle the various cases remains a concern. In addition, the gap between those
formally trained and trained on the job, particularly for adult care, is a further cause for concern. The
overall level of skills in the management of maternal and neonatal complications is in line with the
burden of mortality (535 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies; DHS 2012). Niger’s performance in
diagnostic accuracy, adherence to guidelines, and the management of maternal and child health
complications places it near the bottom of the table for SDI countries.

Human resource availability is a challenge, with a 33 percent national absence rate. This is 2.23 times
higher than in primary education, where teachers are absent from school 14.8 percent of the time
using the same methodology.



11   According to the same source, primary education received three times less funding.


                                                                                                       46
Input availability is relatively low for infrastructure and equipment. This may, in part reflect resource
execution variability which ranges from 28 to 90 percent in the 2003-2014 period. Regardless of the
cause, the lack of basic inputs, such as refrigerators and sterilization equipment, and the lack of
electricity (may also cause refrigerators to not function) make it difficult for health personnel to
provide appropriate care.

The situation in Niger is generally worse than in other countries that have done SDI as is shown in
Table 31. Niger ranks in the top half of the table for caseload (third) and drug availability (fourth).
Niger ranks seventh for equipment availability, eighth for diagnostic accuracy and management of
maternal and neonatal complications, and ninth (last) for adherence to clinical guidelines and
infrastructure availability. While there are concerns across the board, drug availability, which is such
a concern for providers and communities is apparently relatively well-handled in Niger. There is
perhaps more to be done in other areas such as adherence to guidelines, diagnostics, and provider
absence.

ANNEX A. SAMPLING STRATEGY
The sample frame was constituted from administrative data (health management information
system; two sources) and survey data (Service Availability and Readiness Assessment sample frame)
on facilities provided by the Ministry of Health and census data provided by the National Statistical
Institute (Institut National de la Statistique; INS). The team de-duplicated facilities in the
administrative data and worked to properly identify their locations within administrative
boundaries to define the sample frame.

The sample frame is the set of health posts, health centers, and hospitals that could be geographically
identified, that met certain comparability and inclusion criteria set with the Ministry of Health, and
that were in areas that were feasible. For reasons of comparability the ministry excluded all private
facilities that offered surgery and all hospitals that were not normal district hospitals. The feasibility
constraints excluded the region of Diffa, where the government had declared a state of emergency,
and Tassara, Tesker, and Tillia (security) and Bilma (geographic isolation).

The sample frame was stratified along rural/urban (per the INS definitions), ownership
(public/private), and facility type (Health post/Health center/District hospital) to maximize
intragroup homogeneity. The sample was designed based upon the request of the ministry to include
health posts, which represent the overwhelming majority of health facilities, and the need to have
sufficient sample sizes for health centers and hospitals. Selection was done with probability
proportional to the population served by the facilities.

For indicators related to individuals, two further samples were independently drawn among
providers. The overall weight of these indicators, defined below, is the product of the facility weight
and the individual weight for the concept (absence rate or knowledge).

For absence rate, a secondary sampling frame of all health providers who work at the facility is
prepared (Module 2A). The methodology requires 10 providers, or all those in the facility if it has less
than 10 providers. If a facility has more than 10 providers, a random selection without replacement
is undertaken where each provider has equal probability of being selected. In addition, the head of
the facility was always selected for absence monitoring. This gives the inflation factor, or weight, for
provider absence rate, defined as the product of the probability of selecting the facility and the
probability of selecting a given provider in the facility.

For knowledge, the secondary sampling frame of all health providers who work at the facility is used
in conjunction with information on whether the provider is the lead caregiver for an outpatient
consultation at least once per week (Module 2A). The methodology requires 10 providers, or all those
in the facility if it has less than 10 providers. If a facility has more than 10 providers, a random
selection without replacement is undertaken where each provider has equal probability of being
selected. This gives the inflation factor, or weight, for provider knowledge, defined as the product of
the probability of selecting the facility and the probability of selecting a given provider in the facility.




                                                                                                         49
Once Module 3 had been entered and passed clean, a medical doctor with knowledge of the SDI
instruments and experience in training and supervising SDI field staff reviewed all the cases to ensure
that the information on diagnostic accuracy was not compromised by incorrect recording. A decision
was made based upon the comments recorded and the treatment ordered. For example, a provider
who failed to cite diarrhea with severe dehydration but implemented the appropriate treatment plan
was judged to have correctly diagnosed the case. If anything, this will have biased upwards the
diagnostic accuracy rate of providers in Niger.
