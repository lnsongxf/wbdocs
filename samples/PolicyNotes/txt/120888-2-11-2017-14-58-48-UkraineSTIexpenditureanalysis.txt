Executive Summary

This report is one of several analytical pieces developed by the World Bank’s Ukraine Technical Assistance
on Innovation Support project, supported by the Swedish Ukraine Financial and Enterprise Sector
Recovery and Growth Trust Fund. This report attempts to evaluate the quality mix of public support
programs for science, technology, and innovation (STI) and provide recommendations for the
improvement of the support programs’ effectiveness. The three supporting analytical pieces performed
by the Ukraine Innovation Support project team are as follows:

    •    Ukraine Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Diagnostic, which attempts to (a) identify
         the gaps that impede enterprise innovation in Ukraine and (b) develop recommendations for
         policy reforms and support instruments

    •    Fiscal Incentives for Science, Technology, and Innovation Best Practice Review, which reviews
         different international good practices in introducing fiscal incentives for supporting STI and
         provides policy recommendations relevant to the implementation of such incentives in Ukraine

    •    Ukraine Intellectual Property and Technology Transfer Regulatory Review, which attempts to
         identify regulatory and framework impediments for the commercialization of publicly funded
         research and recommends reforms and policies that could improve the framework conditions for
         intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer (TT)

The Ukrainian economy has been facing significant challenges in recent years. The volatile macroeconomic
environment has translated into a significant deterioration of living standards and a major need to seek
new sources of growth in the economy. The private sector, however, remains locked into a low-
productivity/low-diversification regime, partly explained by existing distortions in the economy and by a
lack of innovation investments in the economy.

Against this background, the World Bank team was requested to evaluate the quality and composition of
public investments in science, technology, and innovation (STI) in the context of an important process of
fiscal consolidation that resulted in a reduction in public expenditure on STI. The evaluation aims to
determine the coherence in the allocation of innovation expenditure in addressing the main innovation
challenges in the country, as well as the main gaps and redundancies. The objective of the review is to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of STI public expenditure and maximize impact.

The methodology used builds upon the Public Expenditure Reviews (PER) for STI (Correa 2014) 1 and
compares the demand for innovation policies arising from an innovation ecosystem diagnostic with the
actual expenditure on STI. Several challenges arose while implementing the methodology. First, given the
lack of budget programming, STI expenditure sourced from the BOOST database only approximates actual
expenditure due to the lack of budget codes for all STI-related expenditure. Second, the fact that most
expenditure is disbursed as block funding reduced the granularity of the analysis. Finally, an additional
limitation of the analysis was the lack of access to existing programs to evaluate the quality of design,
implementation, and coordination of policies. Despite these caveats, the analysis uncovered significant
gaps related to STI policies and revealed general trends in STI expenditure.

 General Findings
Despite the difficult fiscal position, the Government of Ukraine has recently renewed its commitment
to STI policies and launched two strategies that target innovation in the Ministry of Economic
Development and Trade (MEDT) and the Ministry of Education and Science (MESU). These are important
and necessary efforts to improve the governance of the National Innovation System (NIS). However, the
NIS remains fragmented and with little alignment across strategies.

Ukraine’s innovation underperformance is reducing economic competitiveness and compromising
growth in firm productivity. Lagging innovation signals are consistent with low research and development
(R&D) commercialization and the overall decrease in the number of national patent applications in recent
years. In addition, the decreasing economic share of technology-intensive sectors and the low incidence
of successful start-ups compared to the Western European average provide additional indication that
conditions for innovation are not fertile.

The existing innovation policy mix and relevant public funding do not respond to the critical needs of
the Ukrainian NIS. The STI expenditure allocation and innovation policy instruments available are
misaligned with the challenges observed and are ill-suited to foster innovation and competitiveness in the
private sector. The gap is not limited to more radical types of innovation or R&D-intensive firms, but it
also includes imitation and technology adoption among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Existing
expenditure on STI has decreased in recent years primarily at the expense of support to business
innovation. Existing funding concentrates almost entirely on the national academies in the form of block
funding and with little competitive grants. In addition, while public expenditure on STI remains low and
has been decreasing in relative terms in recent years, there are significant concerns related to the
governance of these funds and the relevant policy implementation.

Difficult framework conditions represent a significant constraint to innovation and competitiveness.
Conflict and macroeconomic volatility have imposed significant uncertainty for long-term investments in
innovative activities. In addition, bribes and corruption are known to increase the cost of doing business,
affecting potential collaboration partnerships and innovation financing. Distortions in the economy are
known to divert resources from the most productive firms, constraining their growth (Hsieh and Klenow,
2013)2. Improving these unfavorable framework conditions is a much-needed complementary policy for
supporting the innovation policy. In this context, a pragmatic innovation agenda could be delivered by
creating ‘spaces of novelty’ that could circumvent impeding framework conditions.

Industry-university collaboration is weak and prevents firms from acquiring the latest industrial
advances. Universities perform weak R&D and innovation activities, featuring low positions in
international rankings. The NIS lacks agencies specialized in technology adoption that can drive
commercialization of research. Technology commercialization has been marginalized, at least in terms of
public resource allocation. In terms of knowledge supply, the decline of R&D expenditures is leaving
research infrastructure obsolete. In addition, the drain of leading research skills represents a threat to the
local innovation ecosystem, particularly for the scarcity of specialized skills. Evidence of this is the
decrease in the volume and quality of research output. Moreover, the system of innovation support
infrastructure and intermediaries remains weak, preventing effective coordination between the public
R&D sector and private companies such as technology platforms and clusters. The strong existing capacity
in science and technology, particularly in engineering and research, is not exploited, suggesting a missed

opportunity. Difficulties of innovative companies and SMEs with access to finance are known to be a major
constraint in Ukraine. The undeveloped venture capital (VC) system and lack of financial intermediaries
and suppliers of quality business services make the ecosystem thin and unable to service new ventures.

The current governance arrangements with large transfers of block funding to the national academies
do not provide strong incentives to business innovation. NASU consumes the largest share of state
budget allocated for R&D (53%) followed by other specialized Academies (25%). These funds awarded
through block grants rather than competitive funding prevent efficient allocation of research resource to
innovation or R&D needs. Furthermore, the limited applied research that NASU and the other Academies
conduct for government bodies or corporates is still tied to old areas of economy—former state-owned
companies, defense, and resource industries—rather than emerging areas of economy. Only half of the
around 350 universities perform any kind of R&D and many of these do only limited R&D, with Ukrainian
universities featuring low positions in international rankings. The problems identified pertain to the poor
articulation of priorities aligned with the private sector and the low impact efficiency of state support for
R&D and innovation. Absence of mechanisms to promote competitive allocation of public resources for
innovation support is reducing the effectiveness of public funds.

Finally, the Ukrainian NIS remains deeply fragmented, lacking an effective integration platform that can
articulate a national STI strategy. In the current system, the different ministries work in silos and the
newly developed strategies are unlikely to break this fragmentation, unless efforts are unified under an
innovation policy strategy for the country. The governance in STI is fragmented across several institutions.
The country presents no clear and unified research and innovation strategy but instead has several sector
strategies, lacking coordination, especially between the research policy and business needs for
innovation. The lack of strategic foresight is compounded by excessive fragmentation and paucity of
funds. Therefore, Ukrainian policy makers should consider unifying the national STI policy into one cross-
cutting strategy that spans ministries and innovation-related agencies. Innovation in the business sector
and industry should receive increased focus.

 Recommendations
The report’s recommendations belong to three major categories of measures.

    •   First, Ukrainian policy practitioners should strengthen governance, planning, and learning
        mechanisms for better innovation policy efficiency. Before reallocating existing resources,
        addressing design and implementation capacity of Ukrainian innovation agencies will increase the
        likelihood of deployment of effective instruments. In this regard, practitioners need to introduce
        good and transparent policy practices that create incentives to collaboration and commercial
        research. Instituting competitive selection processes should improve the quality of research,
        turning reviews, evaluations, and revisions into a regular practice to enable agencies to learn
        about what works in policy instruments. Introducing systematic diagnostics, deliberate
        identification of issues, and cost-benefit analyses as de facto measures should improve the design
        of innovation policy interventions.

    •   Second, Ukrainian policy practitioners should shift budget allocation to induce enterprise
        innovation. Public support to the research sector is currently directed to the national academies
        on a minimally competitive basis and with little incentives to generate research that can be
        commercialized and to incentivize collaboration with industry. Reforming the academies with
        focus on introducing transparent and competitive funding should allow for competent knowledge

                                                Page |4
    producers (research institutes and universities) to produce impactful and relevant research
    results. Introduce good and transparent policy practices to maximize impact of STI expenditure
    and enable public expenditure expansion. Additionally, public support for private sector R&D and
    innovation is almost nonexistent. State budget support remains biased toward state-owned
    organizations at the expense of commercial innovation and the competitive allocation of grants
    for research projects. Rebalancing the budget to introduce demand-side measures will provide
    space for a comprehensive and mutually reinforcing set of business support measures that can
    revert the lagging trends of competitiveness in Ukraine. The governance of STI policies and
    institutions suggests large skewing and strong legacy problems in Ukraine. STI remains largely
    dominated by science and research institutions with a strong linear view of innovation, from
    science to innovation. National- and regional-level policies are not aligned either. The regions do
    not have comprehensive governance systems for STI. Only a few regions have created special
    departments responsible for R&D, and there are no data on the performance and effectiveness
    of the regional support policies in this area. A commensurate portion of business support should
    be decentralized and implemented at the regional level once effective governance systems,
    competent teams, and anti-capture provisions are established.

•   Third, Ukrainian policy practitioners should invest resources in instruments that build firm
    capability, induce industry-specific research collaboration for business innovation, and improve
    the enabling environment of innovative firms. A set of measures aiming at increasing the
    absorptive capacity of firms include upgraded management systems, enhanced quality standards,
    expanded staff skills, and the ability of firms to participate in global value chains (GVCs).
    Instruments promoting effective interactions between firms and knowledge providers generally
    and in specific sectors, such as the technology transfer system and strengthened collaboration
    between local and foreign knowledge providers, will support accelerated knowledge diffusion.
    Moreover, measures aimed at improving the entrepreneurial environment, especially through
    venture early-stage support, will increase the formation rates for new ventures and increase
    survival of young enterprises.

Introduction

Ukraine is undergoing a challenging period of macroeconomic volatility that has resulted in severe fiscal
consolidation. Income per capita has decreased to levels of a decade ago and firms are stuck in low
productivity, unable to export to international markets and generate the much-needed high-quality jobs.
Several factors constrain firms’ productivity growth, but critical among them are distortions in the
economy that constrain firm growth and investments in innovation. Addressing these distortions and
increasing innovation activities in the business sector is key for the growth prospects of the country.

The World Bank was tasked with profiling and assessing the composition and the quality of public
investments in science, technology, and innovation (STI) against the background of fiscal consolidation.
Thus, this note evaluates the contribution of STI policies to business innovation by assessing the coherence
between the country’s needs for business innovation policies and the allocation of innovation
expenditure. The analysis considers several factors affecting innovation performance of businesses such
as the local country conditions, external factors, and institutional arrangements. The results from the
demand analysis is measured against the portfolio of policy instruments and current public expenditure
on STI. The analysis yields a review of the strategic context of innovation policies, a comparison of the
country’s National Innovation System (NIS) with peers, a profile of the STI institutional framework, the
existing set of policies and programs, and a description of the program portfolio and policy mix for
business innovation.

The objective of this note is to inform the decisions of policy practitioners embarking on the process of
design and review of innovation policies with the aim of maximizing the effectiveness of innovation
policies. This exercise is an important and necessary step toward building a good set of instruments—the
policy mix that effectively supports business innovation. The Analytical Framework and Approach section
presents the analytical framework employed in this exercise. The Demand for STI Policies section creates
a demand profile for innovation policies considering the evidence of business innovation outcomes, firm
investment patterns, and capability traits, such as skills and assets. The analysis is complemented by an
assessment of the enabling environment, external to the firm, which includes the local framework
conditions and other external factors affecting innovation. The Policy Framework for STI Business
Innovation section describes the current policy framework for business innovation policies. The Resource
Allocation and STI Expenditure section discusses the pattern of allocation of public resources for
innovation. The Internal Consistency and External Coherence Analysis for Policy section presents the
results of the gap analysis between the needs of the country and the supply of innovation policy support,
looking at internal consistency of the policy portfolio and its coherence with the needs for country
support. The last section offers recommendations and suggests various ways to support business
innovation policies in Ukraine.

Analytical Framework and Approach

The proposed framework aims to answer two simple questions: (a) how well is the policy framework for
promoting business innovation addressing market and system failures that constrain knowledge and
innovation activities? and (b) is the allocation of public resources for STI consistent with its policy
priorities? The importance of obtaining answers to these questions is not trivial. Given that public
resources are scarce, policy makers should prioritize addressing those failures that are more critical for
innovation and leverage complementarities across existing innovation policy instruments, making
innovation policy programs increasingly cost-effective.

The country’s needs analysis provides the foundational understanding of the importance of STI policies
for policy practitioners and the characteristics of policy demand. The analysis sheds light on how
consistently the country’s existing policies and programs respond to that demand. The observed gaps will
enable practitioners to identify possible action steps toward bridging them.

The approach for this analysis recognizes that not all the observed parameters remain under the control
of policy makers, and as such, many determinants of demand represent exogenous variables, such as
external competitive pressures and other contextual macroeconomic variables, such as interest rates.
Figure 1 provides an overview of the analytical framework.

This analysis relies on primary and secondary sources of data collection to produce information. The
demand for innovation policy analysis relies on information found in databases that compare countries
and ecosystems at the aggregate, such as the conference board for aggregate productivity metrics or the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) innovation indicators. Trade-related
performance data can be found in the World Bank Development Indicators or United Nations
International Trade Statistics Database (UN COMTRADE). Information regarding local framework
conditions resides usually in country-specialized publications and reports, such as the OECD reviews for
innovation policies, and in country featured monitoring indicators, such as the global entrepreneurship
monitor (GEM) consortium.

The STI expenditure information relies on the unified database of the central government spending that
captures all relevant items for the sector expenditure and the overall budgets of selected entities involved
in the financing of research and development (R&D), innovation, and entrepreneurship development in
Ukraine (see appendix II for a description of the BOOST data set). The Ukraine BOOST database, based on
the Treasury data, is a multidimensional multisectoral fiscal database that covers all national government
expenditures. It can be decomposed by the level of government, budget entities, functional, economic,
and program classification. By design, it also covers all crosscutting fiscal areas such as spending on R&D
available at the program/project level, among others. However, the data set does now allow for a granular
analysis embedded in the large transfers of block funding to the National Academies.

At the core, the framework implies a causal relationship between observed performance variables, such
as firm-level productivity, and the existing policy framework, which includes public investment (or
expenditure) in policies and programs to promote innovation and entrepreneurship. Hence, this
framework relies on both descriptive and causal inference. The degree to which this causal relationship
between the presence of policy instruments and observed outcomes can be established will depend on
the quality of the information available. It is worth noting that demand determinants depend on a variety
of factors, including existing framework conditions, which cannot always be influenced by innovation
policies directly, at least not in the short term. The strength of the case will be established on a qualitative
basis.

The selection of structural and regional peers for the country can be a useful way to conduct the
benchmarking analysis. Structural peers represent countries with similar economic characteristics to the
one being analyzed, and the construct is normally ad hoc but based on important determinants, such as
similarities in the economic composition of production and exports. The selection of regional peers is
usually more straightforward; since these are bound by geography and proximity, understanding these is
a strong determinant for economic performance.

Demand for STI Policies

Overall, the analysis of business innovation outcomes suggests a picture of decreasing productivity among
Ukrainian firms, with a significant loss of competitiveness in recent years. Addressing this lagging
competitiveness should be the paramount objective of STI policies, since innovation is the key element
for productivity growth and diversification of the economy.

 Business Innovation Outcomes
Aggregate levels of competitiveness metrics show consistent symptoms of continuing deterioration of
innovation in Ukraine. Per the Global Competitive Index (GCI), the Ukrainian economy ranked 85th in
2016/17, and its position has been slipping from the 73rd place in 2012/13.

The mediocre ranking seems to be driven by deteriorating quality of institutions, poor infrastructure, a
difficult macroeconomic environment, and lagging quality of primary education, all of which ranked much
worse than the average. It is worth noting that Ukraine is still strong in higher education and skills, putting
the country in the 39th place and revealing an untapped opportunity to capitalize on its human resources.
Ukraine also ranked low in technological readiness, although it improved in the sub-ranking of ‘availability
of latest technologies’ (climbing from 113th to 96th position).

From 2003 to 2013, Ukraine had 1,125 PCT-filed patent applications in the technological sector (less than
the Russian Federation and Turkey). Most PCT-filed applications from Ukraine were made in the
mechanical engineering sector (320 or 28.4 percent of the total national share of PCT-filed applications).
However, Ukrainian firms have very few patents recognized in the European Union (EU) or in the United
States compared to neighboring countries due to weak integration of domestic enterprises in global value
chains (GVCs) and high costs of foreign patenting (this also explains why most PCT-filed applications were

not give any information on those Ukrainian patent applications that were filed in a foreign patent office. Most PCT patent
applications submitted by the Ukrainian inventors are aimed at the home country. Both for national (under a national patent
office) and international protection (under PCT), most of the patent applications were made to the Ukrainian patent authorities.

At the level of the firm, Ukrainian firms are half productive in terms of labor productivity than firms in
Belarus, Poland, or Romania (figure 3). While this is just a proxy for efficiency, recent estimations for Total
Factor Productivity (TFP) by the enterprise survey suggests a similar picture (figure 4). In this case, the
median Ukrainian firm is the least productive from this set of countries, although closer to Belarus and on
average to Poland, and with less dispersion between the most and least productive firms. In any case,
productivity in Ukraine is lower than its peers, especially on its lead firms that by any account are least
productive than lead firms in peer countries.

In addition, the share of the innovative output within the industrial output has decreased from 9.4 percent
in 2000 to 1.4 percent in 2015 (table 5). However, the proportion of firms that have introduced either a
product or a process in the previous three-year period has remained relatively stable at around 15
percent. A sectoral cross-sectional analysis reveals that food production stands as the most innovative in
2014, accounting for 17.1 percent of all innovative enterprises. Machinery and equipment production
showed a lower proportion of innovative companies, ranging from 4.7 percent to 9.6 percent.

The innovation level of Ukrainian firms ranks lower than the rates of peer neighboring countries. Figure 5
shows a comparison of different innovation incidence measures.4 In all metrics, Ukraine ranks significantly
lower than its peers, even when considering simple innovation through purely imitations, which manifests
in lower productivity and competitiveness of its business sector.

The problem of low innovation incidence is compounded by low innovation quality. One could argue that
despite having low innovation rates, innovations introduced in Ukraine are of better quality than that of
peer countries. Around half of the innovations in Ukraine rely on the introduction of a new product instead
of an upgraded product, which is similar to Poland but lower than that of either Belarus or Romania (figure
6). In addition, only 20 percent of product innovators engage in any R&D, which is similar to Belarus and

4 Includes product or process innovation, product innovation, and process innovation. We also decompose product innovation
into imitation—when new to the firms or the national market—vs radical innovation—when new to the international market;
and process innovation into those process innovations that involve some degree of automation of the production processes.

slightly more than Poland and Romania. This suggests low innovation and low sophistication of
innovations introduced in Ukraine.

 Firm-Level Investment and Capabilities
Innovation activities in the last decade have shadowed patterns from the business cycle, becoming
increasingly volatile (table 6). While private R&D activities have increased significantly in nominal terms,
overall private investments in innovation activities have decreased in the last three years, driven by
reduced investments in knowledge, machinery, and equipment. The decrease in investments in
knowledge is particularly alarming as it will likely carry negative impacts in the medium and long-term
quality and quantity of upgraded products and processes and productivity.

                             in R&D expenditure per worker in relation to its peers (figure 8). Low R&D intensity is driven by not only
                             the large number of firms that do not perform any formal R&D but also by low intensity among those that
                             do conduct R&D. This relative underperformance is driven by the low use of foreign technology licenses
                             by Ukrainian firms.

                             The share of foreign investments in R&D in Ukraine peaked at about 25 percent of gross domestic
                             expenditure on research and development (GERD) in 2010–2013 but has dropped due to the political and
                             economic instability since 2011 and the recent military conflict in the occupied eastern regions. In 2005,
                             this share was 24.8 percent, and in 2014, 19.8 percent. However, this share of foreign investments in
                             Ukrainian R&D is still relatively high compared to the other Eastern Partnership (EaP) countries (figure 9).

                             and within the research sector (between universities and academic institutes) is weak. Lack of information

on opportunities of such cooperation, high costs faced by organizations in search for partnerships, lack of
commercial orientation among research institutes and universities, and inefficient technology transfer
infrastructure are all hindering collaboration opportunities. Ukraine’s state policies aim at closing this gap
through different strategies: creation of research infrastructures for joint use by different research
organizations, creation of organizations facilitating technology transfer, provision of grants to promote
R&D cooperation between universities and research organizations, and establishment of technology
parks.

The next section offers a description of the existing conditions in the country that are likely affecting the
way the firms weigh opportunities behind innovation and its costs, including the risks and uncertainties.

 Local Framework Conditions

Structure of Demand

The demand for business innovation among a significant population of large firms is low and presents
limited scope for increasing R&D intensity. Heavy industry and agriculture, host to large companies and
public enterprises, represent a disproportionate share of economic output, making Ukraine an industrial
and agrarian country. The prevailing economic specialization owes to a legacy from th,e Soviet era,
featuring heavy industries with large conglomerates and dominant public enterprises in heavy
engineering, ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, shipbuilding, the automotive industry, the aerospace
industry, manufacturing and supply for power plants, oil, gas, and the chemical industry.

Domestic demand for R&D and innovation has dropped substantially since the independence of the
country. The change in the relative composition of economic sectors has reduced the aggregate value
added for the country. The participation of Ukraine’s high-tech sectors has decreased threefold since the
beginning of the 1990s, while the share of energy and ferrous metallurgy, sectors with considerable lower
value added, grew substantially during this period. These lower value added sectors present low
technological deepening, not requiring meaningful R&D and innovation. Moreover, many companies
operating in these sectors buy ready-made solutions embedded in equipment.

According to Yegorov (2012), enterprises operating in the equipment-building, ferrous metallurgy, and
chemicals sectors represent the lowest value segments in the world markets 6 . Competition in such
markets is particularly fierce and Ukrainian companies are persistently under pressure to retain their
existing positions against price-driven competitors from developing countries.

Enabling Environment

The enabling environment for innovation in Ukraine has been hardly conducive for innovation activities.

The economic situation in the country has deteriorated in the last several years due to various external
and internal factors, particularly the conflict in the east, which has led to a significant drop of GDP, exports
and imports, and foreign direct investment (FDI). Ukraine’s GDP dropped by 50 percent between 2014
and 2015, and GDP per capita decreased from US$3,986.2 in 2013 to US$2,114.9 in 2015, regressing to
the 2008 level, revealing a pattern of growth divergence compared to peer countries. By comparison,
Chile, Turkey, and Malaysia, which had lower income per capita in 1990 than Ukraine, presented much

Weak financial services constrain local firms that depend on the domestic financial system. Innovative
companies, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in general, face additional difficulties when trying
to raise finance, which remains a critical obstacle for starting a business. Around 40 percent of
entrepreneurs in a Ukrainian study reported difficulties in obtaining financing in general, but this problem
seems of especial importance for R&D performing companies, of which 80 percent stated limitations in
their innovation activities due to inadequate financing position. Financial resources are usually provided
to Ukrainian banks for onlending to SMEs under different programs (sponsored by International Finance
Corporation [IFC], European Investment Bank [EIB], European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
[EBRD]) in the areas of priority for the country economic catchup program.

Financial difficulties remain more acute for early-stage ventures than for mature firms, particularly in the
absence of risk capital financing. Limited state support targeting start-ups and weak presence of business
angel and venture financing compound the problem. At face value, the number of venture funds seems
large in Ukraine. At the rime of writing this note, Ukraine featured about 700 venture funds (Ukrainian
Association of Investment Business - UAIB), totaling €2 billion in 2009. However, these venture capitals
(VCs) are mainly domestic vehicles targeting speculative real estate and equity stakes in mature
companies, representing brokers, consultancies, construction, and trade outfits. The modest early-stage
investments channeled through VCs are mostly of foreign origin. A more detailed analysis is not possible
at this point due to lack of data on investment volumes and information on deals.

Further development of the early-stage financing system remains hampered by incomplete legislation,
particularly the legal framework dealing with minority stakeholding in businesses and the availability of
option schemes. Consequently, most funds are registered abroad (although tax avoidance may also be a
motivating factor for foreign registration).

The unfavorable business environment, driven by bureaucracy, bribery, corruption, and crony capitalism,
represents an important constraint to private investment. In 2014, Ukraine ranked at the 15th percentile

                                                P a g e | 17
in terms of control of corruption as part of the Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI), well below
comparable peers, such as Poland and Romania. In a similar fashion to countries in the region,
privatization of state assets ended up under the control of a few groups, with vested interests and political
connections. Patterns of oligarchy have affected access to investment opportunities, normally open to the
private sector, and competition in several service sectors in the economy.

Knowledge Supply

Brain drain of innovation skills remains a problem, and investment in inventiveness is decreasing. Ukraine
has a well-developed education system. University enrolment and higher education attainment in Ukraine
are high. Ukraine developed a good primary education system during the Soviet era, which features
outstanding skills in mathematics and sciences at the school level. However, serious concerns have been
raised related to the quality of science and technology education since the early 1990s. In addition,
concerns have risen regarding the efficiency of the education system. Elementary schools feature around
600 teaching hours taught per school year, which is between 100 and 200 teaching hours less than in most
European countries.

R&D infrastructure remains large but with some exceptions is considered outdated. The number of
researchers in Ukraine has decreased five times since 1990, while the number of R&D performing
organizations has dropped from around 1,400 to around 1,000 (figure 11). Systematic business R&D
beyond the operations of the industrial research institutes, engineering departments, and special
engineering bureaus is hardly present in Ukraine.

Many institutions perform R&D, but most of this R&D does not have a commercial focus, and when it
does, it is linked with noncompetitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The number of researchers,
however, highlights the strength of human capital in the Ukrainian economy. Some of these researchers
had to migrate to western Europe and the United States to continue their research work, but they still
constitute an untapped knowledge potential if the right incentives were to be in place.

                                                    P a g e | 18
The total number of research organizations in Ukraine is estimated to be about 1,000. Most of these
academic and industrial research institutions are public, but there are also several private or semiprivate
industrial research institutes, engineering departments, and special engineering bureaus. The majority of
the research organizations are located in the city of Kyiv (26 percent of all organizations), Kharkiv (16
percent), Lviv (6 percent), and Dnipropretovsk (6 percent). Fundamental research is carried out at the
institutes of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine (NASU) that includes around 120 institutions and
200 research establishments, employing about 37,000 people (academicians, corresponding members,
foreign members, and researchers). NASU is an independent public institution that receives more than 50
percent of the state budget for STI.

The focus of Ukrainian universities is on teaching, and not on conducting R&D. In 2015, 664 universities,
colleges, and technical schools were active in Ukraine. Per the latest ERAWATCH report on Ukraine (2011),
only half of the slightly more than 350 universities performed any kind of R&D in 20117. Around 25 percent
of the universities were private universities. The total expenditure on R&D in higher education was less
than 7 percent of GERD in 2011. Two-thirds of persons with degrees of candidates of sciences and doctors
of sciences are working in the higher education sector. Per the national statistics, they produce almost 78
percent of research papers, but NASU has more publications in internationally recognized journals, which
also receive most of the funding. The relatively low absolute financial allocation might not be sufficient to
maintain the comprehensive system of education in a country as big as Ukraine.

In addition, university enrolment in Ukraine remains high, with 80 percent of 19- to 25-year-old Ukrainians
enrolled in universities, making it a member of the group of five European countries that collectively
represent 54 percent of the total tertiary student population in the European higher education area
(EHEA). However, at 1.52 percent, only a fraction of students enrolled at advanced research qualification
programs in Ukraine as against 2.7 percent in the EHEA, indicating a low interest of the population in
pursuing scientific careers. Attainment levels for higher education qualification are steadily rising in the
EHEA. The Bologna median value is 37.3 percent for the 25–34 age group, 29.4 percent for the 35–44 age
group, and 22.9 percent for the 45–64 age group. This increasing tertiary education attainment per age is
the dominating pattern in almost all Bologna countries. Ukraine has a high level of tertiary education
attainment. In the youngest age group, higher education attainment has reached 50 percent in Ukraine
(as well as in Cyprus, Ireland, and Lithuania).

 External Factors Affecting Business Innovation Outcomes
The Ukrainian economy was shocked by the conflict in the eastern part of the country, and by weaker
commodity prices, resulting in the economic crisis of 2014/15 (Ukraine Systematic Country Diagnostic
[SCD], 2017). The conflict in Donetsk and Luhansk regions has contracted industrial output, bringing
significant disruption in commercial networks, and income. In addition, the drop-in commodity prices of
Ukrainian products have worsened dependence on imports and significantly reduced Ukraine income
from exports.

Policy Framework for STI Business Innovation

 Policy Aspirations and National Strategies
Though Ukraine does not possess a unified national strategy to define STI priorities, it has a series of laws
that set overall direction and guidance on innovation policies. These laws set priorities for R&D to increase
the country’s national competitiveness, highlighting strategic economic sectors of focus, capabilities to
develop, and thematic applications (annex I). These priorities also underpin additional national policies
and the formulation of policy instruments.

As for innovation, the key legislative act is the Law on Priority Directions of Innovation Activity in Ukraine,
but in general the law was not implemented. It envisaged the adoption of one-year action plans with
measurable targets, but none of these plans have been designed. Innovation issues are also mentioned in
the ‘Strategy for Sustainable Development of Ukraine 2020’ and the ‘Concept of National Program on
Small and Medium Entrepreneurship Development for 2014–2024’, but without concrete action plans in
this area.

The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) and the Ministry of Education and Science
(MESU) have launched separate innovation strategies. The MESU launched the Law of Ukraine on
Scientific and Technical Activities focusing on the R&D sector and establishing the National Council of
Ukraine on Science and Technology Development chaired by the Prime Minister (see the following
section). The MEDT launched the High-Tech Sector Strategy focusing on the digital sector primarily.

In addition, the Law on State Regulation of Technology Transfer envisages the development of a national
network of technology transfer platforms. Thus, Ukraine has created a diversified innovation support
infrastructure but its effectiveness remains quite low due to funding problems and lack of support.

Ukraine has recently joined Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation program, which provides new
opportunities to Ukrainian research institutions, universities, and businesses to access EU funding.

Many goals under the national programs in Research and Innovation were not achieved due to the political
situation, lack of follow-up actions, and the decrease of state financial support. An evaluation of the
Ukrainian funding programs was conducted in 2015, which revealed fragmentation of the innovation
policy in Ukraine. The report indicated that while innovation policies should be treated as a cross-cutting
issue across ministries, the strategies from each line ministry lacked specificity and integration. The
findings suggest that Ukrainian policy makers should introduce a single STI policy strategy that includes
different ministries with coordination mechanisms such as the National Council of Ukraine on Science and
Technology Development but with innovation in the business sector and far more industry focus. A well-
articulated innovation policy will be difficult to achieve under the current design.

 STI Institutions and Governance
The STI governance system in Ukraine is complex and represented by many state bodies (Figure 12). A
description of the most prominent bodies is as follows:

    •   National Council of Ukraine on Science and Technology Development. This council is chaired by
        the Prime Minister and represents a consulting and advisory body, aiming to advance R&D reform

         in Ukraine. Its mandate includes leading policy proposals in R&D in Ukraine (priority directions
         and action plans), integrating Ukrainian science into international research areas, and drawing
         expertise of state-targeted scientific and R&D programs, scientific projects, and state attestation
         of scientific institutions.

    •    Regional research and innovation agencies. Ukrainian regions can also provide funds for R&I from
         their budgets. Some regional governments and administrations of large cities feature divisions
         responsible for R&I.

    •    International partnerships for innovation. In addition, the MESU affiliation makes Ukraine
         responsible for the implementation of Horizon 2020 and has helped the country establish the
         National and Regional Horizon 2020 Contact Points (the contact points are present in all regions).

and improved performance. The change commenced with the establishment of the National Research
Foundation of Ukraine under the Law of Ukraine on Scientific and Technical Activities. This foundation is
responsible for grant making to improve Ukraine’s attractiveness as a location for scientists and support
projects according to key priorities. The thrust behind this reform is expected to improve research
cooperation between academic institutes and universities, promote the participation of public research
institutions (PRIs) and universities in start-up ventures, include property rights as part of the capitalization,
improve provision of grants, support competitive selection of applications and their evaluation, increase
administrative efficiency of NASU and branch academies, 8 reducing bureaucracy, retain skills through

measures to stop brain drain, and increase accountability by limiting the appointment to leading positions
in research organizations to the maximum of two terms.

The national academies present significant opportunities for process improvement, as they still face
strong legacy issues from the Soviet era. While there is a clear rationale for the activities they carry out,
there is no clear definition and measurement of inputs, outputs, and outcomes for the projects of specific
programs under their responsibility. As Link and Scott (2004) emphasize, clear expectations represent a
key for the success of PRIs in leveraging investments and maximizing impact 9 . Moreover, the lack of
competitive funding in their financing—primarily funded by block grant funding—prevents efficient
allocation of research resources. Furthermore, substantial financing comes from SOEs (and financing from
the private sector remains small), while it is known that public sector spending is deemed higher than
necessary and misaligned with private sector priorities.

 Instruments and Programs
A critical element when assessing the quality of the policy mix is the ability of the combination of
innovation policy instruments to address the main market failures that constrain innovation activities in
the country.

Block funding is the dominant form of business innovation support. Ukraine’s bulk STI support consists of
transfers to existing institutions to finance in-house R&D capabilities and research. This represents a very
important difference between Ukraine and most middle- and higher-income countries in terms of STI
expenditure and the type of instrument used to support STI. Most countries have moved away from block
funding and use specific innovation policy instruments that induce demand and behavior change among
firms. In Colombia, for example, the policy mix of STI instruments in 2014 included 130 different
instruments that primarily allocate funding on a competitive basis. Research funding is allocated on a
competitive basis through open calls for proposals; similar to direct support to businesses through
matching grants or loan guarantees. This practice ensures a more efficient allocation of funding and
alignment with private sector needs and priorities.

After the latest fiscal consolidation process, NASU has been tasked with administering a substantial
portion of support programs. In the case of NASU, six umbrella programs were identified, with a total of
46 subprograms.10 In total these instruments amounted to US$24.4 million, of which US$16.2 million
funds R&D programs for NASU institutions, US$5.3 million finances heritage and infrastructure of NASU
centers and units, US$2.6 million supports PhD and post-PhD programs, and US$0.3 million finances
international cooperation. Interestingly, the R&D programs not only represent purely applied research
but they also comprise basic research. It is worth emphasizing that all this funding is allocated through
the network of NASU agencies and institutions, and it does not get channeled through other universities
and research institutions.

The MESU is phasing out its role in deploying STI instruments—information provided by the ministry
indicated that a variety of instruments have been deployed in the past five years (some of which do not

10 These are as follows: support state target science and technology programs, support target NASU R&D programs (total number

of subprograms 14), support target interdisciplinary R&D programs at NASU (total number of subprograms 25), support joint calls
of scientific projects with international and foreign organizations (total number of subprograms 4), support maintaining NASU
heritage (publishing, infrastructure, national heritage objects, and libraries), and support PhD and post-PhD courses in NASU.

exist any longer), totaling around €22 million. While NASU has retained some research capacity and PhD
funding open for its units, the funding for research and scholarships from the MESU has been eliminated
given the current fiscal situation of the country, which puts NASU and its staff as the only focus of
government support for science and R&D.

The role of economic development agencies in delivering business innovation support has been
diminished in recent years—the MEDT closed all existing programs, as well as private sector support
agencies, that were dependent on the ministry. In addition to funding problems, some governance
problems in the allocation of funding were identified in one of the Ministry of Economic Development and
Trade of Ukraine (MEDT) agencies, which precipitated its closure.

A surge in early-stage infrastructure and science parks has extended support to firms in the middle of the
rationalization push. During the last few years, Ukrainian policy makers have established several
innovation infrastructure programs that includes 12 technology parks; 17 science parks; 28 business
incubators; 25 innovation centers; 9 centers for science, innovation, and information; several units for
intellectual property (IP) development at higher education institutions; and an institute of scientific and
technical expertise and information (only few of these programs are functional today). Some higher
educational institutions have their own technology transfer centers. However, these advancements do
not seem to present much impact beyond the attraction of a few multinational enterprises (MNEs) for
performing R&D contracts, and there is little evidence of effective transfer of technology.

Implementation capacity will remain critical to revive the use of business innovations and expand the
scope of their implementation. Even though the number of instruments available is very small, considering
the quality of design and implementation is important. While it was not possible to provide an assessment
of existing programs, the analysis raised a real concern about the quality of design and implementation of
these programs and the installed capacities in different agencies to effectively implement innovation
policies. This critical issue needs to be considered moving forward, especially given the increasing
opportunities to access new external funding, such as Horizon 2020 and the smart specialization
strategies, which could encourage the proliferation of innovation policy instruments. New instruments
should be designed and implemented on solid grounds, and international good practices should be
adopted in design and implementation to ensure effective deployment.

Resource Allocation and STI Expenditures

Expenditure is significantly biased toward a portion of the research sector, and there is hardly any support
to the private sector. The strong bias to block funding for basic research does not provide incentives for
firms to innovate. More specifically, it was found that the (shrinking) expenditures are imbalanced toward
the supply side (with very little effectiveness/output) and very few (or none) functioning support
instruments to the demand side, enterprise innovation, and entrepreneurship.

Fiscal consolidation has led to severe reductions in STI expenditure for innovation and entrepreneurship
support. Most support programs for innovation have been cut, and its implementing agencies eliminated,
due to general funding cuts and tightening in funds management. Figure 13 shows the evolution of
expenditure on innovation and entrepreneurship programs and documents the sharp decline and
elimination of programs and agencies after 2013. Although an EBRD program supports firm upgrading and
finance, and some other donor-funded sector finance programs exist, there is effectively no program
support to the private sector for innovation using government funding.

The evolution of STI expenditure experienced a significant nominal increase from 2005 to 2012 (figure
13). However, after 2012, and during the period of crisis and consolidation, nominal STI expenditure
decreased slightly. STI expenditure lost significance relative to total expenditure, shifting from 4 percent
to 2 percent (figure 13).

All agencies have experienced funding cuts, yet the magnitude of these cuts has been unequal across
agencies and across types of instruments. While the funding to the National Academies has been reduced,
its adjustment was disproportional in magnitude to that of other agencies, reinforcing the sense of
predilection of policy makers toward the National Academies for the allocation of STI resources. In
addition, the reduction was more pronounced for investments in business innovation and
entrepreneurship, exacerbating the concentration in R&D and research institutions (in other words, the
general STI expenditure allocation has almost lost the ‘I’ in STI).

When looking at the disaggregation of STI budget items across categories, detailed in figure 14, most of
the increase in expenditure is associated with an increase in R&D allocation for specific institutions, which
more than doubled the level of expenditure. The latest fiscal consolidation affected two types of
expenditures: fundamental research and other R&D programs and, more importantly, innovation and
entrepreneurship programs. In the latter category, programs have disappeared completely, which implies
a large concentration of the remaining STI budget on block funding and lack of competitive funding.

The government directly funded 39.3 percent of the whole expenditure for R&D in 2014. The rest was
funded by other national sources (20.9 percent), foreign investments in R&D (19.8 percent), and private
funds (18.7 percent).

Figure 15 shows total funding in 2014 for different scientific/research fields in Ukraine from the state
budget, revealing that most of the budget (57.6 percent) was allocated to technical sciences, followed by
natural sciences (31.4 percent). However, only 14 percent of overall funding for technical sciences came
from government sources, while humanities received 96.1 percent of their total funding from the state
budget and social sciences 89 percent.

The adjustment in STI expenditure has been implemented primarily in programs run by agencies other
than the national academies. The national academies have received fewer resources than in the past, but
they have retained a significant amount of core funding. This is the case for all the different types of STI
expenditures, including other types of R&D programs, as shown in figure 17, where the national
academies have retained most of the share of the budget during 2005–2015. A granular trend analysis

Internal Consistency and External Coherence Analysis for Policy

The ecosystem diagnostic showed an underperforming private sector, with low productivity and
competitiveness levels. Although this is explained largely by the volatile macroeconomic and political
environment and the high costs of doing business, the current allocation of public expenditure for
innovation does not prioritize the areas of need and the mechanisms to maximize impact.

Three elements emerge as key in hampering the potential impact of innovation policies: poor framework
conditions, fragmented governance, and the misalignment between the innovation need and the existing
policy mix.

Despite these clear problems identified in the ecosystem, the instruments available in 2016, which are
reviewed in the previous section, did not tend to target these critical problems in Ukraine. The only direct
instrument to support business innovation and upgrading at the national level is implemented through
the EBRD program of SME upgrading.

Most of public STI budget is transferred through direct block grants to NASU, which received 64 percent
of public STI expenditures in 2015, to finance in-house R&D capabilities and research. Expenditure to this
sector is directed in a minimally competitive basis and with little incentives to generate research that can
be commercialized, address the brain drain problem, and incentivize collaboration with industry. In fact,
there are no specific instruments to facilitate collaboration between research and existing SMEs. One
element that the current policy mix does focus on is international cooperation in research; however, the
resources are so scarce that the potential for impact remains limited. Finally, there is hardly any early-
stage infrastructure to support the generation of innovative start-ups.

Overall, the policy mix is inconsistent with the demands for innovation policies and biased toward the
science part of STI, while leaving technology, especially regarding technology adoption, and innovation
marginalized as de facto priorities for policy.

Key Recommendations

The lack of innovativeness of the Ukrainian business sector, which is underperforming in relation to its
peers, needs to be a top priority for innovation policy reform. Firm upgrading and adoption of existing
technologies are urgent, given the existing low productivity levels. This cannot be resolved only by
increasing collaboration with local knowledge providers or increasing joint R&D projects. It is a much
broader issue that should include upgrading firms with already existing technologies and broader
participation in international activities, through importing inputs, links to FDI, and participation in exports
markets of GVCs.

The necessary fiscal consolidation due to the fragile macroeconomic and political situation in the country
has exacerbated an existing legacy bias on innovation policies toward the research part of STI. This bias
left unattended the support to business upgrading and innovation that is key to competition in OECD
economies. At the same time, existing policies and institutions are extremely fragmented, and there have
been significant governance problems in the past in some of the private sector support agencies.

The report suggests some specific recommendations for improving the governance of the NIS and
rebalancing the policy mix toward achieving these objectives. Along these reforms, the report also
proposes a pragmatic innovation pilot related to creating ‘spaces of novelty’.

 Governance of the NIS
Priority: High (precondition to decentralization and rebalanced resource allocation)

While public expenditures remain low and have been decreasing in relative terms in recent years, there
are significant concerns related to policy implementation. These should be addressed before any potential
planned program expansion, as they are likely to increase the effectiveness in the use of public funds. In
addition, the Government of Ukraine needs to undertake active steps to overcome the abovementioned
problems through improving the governance system in STI, reforming the structure of national academies,
improving the investment climate, strengthening academic and university research cooperation, and
providing better incentives to qualified researchers and entrepreneurs to cooperate and establish
innovative ventures. Some specific recommended measures are as follows (with indicative priority and
feasibility for quick implementation):

    •   Introduce good and transparent policy practices to maximize impact of STI expenditure and
        enable public expenditure expansion. Public support to the research sector is currently directed
        to the national academies on a minimally competitive basis and with little incentives to generate
        research that can be commercialized and to incentivize collaboration with industry. Reforming
        the academies with focus on introducing transparent and competitive funding should allow for
        competent knowledge producers (research institutes and universities) to produce impactful and
        relevant research results. (priority: high; feasibility for quick implementation: medium)

    •   Allocate funding for R&D based on competitive selection to improve research quality. This is
        best practice in advanced countries. Programmatic funding for R&D based on competitive
        adjudication will likely attract stronger proposals than noncompetitive processes and will likely
        address research problems that are more relevant for the private sector. (priority: high; feasibility
        for quick implementation: high)

                                                P a g e | 29
     •   Decentralize and grant portions of the innovation support to the regional level. Innovation
         happens at the regional rather than national level. A commensurate portion of business support
         should be decentralized and implemented at the regional level once effective governance
         systems, competent teams, and anti-capture provisions are established. Leverage private sector
         (financial) support to some of the industry-specific regional cluster programs (especially
         collaborative projects). (priority: medium; feasibility for quick implementation: low)

     •   Conduct regular reviews to evaluate the extent to which funding allocation is achieving the
         intended goals and generating knowledge that is effectively contributing to productivity
         growth, competitiveness, and technological progress in Ukraine. (priority: medium; feasibility
         for quick implementation: low)

     •   Introduce systematic diagnostics and deliberate measures to identify issues to support the
         design of innovation policy interventions. Justifications for funding public research should be
         based on its potential ability to generate knowledge that is applicable and can be commercialized
         to foster innovation and technological change. In the current model, proper justifications remain
         absent. Such justification is an important element when choosing the instruments of the policy
         mix and the mechanism of intervention. In the case of public research, it is important to establish
         the rationale for public intervention. 11 (priority: high; feasibility for quick implementation:
         medium)

More importantly, it is critical to have a change in the priority of STI policies to put business innovation
and increase competitiveness of the private sector at the center of this agenda. This requires an alignment
of existing innovation strategies that emphasize the role of the private sector in achieving the societal
goals of innovation.

Accession to the Horizon 2020 framework program, the EU-supported smart specialization strategy, and
other donor-funded programs opens new opportunities for international cooperation and additional
financial support that offset the difficult fiscal situation of STI in the last few years. However, before
increasing spending, the Government of Ukraine needs to have in place mechanisms to ensure sound use
of public resources. It is, therefore, urgent to undertake an internal evaluation of existing programs that
complement existing external evaluations, such as the ‘Peer Review of the Ukrainian Research and
Innovation System’ and work in the adoption of good practices in funding allocation and design and
implementation of innovation policies.

 The Policy Mix
Priority: Medium to high (highly important measure and results driver)

Once some of the governance issues described earlier have been addressed, it is important to shift the
composition of the policy mix to reflect these new priorities. The policy mix should include existing,



11Arrow (1962) suggests three sources of market failure related to innovation research—indivisibilities, inappropriability, and
uncertainty (Link and Scott 2004). Some knowledge cannot be fragmented and commodified in the market, which implies that it
cannot be sold in bundles and discourages private activity. There is large uncertainty in the generation of new knowledge and
more importantly on its applicability, which discourages access to finance to fund research projects. More important for
innovation activities is the issue of appropriability. Very often research application cannot be fully appropriated by the private
innovator, since the social benefits far outweigh the private benefits.

                                                        P a g e | 30
reformed, and newly introduced instruments. The recommendations focus primarily on the innovation
part of the system. Specifically:

    •   Rebalance the budget to provide increased support to enterprise innovation. Introducing
        demand incentives will be more effective to induce innovative behavior among firms. (priority:
        high; feasibility for quick implementation: medium)

    •   On the supply side, increase support to university-based research due to its educational and
        collaborative impact. Currently, Ukrainian universities are a minor player compared to the
        National Academies, which consume the majority of the national R&D budget. University-based
        research is more likely to allow young researchers to participate in research projects and provide
        private sector collaboration opportunities. (priority: medium; feasibility for quick
        implementation: medium)

    •   The rebalanced STI expenditure on enterprise support instruments and interventions should focus
        on the following key areas:

        o   Upgrading of firms’ management systems, qualification of staff, and adoption of existing
            technologies. This should be achieved not only with upgrading programs and a network of
            upgrading support to SMEs, but also through better cooperation with local knowledge
            producers, participation in international innovation processes, importing of knowledge and
            technologies, attraction of FDI, and promotion of exports and participation in GVCs. (priority:
            high; feasibility for quick implementation: medium)

        o   Enhancement of the technology transfer systems that reach out to SMEs and that are
            implemented by industry specialists. There are several models ranging from technology
            extension programs to technology centers that can be considered. (priority: high; feasibility
            for quick implementation: medium)

        o   Improvement of the entrepreneurial environment, especially the venture early-stage
            infrastructure to increase the rates of innovative start-ups’ creation and survival. (priority:
            medium; feasibility for quick implementation: low)

        o   Cooperation with local and foreign knowledge providers and between SMEs to develop join
            innovation projects. This can be achieved by providing some financial incentives for
            collaboration, for example, using vouchers for collaborative projects. (priority: high; feasibility
            for quick implementation: medium)

These proposed instruments could be introduced, coordinated, and implemented by an innovation agency
or/and other ministries’ and institutions’ programs at central or regional levels. The World Bank team,
through the innovation support project, has been providing technical support to the MEDT and the Reform
Delivery Office in the context of designing and setting up an innovation agency (currently labeled as the
Innovation Development Office) based on a request from the Prime Minister’s Office. This innovation
agency is intended to provide support to enterprise innovation in the real economy and is expected to
administer and implement several support instruments such as innovation vouchers/grants and research
collaboration grants (including several mentioned earlier). The mission, governance and institutional
structure, areas of focus, pilot support programs, and budget are all currently under consideration by the
main stakeholders. This report, in addition to other analytical work produced by the team, helps make the

case for such an agency and its missing role in supporting enterprise innovation but intentionally holds
back from prescribing the details of the institution and its programs, which are addressed in a separate
note.

 Toward a Pragmatic Innovation Agenda12
In addition to the systemic governance and policy mix reforms discussed earlier, the report proposes a
specific piloted program that could create an environment conducive for innovative practices. A pragmatic
innovation agenda in Ukraine could be delivered by creating ‘spaces of novelty’. Novelty in the sense of a
proactive project generation procedure in contrast to mere project selection (more of the same). These
can become an attractive proposition by reducing the grip of vested interests in policy support and by
making sure that new agents of innovation participate in the process, preferably under collaborative
schemes.

Spaces of novelty represent a focused procedure to generate collaborative projects in a specific problem
domain, for example, agribusiness innovation. They rely on bootstrapping—introduction of diverse
incremental changes in which a favorable balance of risks and returns encourages the first steps from a
variety of entry points.

Current conditions can be particularly conducive to create spaces of novelty. First, the current conflict can
act as a trigger to push local actors to depart from the rent-seeking state. This can also be described as a
‘stick’ type of incentive. Second, the promise of European integration for Ukraine represents a call to
action, a business opportunity type of carrot incentive. Third, Ukraine presents agencies led by policy
entrepreneurs that can use ‘sticks’ and ‘carrots’ and tap into opportunities to build a project portfolio.

The ‘spaces of novelty’ approach could be piloted in Ukraine by the envisioned innovation agency in either
sectoral or regional settings. In a sectoral setting, the Ukrainian innovation agency could establish a two-
stage competitive procedure to generate innovation consortia. Within this two-step selection procedure
for large-scale innovation consortia, policy makers select collaborative projects per specified criteria
embodied in the design of the call for proposals. Public space is first scanned for dynamic exceptions from
the general rule—for better performing segments. In the second stage, an independent review board
(which is at once competent and credible) can work with prequalified awardees to ensure the presence
of synergy between participants and to assist them in the design of their projects. These dynamic
segments of participants are then invited to collaborate under a framework program. Partnerships are
thus created based on performance of existing programs and the functioning of the agencies housing
them.

A shift from the present ‘R&D project’ culture to a sustained long-term collaborative effort of building
applied research and technology consortia of a strategic nature is required. A consortium for industry-
specific innovation (agribusiness as an example) could be selected through the competitive two-stage
facilitated process following successful models (such as the Call for Proposals of Australian Ministry of
Industry, Science, and Higher Education13). Details of the project generation procedure, selection criteria,
overseeing bodies, and monitoring and evaluation could be fleshed out accordingly.

bundle of interlinked projects and services in R&D, human resource development, testing and metrology,
and others to address specific problem. A diverse group of agents including international knowledge
organizations and private sector users could participate in the process of the articulation and funding of
the portfolio.

Appendix I. National Policy Aspirations for Business Innovation

National STI priorities are defined by two laws: (a) Law of Ukraine on the Priority Directions of Science and
Technology (adopted in 2001) sets the S&T priorities for 2010–2020, focusing on efficient use of energy,
power, and natural resources; development of life sciences; and creation of new substances and
materials, and (bi) Law of Ukraine on Priority Directions of Innovation Activity in Ukraine (adopted in 2011)
sets priorities in innovation for 2011–2021.

The priorities are aimed at the development and introduction of new technologies in the field of energy
transportation, energy efficiency, resource saving, alternative sources of energy, transportation,
spacecraft and aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding, armament and military sector, production and
processing of materials, nanomaterials and nanotechnologies, pharmaceutics, health care,
environmentally friendly manufacturing, information and communication technology (ICT), robotics, and
agriculture.

The main legal act on research in Ukraine is the Law of Ukraine on Scientific and Scientific-Technical
Activities (last revision in December 2016).

The measures related to defining priorities for scientific activities, enhancing R&D quality according to the
EU standards, and improving the governance in the area of research.

In March 2015, Ukraine joined Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation program. This provides new
opportunities to Ukrainian research institutions, universities, and businesses to access EU funding. To use
these opportunities, the MESU is preparing a national strategy on cooperation of Ukrainian R&I
organizations in the European Research Area. The state measures in this area may be aimed at mobilizing
public and private resources, better policy coordination, facilitating technology transfer, and cooperation
between science and business.

In 2016, the MESU focused on the increase of the state budget dedicated to R&D, in the following
directions: basic funding of the institutions; grants for nationally funded projects; support for the
development of research infrastructure; support for young researchers to increase their motivation to

Appendix II. Boost Data Identification

The objective of this task is to identify and quantify public spending on R&D, innovation, and
entrepreneurship development in Ukraine. The resulting output is a unified database of the central
government spending that captures all relevant sector expenditure items, as well as the overall budgets
of selected entities involved in the financing of R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurship development in
Ukraine.

Data Collection Efforts and Methodological Approach to Data Collection

There is little international guidance on how to collect and identify government expenditures on R&D,
innovation, and entrepreneurship development. The attempts to collect such information were typically
complicated by the fact that such expenditure items are usually reflected in the budgets of multiple
government agencies (primarily central government ones), outlays (for example, education and
agriculture), and cost types (for example, investments versus operational items). Fragmentation of the
sector financing, on top of its cross-cutting fiscal nature, demands a unified source of information that
ideally would be in line with the budgeting process of entities involved in the provision or/and financing
of R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurship development activities.

The methodological approach to data collection envisaged by this note concerns primarily direct
government expenditures on R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurship, which were directed through the
formal government financing channels, mainly the Treasury Single Account. The approach to data
collection therefore aims to be comprehensive in scope to account for all R&D, innovation, and
entrepreneurship expenditure items, while ensuring that the information collected is consistent, credible,
and verifiable.

The Ukraine BOOST database compiled based on the Treasury data is a multidimensional multisectoral
fiscal database that covers all national government expenditures. It can be decomposed by the level of
government, budget entities, functional, economic, and program classification. By design, it also covers
all cross-cutting fiscal areas such as spending on R&D available at the program/project level, among
others.

Assessment Framework and Identification Strategy

The expenditure identification stage follows compiling of the unified database that is ready to be used for
the assessment. As mentioned earlier, some aspects of the data collection are the preconditions for the
effective identification of government spending on R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurship development.
These are the line-item structure of the compiled database and the sufficient level of disaggregation,
ideally in line with the budgeting process.

The identification strategy follows a bottom-up approach, which implies a screening of the entire database
of budget programs for their relevance to R&D, innovation, and entrepreneurship development.
Simultaneously, the identified budget programs are reviewed and mapped to one of the categories of a
topology. The typology, as presented in Table 2.1, comprises five categories that define the R&D,
innovation, and entrepreneurship sector budget in Ukraine. The aim of the mapping was to strike a
reasonable balance between the national practices of accounting and reporting of science, innovation,
and entrepreneurship development expenditure items and internationally recognized broader categories.


                                              P a g e | 35
Category 1 identifies sector-specific R&D expenses based on the functional budget classification. The
functional classification in the case of Ukraine is COFOG-compatible and therefore includes sector-specific
R&D expenditure items explicitly labeled. For instance, in the case of transport, the respective expenditure
line item will be ‘0485 Research and development in transport sector’. The rest of the programs were
inspected more closely on their attribution to science, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
Activities/programs related to entrepreneurship were mapped to Category 5. The expenditure items
classified under this rubric include ‘Activities related to the creation of a positive investment climate in
Ukraine’, ‘Activities related to the protection of property rights’, ‘Support for small enterprises’, and so
on.

Expenditure items that had explicit reference to ‘innovation’, ‘investments in new technology’, and
‘programs related to the introduction of energy efficiency methods’, among others, were attributed to
Category 3.

Expenditure items that had a broader scope and were related primarily to ‘management’, ‘organization’,
‘functioning’ of government institutions or programs on science, innovation, and entrepreneurship were
mapped to Category 2 labeled as ‘program/expenditure line items related to the administrative
functions’.

Lastly, expenditure items labeled as ‘fundamental research’, ‘applied research’, and some items that were
not attributed to Category 1 can be found in Category 4. This rubric also includes some expenditure line
items that were excluded from the COFOG classification as R&D related.
