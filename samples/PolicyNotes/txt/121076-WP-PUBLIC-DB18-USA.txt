About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best performance observed on each of
    the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0
    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

  2   Request and obtain plan approval from the New York City Department              21 days            USD 3,640
      of Buildings (DOB)
      Agency : New York City Department of Buildings (DOB)

      The applicant must be either a Registered Architect (RA) or a Professional
      Engineer (PE) to submit the plans. The Department of Buildings (DOB)
      reviews construction plans to ensure that they comply with the Building
      Code and meet current safety standards and zoning requirements. Once
      plans are approved, a contractor or contractor’s representative may apply
      for a construction work permit.


      Simple projects, as in the case of BuildCo, can opt for a fast-track service
      o ered by the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB), called the
      Professional Certi cation Program. The program, introduced in 1996,
      enables registered architects and professional engineers to certify, through
      an a davit signed by the owner, contractor, and all responsible
      professionals (architects, engineers, plumbers, and the like) that the plans
      they le with the department are in compliance with all applicable laws. This
      reduces the amount of time a builder normally would wait for a DOB permit
      by eliminating the process of DOB examination and approval of the plans.


      The professional certi cation must be submitted at the time of pre- ling and
      in advance. A professionally certi ed application goes through the same pre-
        ling, payment, and data entry process as normal applications:
      • Information on the availability of a public sewer system
      • If a private sewage treatment plant is proposed, evidence of submission of
      plans for approval of such a plant to the department of environmental
      protection and the department of health as required by law
      • The lot diagram showing compliance with the zoning resolution                                                   Page 19

                          such a plant to the department of environmental
       protection and the department of health as required by law
       • The lot diagram showing compliance with the zoning resolution
       • The foundation plans
       • The oor and roof plans showing compliance with exit requirements
       • The detailed architectural, structural, and mechanical drawings
       • General description of the proposed work

       After analyzing the plans (assuming that all required documents are
       present), the DOB approves the application at the end of data entry.

       A professionally certi ed application does not go through plan examination.
       The applicant can check the application status by using the Buildings
       Information System and, upon approval, can retrieve the application folder
       from the DOB to apply for a permit. Twenty percent of all professionally
       certi ed applications are selected for audit within 10 days of rst permit
       issuance. The audits for new projects may take place within 30 days after the
       application is issued.

       The overall time of application clearance is 5 days on average.

       According to the 2008 Building Code No. 26-212, the fee for the new building
       permit is USD 0.26 per square foot. The plumbing permit and foundation fee
       are calculated inside the above at rate.


       The Building Code says that " fty percent of the total fee for the work permit,
       but not less than one hundred dollars, or the total fee for the work permit
       where such fee is less than one hundred dollars, shall be paid by or on
       behalf of the owner or lessee of the building premises or property a ected,
       and shall accompany the rst application for the approval of plans or other
       statement describing the building work when submitted prior to submission
       of the permit application; and the whole or remainder of the total fee shall
       be paid before the work permit may be issued.” Still, most companies of
       BuildCo’s size would opt to pay the amount upfront, not in two separate
       transactions. Only for large projects is dividing the amount widespread.

       Starting in 2011, the NYC Department of Buildings began accepting digital
       plans for new buildings. While our contributors have noted that the
       processing time isn't any faster in practice than submitting in person, it does
       allow the applicant more project control and improved accessibility to the
       plan examiner and inter-agency communications, as well as online tracking
       of application progress.

   6   Obtain work permit from the Department of Buildings (DOB)                       1 day     no charge
       Agency : Department of Buildings (DOB)

       After obtaining the Building permit, the company must request a work
       permit. The request should be accompanied by a copy of the current
       insurance policy of workers’ compensation insurance. This procedure must
       be done by the contractor even if they are not the owner of the land.
       Di erent types of work require separate licenses. However, in one
       application, more than one permit can be requested. For instance, plumbing
       and construction work permits can be requested in the same application.

       For a warehouse, BuildCo must request a new building permit, a plumbing
       permit, and a foundation and earthwork permit. The request must include
       the detailed architectural, structural, and mechanical plans. One to two days
       prior to construction works, the company must notify the DOB by phone.

  11   Request occupancy certi cate from the Department of Buildings (DOB)               1 day    no charge
       Agency : Department of Buildings (DOB)

       Upon completion of construction, the company must arrange for DOB
       inspections. For construction and plumbing, the company should contact
       the borough o ce where property is located.

       After completion of satisfactory inspections and submission of the required
        llings (including inspections reports), DOB issues a new certi cate of
       occupancy that describes the legal use and occupancy of a property.

       Each application must be accompanied by an accurate and complete lot
       survey made by a licensed surveyor. If the certi cate of occupancy
       application is not signed by a professional engineer or registered architect,
       the form must be notarized by an o cial notary public.

       To obtain the certi cate of occupancy, the company must obtain the work
       permit/approval from the Bureau of Electrical Control, the Department of
       Environmental Protection, and the Department of Transportation. If these
       approvals have not yet been granted at the time of applying for the
       certi cate of occupancy, a temporary certi cate can be issued. The company
       then has a year to obtain all the necessary approvals.


       If the building does not comply with all the plans and the New York City
       building code, the company must make the necessary changes. Then the
       Department of Buildings inspects the warehouse again. This process is
       repeated until the building complies with all the rules. It is common to have 2
       -- 3 inspections of this sort. Once the building passes the inspection, the
       issuance of the certi cate of occupancy is immediate.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of dealing with construction permits is determined by sorting their distance to frontier
scores for dealing with construction permits. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the
component indicators.

      Smaller projects such as tenant improvements and small o ces may receive
      a counter plan check that takes only 45-60 minutes.

      Building plans must be submitted to the Department of Building and Safety,
      including:
      • Description of the work to be covered by the permit.
      • Description of the land on which the proposed work is to be done, and the
      street address.
      • Description of the use for which the proposed work is intended.
      • Two sets of site plans, including all boundaries, lot lines, existing and
      proposed buildings and structures, neighboring public ways, and
      dimensions.
      • Valuation of any new building.
      • Be signed by the permittee, or an authorized agent.
      • Give such other data and information as may be required by the
      Superintendent of Building.


      Building plan checks include electrical, mechanical, disabled access and
      structural plan checks. Grading plan checks may also be required if the
      location is in a hillside area. Mechanical plan checks may also be required
      when there are HVAC systems or elevators required. HVAC systems may be
      required if the building is in the desert areas, but would not be required in
      the beach or basin areas. BuildCo's warehouse is also not likely to require an
      elevator, according to the CBC Title 42 Chapter 11B, because it is fewer than
      three stories, and "a reasonable portion of [the] facilities and
      accommodations normally sought by the public... are accessible to and
      usable by persons with disabilities."

      Application for service may be made by mail, fax or by using Con Edison web
      site at www.coned.com/es/. However, written con rmation is required.


      The customer or their contractor should consult Con Edison regarding the
      characteristics of service available before plans are completed, equipment
      purchased or construction started on facilities to be connected to the
      company's distribution system. Information the customer or their
      contractor furnishes Con Edison with regard to the customer's proposed
      electrical installation, must be in writing. The company has Electrical
      Contractor or Work Request Pads for your convenience. Only licensed
      electricians can conduct electrical connections. The licensing is done by the
      City of NY. The electrician hired by customer should be a licensed master
      electrician. The licensing is done by the City of New York. The service layout
      usually requires an inspection by Coned's sta who then give the technical
      conditions on the spot. After that the electrician can start the works. The
      electrician could have completed the works until the panels/ switchboard
      before Coned comes and inspects and then only do the wiring when they
      know from Coned where the service room is going to be. If the electrician
      however, wants to avoid to have to re-wire, they can rst wait for the service
      layout that tells them where the service room should be. The electrician is in
      charge of all the works until the connection point. The connection point
      should be on the customer's land and within a distance of 10 feet from the
      property line (border between public and private lands), which we assume
      here. The service layout usually require an inspection by Coned's sta who
      then give the technical conditions on the spot. After that the electrician can
      start the works. Now, the electrician could have completed the works until
      the panels/ switchboard before Coned comes and inspects and then only do
      the wiring when they know from Coned where the service room is going to
      be, etc. If they want to avoid to have to re-wire though, they can rst wait for
      the service layout that tells them where the service room should be. The
      electrician is in charge of all the works until the connection point. The
      connection point should be on the customer's land and within a distance of
      10 feet from the property line (border between public and private lands).

      The security deposit will not be recorded as it is refunded to the customer in
      3 months time. The security deposit amount is twice the average monthly
      usage. Con Edison representative performs an inspection to verify that the
      site is ready for service construction (property-line box or sweep is installed,
      area graded to within 6” of nal grade, curbs are installed, sewer & water
      lines installed, etc.). Electrician submits nal checklist to Coned, requests and
      receives the works. The works consist of laying out a cable from the
      connection point to the closest supply source on the LV network (usually a
      manhole and not necessarily all the way to the distribution transformer). The
      works by Coned can be carried out in parallel with the electrician's works.

       The NY Building Dept Electric division inspector does the internal and
       external wiring inspection once all wiring and connections are nal. This step
       is usually carried out after electricity has been turned on, and is not a
       requirement to obtain supply. It is required however in order to obtain an
       occupancy permit. If the inspector nds that everything is ok, he submits his
       report to the clerk in the NY Buildings o ce, who les it, and then publishes
       the Certi cate of Completion online on the NY Buildings Website. This is
       usually done on the same day or next business day after inspection.
       The actual application for Certi cate of Internal Inspection is done by the
       electrician before internal wiring commences. The Dept of Buildings then
       issues a Control Number to the electrician.

      A title report is obtained from one of many competing private companies,
      regulated by the state. Fees for title insurance are set by state regulators.
      Fees for services vary. A title report is not technically mandatory, but is

      the cost of the title report.

      violation nor problem is found in the rst phase of the review, and that the
      whole Procedure does not take more than the 10 days that it takes to obtain
      the title report in Procedure 1)

      The environmental review is typically conducted by a private rm specializing
      in the eld. It is not technically mandatory, but a prudent investor will
      routinely require an environmental review and no bank would ever advance
      a commercial mortgage without conducting an environmental review. The
      environmental review may have up to 3 phases: 1. The history of the
      property in the public records is analyzed to check if there was any record of
      contamination or any violation. 2. If yes, an inspection of the property takes
      place, where some samples are taken 3. Clean-up phase if needed.

       typically collected by the title company at closing, prior to recording, and
       must be paid to the state upon ling the deed for recording with the registry.
       It is common practice to obtain title insurance from one of the competing
       title insurance companies. (The cost of title insurance will cost $9,500). The
       title insurance can only be acquired at closing, after the transaction has
       been completed between buyer and seller and the price has been paid.
       Where nancing is involved, the lender typically requires the purchaser to
       obtain insurance as a condition of the loan. There is a separate mortgage
       recording tax required to be paid, in addition to the real property transfer
       tax. Real property transfer tax is paid by the seller at rates 0.4% for NYS
       transfer tax and 2.625% for NYC transfer tax (of property value exceeding
       $500,000). The title insurance company will take the responsibility of
       recording the title at the county clerk.

       Nonetheless, it often can take many weeks (and even months) for the actual
       recordation to take place and become available on the public record.
       However, the transaction is valid and opposable to third parties on the date
       it is submitted.
       Although the law states that title passes upon delivery of the deed, where
       there are competing claims the law recognizes the 1st recorded deed.

      contingencies (i.e. the property meeting the contingency requirements to
      move forward with the sale). At the end of this period, the buyer's deposit
      will no longer be refundable. During this period, a variety of inspections take
      place. The checks may be completed before this period ends, but cannot
      exceed this period. In the due-diligence phase, the two following
      requirements have to be undertaken: - Phase I Environmental inspection.
      This is a visual inspection to check if there are any hazardous materials such
      as oil stains or chemicals on the property or if it is located near or formerly
      used as a gas station or dry cleaners for instance. - Natural Hazards
      Disclosure Statement (usually ordered online by the escrow company and
      provided to the Buyer; it is public data. This Report is required by law as of
      1998 for all real estate transactions in California: Assembly Bill 1195 now
      knows as California Civil Code 1103. It mandates 3 natural hazard disclosures
      into one statutory form: Seismic, re and oods, given that California is
      especially sensitive to seismic movements and earthquakes. More

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                          charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator            Answer              Explanation

Proceeding           reorganization      As a general rule, unless a debtor believes that restructuring is hopeless, a debtor will likely
                                         seek bankruptcy protection. This is particularly true in a case where the chairman or other
                                         decision-maker controls and/or owns a large portion of the debtor equity. Moreover, under
                                         U.S. bankruptcy law, absent evidence of fraud or gross mismanagement, existing
                                         management is permitted to operate the debtor during the bankruptcy and has the first
                                         opportunity to file a plan. Mirage would therefore likely file for bankruptcy protection and
                                         seek and likely achieve a reorganization. However, there is a chance in the current
                                         environment that the case could end in a sale or return of the security (i.e., liquidation after
                                         a voluntary filing).

Outcome              going concern       The hotel will continue operating after reorganization. Even if the hotel is sold, it will likely be
                                         sold as a going concern, because it would be worth less if it stopped operating.

Time (in years)      1.0                 A Chapter 11 restructuring takes approximately 12 months. Hotel management will file for
                                         voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11. At that time, all other proceedings will be
                                         automatically stayed. Hotel management will continue operating the hotel under supervision
                                         of the US Trustee and a committee of unsecured creditors (appointed by the US Trustee).
                                         Unofficial (ad hoc) committees may also be involved. The hotel management will prepare a
                                         schedule of assets and liabilities, where it will list all of the known claims against Mirage. The
                                         court will then issue an order setting the date for all creditors to submit proof of their
                                         claims. If debtor and creditors do not agree on each other's representation of the loan, the
                                         issues will be litigated before the court. Once all claims have been confirmed, Mirage will
                                         propose a reorganization plan, which must pass "the best interest of the creditors test", so
                                         that creditors who vote against the plan receive at least as much as they would have
                                         received if the debtor were liquidation. The creditors will vote on the plan and accept it.
                                         When the plan becomes effective, the court will enter a final decree closing the case.

Cost (% of           10.0                Major expenses will include attorneys' fees (around 6%), fees of accountants involved in the
estate)                                  restructuring proceedings (around 3%), and court fees (1%).

Indicator           Answer             Explanation

Proceeding          liquidation        The outcome depends on whether (i) BizBank will work with Mirage to implement a
                    (after an          restructuring of its debt; or (ii) the terms governing BizBank's loan are over-market and can
                    attempt at         be forcibly restructured (called "cram-down") such that the payment amount will be reduced
                    reorganization)    sufficiently to enable Mirage to propose a plan to service its debt. In the latter case, Mirage
                                       would need to provide some treatment for and obtain the favorable votes of a sufficient
                                       number and amount of unsecured creditors because the United States Bankruptcy Code
                                       requires that a single class of impaired creditors vote in favor of the plan where the plan is
                                       not fully consensual. (Creditors are "impaired" where a plan affects their legal rights). A
                                       chapter 11 plan also must satisfy the "best interests of creditors" test, meaning that it must
                                       pay creditors at least as much as they would receive in a chapter 7 liquidation - under such a
                                       liquidation, BizBank would receive around 70% of its debt amount (since its debt is equal to
                                       the FMV of the property and the liquidation value is 70% of such value). However, given
                                       Mirage's cash flow in 2015 and anticipated future performance, liquidation after a
                                       reorganization effort seems likely.

Outcome             going concern      Given the 30% drop in value if the property is to be liquidated, BizBank may support a sale as
                                       a going concern so it captures as much value as possible on account of its secured debt.

Time (in years)     1.0                Assuming Mirage did not take steps to prepare for a bankruptcy filing until it defaulted, it
                                       would take approximately 2-3 weeks to be prepared to file necessary documents. Then,
                                       Mirage will take advantage of its exclusivity period under the Bankruptcy Code, within which
                                       only it may propose a plan (11 U.S.C. sec. 1121(c), (d)). The initial period to propose the plan
                                       is 120 days. Given the size of the case and the need for the debtor to work with its lender
                                       (BizBank) in order for it to succeed, the reorganization effort would take 6 months.
                                       Thereafter, if reorganization is not possible and the property is to be sold and other assets
                                       liquidated, the liquidation process might take approximately 6 more months.

Cost (% of          10.0               The entire procedure, taking into account a reorganization attempt that fails and is
estate)                                converted to liquidation, would cost approximately 10% of the value of Mirage's estate.
                                       Major expenses will include attorneys' fees - 5,5%, remuneration of the trustee - 3.5%, and
                                       court fees - 1%.
