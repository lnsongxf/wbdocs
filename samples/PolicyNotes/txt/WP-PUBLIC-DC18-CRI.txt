About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      A soil study is not a requirement by law. In practice, contractors ask for a soil
      test to ensure that the foundation of the building is solid. The engineer must
      understand the suitability of the soil for the proposed construction work.
      Soil test allows to build a solid foundation and avoid structures to be
      damaged or collapsed or leaned.
      The zoning authorization must be obtained prior to requesting a soil test.

  5   Request and obtain workers compensation insurance proof from                           1 day                no charge
      National Insurance Institute
      Agency : National Insurance Institute

      The National Insurance Institute requires proof that worker compensation
      insurance has been paid prior to issuing a building permit. This proof is
      required to start each new project. In the past, developers were allowed a
      blanket insurance policy that did not require purchase of insurance for every
      new project. In 2007, the Institute’s policies were revised; it now allows a
      blanket insurance that the developer adjusts, paying the di erences
      annually. But the complexity of the process discourages its use. Most
      construction companies purchase individual insurance on a case-by-case
      basis for projects instead of globally for annual activities. This system is likely
      to be changed because of private sector complaints.


      Insurance premiums are based on the amount of coverage. The cost can
      range from 4.23% to 5.53% of the coverage amount. The completed form
      must be presented with copies of the workers’ identi cation cards or (for
      underage employees) working permits.                                                                                         Page 13

       Secretary
       Agency : National Environment Technical Secretary

       BuildCo must obtain approval from the National Environment Technical
       Secretary (Secretaría Técnica Nacional del Ambiente, SETENA), using two
       forms (in Spanish) available on SETENA’s Web site (www.minae.go.cr
       /setena.html). BuildCo would use Form D-1 which costs anywhere between
       CRC 1 million to CRC 1.5 million. The response generally takes 60 -- 90 days.
       This procedure and the next can be completed simultaneously.

       Preparation of the environmental impact study (EIS) costs anywhere
       between CRC 8,000.00 and CRC 12,000.00. But the study is done internally by
       BuildCo.

       BuildCo should submit the property survey map and a contract, signed by
       two members of the College of Architects and Engineers: an electrical
       engineer and either a civil engineer or an architect. It is preferred that at
       least four blueprint copies be submitted. The college has implemented the
       new American Power Conversion Corporation (APC) system (via the Internet).
       If the APC submits the approval, the time line is 1 day; if not, it is about 5 -- 8
       days. In 2007, the College encouraged a complete change to digital approval.
       The approval fee is 0.265% of the project value, plus a xed fee of CRC
       1,500.00 for two construction log books.

       Agency : Municipal Government

       According to Law 8220, the relevant authorities must respond to a
       construction permit request within 30 days. However, on average, it should
       take 15 days. The construction permit fee is 1% of the project value.

       Agency : Municipal Government

       During construction, inspections occur monthly, though not according to a
       speci c schedule. The inspector may show up randomly to view the
       construction and review the construction log book (bitacora de
       construccion), which the engineer/architect uses to register entries for each
       stage of construction. Under Costa Rican law, the engineer is responsible for
       complying with construction laws and regulations. There is no need to
       request inspections.

  12   Agency : Water Department

       After the connection is requested, an inspector from the Water Department
       visits the construction site, determines the connection requirements, and,
       on this basis, estimates the costs. Sewage connection is not included. With
       few centralized sewage connections, most connections are done with an
       independent septic system or treatment plant.

       BuildCo must complete an application form and present all the required
       documents, including a copy of the company's identi cation card.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      After the inspection the utility will issue a technical report. The client is given
      the designs and a list of providers authorized by CNFL to do the connection
      works.
      The design itself is prepared by CNFL -indicating the works and materials
      required. Should the installation of a transformers be required the design is
      prepared by the Section for the Design of Electrical Networks of CNFL. In
      order to establish whether this is necessary, the Engineering Study is issued;
      if the connection can be done with underground cables, the work can be
      designed by an outside electric engineer, who is registered with the Colegio
      de Ingenieros Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA). In that case, the
      designs are presented to CNFL for approval. Until they are approved and the
      Engineering Study is issued, no works can be done.

      The external connection works have to be done by a rm that has been
      authorized by CNFL to do medium voltage network construction work. There
      are 21 rms with such authorization in the capital city. Once the supply
      contract between the client and the authorized provider has been signed, it
      is led with CNFL. It takes approximately 3 days to start the works and, once
      supervised, the construction can start. The construction cannot start if no
      initiation date has been determined by the CNFL.

      The internal wiring installation can be done by any electrician hired by the
      client, but it has to be supervised by the engineer responsible for the design
      of the electric installation. CNFL does not conduct any inspections of the
      internal wiring. The internal wiring installation requires previous plans
      approved by an electric engineer authorized by Colegio de Ingenieros
      Electricistas, Mecánicos e Industriales (CFIA) and the works have to be
      supervised by the CFIA or by another electric engineer. No certi cate of
      compliance with NEC rules is emitted nor can it be requested. The plans
      approved by CFIA will have to be led with the CNFL by the time the meter
      installation is requested. Three transformers of 50 kVA have to be installed
      inside the client's private property. The client has to pay for them. They can                                               Page 22

       inside the client's private property. The client has to pay for them. They can
       be installed in a post inside the private property (it's not allowed to install
       them in public places) or in a transformers vault.

       Agency : Compania Nacional de Fuerza y Luz (CNFL)

       The client has to request the meter. A donation document for the
       transformers (transferring ownership to the utility) is prepared and
       con rmed that no money is owed by the client. The payments that the
       customer has to make to CNFL have to be done in the Section of Electric
       Networks Design. The payment receipt has to be shown later in the o ce of
       Engineering Study to be able to go to this step (the Engineering Study).
       There is a guarantee deposit that is calculated according to the
       consumption. It represents one month consumption. The minimum amount
       of guarantee for the residential customer is ¢ 15.500, and for businesses the
       minimum amount is ¢ 25.000. This deposit is required for all clients
       requesting a new service. The deposit is refundable and after ve years it
       begins to generate interests. It is reimbursed when the client terminates the
       service. The deposit covers the installation of the meter equipment with its
       materials. Additionally it covers the operation costs and the service
       maintenance.
       Normally CNFL tries to both inspect the works and install the meter at the
       same time. CNFL charges between 2 and 3% of the cost of the works only for
       the reception and the powering. The responsible to pay this fee is the client.
       Therefore, this cost is normally included in the estimation of costs sent to
       the client. If the service requires power transformers or a speci c meter,
       they are installed by CNFL without extra costs.
       The installation of the meter is exclusive responsibility of CNFL. The internal
       installation planes approved by the Engineers Association and the
       electrician's certi cation have to be sent to CNFL before the nal powering.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                       Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest        registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population        secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                     In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow

                                                           Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                           largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                           second largest business city.
                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                           a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding            liquidation        Mirage would initiate an in-court reorganization proceeding (solicitud de concurso) based on
                      (after an          article 709 of the Civil Procedure Code. This procedure would involve the appointment of an
                      attempt at         insolvency administrator, who will be responsible for the day-to-day business of the

                                         reorganization procedure would be converted into a liquidation procedure after the Mirage’s
                                         bankruptcy declaration is issued by the Court (Article 740 of the Code of Civil Procedure). The
                                         sale of the secured assets will occur during this stage.

Outcome               piecemeal sale     Insolvency proceeding of liquidation usually involved the end of business operation for the
                                         company and the sale of its assets due to the lack of liquidity. Without these assets the
                                         company won’t be able to continue with its business operations (Articles 760 and following of
                                         the Civil Procedure Code)

Time (in years)       3.0                A reorganization proceeding which is converted into liquidation, similar to the case study,
                                         will take about three years. The preparation of the creditors’ claims, the appointment of the
                                         insolvency professionals, and the negotiation with creditors during the reorganization stage
                                         will last approximately 1.5 years. After this, assuming that there won’t be an agreement with
                                         BizBank, the liquidation proceeding will start in accordance with Article 709 Procedure Code.
                                         During this stage, the necessary steps towards a judicial sale of the property (inventory
                                         preparation, auction, etc.) would take place. The liquidation proceeding would last about 1.5
                                         additional years. This time estimate takes into account a decrease in time to settle in-court
                                         disputes in Costa Rica after the creation and full implementation of the Bankruptcy Court in
                                         San Jose in 2008, which has reduced the time it takes solve cases like the one at stake from
                                         3.5 to 3 years.

Cost (% of            14.5               The costs associated with the reorganization proceeding which is then converted into
estate)                                  liquidation like in the actual case would amount to approximately 14.5% of the value of the
                                         estate. The main component of this expenditure would be the attorney’s fees around 10%
                                         and fees insolvency representatives around 4% based on article 700 of the Code of Civil
                                         Procedure.
