About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       the property, whichever is higher, as an advance payment of the Income Tax
       applicable to any pro t resulting from the sale operation. In such cases, the
       taxpayer may opt to consider such 3% as the de nitive Income Tax to be paid
       for pro ts earned. However, where such 3% advance payment exceeds the
       amount resulting from application of the nominal rate of such tax, which is
       10% of the di erence between the real value of the sale and the sum of the
       cost to acquire the property plus the expenses required to carry out the
       operation, the seller taxpayer may ask the General Income Directorate for
       reimbursement of the sums paid in excess, whether in cash or by means of a
        scal credit that can be used to pay other taxes). Previously and since July
       2006, the 10% of capital gains tax was calculated and paid at the moment of
       the sale as well as mentioned in the sale act by the notary; the gain was
       calculated as sales minus buying cost, minus expenses (lawyers, notary fees).

       1999, there has been an optional expedited procedure in which one can
       obtain registration within 24 hours, at an additional cost of $250 though not
       many people choose it because it is rather expensive.

       Procedure 6).


       In May, 2013 an automated system between the Cadastre and the Land
       Registry was implemented. The system is responsible to share the
       information involving the registration with the cadastre once the application
       is lled. The cadastre then records the new buyer for tax purposes as the
       new person responsible for the payment of the property tax.


       The Public Registry is implementing an online system which would allow
       lawyers to submit all the documents required to register the transfer of an
       immovable property.                                                                                           Page 29

       1999, there has been an optional expedited procedure in which one can
       obtain registration within 24 hours, at an additional cost of $250 though not
       many people choose it because it is rather expensive.


       The documentation shall include: the notarized public deed (obtained in
       Procedure 6).


       In May, 2013 an automated system between the Cadastre and the Land
       Registry was implemented. The system is responsible to share the
       information involving the registration with the cadastre once the application
       is lled. The cadastre then records the new buyer for tax purposes as the
       new person responsible for the payment of the property tax.


       The Public Registry is implementing an online system which would allow
       lawyers to submit all the documents required to register the transfer of an
       immovable property.

                                                         (BizBank) are used:

                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          foreclosure       After Mirage's default, BizBank would enforce its security interest over Mirage's assets as the
                                      debenture holder and initiate foreclosure proceeding. It is highly unlikely that the secured
                                      creditor will initiate a liquidation proceeding as a consequence of the debtor’s bankruptcy. In
                                      situations like the one at stake, liquidation proceedings are not common because of its
                                      complexity and delay in time (10 years or more).

Outcome             piecemeal sale    Once the assets are sold in public auction, the hotel will cease operations and its assets will
                                      be sold piecemeal.

Time (in years)     2.5               The foreclosure procedure in Panama will take approximately 2.5 years from the moment of
                                      the debtor's default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. Assuming a possible
                                      counter-claim by the debtor, many hearings during the judgment procedural stage and the
                                      seizure of the assets, and it will take 1.75 years until the approval to initiate foreclosure is
                                      handed down by the Court. Henceforward, it will take 9 months for the auction to take place
                                      (including the necessary time to appoint an auctioneer, the scheduling of the auction and
                                      the sale of the real estate).

Cost (% of          25.0              The cost for a foreclosure proceeding will amount to approximately 25% of the value of
estate)                               Mirage’s estate. The main component of this expenditure would be the attorney’s fees, which
                                      would amount 15% of the value of Mirage’s estate (based on the agreement No. 49 issued by
                                      the Supreme Court of Justice, April 24th 2001). The rest of the cost (5%) are related to
                                      auctioneer’s fees, appraisal fees and other fees related to the public auction.

   Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
