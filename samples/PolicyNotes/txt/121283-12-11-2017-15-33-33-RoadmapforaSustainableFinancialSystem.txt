The United Nations Environment Programme is the leading global environmental authority that sets the global
environmental agenda, promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable
development within the United Nations system and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment.
In January 2014, UN Environment launched the Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System to
advance policy options to deliver a step change in the financial system’s effectiveness in mobilizing capital
towards a green and inclusive economy – in other words, sustainable development.

This report is the third annual global report by the UN Environment Inquiry. The first two editions of ‘The Financial
System We Need’ are available at: www.unep.org/inquiry and www.unepinquiry.org.

                                    SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
UN ENVIRONMENT – WORLD BANK GROUP
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Historically the financial system has responded to the needs of the time. A global consensus
has arisen that sustainable growth will be one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century—
as demonstrated by the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
adopted as part of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development—along with the measures
to combat climate change and adapt to its effects that are part of the Paris Agreement. As in
previous structural transformations, the financial system will play a major role in this process:
the full potential of the financial system needs to be harnessed to serve as an engine in the
global economy’s transition toward sustainable development.

The objective of this Roadmap is to propose an integrated approach that can be used by all
financial sector stakeholders—both public and private—to accelerate the transformation toward
a sustainable financial system. This approach can bring policy cohesiveness across ministries,
central banks, financial regulators, and private financial sector participants to focus efforts.

The ultimate vision that the Roadmap seeks to reach is one of a financial system that
integrates sustainability considerations into its operations, including the full costing of
positive and negative externalities that sustainability implies, leading to a reorientation of the
flow of resources toward more inclusive and sustainable activities.

THREE DRIVERS OF CHANGE

The ongoing transition toward a sustainable financial system is taking place through the
interaction of three types of initiatives:

      1.	 Market-based initiatives. Through the development of collective initiatives such
          as the Sustainable Banking Network (SBN) and the United Nations Environment
          Programme – Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), private and public finance institutions
          have worked to integrate environmental and social risks and opportunities into
          their business lines and approaches.

      2.	 National initiatives. The initial momentum for sustainable finance has been driven
          by country-level initiatives that, in many cases, arose from national planning
          processes to implement climate change policies or other long-term strategic
          development initiatives.

      3.	 International initiatives. Cooperative efforts carried out by the G20, the G7, the
          UN, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) have all addressed different aspects
          of sustainable and green finance while at the same time increasingly involving the
          private sector. This effort has been complemented by the multilateral development
          banks (MDBs) and other international financial institutions (IFIs) that are continuing
          to actively promote sustainable finance with initiatives ranging from the adoption
          of sustainable practices in their core financial activities to the launching of new
          products aimed at driving capital to sustainable and green applications.

                                     STRUCTURE OF THE ROADMAP

                                     The Roadmap document is structured in five chapters that use the three drivers of
                                     transformation toward sustainable finance as its organizing principle (Figure ES.1).

                                     MARKET-DRIVEN TRANSFORMATION

                                     Markets have led the development of sustainable finance products, information, and
                                     technological innovations. More recently financial institutions (FIs) have started turning
                                     to adapt their business models, skills, and incentives to embed sustainability into their
                                     core strategies. The process of market transformation needs to be accelerated to meet
                                     global sustainability demands. This will require enhanced coordination with national and
                                     international initiatives to facilitate the process of FIs transitioning toward sustainable
                                     finance as well as additional regulatory prodding to increase the pace of change.

                                     evolving to respond to that reality. FIs are realigning existing products as well as creating
                                     new ones to match the risk-reward and maturity needs of sustainable investments. The
                                     expected financing needs are large: a review of the Nationally Determined Contributions
                                     (NDCs) and other policies in 21 developing countries that represent 48 percent of global
                                     greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions finds an initial investment opportunity of US$22.6 trillion
                                     from 2016 to 2030 in key sectors. Although these estimates refer to levels of investments,
                                     most of these resources are intended to flow through the financial sector as bank lending,
                                     project finance, institutional investing, or equity investing.
Further growth in the supply of sustainable finance requires addressing important
information gaps. Information relevant to sustainable finance will be critical to ensure the
alignment of incentives, results measurement, proper valuation of assets, and effective risk
management. Current efforts to move to a more advanced disclosure paradigm are uneven
across asset classes and jurisdictions, but consensus is building around methodologies for
the disclosure of certain types of information (such as the carbon footprint of investment
portfolios). Measuring flows and stocks of green financial assets requires converging on
criteria and methodologies to identify these assets in FIs and investors’ portfolios. Identifying
these assets is not only critical to assessing the evolution of the financial sector towards
sustainability, but also permits measuring the risk performance of, for example, green assets,
and contrasts them with non-green ones.

Digital finance, or innovative financial technology—fintech—has emerged as a powerful
disruptor that is rapidly reshaping the real economy and the financial sector on a global
scale. Digital finance has the potential to deliver environmental outcomes and support a
transformation in financing for sustainable development by, for instance, mobilizing capital
for critical priorities and mainstreaming social and environmental factors throughout
the financial system. Ultimately, the impact of digital finance will depend on a number of
policy and regulatory innovations that enable scaling and minimize its potential negative
unintended consequences, such as cyber security risks.

   Business Models, Capabilities, and Incentives

Sustainability considerations should be established as a key strategic pillar by shareholders
and the senior management of FIs. Sustainable finance requires a strong commitment
from owners and managers to make sustainability considerations a primary component
of business strategy, not a niche area associated with other initiatives that—while also
important, such as corporate social responsibility and environmental risk management—
are not at the core of most FIs’ business strategies. Putting sustainability considerations
front and center requires incorporating sustainability strategies into the process to allocate
resources—both the firms’ own capital and intermediated resources—in support of creating
new sustainable businesses lines, fostering the growth of existing ones, and moving away
from activities not aligned with sustainability.

The capacity of financial sector stakeholders to use sustainability information needs to be
enhanced. Differences in the familiarity, understanding, and capabilities of practitioners
related to sustainability factors affect the capacities of institutions to appropriately consider
and act on risks and opportunities stemming from sustainability factors. Gaps in skills,
inadequate institutional frameworks, and a lack of clear leadership signals can hinder efforts
to respond to dynamic market conditions, changing client demand, or new regulatory
requirements, potentially posing competitive disadvantages. Because skills upgrading can
pose significant costs to institutions, a lack of understanding of a clear business case for
engagement on sustainability issues can further compound capacity issues. Capacity issues
related to sustainable finance are also a pressing challenge for public authorities, including
financial supervisors, regulators, and governments. Finally, a lack of understanding of the
financial dimensions of sustainability challenges—such as investments in energy efficiency—
can constrain consumer demand for sustainable finance products.

                                                         ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                     Ultimately, the success of efforts to effectively integrate sustainability information into
                                     financial decision making is significantly influenced by the incentives that shape practice
                                     within FIs. If information is available, and readily understood by practitioners, transformation
                                     is contingent upon the core values, culture, and policies of firms—which at their core are
                                     motivated by incentive structures. Increased sustainability disclosure in financial markets
                                     contributes to help align incentives across participants in the financial system. The cultural
                                     change needed in the transition to sustainable finance also requires an appropriate
                                     alignment incentive within FIs. This requires incorporating sustainability targets into the usual
                                     business key performance indicators to which officers in the institution are held accountable,
                                     as well as ensuring that initiatives such as internal carbon pricing are used to direct business
                                     units’ behavior.

                                     NATIONALLY DRIVEN INITIATIVES TOWARD SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

                                     The multiplicity of market failures that constitute barriers to sustainable finance require
                                     governments to kick-start, sustain, and accelerate its development through the use of
                                     fiscal resources and public policy measures. A systematic approach is necessary to select
                                     government interventions; this can be accomplished through the development of national
                                     sustainable finance roadmaps with broad support across all parts of government and the
                                     private sector.

                                         Public Finance Measures

                                     Government responses with fiscal implications can be categorized into four categories
                                     depending on the area of involvement and instruments. Figure E.2 categorizes government
                                     interventions in support of sustainable finance that imply financial outlays or revenues
                                     forsaken. This is not meant to be a full catalog of potential interventions, but a categorization
                                     that can guide the development of specific national approaches.1 The first (horizontal)
                                     dimension refers to whether or not actions are taken directly in support of the financial
                                     system or whether they seek to support the real sector of the economy or other parts of
                                     the government to facilitate their engagement with the financial sector. The second axis
                                     (vertical) categorizes them according to the mechanism used: direct financing, which
                                     includes risk sharing mechanisms; or activities in support of the “enabling environment” that
                                     would facilitate the operation of a sustainable financial system.

                                     bodies—are taking legislative, policy, regulatory, and supervisory steps to achieve a range of
                                     objectives linking sustainability and the financial system, such as:

                                           ¢¢ Enhancing market practice, including efforts that mainstream environmental factors
                                              into financial decision making and correct for market failures (such as unpriced
                                              environmental externalities);

                                        National Roadmaps

                                     A growing number of countries are developing sustainable financial system policy
                                     frameworks. However, these are often not joined up or focused in a strategic way. National
                                     sustainable finance roadmaps have been launched in many countries over the past year.
                                     These identify system-wide needs, barriers to scaling up, and priority actions. Examples
                                     of these countries include Argentina, China, Indonesia, Italy, Mongolia, Morocco, Nigeria,
                                     Singapore, and South Africa. The specific mix of policy-led, market-led, and public-private
                                     initiatives in each country is a function of national development priorities and, as such, varies
                                     considerably. However, all have at their core the development of long-term, systemic plans to
                                     enhance the ability of the financial system to mainstream sustainability factors into decision
                                     making and to mobilize predominantly private capital for sustainable investment.

                                     Based on an analysis of existing national roadmaps as well as engagement with stakeholders
                                     in other countries currently undertaking this process, roadmaps for sustainable finance are
                                     more likely to enjoy broad support and increase their opportunity of success if they include
                                     key components grounded in a systematic assessment of overall needs, estimation of
                                     required financing, identification of barriers, and identification of suitable policy measures
                                     whose progress and impact can be readily measured.

                                     INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION AND SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

                                     Meaningful global action requires global principles that can guide concerted international,
                                     national, and market-driven progress toward a sustainable financial system. Achieving
                                     sustainable development is, by its own nature, a global challenge because no country can
                                     be on a long-term sustainable path alone given the interconnectedness of problems such as
                                     climate change, communicable diseases, and biodiversity loss. International collective action
                                     is therefore critical to ensuring the alignment of ongoing efforts to support the development
                                     of sustainable finance. Maximum impact can be accomplished by embedding sustainability
                                     considerations into existing financial sector principles and standards.

                                        Global Coordination and Principles

                                     Establishing general principles does not imply standardization but rather an alignment of
                                     efforts. It is important to emphasize that agreeing on certain principles is very different from
. 14                                 trying to standardize measures to develop a sustainable financial system across countries
                                     or even across different parts of the financial sector. Certainly the needs of developed
                                     countries with deep financial markets are very different from those of developing countries

                                     with substantial financially underserved populations. Similarly, efforts to develop sustainable
                                     banking in the retail segment are very different from efforts targeting large institutional
                                     investors and capital markets. The aspects to be considered in developing these principles
                                     (Box E.1) aim to follow the approach previously used in other components of the financial
                                     sector to guide and facilitate the development of initiatives and policies aligned toward a
                                     common global goal. Agreement on these principles does not imply the creation of new
                                     standards but rather the incorporation of sustainability consideration into existing ones.
Box E.1   Key Considerations for Developing Principles of Sustainable Finance
          	


System-wide

     ¢¢ Make a statement defining the long-term objective of the financial sector in the
        context of sustainability.

     ¢¢ Agree on an approach to incorporate sustainability considerations to ensure the
        effectiveness, efficiency, and soundness of the global financial system.
Disclosure

     ¢¢ Establish approaches and methodologies to disclose the sustainability impact,
        opportunities, and risks arising from financial sector activities as well as the
        sustainability risks affecting the financial sector.

     ¢¢ Consider including sustainability information from the financial sector into the
        policy-making process to ensure that both the financial sector and the other
        relevant sectors (for example, environment, education, and so on) are directed
        toward sustainability objectives.
Business practices

     ¢¢ Price sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities and incorporate them into
        financial institutions’ strategies, governance, and business decision-making
        processes.

     ¢¢ Develop transition plans toward sustainable finance, with financial institutions
        identifying activities to be increased as well as business lines that need to be
        reoriented toward sustainability.
Financial instruments

     ¢¢ Agree on criteria to identify financial instruments and specific transactions
        aligned with sustainability objectives.

     ¢¢ Define mechanisms to promote innovative financial mechanisms, including
        through active regulatory encouragement, to increase the depth of sustainable
        financial markets.
Collaboration and alignment of efforts

     ¢¢ Develop mechanisms to promote and allow collaboration and sharing
        of information between financial sector participants on approaches,
        methodologies, and business practices for sustainable finance.

     ¢¢ Seek alignment of international and national policies, standards, and results
        measurement to ensure consistent global approaches that fit national needs




                                                                                                  .15
                                                     ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                        Results Measurement

                                     To deliver the required transformation in the financial system, a performance framework is
                                     needed so progress can be measured. This framework would allow governments, IFs, and
                                     citizens to identify successful approaches, as well as areas lagging behind, thereby laying
                                     the basis for strategic adjustments in both policy and practice. Over the past five years,
                                     increasing efforts have been placed on how to measure the contribution of the financial
                                     system to sustainable development, specifically in the environmental dimension. Measuring
                                     progress to a sustainable financial system involves gaining an understanding of three core
                                     performance characteristics:

                                          1.	 Effectiveness. The degree to which the market prices sustainability factors in
                                              asset valuations

                                          2.	 Efficiency. The costs of running the financial system that delivers the flows of
                                              finance aligned with sustainable development requirements

                                          3.	 Resilience. The strength of the financial system in the face of disruptions related to
                                              unsustainable development such as air pollution, climate change, or water scarcity

                                     Understanding performance against these characteristics requires a focus on three key
                                     dimensions:

                                          1.	 Architecture. This covers the principles, norms, standards, rules, regulations, and
                                              policies that directly or indirectly contribute to the sustainable development of
                                              finance. Metrics are needed that measure the degree to which the “rules of the
                                              game” are aligned with sustainable development needs.

                                          2.	 Markets. This covers the behavior of market participants and the degree to which
                                              they are integrating environmental, social, and governance factors into their
                                              activities and the transparency with which they describe their sustainability efforts.

                                          3.	 Flows and stocks. This covers the allocation of capital and financial services to
                                              both sustainable and unsustainable assets.

                                     Maintaining the momentum of the ongoing transition toward sustainable finance requires

                                     concrete actions to support the implementation of many of the measures described in each
                                     one of the chapters. This process is anchored in a continuing consultation process over
                                     the next 24 months combined with a series of actions that will benefit from that process,
                                     leverage ongoing initiatives, and support the design and implementation of new ones. Some
                                     of these initiatives will be coordinated by UN Environment and the World Bank Group, while
                                     in some other cases, part of the consultation process aims to identify the international,
                                     regional, and national institutions that may be better placed to lead each activity. Table E.1
                                     summarizes the vision of the outcomes associated with each one of the areas discussed in
                                     the Roadmap along with an outline of proposed next steps to achieve those outcomes and
their expected timing. Short-term initiatives are expected to be completed by the end of
2018. Medium-term initiatives will be completed within the next 24 to 36 months.

1.1	 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE OF THE ROADMAP

Historically the financial system has responded to the needs of the time. From the
development of industrialization and international trade starting in late 18th century Britain,
to the massive industrial and infrastructure growth in East Asia in the last 50 years, the
financial system has been fundamental to facilitating the structural transformation of
economies. Today's society needs the financial system to help move the global economy
toward sustainable development. A global consensus has arisen that sustainable growth will
be one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century, as demonstrated by the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted as part of its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, along with the measures to combat climate change and adapt to its effects
that are part of the Paris Agreement. As in previous structural transformations, the financial
system needs to play a major role in this process: the full potential of the financial system
needs to be harnessed to serve as an engine in the global economy’s transition toward
sustainable development.

The financial system is already transitioning to create, value, and transact financial assets in
ways that shape real wealth to serve the long-term needs of an inclusive and more sustainable
economy (UN Environment Inquiry 2015, 2016a). Shifting to a sustainable financial system does
not imply a change of the traditional functions of the financial sector. Rather, these functions
can be realigned toward sustainable goals to ensure the growth of a more inclusive and
sound financial sector, one that intermediates resources, enables payments, and facilitates risk
management with increased efficiency and effectiveness.

Developments in sustainable financial markets are taking place very rapidly. The complexity
of challenges such as achieving the SDGs and addressing climate change requires aligning
disparate initiatives to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of these measures and to
accelerate further this transformation. Until a few years ago, sustainable finance in its many
forms—climate and green finance being probably its most discussed area—was an area of

                                                                                                      .19

                                     interest mainly to a subset of practitioners in the financial sector. Today, sustainability is
                                     regarded as a fundamental component of the financial sector, essential to its soundness and
                                     effectiveness in fulfilling its intermediation role and contributing to a more inclusive world by
                                     providing broader access to financial services.

                                     The objective of this Roadmap is to propose an integrated approach that can be used by
                                     all financial sector stakeholders—both public and private—to accelerate the transformation
                                     toward a sustainable financial system. This approach can bring policy cohesiveness across
                                     ministries, central banks, financial regulators, and private financial sector participants to
                                     focus efforts. This approach should also contribute to a broader cultural change, which
                                     would be evident in:

                                              term growth, and soundness of financial markets, not a niche matter circumscribed
                                              to a smaller subset of investors and practitioners such as the impact investment
                                              community. This broader understanding will require embedding sustainability
                                              principles both in global regulatory and oversight frameworks, including the
                                              standards and principles that bodies such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB)
                                              oversee, and in other market-driven principles such as the UN-supported Principles
                                              for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the Green Bond Principles.

                                              it (such as national and multilateral development institutions and other specialized
                                              institutions), as a critical element in building a new sustainable economy.

                                     The ultimate vision that the Roadmap seeks to reach is a financial system that integrates
                                     sustainability considerations into its operations, including the full costing of positive and
                                     negative externalities that sustainability implies, leading to a reorientation of the flow of
                                     resources toward more inclusive and sustainable activities. The Roadmap seeks to provide
                                     a framework that can support the development of the broader agenda of sustainable
                                     finance. Sustainable finance, at a broad level, includes “green” finance,2 as well as finance
                                     for education, social development, health, and other aspects of sustainable development
                                     as defined by the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. However, this document primarily focuses
                                     on climate and environment sustainability factors as they relate to finance—that is, green
. 20                                 finance. For most countries, focusing on green finance can generate important lessons that
                                     can be expanded to cover other areas of sustainable finance. To facilitate this process, this

1.3	 TRANSITIONING TOWARD SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

Moving successfully toward a sustainable financial system requires changing course from
business-as-usual practices and avoiding transition pitfalls. Achieving a financial system
exhibiting the characteristics mentioned above implies a transition process with risks along
the way. Table 1.1 describes the transition process needed to achieve each one of these
characteristics.

1.4	 THREE DRIVERS OF CHANGE

The ongoing transition toward a sustainable financial system is taking place through the
interaction of three types of initiatives:

       1.	 Market-based initiatives. Through the development of collective initiatives such
           as the Sustainable Banking Network (SBN) and the United Nations Environment
           Programme – Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), private and public finance institutions
           (FIs) have worked to integrate environmental and social risks and opportunities
           into their business lines and approaches. 3 Through these initiatives, market
           participants are building on frameworks initially developed for certain types of
           institutional investments and risk management—such as, respectively, the PRI and
           the Equator Principles— and are increasing their environmental risk assessment
           capabilities, allocating funds to specific green lending and asset classes, and
           making commitments to decarbonize their portfolios.

       2.	 National initiatives. The initial momentum for sustainable finance has been driven
           by country-level initiatives that, in many cases, arose from national planning
           processes to implement climate change policies or other long-term strategic
           development initiatives. National policy makers and regulators, in coordination
           with their private sectors, are increasing their support and promoting efforts
           in sustainable finance, with many introducing measures to promote capital
           reallocation, improve risk management, and enhance reporting. About two dozen
           countries are already implementing national roadmaps for sustainable finance.

       3.	 International initiatives. Cooperative efforts carried out by the G20, the G7,
           the UN, and the FSB have all addressed different aspects of sustainable and
           green finance while at the same time increasingly involving the private sector.
           This effort has been complemented by the multilateral development banks
           (MDBs) and other international financial institutions (IFIs) that are continuing to
           actively promote sustainable finance with initiatives ranging from the adoption
           of sustainable practices in their core financial activities to the launching of new
           products aimed at driving capital to sustainable and green applications.

1.4.1	 Examples of Interaction among These Types of Initiatives

The creation and growth of green bond markets and the development of approaches to
disclose climate-related financial information are examples of how national, international,
and market-driven initiatives interplay. Green bonds were created in response to demand
from institutional investors and led to the initial involvement of IFIs—the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank in particular—in the pioneering transactions that triggered the
development of these instruments. As market demand grew, international standards were
developed and other financial infrastructure players (rating agencies, verifiers, and so on)
further contributed to this asset class growth. A new step change in the market is taking
place through the development of national standards (for example, China) that has led to a

equity funds, venture capital funds, microfinance institutions, and leasing and insurance companies, among others.

                                                                      ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                     substantial increase in issuance. Similarly, a bottom-up approach—starting with country-level
                                     market and regulatory initiatives and later strengthened through international cooperative
                                     arrangements—has contributed to the development of guidelines for incorporating climate risks
                                     into the calculation and disclosure of financial information (TCFD 2017a).

                                     1.5	 ROADMAP: DEFINITIONS, SCOPE, AND STRUCTURE

                                     For purposes of the approach proposed in this Roadmap, the definition of sustainable finance
                                     will be broad enough to capture the different approaches being used around the world (Box
                                     1.1). Appendix A presents a discussion of the approach used to converge on this working
                                     definition and facilitates its understanding by discussing other related concepts. This definition
                                     refers to the “system” at large, which is composed of all the stakeholders involved in sustainable
                                     finance—including government agencies, public and private sector financial entities, and users
                                     (that is, savers and borrowers). As the process of consultation on these proposed principles
                                     moves forward, this definition will be refined to reflect the views gathered in this process.

                                       assets in ways that shape real wealth to serve the long-term needs of a sustainable and
                                       inclusive economy along all dimensions relevant to achieving those needs, including
                                       economic, social, and environmental issues; sustainable employment; education;
                                       retirement financing; technological innovation; resilient infrastructure construction; and
                                       climate change mitigation and adaptation.

2.1	 MARKETS HAVE LED THE INITIAL TRANSFORMATION TOWARD
        SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

The initial stage of transformation toward sustainable finance has been driven by a virtuous
cycle of financial innovation that has facilitated the allocation of capital to real sector
activities aligned with sustainability considerations (Figure 2.1). For example, institutional
investors and international financial institutions (IFIs) were instrumental in creating green
bond markets. The real sector’s increased demand for sustainable finance led to a substantial
growth in the depth of green bond markets. As this chapter notes, a similar path is bein+g
followed in the development of other financial instruments, but it will require continued
financial innovation by market participants accompanied by an increased availability of
market-relevant information, new approaches to leverage emerging financial technology
(fintech), new business models, and upgrades to the financial sector infrastructure and skills.

2.2	 PRODUCTS, INFORMATION, AND TECHNOLOGY
2.2.1	 Financial Products

Sustainability considerations are transforming the real economy and the financial sector is
evolving to respond to that reality. These changes are affecting the financial structure and
the financing needs of entire industries, from gas and oil to transportation. For example, the
growth of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects are shifting investments toward
higher capital expenditures and relatively lower operating expenditures than those needed
in traditional energy projects. Financial institutions (FIs) are responding to the new financing
needs arising from these changes. In 2016, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
conducted a survey with its FI clients in emerging markets to understand their strategy

For FIs, the size of the sustainable finance business will continue to grow. In part because the
definition of sustainable or green financing is still evolving, there is not yet a global, systematic
estimate of the size of this market. However, some specific estimates do exist for regions and/
or sectors. A review of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)4 and other policies in
21 developing countries that represent 48 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
finds an initial investment opportunity of US$22.6 trillion from 2016 to 2030 in key sectors. A
significant portion of this estimate is for green buildings, and this is probably an underestimate—
there are large data gaps for important sectors such as climate-smart agriculture and
transportation (IFC 2016b). In specific sectors, such as renewable energy, US$7.4 trillion of global
investments are expected through 2040 (BNEF 2017). Although these estimates refer to levels
of investments, most of these resources are intended to flow through the financial sector as bank
lending, project finance, institutional investing, or equity investing. For the insurance industry,
the increase in climate-related perils has increased the protection gap to US$100 billion per year
according to ClimateWise, a network of 30 large global insurers (ClimateWise 2016).

Banks are realigning existing products as well as creating new ones to match the risk-reward
and maturity needs of sustainable investments. In many cases, realigning business activities
toward sustainable sectors can be achieved with existing products adapted to the specific
needs of new sustainable markets and, to ensure broad acceptability, with an accompanying
set of standards that can facilitate origination processes. For example, in 2016 the European
Mortgage Federation, along with the European Covered Bond Council, launched a mortgage
financing initiative to support energy efficiency improvements in buildings by creating a
standardized approach and market benchmark. This initiative will develop a standardized
European instrument that takes into consideration the positive impact that retrofitting
for energy efficiency has on buildings’ value, thus increasing the underlying value of the
collateral. It also provides the potential for lower default rates for this type of mortgage as
a result of the decrease in energy costs.5 Similarly, sustainable finance energy products are
built on traditional project finance for renewable energy projects, and on corporate or small
and medium enterprise (SME) finance for energy efficiency equipment and retrofitting.
In the case of retail finance, FIs are offering consumer loans to finance efficient electrical
appliances and heating/cooling systems as well as to retrofit housing for increased energy
efficiency—a critical development because about 20 percent of global energy consumption
goes to residential and business buildings’ heating, lighting, and appliances (EIA 2016).

In capital markets, the development of green bonds is addressing the need for longer-term
financing that is generally required by sustainable projects. Green bonds are now being used
to raise funds across multiple sectors (Figure 2.3). The European Investment Bank was the
first issuer of a climate awareness bond in 2007, followed by the World Bank’s first labeled
green bond in 2008. Since then a market for bonds designated as “green” has emerged. This
market was initially dominated by multilateral development banks (MDBs), but has grown
significantly since then and now includes a much broader universe of issuers. In 2016, green
bond issuances reached US$80 billion, almost double the total issuance of 2015. Green bond
issuances of financial institutions registered the highest growth, a seven-fold increase from
2014 to 2015, making up half of the corporate issuance in 2016 (Figure 2.4).
4 Nationally Determined Contributions spell out the actions countries intend to take to address climate change, in terms
of both adaptation and mitigation. Further details can be found at http://unfccc.int/focus/indc_portal/items/8766.php

                                     Despite their impressive growth in recent years, green bonds remain a small and nascent
                                     segment of the overall bond market, which currently stands at almost US$100 trillion. The
                                     momentum of demand for green bonds is expected to help drive more capital to low-
                                     carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure projects, including renewable energy projects.
                                     For investors, green bonds can achieve attractive risk-adjusted financial returns along with
                                     environmental benefits, in addition to meeting allocations for climate-aligned investment
                                     and green investment mandates without the need for time-consuming due diligence.
                                     Green bonds can also offer a hedge against carbon transition risks in a portfolio that
includes emissions-intensive assets. For issuers, green bonds help diversify the investor
base, attracting new intuitional investors with green or climate mandates. The bonds
can also demonstrate and implement an issuer’s approach to environmental, social, and
governance (ESG) issues and deliver reputational benefits, enhancing the issuer’s corporate
sustainability strategy and its environmentally friendly brand. The upfront and ongoing
transaction costs of the labeling and associated monitoring of a green bond, as well as the
costs of reporting, verification, and tracking the use of its proceeds, can be offset through
improved internal governance structures and environmental and social management
systems.

Insurance companies are playing a double role in the development of sustainable finance
products. As institutional investors they have been crucial in fostering the demand for green
bonds as well as other long-term instruments to match their liabilities. They also play a
more direct role by creating products to facilitate the management of risks. For example,
their role in developing and providing the analytics to price catastrophe bonds can be
used to promote investments in resilience by issuers (Kahn, Casey, and Jones 2017). At the
retail level, products such as index-based weather insurance can facilitate the process of
adaptation to climate change.

2.2.2	 Market-Relevant Information Is Essential to Increase the Supply of
       Sustainable Finance

Further growth in the supply of sustainable finance requires addressing important information
gaps. Financial markets depend on information to ensure a process of allocating resources
that leads to efficient prices and effective risk management, and more generally to minimize
information asymmetries that prevent markets from developing. Two elements to the
concept of sustainable finance information are relevant to financial markets:

     ¢¢ Disclosure. This refers to the public availability of market-relevant sustainability
        information arising from real and financial sector entities, financial institution
        associations, stock markets, regulators, and other stakeholders of the financial
        sector. This information is also essential for investors to select portfolios aligned
        with sustainability criteria, for shareholders to monitor companies’ compliance
        with sustainable strategies, and for policy makers and society at large to measure
        progress toward sustainable finance objectives.

     ¢¢ Embedding of disclosed as well as non-public information into market-relevant
        information flows. There is a well-established subset of financial infrastructure
        entities whose role is to increase market efficiency by collecting, processing, and
        making available information relevant to financial sector stakeholders. These include
        credit rating agencies, credit bureaus, credit registries, research houses, property
        and other collateral registries, and financial data providers. This information is
        essential for FIs to develop and appropriately price financial products and to manage
        risks, and for other market participants and regulators to assess FIs’ performance
        with respect to strategic objectives and legal and regulatory requirements related to
        sustainability considerations.

                                     Diverse approaches and evolving toolkits. Current efforts to move to a more advanced
                                     disclosure paradigm are uneven across asset classes and jurisdictions, but consensus is
                                     building around methodologies for the disclosure of certain types of information (such as
                                     the carbon footprint of investment portfolios). Emerging approaches can be grouped into
                                     five categories:

                                           1.	 Process. Information relating to the operational processing of sustainability
                                               factors, such as ESG integration into investment disclosure and the overall mix of
                                               products aligned with sustainability considerations. Key tools include disclosure
                                               of investment policies.

                                           2.	 Performance. Information relating to the performance of financial portfolios
                                               with respect to different green indicators or policy objectives (for example,
                                               decarbonization). Key tools include benchmarking against indices and exposure
                                               assessment (for example, exposure to fossil fuel holdings).

                                           3.	 Impact. Information relating to positive impact achieved on sustainability
                                               objectives within the real economy, such as pollution abated or green jobs
                                               created. Key tools involve life-cycle assessment, monitoring, and evaluation.

                                           4.	 Scenario/strategic alignment. Information relating to alignment with a low-carbon
                                               future, specifically examining exposure and performance of an institutional
                                               portfolio over a two-degree future scenario for the economy. Key tools involve
                                               scenario analysis and the use of asset-level data.

                                           5.	 Identification. Information relating to the environmental characteristics of all
                                               financial assets. Key tools involve the tagging of green assets or the use of
                                               established data registries.

                                     Linking across levels. Consistency in information is needed across multiple levels in the
                                     financial system to enable effective decision making (Figure 2.5). As risk assessment
                                     becomes more sophisticated, financial institutions and third-party service providers are
                                     being challenged with a range of issues in their efforts to translate financial risks to individual
. 32                                 assets to the institutional level. Alignment across sources of data, classifications, analytical
                                     methodologies, and scenarios will be necessary to enable each successive level of analysis to
                                     be useful for corporations, FIs, and regulators. The main elements of alignment include:

Sustainability information is being integrated into accounting standards and other
mechanisms that are essential to ensure markets’ integrity. This can involve reporting not
only on the impact on sustainability of a firm’s operations (for example, in terms of GHG
emissions), but also on the levels of revenue that are associated with green businesses, an
effort in which the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is involved in the
context of facilitating the identification of firms that could be considered as eligible for ESG
investors. The guidance from the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is providing further impetus to both the real sector and FIs to
develop a coherent and consistent approach to incorporate climate-related risks into their
decision-making process (TCFD 2017a).

Stock markets and institutional investors have played a key role in encouraging disclosure
in the real sector. Stock exchanges are important in encouraging improved environmental
disclosure by corporations, including through listing requirements. Momentum is increasing—
the Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) Initiative now includes over 60 stock exchanges,
representing more than 70 percent of listed equity markets and some 30,000 companies
with a market capitalization of over US$55 trillion. Notable frameworks released within the
last year include:

                                     coalitions. Market institutions are working together to help enhance flows of sustainability
                                     information, including through disclosure of investment policies, portfolio allocation,
                                     and alignment with a low-carbon future. Reporting and disclosure is a key aspect of the

                                     sharing sustainable investment priorities—which has increased by over 185 members since
                                     June 2016 and now represents 50 percent of global assets under management. Launched in
                                     2014, the Montreal Pledge has reached more than US$10 trillion in assets under management
                                     with over 120 investors committed to measure and publicly disclose the carbon footprint

2.2.4	Embedding Sustainability Information into the Financial Sector

Information relevant to sustainable finance will be critical to ensure the alignment
of incentives, results measurement, proper valuation of assets, and effective risk
management. Information asymmetry is in fact one of the main obstacles to developing a
sustainable financial system. A broad set of sustainability data providers arose in response
to ESG investors’ needs. These data providers include both the large international ratings
agencies and specialized firms providing ESG ratings, indices, and other specific reporting
such as governance and proxy voting reporting (Novethic 2013).

      ¢¢ ESG ratings. Rating agencies assign a score or rating to companies based on
         different types of criteria that may include exposure to ESG risks and their ability to
         manage them (for example, MSCI ESG ratings) and their ability to incorporate ESG
         considerations into business opportunities and other financially material issues (for
         example, RobecoSAM Corporate Sustainability Assessment).

      ¢¢ Inclusion of ESG factors into credit ratings. More recently, with support from the PRI
         and the UN Environment Inquiry, leading rating agencies have started to incorporate
         ESG considerations into the development of their credit ratings. This arises from the
         recognition that ESG risks are material and directly affect the long-term viability
         of firms. Nine rating agencies are signatories of the Statement on ESG in Credit
         Ratings and are undertaking a consultation process, to be finalized in 2018, to adapt
         their rating methodologies to include ESG parameters.11

      ¢¢ Financial data providers. A broad set of financial data providers aggregate
         information such as ratings, financial statements, material news, and other relevant
         market data; these data providers have developed ESG modules. For example,
         Bloomberg, one of the largest data providers, collects ESG data on more than
         10,000 publicly listed companies.

      ¢¢ ESG indices. Indices, many of them developed by rating providers, select companies
         based on ESG criteria and can be used to select investments and compare the
         performance of ESG portfolios using the index as benchmark. A broad range of
         ESG indices can select for criteria as specific as low-carbon footprint, fossil fuels–
         free status, and gender equality in addition to those using broader criteria with
         parameters for each one of three ESG pillars. More recently, regional indices have
         been developed. These include an ongoing initiative between S&P Dow Jones
         Indices, IFC, RobecoSAM, and the Stock Exchanges of the Mercado Integrado
         Latinamericano (MILA) to develop an ESG index covering public companies in Chile,
         Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.

Mainstreaming sustainability across the financial data ecosystem is needed. At a higher
level, recognition is building of the need to mainstream sustainability consideration
across the existing ecosystem of information infrastructure within the financial system—
including data sources and methodologies used by institutions to evaluate risk profiles

                                     of real economy investments and financial assets. Critical here is the role of credit rating
                                     agencies (CRAs), some of which have begun to integrate ESG factors into in mainstream
                                     credit risk analysis. Recent research undertaken by the PRI has confirmed progress within
                                     several leading agencies (such as S&P and Moody’s), but identifies major differences in
                                     consideration of the materiality of ESG factors across different CRAs, and asymmetries
                                     between CRAs and investors (Beeching, Nuzzo, and Adams 2017). Beyond rating agencies,
                                     there are multiple other sources of information where sustainability factors have not yet
                                     been extracted—including credit bureaus, credit registries, and property registries. For
                                     example, including information regarding compliance with energy efficiency standards in
                                     property registries can facilitate the tagging of mortgages and potentially lead to lower
                                     financing costs for green investments.

                                     Investments in data infrastructure for the financial sector will be critical for the green
                                     economy. There is an opportunity for significant improvement in the tracking and
                                     measurement of green finance, particularly in bank lending, by improving the way loans
                                     are tagged and by developing standards to identify green loans in each economic sector.
                                     Generating sustainability data has impact at multiple levels, as the ongoing process to
                                     develop green tagging of bank portfolios shows. IFC published a bottom-up methodology
                                     (IFC 2017) to track green finance by banks that provides a definition of green at a project
                                     level, based on the intended use of the investment in the real economy. This approach
                                     estimates the green share per project type and then aggregates flows at an industry and
                                     country level. The World Bank Group (WBG) is leading efforts to develop an approach to
                                     identify green assets within banks (Box 2.1). This process is also referred to as green finance
                                     tagging. The exercise undertaken will potentially provide multiple benefits:

                                              valuable information on the portfolios of green/climate-smart loans that could be
                                              packaged as asset-backed securities into green bonds.

                                           ¢¢ Contributing to measure the existing level of green finance and manage exposure
                                              to “non-green” or “brown” sectors. This effort would lead to a leap in market
                                              transparency on the flows of finance to green/climate smart assets and products.12
                                              This is particularly important in the banking sector where no criteria equivalent
                                              to that in debt markets—such as the Green Bond Principles managed by the

Box 2.1   	Green Tagging

Green tagging, or green finance tracking, is the process of identifying, tracking, and
reporting the green share of a financial institution (FI)’s portfolio committed per year
or accumulated in a given period. Based on the range of green percentages or shares,
individual transactions can be tagged as: (a) green, (b) partially green, or (c) non-
green—that is, brown. The approach leverages, whenever feasible, existing industry
standard classification codes and certification and asset classification systems, such
as the Energy Star rating system, green building standards, and agri-certification
standards.

Existing Initiatives

Several new bottom-up approaches for tracking/tagging green finance are being
piloted by various institutions.a With Climate Strategies, the UN Environment Inquiry
has launched an initiative with 10 of the largest European banks to explore the “state of
the art” in linking lending to the real estate sector with energy performance standards.
The European Investment Bank has also kick-started an initiative to align taxonomies for
green projects following the IFI Framework for a Harmonized Approach to Greenhouse
Gas Accounting.b This includes the taxonomy developed by China to regulate the
Chinese green bond market, and that developed by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI)
for certifying green bonds.c

New World Bank Group Initiative

The proposed World Bank Group initiative on green tagging seeks a broader approach
to ensure that bank loans are being consistently and comprehensively tagged at the
appropriate levels. To track and filter green transactions, the process primarily uses
existing standard industry classification (SIC) codes to identify the industry to which
the borrower belongs, not necessarily the type of activity that is being financed. For
transactions that could be tagged as “partially green” based on SIC codes, additional
information will be required to determine the green share of activities financed by the
loan. Various standards, often sector/activity-specific, already exist in a growing number
of countries that attribute “greenness.” This initiative will bring these standards into a
collective framework in a way that is aligned with the needs and operating practices
of the financial system. The key steps proposed under this initiative are summarized in
Table B2.1.1.

The proposed approach will require developing an analytical framework that outlines
the industry sector classification and green sectors. It will be necessary to leverage the
existing initiatives, including certification schemes for agricultural commodities, small
and medium enterprise loans, green building standards, and so on, and to work with
external data providers. External data providers and credit bureaus could be relied on
to implement this approach, and transform the existing data collected by FIs that use a
paper form or that have inconsistent or missing industry classifications.

2.2.5	 Technology

Digital finance, or innovative financial technology—fintech—has emerged as a powerful
disruptor that is rapidly reshaping the real economy and the financial sector on a global
scale. By changing the way people pay, lend, and invest, digital finance could substantially
change financial sector architecture and policies. Furthermore, it has the potential to
advance sustainable finance and transform the future of the financial system, and to align it
with policy goals such as those embodied in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Broadly defined, digital finance is the evolving process by which technologically enabled
financial innovation results in new business models, applications, processes, and products
with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and on the provision
of financial services (Bank of England 2017). These innovations include, for instance,
digital payment solutions, e-commerce, crowd lending and aggregation platforms,
equity crowdfunding, Internet-based services in the insurance industry, roboadvisors and
gamification in the investment space, and peer-to-peer lending (GreenInvest 2017). Moreover,
digital finance is part of a wider digital ecosystem that includes artificial intelligence, big
data, cryptocurrencies, the Internet of Things, and a wide range of nonfinancial applications
of blockchain technology.

Digital finance has the potential to deliver environmental outcomes and support a
transformation in financing for sustainable development by, for instance, mobilizing capital
for critical priorities and mainstreaming social and environmental factors throughout
the financial system. For example, the Kenya-based M-KOPA, the Swedish start-up Trine,
and the U.S.-based SolarCoin have all used a combination of crowd-sourcing, payment
platforms, cryptocurrencies, and clean technology to mobilize capital and deliver
distributed solar energy options to remote communities in Sub-Saharan Africa and
elsewhere (GFDA 2017).

Recognizing that collaboration with industry peers and key stakeholders is important, the
Green Digital Finance Alliance (GDFA) was established at the World Economic Forum’s
annual meeting in Davos in January 2017 by UN Environment and Ant Financial Services
Group. The mission of the GDFA is to realize the potential for digital finance to help deliver
environmental sustainability by deepening understanding, stimulating innovation, and
facilitating collaboration (Box 2.2).

However, the emergence of such transformative technologies is not without potential
consequences and implications. Unintended consequences may be greater than the planned,
or even the foreseen, consequences. While many digital finance entrepreneurs set out with
the vision that a profitable start-up could have major social or environmental benefits, few
have fully explored the negative implications it may bring. From common cyber security risks
and regulatory gaps of understanding fintech development to the potential of automation
and displacement of labor, the downside implications of fintech development should also be
considered by policy makers and financial regulators.

                                       it with the needs of environmental sustainability. The GDFA’s participants comprise
                                       innovative financial institutions committed to using digital technology to advance green
                                       finance in lending, investment and insurance. The GDFA draws in allies from across
                                       the worlds of environment and finance whose expertise, insights, and networks can
                                       contribute to collaborative actions with timely and scaled potential (GDFA 2017).

                                       Ant Financial Services Group—a related company of the Alibaba Group and parent
                                       company of Alipay, and a leading online and mobile payment platform—is a member of
                                       the GDFA. It is focused on serving small and medium enterprises as well as individuals
                                       (GDFA 2017). Ant Financial is dedicated to building an open ecosystem of Internet
                                       thinking and technologies while working with other financial institutions to support the
                                       future financial needs of society. The main businesses operated by Ant Financial include
                                       Alipay, Ant Fortune, Zhima Credit, and MYbank.

                                       Ant Financial has also initiated the world’s first large-scale pilot aimed at greening
                                       citizens’ consumption behavior through the use of mobile payment platforms, big data,
                                       and social media. The Ant Forest app encourages users to reduce their carbon footprint
                                       through a three-part approach: providing individualized carbon savings data to people’s
                                       smartphones, connecting their virtual identify and status to their earnings of “green
                                       energy” for reduced carbon emissions, and providing carbon offset rewards through
                                       a physical tree planting program. As of January 2017, the first six months of the Ant
                                       Forest pilot has resulted in 200 million people across China joining voluntarily—about
                                       40 percent of Ant’s user base in China—and resulted in an estimated 150,000 tons of
                                       cumulative avoided carbon emissions and over 1 million trees planted.

                                       Ant is dedicated to building up a measurable carbon account for its 450 million users,
                                       promoting the development of personal avoided carbon emissions, establishing a

                                       methodologies, including by helping small and medium enterprises in particular to enter
                                       the carbon trading market and reward carbon reduction activities.

                                     Ultimately, the impact of digital finance will depend on a number of policy and regulatory
                                     innovations that enable scaling and minimize its negative unintended consequences. Some
                                     of these interventions are not specific to particular sustainable development considerations,
                                     but are good practice in enabling fintech innovations. Policy interventions can therefore be
                                     active on both the digital finance supply-side and on the manner in which financial system
                                     development is aligned to sustainable development (UN Environment Inquiry 2016a). These
                                     steps can include:
      ¢¢ Ensuring that digital finance is an integral part of financial system development plans
         and roadmaps focused on financing sustainable development, particularly at the
         national level, and especially for developing countries,

      ¢¢ Establishing a platform of leading digital finance companies, working with others to
         influence the right enabling business, policies, and standards to effectively connect
         fintech and sustainable development, and

      ¢¢ Incentivizing fintech to align with sustainable development, for example by supporting
         venture capital and social impact funds to fund start-ups with specific sustainable
         development ambitions. Another alternative would be to establish a challenge
         fund, similar in nature to the Longitude and X-Prizes, which seek to create a global
         community of purpose that can pilot and create replicable solutions over time.13

2.3	 BUSINESS MODELS, CAPABILITIES, AND INCENTIVES

2.3.1	 Business Models

Sustainability considerations should be established as a key strategic pillar by shareholders
and the senior management of FIs. Sustainable finance requires a strong commitment
from owners and managers to make sustainability considerations a primary component
of business strategy, not a niche area associated with other initiatives that—while also
important, such as corporate social responsibility and environmental risk management—
are not at the core of most FIs’ business strategies. Putting sustainability considerations
front and center requires incorporating sustainability strategies into the process to allocate
resources—both the firms’ own capital and intermediated resources—in support of creating
new sustainable businesses lines, fostering the growth of existing ones, and moving away
from activities not aligned with sustainability. For example, the TCFD’s emphasis on strategic
and governance considerations related to climate-related financial disclosures highlights the
need to embed sustainability into the core business model of organizations.

There is already substantial interest in ensuring that sustainability strategies cascade down
to day-to-day decision making through metrics that align incentives. Institutions have started
looking at internal carbon pricing as a key tool to aid them in the process of deciding how
they allocate their resources. By incorporating such internal prices, investments in carbon-
emitting businesses become less attractive. According to the CDP, 65 FIs currently disclose
the use of an internal carbon price and 68 more are expected to have this in place by the end
of 2018 (CDP 2016). Nearly all of these institutions are applying a price to their operational
emissions (for example, building energy use, employee travel, and so on). However, with
the release of the TCFD report, the move by some governments (for example, France and
the Netherlands) asking financial institutions to “stress test” their investment portfolios to
address climate risk, and a growing number of investors looking into climate risk, banks are
beginning to explore how to apply a carbon price to their investment decisions as a way to
identify and manage climate risk.

                                                                     ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                     Developing standards and addressing methodological issues is essential to ensure broader
                                     adoption of metrics such as carbon pricing. Although approaches to applying internal carbon
                                     prices vary in scope and methodology, many FIs are facing the same challenges in moving
                                     this forward around internal awareness-building and stakeholder management and by setting
                                     appropriate price levels, methodological challenges associated with corporate loans and equity
                                     investments, and capacity constraints. Institutional investors are also increasingly interested in
                                     ensuring the emergence of standards that could facilitate the process of the decarbonization
                                     of portfolios and the selection of investments for ESG portfolios.

                                     New business models in FIs require effective metrics to assess their alignment with
                                     sustainability considerations. Assessing the level to which the business model of an FI is
                                     moving toward sustainable finance requires a review along several dimensions. In the case
                                     of green financing, current efforts, driven primarily by nongovernmental organizations, have
                                     focused on reviewing portfolios to assess banks’ level of financing directed toward emissions
                                     incentive activities.14 This approach is partly driven by the fact that, by reviewing industry
                                     sectors in portfolios, it is easier to identify brown assets than green ones (the next section of
                                     this report reviews approaches to address this data gap). A more comprehensive approach
                                     to identify a financial institution as green would require a review along four dimensions:

                                           1.	 Environmental and social (E&S) risk management. An assessment of how E&S
                                               risks standards and practices in the sector are applied in the conduct of business
                                               to assess the E&S impact of the financial institution’s activities. This would
                                               encompass a review of the internal processes to categorize and incorporate
                                               into business decision-making these risks as well as approaches to develop risk
                                               mitigation strategies, ensure their application, and measure their success.

                                           2.	 Green assets. Measurement of the institution’s business intent and actual results
                                               in building and maintaining a green portfolio is needed.

                                           3.	 Brown assets. Measurement of the institution’s level of business-as-usual
                                               intent and actual results in reducing, building, and maintaining brown assets is
                                               needed. Although a formal definition of brown assets does not exist, existing
                                               initiatives associate them with the financing of emission-incentive activities (for
                                               example, oil and gas).


. 42                                       4.	 Internal footprint. This term refers to how the financial institution conducts its
                                               business operations to minimize its environmental footprint (for example, energy
                                               efficiency of facilities, water and paper consumption).

                                     2.3.2	 Capabilities in Financial Institutions

                                     The capacity of financial sector stakeholders to use sustainability information needs to be
                                     enhanced. Differences in the familiarity, understanding, and capabilities of practitioners
                                     related to sustainability factors affect the capacities of institutions to appropriately consider

                                     14 See, for example, the Banking on Climate Change Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card 2017 prepared by the
                                     Rainforest Action Network, Banktrack, Sierra Club, and Oil Change International at www.ran.org/banking_on_
                                     climate_change
and act on risks and opportunities stemming from sustainability factors. Gaps in skills,
inadequate institutional frameworks, and a lack of clear leadership signals can hinder efforts
to respond to dynamic market conditions, changing client demand, or new regulatory
requirements, potentially posing competitive disadvantages. Because skills upgrading can
pose significant costs to institutions, a lack of understanding of a clear business case for
engagement on sustainability issues can further compound capacity issues. Capacity issues
related to sustainable finance are also a pressing challenge for public authorities, including
financial supervisors, regulators, and governments. Finally, a lack of understanding of the
financial dimensions of sustainability challenges—such as investments in energy efficiency—
can constrain consumer demand for sustainable finance products.

The capabilities and skills gap among financial practitioners may be exacerbated by a
number of different issues. Surveys of global financial institutions show that only a very small
percentage of staff would be capable of appropriately managing sustainability information
to use it in decision making either as a strategic driver of the business or, for example, to
incorporate this information into regular due diligence of loans and overall risk management
(IFC 2014). Some of the causes of this gap include:

     ¢¢ A lack of clear consensus on how to consider or evaluate risks within financial
        decisions (for example, standard approaches for discounting over time),

     ¢¢ Disagreements on the materiality of sustainability factors with long-term impacts,

     ¢¢ Inadequate impetus on the part of investors to build internal capacity on
        sustainability issues stemming from a lack of clear sustainability mandates, and

     ¢¢ A lack of mechanisms to catalyze skills upgrading through investment chain
        interaction (that is, regulations targeting buy-side stimulating a demand for specific
        capabilities or products from the sell-side)

Industry associations are leading many of the efforts to increase sustainability capabilities
within the financial sector. With new emphasis being placed on sustainable banking
approaches, capacity building efforts and the provision of technical guidance have been
essential to assisting banks to build internal know-how and systems. The Sustainable Banking
Network (SBN)—a grouping of banking regulators and associations from 31 emerging
markets focused on enabling frameworks for environmentally and socially sustainable
lending, supported by IFC—is, for example, supporting training and knowledge exchange
among its members. Support ranges from training and workshops to technical guidance and
sector-specific guidelines and checklists. Countries that exhibit recent activities include:

     ¢¢ Brazil. The Brazilian Central Bank (BACEN) and IFC partnered to provide capacity
        building for Central Bank supervisors in order to strengthen knowledge of E&S
        risk management and support the implementation of the Resolution on E&S
        Responsibility for financial institutions.

     ¢¢ China. Following the launch of the Green Credit Guidelines in 2012, the China
        Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and the China Banking Association (CBA)

                                                                                                     .43
                                                        ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                             have led efforts to disseminate best practices and sector-wide capacity building,
                                             including a Green Credit training book and trainings. The CBRC has also led a series
                                             of awareness raising activities among banks, as well as dialogues with multiple
                                             ministries, to channel information and technical know-how to banks to enable green
                                             lending.

                                          ¢¢ Mongolia. The Mongolian Bankers Association (MBA), representing all Mongolian
                                             banks, launched the Mongolia Sustainable Finance Principles and Sector Guidelines
                                             in December 2014, which took effect in January 2015. All participating banks have
                                             since developed internal E&S policies and procedures and have hired full-time E&S
                                             staff. The sector guidelines provide guidance to participating banks on how to assess
                                             potential E&S risks and opportunities in the agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and
                                             construction sectors, and assess the ability of clients to manage E&S issues. They
                                             also include guidance on E&S risk rating criteria for assessing and categorizing E&S
                                             risks, and encourage the adoption of relevant industry international standards and
                                             best practices.

                                     Financial industry organizations are also incorporating sustainability into their capacity
                                     building programs. The CFA Institute, the global association of investment professionals,
                                     is currently working to implement content on sustainability issues in the Level 1 CFA
                                     qualification, and is beginning to develop content at Levels 2 and 3 of the qualification exam,
                                     which address integration into valuation processes and portfolio decision making. Actions
                                     are also underway to integrate sustainability issues into the CFA Institute’s Certificate
                                     in Investment Performance Measurement (CIPM) to ensure integrity in performance
                                     measurement in addition to valuation.

                                     2.3.3	 Aligning Incentives in Financial Institutions

                                     Ultimately, the success of efforts to effectively integrate sustainability information into
                                     financial decision making is significantly influenced by the incentives that shape practice
                                     within FIs. If information is available, and readily understood by practitioners, transformation
                                     is contingent upon the core values, culture, and policies of firms—which at their core are
                                     motivated by incentive structures.

                                     Increased sustainability disclosure in financial markets contributes to help align incentives
. 44                                 across participants in the financial system. Taking advantage of the momentum gained
                                     from the work carried out by the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s TCFD, continued action
                                     is needed to support voluntary disclosure standards and climate risk assessments for

                                     banks and FIs, helping to better manage emerging physical and transition risks. Moreover,
                                     transparency lends itself to more consistent definitions for sustainable finance and green
                                     lending, bringing clarity for more innovative financial products. Although a number
                                     of banking regulators, central banks, and banking associations have introduced such
                                     definitions tailored to national context and reflecting international experience, more work
                                     in mainstreaming transparency can still be done. This approach will ensure the alignment of
                                     incentives between customers, investors, shareholders, and governments seeking to promote
                                     sustainable developments and financial institutions.
The cultural change needed in the transition to sustainable finance also requires an
appropriate alignment incentive within financial institutions. Although the first driver of any
cultural change is the mandate and strategy set by financial institutions’ senior management,
adequate mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that an orientation toward sustainability
permeates the organization. This requires incorporating sustainability targets into the usual
business key performance indicators to which officers in the institution are held accountable,
as well as ensuring that initiatives such as internal carbon pricing are used to direct business
units’ behavior.

Aligning compensation to sustainability targets is another powerful mechanism to align
incentives internally. For example, the use of risk-adjusted compensation in banking can be
expanded to incorporate sustainability risks and therefore ensure staff are provided with
the right incentives in their business development activities. This can be expanded to other
levels of the institution, not just business units, so that corporate procurement or facilities
management units’ performance measurement would include green indicators. Different
approaches and instruments are being used to correct for a short-term bias, but many are
relatively new—with unclear and inconsistent impacts on behavior. Approaches to aligning
incentives are still relatively new and include:

     ¢¢ Public policy action. In recent years, an increasing number of central banks, financial
        regulators, and policy makers have started working to align the rules governing the
        financial system with broader social purpose—including tackling incentive issues, but
        not from a sustainability perspective.

     ¢¢ Market leadership. Linking core business models and strategies to broader societal
        mandates will help address incentive issues in an inclusive manner.

Lessons can be obtained from the experience of ESG institutional investors. ESG investors
seek to tie compensation of their investment managers to the ESG performance of their
portfolios. More importantly, investment managers may use the alignment of executive
compensation to ESG considerations as screening criteria for investments. In 2012, the PRI
identified the linking of executive pay to ESG performance as critical to achieving the PRI’s
mission of fostering responsible investments; it recommended tying compensation to clear
metrics and disclosing the rationale and approach used to incorporate such ESG metrics into
executive pay. Using this framework, the PRI reviewed how ESG metrics are incorporated into
executive compensation in global utility and extractive industries, a sector particularly at risk
of unsustainable activities. Its analysis showed that, although more than 80 percent of the
firms analyzed (84 extractive and utility companies included in major stock indices in North
America, Europe, and Australia) in some manner tied ESG issues to compensation, only 28
percent did this using disclosed metrics and 37 percent had claw-back provisions (PRI 2016).

2.4	 CONCLUSIONS

The process of developing new products and greening existing ones in support of
sustainable finance will have to be accelerated to meet the increasing needs of the global
economy. Addressing information gaps will be essential to that process, with enhanced

                                     presenting only historic results and past performance to emphasizing the centrality of
                                     forward-looking material, which will be critical to enabling clients, investors, and other
                                     stakeholders to understand how well the institution is grappling with competing future
                                     trajectories. One striking result from the consultation undertaken by the TCFD was that “96%
                                     of respondents see scenario analysis as a key component of disclosure” (TCFD 2016, p. 8). A
                                     growing focus on the delivery of sustainability information by FIs themselves—for instance,
                                     disclosure of climate risks to investment portfolios—is broadening the base of end users
                                     beyond clients and shareholders.

                                     More and more, financial supervisors are requesting such information from firms as a way to
                                     better inform their view of safety and soundness in the face of environmental hazards and
                                     shocks. Information on environmental performance is also becoming increasingly important
                                     for consumers of financial services, who are seeking to align their savings and investments
                                     with a low-carbon future—a development exemplified by the reputational risks facing firms
                                     invested in high-carbon assets. Finally, such disclosure can be relevant for policy makers who
                                     are looking to glean insights into potential real economy implications of asset allocations,
                                     such as consequences for fiscal policy, as well as the effectiveness of energy, environmental,
                                     and economic policy.

                                     To accelerate the transformation of the financial system and the real economy toward a more
                                     environmentally friendly and sustainable path, fintech and various technological innovations
                                     will play a critical role. Regulators and financial policy makers will need to ensure that the
                                     development of fintech will continue to allow for disruption of inefficient and fossil fuel–
                                     intensive business models, products, and services, and instead offer products and services
                                     that are integrated with sustainability standards and meet consumer demand while providing
                                     platforms that help aggregate and reinforce the positive feedback loops. Additionally, to
                                     manage the potential downside risks and unintended consequences of fintech, regulators
                                     and financial policy makers need to start by engaging with innovators within the industry
                                     and begin identifying barriers to the successful scaling up of sustainability and fintech.

                                     FIs are changing the manner in which they operate to internalize sustainable finance into
                                     their business models and upgrade the sets of skills and incentives of staff to embed
                                     sustainability considerations into their culture. Although this may also require a certain level
                                     of regulatory prodding, current market-driven initiatives are moving in the right direction,
                                     and the increased transparency that enhanced information will provide will also boost the
. 46                                 incentive for FIs to move along this path.

                                                          government and the private sector.




3.1	 NATIONAL PUBLIC POLICY ACTIONS

The multiplicity of market failures that constitute barriers to sustainable finance require
governments to kick-start, sustain, and accelerate its development. In its seminal analysis
of climate change economics, Stern (2007) referred to climate change as “the greatest and
widest-ranging market failure ever seen.” To the degree that unsustainable growth paths
arise from externalities, governments have a role to play in addressing market failures that
prevent sustainable financial markets from developing.

3.1.1	 Five Basic Types of Market Failures

A full analysis of market failures associated with climate change and sustainability is beyond
the scope of this Roadmap, but it is important to highlight the shape that these failures, and
their associated costs, take with respect to financial markets.

       ¢¢ Negative externalities. This is the market failure most directly associated with climate
          change because the negative impact of marginal emissions is incorporated into
          prices. In the case of the financial system, this could lead to underpricing loans for
          activities contributing to climate change or could result in other impacts leading to
          unsustainable growth. In the case of climate change, these externalities are generally
          intertemporal (that is, the effects of emissions are cumulative so that the marginal
          negative effect will occur in the future)—unlike the negative externalities associated
          with pollution or some externalities associated with biodiversity destruction.

       ¢¢ Positive externalities. In both adaptation and mitigation activities, there is scope for
          substantial positive externalities. For example, agriculture projects can be structured
          to ensure that they also lead to carbon sequestration, thus mitigating their impact on

                                                                                                        .47
                                                           ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                              climate change (Sakuyama and Stringer 2006); or they can promote the management
                                              of certain crops in ways that reduce landslide risks arising from new weather patterns
                                              (Tompkins and Eakin 2012). However, the additional efforts needed to achieve these
                                              benefits are, in fact, costs that would decrease a project’s overall return on investment
                                              and that could lead to its rejection by potential financiers.

                                           ¢¢ Information asymmetries. Particularly in credit markets, information asymmetries are
                                              both the raison d’être and a source of costs for the financial sector. Although many
                                              new types of information asymmetries are found in climate financing, a key example
                                              is the lack of financing for new firms with innovative approaches to climate change
                                              mitigation, such as battery technology firms and energy service companies (ESCOs).
                                              In the case of ESCOs—firms that provide other companies with know-how and
                                              technologies to increase energy efficiency—they or their customers have difficulty
                                              accessing financing because banks do not have the expertise to analyze project
                                              proposals, firms generally lack physical assets that can be used as collateral, and
                                              there is the perception that the materialization of extra resources (that is, cash flows
                                              from energy savings) still depends on unproved technologies (Econoler 2011).

                                           ¢¢ Coordination costs. Institutional investors’ growing interest in environmental,
                                              social, and governance (ESG) approaches as a mechanism to influence real sector
                                              companies reflects an effort to overcome coordination costs, which in the past
                                              have prevented institutional investors from being involved in the management of
                                              firms (Black 1998). Additional efforts to develop disclosure standards would further
                                              facilitate this process. Similarly, coordination costs can prevent the development of
                                              long-term financing, particularly in developing countries that have weaker creditor
                                              rights. Given the long-term nature of many climate change mitigation projects, such
                                              as green energy generation, this leads to credit constraints in this sector.

                                           ¢¢ Incentive problems. Bank managers and asset fund managers tend to be judged on
                                              short-term results, a situation that further exacerbates the bias against longer-term
                                              projects related to sustainable finance.15

                                     3.1.2	 Intervention Types: Public Finance and Policy

                                     Governments can support the development of sustainable finance through the use of public
. 48                                 finance or through policies and regulations. Though these two types of actions are not
                                     completely independent, the rest of this section divides government measures into these
                                     two categories.

                                     3.2	 PUBLIC FINANCE MEASURES

                                     Government responses with fiscal implications can be categorized into four categories
                                     depending on the area of involvement and instruments. Figure 3.1 categorizes government
                                     interventions in support of sustainable finance that imply financial outlays or revenues
                                     forsaken. This is not meant to be a full catalog of potential interventions, but a categorization
                                     15 Martinez Peria and Schmukler (2017) present a discussion and literature review of the impact of coordination
                                     costs and incentives on the availability of long-term financing.
that can guide the development of specific national approaches.16 The first (horizontal)
dimension refers to whether or not actions are taken directly in support of the financial
system or whether they seek to support the real sector of the economy or other parts of
the government to facilitate their engagement with the financial sector. The second axis
(vertical) categorizes them according to the mechanism used: direct financing, which
includes risk sharing mechanisms; or activities in support of the “enabling environment” that
would facilitate the operation of a sustainable financial system.

Quadrant I: Financing and risk sharing in the financial sector. These interventions are aimed
at directly addressing market failures that prevent the development of complete markets
that allocate resources to sustainable finance activities. In many cases, this is done through
public financial institutions that provide longer-term financing than is otherwise available in
private markets; act as second-tier institutions, providing resources for on-lending to banks
and specialized financial institutions (blended finance); or facilitate the leveraging of balance
sheets of financial providers through the issuance of guarantees and other risk sharing
mechanisms. Rather than providing direct financing, the government can also provide
matching grants that are then leveraged by financing from private financial institutions
(FIs). This category also includes governments’ use of their resources to facilitate innovative
transactions that are meant to serve as “proof-of-concept” and trigger the development
of new instruments. Governments can also foster the development of new instruments by
providing tax-advantaged treatment of interest and other income received by investors
when proceeds are used for eligible sustainable activities.

                                     Quadrant II: Financing and risk sharing outside the financial sector. This category includes
                                     programs that, while not directly tied to the financial sector, indirectly facilitate recipients’
                                     access to financing, contribute to building assets that can be used as collateral, and
                                     generally stimulate demand for green assets—thus contributing to increased financial sector
                                     involvement with producers and consumers of those assets. Examples include development
                                     grants for research and development for small and medium enterprises providing greening
                                     services such as ESCOs, tax exemptions associated with investments in green assets such as
                                     installing of household photovoltaic energy systems, and government procurement policies
                                     providing preferential treatment to suppliers committed to energy efficient practices.

                                     support the development of elements of the sustainable finance infrastructure that have
                                     some characteristics of public goods or that private sector stakeholders may not be willing
                                     to develop because they do not see sufficient returns on their investment. For example,
                                     governments can work jointly with national banking associations to develop training
                                     programs for commercial loan officers to review and underwrite new financial sustainable
                                     financial instruments such as green mortgages (that is, mortgages associated with energy-
                                     efficient buildings) or to structure bankable green projects.

                                     Quadrant IV: Support to the enabling environment outside the financial sector. This category
                                     of intervention is generally geared toward addressing information asymmetry problems and
                                     coordination costs not necessarily within the financial sector. For example, governments
                                     aggregate and make available information that would facilitate green project underwriting,
                                     such as weather and climate data and real estate transaction information associated with
                                     green buildings. This type of intervention also includes supporting ongoing efforts to define
                                     disclosure standards of environmental risks in the real sector, where the government could
                                     subsidize the process of developing and disseminating such standards.

                                     3.2.1	 The Role of Government Entities

                                     Selecting the appropriate government entity to execute these interventions is key to success.
                                     Governments play different roles in the financial system. Besides their role as regulator
                                     and supervisor—discussed in the next section—governments are also owners of financial
                                     institutions. This role is particularly important for Quadrant I interventions, which are
                                     carried out through existing institutions or, particularly in countries lacking an established
. 50                                 development or policy-oriented government bank, new green banks. Governments are also
                                     institutional investors through their role as central bankers and, in some cases, as managers
                                     of pension funds or sovereign wealth funds whose actions can contribute to facilitate

                                     the flow of funds toward sustainable activities. Finally—in what is probably their most
                                     obvious role—governments are service providers, and in that role they can channel much
                                     of the nonfinancial support described above. Close coordination between financial sector
                                     authorities and line ministries is essential to achieve results. For example, developing and
                                     rolling out criteria to identify green mortgages requires the close involvement of housing
                                     and construction government agencies to ensure that standards requirements are technically
                                     sound, verifiable, and aligned with global criteria.
3.2.2	 The Role of International Financial Institutions in Facilitating National
       Public Policy Interventions

International financial institutions (IFIs) also play a key role in supporting governments in
deploying resources in support of sustainable finance. Governments also can rely on IFIs
to support them in the design and execution of policies in support of sustainable finance,
leveraging their multiple roles. IFIs can play four roles in support of these interventions:

     ¢¢ Facilitating the development of the enabling environment for sustainable finance.
        Both internationally and nationally, IFIs have played a key role in developing and
        strengthening elements of the financial infrastructure, including credit bureaus and
        registries, payment systems and remittances, and standards of financial information.
        Integrating sustainability considerations into financial infrastructure is essential to
        successfully mainstream sustainable finance. For example, the initiative on green
        tagging described in Box 2.1 could be the basis for identifying green assets in credit
        reporting; this would facilitate the development of credit ratings and efficient pricing,
        and ultimately would help boost an increase in the origination of this type of asset.

     ¢¢ Providing long-term financing bundled with technical support. IFIs are providing
        long-term financing, which is needed to meet the maturity required for sustainable
        projects. Unlike commercial lenders, IFIs can also accompany governments as
        providers of technical advice during the entire project cycle, from the development
        of requests for proposals and technical requirements to its operation and evaluation.

     ¢¢ Supporting innovative transactions. IFIs have been instrumental in kick-starting some
        of the sustainable finance markets. For example, the World Bank and a private Swedish
        bank, SE Banken, responded to demand from institutional investors to structure and
        issue one of the first green bonds in 2008. The World Bank has since continued to
        expand the range of financial instruments related to climate financing, including by
        establishing regional facilities for disaster insurance in the Caribbean and the Pacific
        and supporting Malaysia in issuing the first Sharia-compliant green bond in June 2017.

     ¢¢ Global knowledge sharing and convening. IFIs also play an important role facilitating
        the process of scaling up successful interventions and sharing experiences among
        countries.

3.2.3	 Approach to Selecting Public Finance Interventions

The process of developing national roadmaps should include an approach to select public
finance interventions. The selection of needed government interventions should depend on
an assessment that identifies unmet needs of the real sector, market failures that prevent
the development of sustainable finance, and the level of development of national financial
systems. Additionally, countries need to assess the level of fiscal space available to support
interventions and the capacity of existing government institutions to design and manage
programs to ensure that the appropriate agencies are involved. Figure 3.2 summarizes this
approach, highlighting the type of analysis and questions that need to be addressed at each
step of the process.

                                                                                                     .51

                                     3.2.4	The Other Side of Public Finance: Addressing Flows to Unsustainable
                                           Activities

                                     This section has discussed approaches to using public resources to facilitate the flow of
                                     capital toward sustainable activities. However, it is equally important to assess the role that
                                     governments can play in the opposite direction by allocating resources to unsustainable
                                     activities, which have other public policy objectives. The most salient of these is the
                                     provision of fossil fuel subsidies. In addition to multiple drawbacks particularly related to
                                     equity and efficiency associated with fuel subsidies, the resultant decrease in fossil fuel
                                     prices leads to their overconsumption and to a resulting disincentive to develop green
. 52                                 projects, particularly with respect to low-emissions energy (Merrill et al. 2015). There is
                                     substantial momentum to address this issue, and the recent decrease in oil prices has
                                     facilitated this process (Kojima 2016)—not only as a measure to improve fiscal sustainability

                                     but also as part of the process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with 13 countries
                                     mentioning fossil fuel subsidy reform in their NationallyDetermined Contribution (NDC)
                                     submitted in the run up to the Paris Agreement (Terton et al. 2015). In addition to fossil
                                     fuel subsidies, governments are already undertaking a broader review of their public
                                     expenditures to identify and address flows to unsustainable activities, in many cases with
                                     technical support of the International Monetary Fund. The World Bank has also developed
                                     an approach to this process for climate change–related activities that is being incorporated
                                     into the public expenditures reviews carried out periodically by its member countries
                                     (World Bank 2014).
3.3	 FINANCIAL POLICY AND REGULATION

Around the world, public authorities are deepening efforts to align financial systems with
sustainable development.

3.3.1	 The Rationale for Policy and Regulatory Action

Public authorities—including governments, central banks, regulators, supervisors, and other
bodies—are taking legislative, policy, regulatory, and supervisory steps to achieve a range of
objectives linking sustainability and the financial system, such as:

     ¢¢ Enhancing market practice, including efforts that mainstream environmental factors
        into financial decision making and correct for market failures (such unpriced
        environmental externalities);

     ¢¢ Supporting market growth, including policy frameworks and standards that promote
        the issuance of green financial products (that is, green bonds and securities), the
        development of new market platforms (that is, crowdfunding and fintech), or the
        competitiveness of financial centers;

     ¢¢ Promoting transparency and efficiency, by improving flows of sustainability
        information through the financial system through voluntary guidance, labeling
        schemes, or mandatory requirements;

     ¢¢ Strengthening risk management, often by integrating environmental factors (such as
        physical and transition-related climate risks) into the prudential oversight of financial
        institutions, supervising financial markets, and providing sector and system-level
        stress testing;

     ¢¢ Facilitating flows and services, with investment and lending to priority sectors,
        restrictions or limitations on financing, insurance requirements, or the provision of
        financial services as a way to promote inclusion and support development;

     ¢¢ Clarifying legal frameworks, including the fiduciary responsibilities of financial institutions,
        with respect to long-term risks and opportunities (such as climate change); and

     ¢¢ Enhancing conduct and behavior, with codes of conduct and guidelines for
        environmental issues and compacts with FIs.

3.3.2	 Categories of Public Action

Public action on sustainable finance priorities can be broken down into two main categories:

     ¢¢ Enhancing the alignment of financial institutions and markets with sustainability
        outcomes, looking across environmental (that is, climate and pollution), economic
        (that is, sustainable growth), and social (that is, financial inclusion and livelihoods
        resilience) dimensions; and

                                                                                                           .53
                                                            ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                           ¢¢ Understanding and managing the impacts of sustainability factors (such as climate
                                              risks and opportunities) on financial institutions, markets, consumers, and the
                                              macroeconomy.

                                     3.3.3	 The Fundamental Relevance of Sustainability Factors

                                     There is growing awareness of the fundamental relevance of sustainability factors to the
                                     core statutory obligations and mandates of financial authorities (Table 3.1). At the same time,
                                     there is increasing recognition of the critical importance of financial sector alignment for the
                                     achievement of sustainable development objectives across real economy policy frameworks,
                                     from small and medium enterprise finance to infrastructure planning. In developing countries,
                                     public authorities are leveraging the financial system to achieve national development
                                     objectives, including abatement of pollution, financial inclusion, and disaster resilience. In
                                     developed countries, an increasing number of supervisors, regulators, and central bank
                                     governors have publicly recognized the potential for sustainability factors—such as climate
                                     change—to hold implications for the resilience of firms and functioning of markets.

                                     3.4	 THE GLOBAL POLICY AND REGULATORY LANDSCAPE OF
                                           SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

                                     Public intervention in the financial sector to promote sustainability has a long history.
                                     Instances of public interventions started with early frameworks for ethical and socially
                                     responsible investment in the 1990s, and included basic guidelines for the disclosure of
                                     environmental information in corporate reporting. Following the financial crisis, a growing
                                     number of public authorities began taking action on sustainability, leading to a steady
                                     expansion in the number, scope, and typologies of measures. Research conducted by UN
                                     Environment has found nearly 300 policy and regulatory measures in place as of October
                                     2017, implemented in over 60 countries.17 Growth in measures has averaged roughly 20
                                     percent year on year since 2010—with an increase of roughly 30 percent since July 2016.

                                     One of the most significant changes in recent years has been a major increase in system-
                                     level measures—including major policy packages to advance sustainable finance across
                                     asset classes. Of particular note are China’s 2016 Green Finance Guidelines (PBoC 2016b),
                                     which set out specific provisions to incentivize and promote green loans, green bonds,
                                     green funds, green insurance, and mandatory environmental information disclosures. Recent
. 54                                 years have seen a marked increase in international measures, as sustainable finance has
                                     been taken up by international standard-setting institutions and regional bodies such as
                                     the European Commission. In addition, there has been a major increase in policy measures

                                     focused on specific asset classes (that is, securities markets), which are relevant to a broad

                                     3.5.1	 Disclosure

                                     Approximately 30 percent of all policy and regulatory measures on sustainable finance
                                     implemented by public authorities are focused on disclosure.18 Governments in leading
                                     financial economies—such as the United Kingdom—were first movers in setting out mandatory
                                     corporate environmental reporting as part of exchange listing requirements. Over the last
                                     two years, public authorities have scaled up action, implementing frameworks across asset
                                     classes. The majority of these efforts have been either to build the information base necessary
                                     for green finance markets to develop or to build transparency on future risks and evaluate
                                     alignment with the low-carbon transition (Box 3.1).


                                       Box 3.1   	Enhancing Disclosure on Climate Risk in France and California
                                       France: In August 2015, France set out the world’s most ambitious disclosure regime
                                       under Article 173 of the French Energy Transition Law. The provisions of its Article
                                       173 require institutional investors (more than 800 entities) to disclose information on
                                       their risk management of climate change consequences and to take into account their
                                       environmental footprint in their investment policy. In addition, larger institutions should
                                       notably describe how their investment policy has been affected by the outcome of the
                                       analysis process, and how it will contribute to the overall objective of limiting global
                                       warming. The French government implemented these requirements with considerable
                                       freedom for firms in their responses, considering flexibility to be a supportive element
                                       for the institutional innovation necessary to meet the complex challenges inherent in
                                       examining alignment with the low-carbon transition. In October 2016, global insurer AXA
                                       received the top award for the best investor climate-related disclosures, in a competition
                                       organized by the French Ministry of Environment (AXA Group 2016). An assessment
                                       by the government of the new disclosure framework regarding insurance companies is
                                       planned by the end of 2018.

                                       California: In the United States, the California Department of Insurance was instrumental
                                       in the decision by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to introduce
                                       the world’s first climate risk disclosure survey for the insurance sector in 2009. In
                                       2016 California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones implemented the Climate Risk
                                       Carbon Initiative, which set out new requirements for insurance firms to disclose their
                                       investments in fossil fuel enterprises (including thermal coal, oil, gas, and utilities).

 UN ENVIRONMENT – WORLD BANK GROUP




                                     There is increasing recognition across jurisdictions that sustainability factors—such as climate
                                     change—may be material for the solvency of firms, safety of markets, and stability of the
                                     financial system as a whole. Public authorities are responding to these challenges in different
                                     ways, including by assessing exposure to sustainability risks, integrating environmental
                                     factors into the oversight of firms and markets, and implementing new requirements. For
                                     example:

                                     18 UN Environment Inquiry internal database.
     ¢¢ Australia. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority stated its views on climate
        change as a “material” physical and transition risk that it will consider much more
        closely in its monitoring of banks, insurers, and asset managers (Summerhayes 2017).

     ¢¢ Brazil. BACEN, the Brazilian Central Bank, issued guidelines on integrated risk
        management—including environmental risk—at the end of March 2017, building on its
        2014 requirements for firms to have environmental and social risk system in place.

     ¢¢ China. Environmental risk analysis is a key component of China’s “Guidelines for
        Establishing the Green Financial System,” with a focus on stress testing led by the
        Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking (PBoC 2016b).

     ¢¢ France. In February 2017, a synthesis report by DG Trésor, Banque de France and
        Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution was published on climate-related
        risks assessment in the banking sector with a view to providing banks with a
        framework and guidance on how to develop their expertise going forward (French
        Treasury 2017).

     ¢¢ Germany. In 2016, the Federal Ministry of Finance released a commissioned research
        report on the potential impact of climate change on financial market stability
        (German Finance Ministry 2016).

     ¢¢ Netherlands. Since 2014, the Dutch central bank has considered financial and
        macroeconomic risks related to climate change in its assessment of soundness of
        major financial institutions (Box 3.2).

3.5.3	 Reallocation

Action by public authorities to promote capital reallocation toward sustainable investments
has been widespread, with instruments ranging from policies that support the growth of
green financial markets to policy-directed lending. Efforts to enhance information are often
a key component. A key example is the new frameworks for development and issuance of
green financial products in countries such as China and Japan (MOEJ 2017); and also in
subnational levels, such as California (Chiang 2017). Recently, in India, the Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issued disclosure requirements for the issuing and listing of
green debt securities (SEBI 2017), while in Indonesia, regulator OJK announced it will launch
a framework and introduce regulation for green bond issuance in Indonesia in 2017 (Jong
2017). The evolution of secondary markets is now coming into focus, with France authorizing
the launch of the first green bonds as well as an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) tracking a
portfolio of 116 investment grade green bonds in March 2017 (Lord 2017).

One interesting focus emerging for policy makers is at the consumer interface, seen in
instruments to build awareness and transparency around sustainable investment option for
everyday consumers. In France, the “the energy and ecology transition for climate” label was
launched in November 2016 to help identify green investment funds, linked to broader policy
package implemented under Article 173 (see Box 3.1).

                                     DNB, the Dutch central bank, first examined financial risks relating to climate change in
                                     2014, in response to a request from the Dutch parliament. In 2016, it completed a deeper
                                     assessment of the macroeconomic implications of the energy transition—considered by
                                     DNB to be “one of the greatest challenges that the economy faces in the long term.” For
                                     the study, DNB undertook primary research based on survey data from three major banks,
                                     five insurers, and three pension funds dominant in each market segment. Gathering these
                                     data enabled DNB to quantify the capital exposure of financial firms to carbon-intensive
                                     sectors, looking across asset equity, debt, and other holdings (Figure B3.2.1).

3.5.4	Capacities

Public bodies are also making efforts to increase sustainability capabilities in the financial
sector. National governments are acknowledging the importance of skills and capabilities in
supporting broader processes to align financial systems with sustainable development:

     ¢¢ Certain countries have specifically identified the importance of practitioner training
        to support the success of broader green finance initiatives. For example, in China,
        the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has specifically recommended training for
        investors and the promotion of green investment education as a central objective for
        a proposed Green Investor Network (UN Environment Inquiry and PBoC 2015).

     ¢¢ In France, a 2013 White Paper on Financing the Ecological Transition puts forward
        a range of measures to “re-centre the behavioural set of stakeholder practices
        around the objectives of ecological transition and funding,” including action to
        train fund trustees and financial intermediaries in technological and environmental
        risk assessment methodologies (Ministry of Economy & Ministry of Ecology and
        Sustainable Development 2013).

     ¢¢ Other countries are taking steps to improve the professional capacities of regulators
        with regard to climate and sustainability issues. In Indonesia, the financial services
        authority (OJK) has prepared a Roadmap for Sustainable Finance Implementation
        Plan that specifically identifies “the provision of environmental analysts trainings”
        as a roadmap action; a target of training 1,000–2,000 members of financial services
        institutions (FSIs), OJK officials, and OJK supervisors between 2015 and 2019 has
        been set (OJK 2014).

     ¢¢ In Switzerland, the Swiss government has recognized that “an indispensable and
        transversal requirement for facilitating the alignment of the financial system with
        sustainable development is a paradigm shift in business, economics and finance
        education” (Swiss Confederation 2015).

3.5.5	 Financial Institutions’ Fiduciary Duties

An increasing number of public authorities are considering ways in which environmental
factors may relate to the core responsibilities and duties of financial institutions to
shareholders and consumers. Legislators are re-examining how the frameworks governing
these responsibilities may constrain the capacity of institutions to act, which is leading to
clarifications and reforms. For example, the United Kingdom followed a multiyear process
that began with an independent legal commission examining ESG consideration within
fiduciary duties (The Law Commission 2014). The Pensions Regulator clarified in July 2016
that ESG material issues, including environmental issues, should be taken into account by
pension fund trustees (The Pensions Regulator 2016). Recently, the Canadian Association of
Pension Supervisory Authorities amended its guidance in February 2017 to list ESG issues
as typical risks to be evaluated by pension trustees (Thomas 2017). Other examples include:




                                                                                                    .59
                                                       ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                          ¢¢ China. The Securities Regulatory Commission publicly encouraged Chinese investors
                                             to become Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) signatories in October 2016.

                                          ¢¢ Germany. The federal state of Berlin introduced a sustainability index to reallocate its
                                             pension fund investments as of 2017.

                                          ¢¢ Singapore. The Monetary Authority of Singapore supported the development of the
                                             Stewardship Principles for Responsible Investors, which were launched in November
                                             2016 (Stewardship Asia 2016).

                                     Aligning the fiduciary duties of FIs with sustainability considerations in fact highlights
                                     the close interaction of market- and nationally driven initiatives. For example, a number
                                     of real sector corporations and FIs are seeking to align their activities with the successful
                                     implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement
                                     with particular emphasis on reviewing the sustainability of its supply and production chains.
                                     Others are using results-based financing to “crowd-in” private financing into climate change
                                     financing (World Bank 2017).

                                     3.6	 NATIONAL ROADMAPS

                                     A growing number of countries are developing sustainable financial system policy
                                     frameworks. However, these are often not joined up or focused in a strategic way.
                                     Furthermore, action to deliver the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on climate change will
                                     need to involve a systemic approach to the financing challenge. For example, Agenda
                                     2030 identifies the need for “integrated national financing frameworks.” As part of the
                                     implementation of the Paris Agreement, the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions
                                     (INDCs) submitted in 2015 will need to be translated into more granular climate investment
                                     plans or green finance strategies.

                                     National sustainable finance roadmaps have been launched in many countries over the past
                                     year. These identify system-wide needs, barriers to scaling up, and priority actions. Examples
                                     of these countries include Argentina, China, Indonesia, Italy, Mongolia, Morocco, Nigeria,
                                     Singapore, and South Africa. The specific mix of policy-led, market-led, and public-private
                                     initiatives in each country is a function of national development priorities and, as such, varies
                                     considerably. However, all have at their core the development of long-term, systemic plans to
. 60                                 enhance the ability of the financial system to mainstream ESG factors into decision making
                                     and to mobilize predominantly private capital for sustainable investment.

                                     Case studies highlight different national approaches to sustainable finance roadmaps. A
                                     diversity of approaches to roadmap design is evident in the case studies compiled for
                                     this Roadmap, despite their common goal of mobilizing new sustainable investment and
                                     mainstreaming sustainability considerations into financial decision making. For example,
                                     Brazil has focused on building broad coalitions in support of sustainable finance, China has
                                     reinforced early private sector momentum with a comprehensive public policy framework,
                                     and Russia has made extensive use of public-private partnerships to build new markets in
                                     areas such as energy efficiency. In most cases, the national roadmaps have been anchored
                                     to a broader policy objective (Figure 3.3) that has facilitated the process of policy design
and contributed to building a broad coalition in support of the transformation to sustainable
finance. A summary of these national roadmaps is in Appendix B at the end of this document.

The emerging practice of developing national roadmaps indicates an increasing focus on
how financial system reform can support the sustainability transition in the real economy.
Countries are starting to make explicit links between action in the financial system and the
realization of broader goals for sustainable development. What began as a series of tactical
steps in response to specific sustainability issues has started to become more strategic.
Traditionally, sectoral policies to deliver sustainability (for example, in clean energy or in
agriculture) have largely ignored the need to consider the complementary role that financial
reform can play to deliver effectiveness. The emergence of national sustainable finance
roadmaps points to a change in this worldview.

National sustainable finance roadmaps encompass 10 broad components. Based on an
analysis of existing national roadmaps as well as engagement with stakeholders in other
countries currently undertaking this process, roadmaps for sustainable finance are more
likely to enjoy broad support and increase their opportunity of success if they include the
following key components:

                                                                                                             .61
                                                                ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                     ¢¢ Identifying the narrative. This section of the roadmap outlines why a national
                                        financial system needs to be aligned with national sustainable development
                                        outcomes. Countries will have different starting points linked to national priorities;
                                        different individual, institutional, or structural drivers of change; and different
                                        capacities. A new narrative that has sustainability at its core can also be a response
                                        to factors that include global nudges from international bodies; bottom-up initiatives
                                        at subnational, national, or regional levels; or disruption caused by new technologies
                                        or business models. The narrative should clearly set out the opportunity a
                                        sustainable financial system can help deliver as well as the scope of key terms such
                                        as financial system and sustainable development in a national context.

                                     ¢¢ Assessing overall needs. This section describes the national sustainable finance
                                        requirements over a particular time period, as well as the magnitude of business-as-
                                        usual flows to high-carbon sectors. The needs assessment will also cover the broad
                                        financial characteristics of each major component—such as infrastructure or energy
                                        efficiency—within the national sustainable financing requirement such as the ratio of
                                        public to private finance, debt to equity ratios, and the tenor of finance required, as
                                        well as typical transaction sizes.

                                     ¢¢ Estimating necessary flows. To understand the magnitude of the challenge, this
                                        element estimates sustainable finance stocks and flows to generate a directional
                                        estimate of the investment gap. It is unlikely that these data will come from any
                                        single source; proxies and approximations will also probably be required.

                                     ¢¢ Identifying potential barriers. Barriers can hinder the flow of sustainable finance and
                                        investment at the level of the financial system or the enterprise. At either level, they
                                        can either be generic (such as underdeveloped capital markets or remuneration
                                        policies that incentivize short-termism) or they can be specific to sustainable finance
                                        (such as a lack of clarity over sustainable finance definitions, or information about
                                        sustainable projects and sectors might be poor).

                                     ¢¢ Aligning with international experience. Any sustainable finance roadmap would be
                                        firmly aligned with national priorities and would involve clear domestic leadership.
                                        Where appropriate, however, evolving international practice in sustainable financial
                                        system development could be considered.

                                     ¢¢ Building scenarios. The financial system is in a constant state of flux. This fluidity
                                        makes predictions about its future path risky. However, failing to take into account
 UN ENVIRONMENT – WORLD BANK GROUP




                                        possible future scenarios for the financial system means potentially failing to take
                                        into account possible risks and opportunities. Change can be driven by many factors,
                                        including changes to the national or international governance of the financial system
                                        or from disruption caused by digital innovation.

                                     ¢¢ Identifying suitable measures. The specific measures that might make a national
                                        financial system more effective, efficient, and resilient are a function of a number of
                                        factors. Structurally, the architecture of the national financial system will theoretically
                                        determine what might be most appropriate, but international experience indicates
        that factors such as capacity, ease of implementation, and the identification of
        an individual or institutional champion will also determine what measures are
        prioritized. Common measures include those related to disclosure, business
        practices, financial instruments, and knowledge-sharing networks.

     ¢¢ Sequencing of measures and priorities. Pivoting from tactical innovation to a more
        systemic approach to sustainable financing at a national level will reveal sequencing
        issues. Clear definitions or criteria might need to be agreed upon through a
        multistakeholder process before relevant financial instruments can be scaled up,
        for example. Similarly, consideration should be paid to trade-offs between ease of
        implementation and the potential effectiveness of a particular measure that might
        lead to the prioritization of certain measures.

     ¢¢ Building capacity. Aligning the financial system with sustainable development will
        require capacity building because new competencies and capabilities will need to be
        developed in key areas. New institutional configurations, such as those related to the
        scope of financial policy makers’ and regulators’ mandates, along with their interface
        with other policy institutions, might need to be addressed.

     ¢¢ Measuring progress. There is growing recognition that progress toward aligning the
        financial system with sustainable development must be measured. Existing data
        are often fragmented, incomplete, and do not allow for effective analysis within a
        country or between countries. An effective framework for measuring progress can
        help highlight areas for market, policy, or regulatory improvement and can also help
        assess the effectiveness of measures that have been introduced.

There is no single formula for developing national sustainable finance roadmaps. However, all
have at their core an inclusive multistakeholder process spanning the public sector, private
sector and civil society. Working groups consisting of subject experts examining measures
related to specific topics are also a common feature of the process. The UN Environment
Inquiry has developed an online Sustainable Finance Diagnostic Toolkit with embedded
resources to help countries develop the core material for each of the 10 components outlined
above (see also Box 3.3).

3.7	 CONCLUSIONS
The richness of national initiatives in support of sustainable finance reflects a broad
commitment to facilitate its development and promote government involvement to address
structural obstacles. Most of these initiatives have had the support of far-reaching coalitions
of multiple government agencies and other public and private sector financial sector
stakeholders. However, governments lack a systematic approach to identifying market
failures and designing viable policy and fiscal interventions to trigger the development
of sustainable finance markets. The development of national roadmaps, which several
countries are already implementing, constitutes an opportunity to more strategically—
and systematically—approach the design of sustainable financial systems. The design of a
framework to prepare these roadmaps will be critical to facilitate their design and adoption
by a larger number of countries.

                                     Since 2014, the UN Environment Inquiry has built up a body of knowledge on how
                                     countries are aligning the rules that govern the financial system with sustainable
                                     development. The 2016 Inquiry annual report identifies more than 200 separate
                                     measures in 60 countries across banking, capital markets, insurance, investment, and the
                                     financial system as a whole.

                                     With the demand rising, the Inquiry has pulled together the experience to date
                                     in systematic form, which has led to the development of the Sustainable Finance
                                     Diagnostic Toolkit. This can be used by stakeholders at the start of the process of
                                     developing a national sustainable finance toolkit. The toolkit can help develop a
                                     sustainable finance status report, structured using the 10-step framework described
                                     above. This status report can be a key input that will feed into the discussions around
                                     the development of national sustainable finance roadmap.

                                     The Sustainable Finance Diagnostic Toolkit is designed to be a flexible platform and will
                                     be regularly updated as ongoing work brings to light new knowledge, approaches, and
                                     data. More information on the Sustainable Finance Diagnostic Toolkit can be found at

4.1	 GLOBAL COORDINATION AND PRINCIPLES

Meaningful global action requires global principles that can guide concerted international,
national, and market-driven progress toward a sustainable financial system. Achieving
sustainable development is, by its own nature, a global challenge because no country can
be on a long-term sustainable path alone given the interconnectedness of problems such as
climate change, communicable diseases, and biodiversity loss. The transition to sustainable
finance is driven by country-level initiatives; continued transformation along this path should
remain anchored in such bottom-up approaches to ensure that the ultimate structure of
sustainable financial systems and the pace of change are adapted to country needs and the
current state of development of national financial systems. However, agreeing on key global
guiding principles can contribute to keeping the momentum of the ongoing transformation
of the financial system and can magnify the efficiency and effectiveness of ongoing and
future national, international, and market-driven initiatives. Potential benefits from agreeing
on a set of global principles include the ability to:

        1.	 Guide the design and implementation of national roadmaps to sustainable
            finance. National initiatives have been developed in relative isolation from each
            other, and there have been limited opportunities for cross-pollination between
            countries and/or markets while lessons are being learned. Building a sustainable
            financial system needs to be driven by the needs of society at large, and
            therefore the process involves a very broad set of stakeholders that go beyond
            financial sector policy makers and institutions. This makes the development of
            national roadmaps a complex process that could benefit from broad principles

                                                                                                        .65
                                                         ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                               to guide their development and facilitate the process of bringing together
                                               stakeholders with very different backgrounds.

                                           2.	 Facilitate coordination across multiple international efforts to expedite the creation
                                               of a global sustainable financial system. Global cooperative efforts to create a
                                               sustainable financial system include initiatives to establish principles that have
                                               generally targeted specific parts of the financial sector (such as banks or stock
                                               exchanges) or that respond to the needs of a subset of stakeholders (for example,
                                               institutional investors). However, these efforts lack a comprehensive approach that
                                               can bring together all components of the financial system and ensure alignment
                                               of efforts and synergies that ultimately will lead to an increase in sustainable
                                               financial flows. For example, the issuance of green bonds by international financial
                                               institutions (IFIs) whose returns are tied to environmental, social, and governance
                                               (ESG) indices—such as the World Bank’s Green Growth Bonds19—contribute to
                                               not only increase the flow of sustainable finance to the issuer but more broadly
                                               promote the growth and importance of ESG equity indices.

                                           3.	 Facilitate the integration of sustainable finance considerations into existing
                                               international finance oversight and regulatory frameworks. General global
                                               principles have been used successfully to develop other aspects of the financial
                                               sector, including banking supervision, capital adequacy, payment systems, and
                                               remittances. A sustainable financial system will have to be embedded in many
                                               of these initiatives and the existence of global principles can facilitate this
                                               process. Ongoing initiatives such as the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on
                                               Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the efforts of the International
                                               Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) to assess climate change–related risk
                                               in the insurance sector are already part of this process.

                                           4.	 Contribute to establishing a common definition of sustainable finance and some
                                               of the different forms it can take. The concept of sustainable finance is relatively
                                               new and its definition is still evolving, with different organizations and initiatives
                                               having different understandings of the concepts that it encompasses. In many
                                               cases, the differences between the terms sustainable, green, and climate finance,
                                               and between ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investment criteria
                                               and impact investment are not fully understood. Clarifying the differences
. 66                                           and relationship between these concepts can contribute to aligning national,
                                               international, and market-based efforts.

                                           5.	 Enhance the credibility of market-driven innovation and measurement of
                                               progress. The establishment of global principles can contribute to ensuring a
                                               common understanding of the policy and market developments that need to
                                               take place to meet the sustainability challenges the world faces. Such principles
                                               are also critical to ensuring the credibility of policies and instruments to be
                                               developed and to aggregating national actions to measure global results in the
                                               transition to a sustainable financial sector. For example, savers, investors, financial

          institutions, and financial regulators across the world require assurance that
          labels such as green bonds or ESG investment fund share key common principles
          across multiple jurisdictions.

Establishing general principles does not imply standardization but rather an alignment of
efforts. It is important to emphasize that agreeing on certain principles is very different from
trying to standardize measures to develop a sustainable financial system across countries
or even across different parts of the financial sector. Certainly the needs of developed
countries with deep financial markets are very different from those of developing countries
with substantial financially underserved populations. Similarly, efforts to develop sustainable
banking in the retail segment are very different from efforts targeting large institutional
investors and capital markets. The approach to develop these principles presented in this
section aim to follow the one previously used in other components of the financial sector
to guide and facilitate the development of initiatives and policies aligned toward a common
global goal. Agreement on these principles does not imply the creation of new standards
but rather the incorporation of sustainability consideration into existing ones. Examples of
such existing principles include the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision,
the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems, and the G20 Principles for
Innovative Financial Inclusion.20

4.1.1	 Existing International Initiatives Related to Sustainable Finance
       Principles

In 2016, both the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) had raised the issue of
sustainability to the forefront of the international financial sector dialogue. The policy
dialogue at such bodies has focused on enhancing flows of sustainability information within
the financial system, setting out new voluntary standards and policy options with immediate
relevance for firms and public authorities.

Under its 2016 G20 Presidency, China launched the Green Finance Study Group (GFSG) to
develop options for how to enhance the ability of the financial system to mobilize private
capital for green investment. At the 2016 Hangzhou Summit, G20 heads of state for the
first time recognized the need to “scale up green finance” and endorsed a set of options to
achieve this goal—with information elements, such as product standards, established as a
core aspect of frameworks to promote the development of markets for green assets (such as
green bonds). In 2017, the GFSG concentrated its efforts on the information agenda with two
specific research tracks: Enhancing Environmental Risk Assessment in Financial Decision-
Making (UN Environment Inquiry 2017a), and Improving the Availability and Usefulness of
Publicly Available Environmental Data for Financial Analysis (UN Environment Inquiry 2017b).
In addition to the GFSG, the G20 has also advanced work on energy efficiency finance, with
a G20 Energy Efficient Investment Toolkit launched in 2017 (G20 Energy Efficiency Finance
Task Group 2017).

The FSB launched the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)
in December 2015. The TCFD is a market-led effort mandated to develop voluntary,

                                     consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing
                                     information to investors, lenders, insurers, and other stakeholders (FSB 2015). The
                                     TCFD’s final recommendations were published in June 2017 (TCFD 2017a), setting out a
                                     framework for climate-related financial disclosures structured around four thematic areas:
                                     Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets (Figure 4.1). As part of its
                                     recommendations, the TCFD released supplementary guidance for the implementation of the
                                     recommendations within different real economy and financial sectors, with specific guidance
                                     for banks, insurance companies, asset owners, and asset managers (TCFD 2017b).

                                     Existing global, national, and market-driven initiatives point out the key elements that
                                     sustainable finance principles could have. Figure 4.2 summarizes the leading sustainable
                                     finance global initiatives, segmented into different thematic areas. A review of existing
                                     efforts to define standards and principles and more broadly support the development
                                     of sustainable finance can be divided into (a) disclosure policies, (b) business practices,
                                     (c) knowledge-sharing networks, and (d) financial instruments. Some of these initiatives
explicitly define high-level principles for specific parts of the financial sector (for example,
the UN Principles for Responsible Investment), while others propose specific methodologies
to define certain financial instruments as “green” (Green Bonds Standards) or disclose
emissions related to financing activities (CDP). A review of the main thrusts of these
initiatives presented in Table 4.1 identifies about a dozen key tasks that could be applied
more broadly to the entire financial system.

4.1.2	 Additional Issues Identified by National Roadmaps

National roadmaps have identified additional issues that could be part of global principles.
About two dozen countries have developed these roadmaps, in many cases with technical
support of some of global initiatives mentioned above. Some countries, such as China, have
also implemented detailed policy standards with respect to financial instruments, including
national green bonds and green portfolios criteria. Box 4.1 summarizes some of the key
actions that are common to many of these roadmaps, which are discussed in more detail in
the following section.

Box 4.2 summarizes the key considerations that could be covered by an eventual set of
global principles. These are meant to be consistent with the previously mentioned efforts
and seek to provide financial sector constituencies with a set of high-level topics that can be
further developed as part of a broader consultation process.

                                                sector stakeholders (for example, regulators, supervisors, central bankers,
                                                private sector institutions, associations of financial services users) but also
                                                real sector and sustainability stakeholders (for example, government agencies

Box 4.2   Key Considerations for Developing Principles of Sustainable Finance


System-wide

     ¢¢ Make a statement defining the long-term objective of the financial sector in the
        context of sustainability.

     ¢¢ Agree on an approach to incorporate sustainability considerations to ensure the
        effectiveness, efficiency, and soundness of the global financial system.
Disclosure

     ¢¢ Establish approaches and methodologies to disclose the sustainability impact,
        opportunities, and risks arising from financial sector activities as well as the
        sustainability risks affecting the financial sector.

     ¢¢ Consider including sustainability information from the financial sector into the
        policy-making process to ensure that both the financial sector and the other
        relevant sectors (for example, environment, education, and so on) are directed
        toward sustainability objectives.
Business practices

     ¢¢ Price sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities and incorporate them into
        financial institutions’ strategies, governance, and business decision-making
        processes.

     ¢¢ Develop transition plans toward sustainable finance, with financial institutions
        identifying activities to be increased as well as business lines that need to be
        reoriented toward sustainability.
Financial instruments

     ¢¢ Agree on criteria to identify financial instruments and specific transactions
        aligned with sustainability objectives.

     ¢¢ Define mechanisms to promote innovative financial mechanisms, including
        through active regulatory encouragement, to increase the depth of sustainable
        financial markets.
Collaboration and alignment of efforts

     ¢¢ Develop mechanisms to promote and allow collaboration and sharing
        of information between financial sector participants on approaches,
        methodologies, and business practices for sustainable finance.

     ¢¢ Seek alignment of international and national policies, standards, and results
        measurement to ensure consistent global approaches that fit national needs

                                     4.2	 RESULTS MEASUREMENT

                                     To deliver the required transformation in the financial system, a performance framework is
                                     needed so progress can be measured. This framework would allow governments, financial
                                     institutions, and citizens to identify successful approaches, as well as areas lagging behind,
                                     thereby laying the basis for strategic adjustments in both policy and practice. Traditionally,
                                     the performance of financial systems has been measured across four key dimensions:

                                          ¢¢ Financial depth. The size of financial institutions and markets;

                                          ¢¢ Access. The degree to which individuals can and do use financial institutions and
                                             markets;

                                          ¢¢ Efficiency. The efficiency of financial institutions in delivering financial services; and

                                          ¢¢ Stability. The stability of financial institutions and markets.

                                     Over the past five years, increasing efforts have been placed on how to measure the
                                     contribution of the financial system to sustainable development, specifically in the
                                     environmental dimension. Measuring progress to a sustainable financial system involves
                                     gaining an understanding of three core performance characteristics:

                                          ¢¢ Effectiveness. The degree to which the market prices sustainability factors in asset
                                             valuations;

                                          ¢¢ Efficiency. The costs of running the financial system that delivers the flows of finance
                                             aligned with sustainable development requirements; and

                                          ¢¢ Resilience. The strength of the financial system in the face of disruptions related to
                                             unsustainable development such as air pollution, climate change, or water scarcity.

                                     Understanding performance against these characteristics requires a focus on three key
                                     dimensions already covered in this Roadmap:

                                          ¢¢ Architecture. This covers the principles, norms, standards, rules, regulations, and
. 72                                         policies that directly or indirectly contribute to the sustainable development of
                                             finance. Metrics are needed that measure the degree to which the “rules of the
                                             game” are aligned with sustainable development needs.

                                          ¢¢ Markets. This covers the behavior of market participants and the degree to which
                                             they are integrating environmental, social, and governance factors into their
                                             activities and the transparency with which they describe their sustainability efforts.

                                          ¢¢ Flows and stocks. This covers the allocation of capital and financial services to both
                                             sustainable and unsustainable assets. This dimension addresses both the annual
                                             flows of finance as well as the overall stocks of assets held by banks and institutional
                                             investors and enables decision makers to assess progress toward meeting sustainable
         finance needs. This could be accomplished by leveraging existing frameworks such as
         the periodic reporting of financial sector information from national authorities to the
         International Monetary Fund (IMF) to include green flows and stocks.

For a comprehensive picture of progress to be developed, metrics need to be chosen in each
of these three dimensions at the system level, as well as in key sectors such as banking, debt
capital markets, equity capital markets, institutional investment, and insurance. Currently
only limited data are available to measure performance. However, signs of progress are
emerging that now need to be consolidated so that a globally consistent framework can
be developed using the limited but growing pools of data available. At the system level,
there is a growing understanding of policies and measures in place to promote sustainable
finance, but much less is known about either the effectiveness or the efficiency of policy
interventions.

In the banking sector, the measurement of green financial flows was initially driven through
local efforts now scaled up through international collective action. For example, in Brazil, the
Brazilian Federation of Banks, FEBRABAN, has completed one of the world’s first estimates
of the number of loans and credit financing for the green economy. At the end of 2015, 17
percent of total corporate loans were allocated to the green economy, with sustainable
transport the largest category.21 The Sustainable Banking Network (Box 4.3) is currently
assessing the progress made by banking regulators in developing countries on integrating
environmental and social factors.

Capital markets are perhaps the area where the most transparency that could facilitate
results measurement is available. It is now possible to compare levels of disclosure on ESG
factors across the world’s stock exchanges. In addition, estimates of the flows of green
revenues of the companies listed on different exchanges are available from data providers
such as FTSE Russell. The value of issuance of green bonds is also available across countries:
expressing the results as the share of total bond issuance in a given country helps to put
these data into context.

A growing volume of data on the practices of institutional investors is also available.
Signatories to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) now manage over US$70
trillion in assets under management. As part of their commitment, signatories are required
to report on implementation and are then assessed on an A-E grading system across 12
modules (Box 4.4). A comprehensive Report on Progress is then made public to present the
overall reports along with the individual reports from the signatories.22

Internationally, there is growing interest in developing a flexible but consistent approach to
measuring progress. At the September 2016 Hangzhou Summit, G20 heads of state welcomed
seven broad financial sector options, “for voluntary implementation by countries in light of
national circumstances,” to help scale up green financing (G20 Green Finance Study Group
2017). Improving “the measurement of green finance activities and their impacts” was one of
these. In its 2017 Green Finance Progress Report, the UN Environment Inquiry concluded that

                                     About the Sustainable Banking Network (SBN)

                                     The SBN (www.ifc.org/sbn) is a knowledge and capacity building platform comprised of
                                     financial sector regulators and banking associations from emerging markets committed to
                                     developing national sustainable finance frameworks to advance the sustainable financial
                                     market development, based on national priorities and leveraging international good
                                     practice. Launched in 2012, the SBN achieved a critical mass in 2016, reaching 34 member
                                     countries,a and representing 85 percent of the banking assets across emerging markets.
                                     Fifteen of these countries have already launched national policies, guidelines, principles,
                                     or roadmaps on sustainable finance.

                                     A Member-Led Initiative to Track and Support Progress

                                     SBN members have identified measurement as a top priority in order to benchmark country
                                     progress and support countries in designing effective roadmaps that leverage lessons
                                     and good practice from other jurisdictions. With this in mind, in December 2016 the SBN
                                     launched the first member-led technical Working Group that focuses on measurement.

                                     The goal of the Working Group is to develop a methodology and tools to support
                                     SBN members to develop effective and fit-for-purpose measurement mechanisms for
                                     assessing the progress and impact of sustainable finance adoption at national level.

                                     The objectives of the Working Group include:

                                           1.	 Analyze the approaches and indicators currently being used to measure
                                               sustainable finance adoption and impact;

                                           2.	 Provide options to members in designing nationally appropriate
                                               measurement frameworks to assess progress in areas such as:

                                       Box 4.4   PRI Reporting Framework

                                       Reporting on Responsible Investment is one of the six Principles to which organizations
                                       commit when they become a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment
                                       (Principle 6: We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing
                                       the Principles). Annual reporting ensures accountability of the PRI and its signatories,
                                       provides transparency through the use of a standardized tool for signatories’ reporting,
                                       and allows signatories to receive feedback from which to learn and develop. There
                                       are 12 reporting modules, two of which are “core” modules and the rest are asset
                                       class–specific, depending on the line of business of the signatory. The core modules
                                       are related to the organizational structure and the strategic approach to responsible
                                       investment being implemented by the organization. The rest of the modules describe
                                       the approaches to responsible investment undertaken for different asset classes.

                                     “there is no systematic methodology for assessing progress on the greening of the financial
                                     system and the number of initiatives in this space has been relatively small. Progress has been
                                     most pronounced in relation to improved reporting by financial institutions particularly on
                                     climate change” (UN Environment Inquiry 2017c, p. 25).

                                     4.3	 CONCLUSIONS

                                     International collective action is critical to ensure alignment and effectiveness of the multiple
                                     market- and national-driven initiatives in support of sustainable finance. In most cases, this
                                     can be accomplished through existing global cooperation and oversight frameworks for
                                     the financial sector. However, it will require a strong commitment from a broad coalition of
                                     international stakeholders to embed sustainability considerations into long-standing financial
                                     sector structures and, if necessary, develop new ones.

Maintaining the momentum of the ongoing transition toward sustainable finance requires
concrete actions to support the implementation of many of the measures described in each of
the chapters. This process is anchored in a continuing consultation process over the next 24
months combined with a series of actions that will benefit from that process, leverage ongoing
initiatives, and support the design and implementation of new ones. Some of these initiatives
will be coordinated by UN Environment and the World Bank Group, while in some other cases,
part of the consultation process aims to identify the international, regional, and national
institutions that may be better placed to lead each activity. Table 5.1 summarizes the vision of
the outcomes associated with each one of the areas discussed in the Roadmap along with an
outline of proposed next steps to achieve those outcomes and their expected timing. Short-
term initiatives are expected to be completed by the end of 2018. Medium-term initiatives will
be completed within the next 24 to 36 months.

The proposed next steps summarized in Table 5.1 are expanded below.

5.1	 MARKET-LED INITIATIVES

5.1.1	 Products, Information, and Technology

    ¢¢ Leverage existing partnerships to develop and implement methodologies to identify
       green assets. Based on a review of ongoing work, including initiatives led by UN
       Environment as well as by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), develop—
       in partnership with financial institutions (FIs) and other financial infrastructure
       stakeholders—a general methodology to identify green assets. The approach
       should be sufficiently flexible that it can be adapted to markets with different data
       environments, but it should be sufficiently robust to allow it to support market and
       regulatory decisions.

    ¢¢ Support embedding market-relevant sustainability information into the financial data
       ecosystem. Given the broad nature of the stakeholders involved—FIs, financial data
       providers, credit rating agencies, national financial regulators, and global financial sector
       oversight bodies—global coordination is required to develop a multiasset green finance
       data system. This would promote convergence around defining, tagging, measuring,
       and reporting green assets. It would aim to connect existing initiatives at the sector and
       national levels to ensure a connected approach across asset classes and markets.

    ¢¢ Support additional research into the risk performance of green assets. The rate of
       default of green loans in some markets has been observed to be lower than that
       of non-green loans with otherwise similar characteristics. Additional systematic
       research, taking advantage of increasing availability of data on green assets, is
       needed to confirm these results and allow FIs to incorporate these performance
       characteristics into their loan origination processes.

    ¢¢ Support the implementation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial
       Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations in a pilot group of countries. This could be
       undertaken as part of the process of supporting countries to develop their national
       roadmaps for sustainable finance.

    ¢¢ Design and execute a set of key transformational transactions that can trigger new
       sustainable finance products. This may require the financial involvement of the
       international financial institutions (IFIs) and could explore innovative approaches
       to identify potential transactions, including requests for proposals or the use of
       innovation competitions.

    ¢¢ Establish “challenge prizes” or other types of innovation funds to stimulate the
       development of new products and technologies in support of sustainable finance.
       This approach can be explored initially to facilitate the development of innovative
       fintech solutions where the use of prizes and “hackathons” can focus the efforts of a
       large range of technical experts who may not otherwise concentrate on sustainable
       finance solutions.

                                         ¢¢ Leverage existing market-led initiatives—such as the Sustainable Banking Network—
                                            or create new ones, to expand the skills of FIs necessary to embed sustainability
                                            considerations overall strategy and into day-to-day operations. This could lead to
                                            the establishment of a Sustainable Finance Skills Initiative (SFSI). This would have a
                                            dual focus. The first focus would be to stimulate training and capacity building for
                                            financial supervisors, regulators, and policy makers. The SFSI would draw together
                                            the existing ecosystem of capacity building within multilateral development banks
                                            (MDBs)—for example, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Financial
                                            Stability Board (FSB), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors
                                            (IAIS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and
                                            the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)—and key
                                            sustainable finance initiatives such as the Sustainable Banking Network (SBN),
                                            Sustainable Investment Forum (SIF), and the Toronto Centre—to develop and deliver
                                            harmonized capacity building on key topics (sustainability risk, green financial
                                            products, and so on). The second focus would be to convene and encourage
                                            professional bodies, trade associations, universities, and financial institutions to
                                            develop and deliver effective capacity building for finance sector employees on
                                            sustainable finance.

                                         ¢¢ Develop a framework to align institutional incentives within FIs to sustainability
                                            considerations. The starting point for this initiative would be a review of the lessons
                                            learned by the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) on aligning incentives
                                            of investment managers with responsible investment considerations. This work
                                            could also be expanded to review the needs of consumers (individual, corporate,
                                            and government) to ensure the alignment of incentives also with respect to
                                            their interests. This would require exploring mechanisms to enhance consumer
                                            engagement in a sustainable financial system—that is, consumer literacy, information,
                                            costs, and so on—and use this to design incentives and financial products to better
                                            meet consumer needs and thereby drive demand.

                                            preparation of national roadmaps.

                                         ¢¢ Incorporate sustainability considerations into national fiscal frameworks, including a
                                            review of the effectiveness of fiscal interventions and subsidies in support of green
                                            activities and expenditures in unsustainable activities, including fossil fuel subsidies.
                                            This would require developing a methodology to assess national fiscal measures
                                            that may have an impact on flows toward sustainable activities. It would include an
                                            approach to carrying out an inventory of direct and indirect subsidies, including risk
      sharing schemes that exist in support of activities that have a positive or deleterious
      impact on promoting the flow of resources toward sustainable activities, as well as
      approaches to prioritize fiscally sound policy measures that facilitate the transition
      toward sustainable finance.

5.2.2	 National Roadmaps

    ¢¢ Support the development of national roadmaps in key countries. This could be part
       of a broader approach to develop a general framework that can be adapted to each
       country’s needs and level of economic and financial markets development. Selecting
       the countries to be part of this initial set of roadmaps would be demand-driven but
       would also seek to include a balanced mix of levels of markets development and
       readiness to ensure that lessons learned through this process can enrich subsequent
       roadmaps.

5.3	 INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES

5.3.1	 Global Coordination and Principles

    ¢¢ Launch a consultation process to converge in the next 24 months in a set of global
       principles for sustainable finance. A strong consultation process incorporating the
       views of all stakeholders of the financial system is essential for ensuring that any
       principles that are adopted can be used as a blueprint to design and implement
       global, regional, and national sustainable financial systems. Following the approach
       undertaken in the process of developing and adopting other global financial
       standards, the Roadmap team will convene five different working groups—one
       of each one of the five types of principles—to further develop these concepts.
       Membership of the working groups will reflect a broad range of international,
       national, and market participants’ views.

    ¢¢ Promote the inclusion of sustainability considerations into global financial sector
       oversight and cooperation frameworks. Public authorities are seeking to deepen
       their understanding of how sustainability factors may be relevant to their core
       mandates, including the safety and soundness of markets. There are leadership
       groups of regulators working together in these areas (for example, the SIF and the
       SBN), and global efforts are linking activities across asset classes in order to develop
       best practice guidance on the integration of sustainability risks into supervisory
       frameworks.
       The groups of regulators also consider sustainability factors in the design of regulatory
       reform and policy interventions. The promotion of sustainability standards would be
       broadly applicable across jurisdictions and relevant across asset classes, including
       banking, insurance, investment, and securities. Initial efforts, many in the form of
       pilots, could include developing and testing a sustainable finance module for the
       Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), reviewing the impact on fiscal analysis
       frameworks such as the World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review and the International
       Monetary Fund (IMF)’s Article IV methodologies, and their relevance to investments of
       large pools of official assets such as pension and sovereign wealth funds.

                                          ¢¢ Develop a results measurement framework for sustainable finance. This could be
                                             done as part of the consultation process for global principles and the preparation of
                                             national roadmaps.

                                          ¢¢ Promote the inclusion of sustainability data as part of global financial reporting
                                             frameworks (for example, central bank reporting to the IMF). This effort would be
                                             crucial to ensuring that the results of multiple ongoing initiatives can be measured
                                             using common metrics.

                                     This Roadmap focuses on green finance, but the challenge posed by the 2030 Agenda for
                                     Sustainable Development is much broader and touches all the Sustainable Development
                                     Goals (SDGs). Many of the areas discussed in this Roadmap with respect to green finance
                                     are applicable more broadly to developing a financial system that supports the attainment
                                     of the SDGs. They are also applicable to addressing some of the systemic issues identified
                                     in 2015 at the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (United Nations 2015) endorsed by the United
                                     Nations General Assembly, such as the need for a sound, inclusive, and resilient financial
                                     system and increased cooperation among international organizations to attain global
                                     objectives. Implementation of elements of this Roadmap can generate some of the pieces to
                                     develop a broader plan of action to support the 2030 Agenda and address systemic issues
                                     hindering the development of a financial system that can facilitate sustainable development
                                     in the three dimensions identified in Addis Ababa: promoting inclusive economic growth,
                                     protecting the environment, and promoting social inclusion.

    APPENDIX A: SUSTAINABLE FINANCE AND
    RELATED CONCEPTS: A SHORT REVIEW

Converging on a definition of sustainable finance can be facilitated by understanding related
concepts, including some developed before the idea of sustainable finance began to be
used. A subset of institutional investors emerged seeking a socially responsible investment
(SRI) approach that used a negative list screening approach to exclude investments in
certain sectors (for example, tobacco, alcohol). SRI investing initially remained a niche
area of primary interest to investment funds associated with religious organizations in the
United States. SRI investing growth was triggered from the 1970s onward in response to
pressure on large institutional investors in the United States and Western Europe to divest
from certain industries, such as armaments, and to refrain from supporting investments in
apartheid South Africa. From the 1990s onward, a broader set of investors sought to use
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria to select investments (Knoll 2002). This
type of “new SRI” is generally known as ESG investing or responsible investing, a concept
that is defined by the Principles for Responsible Investment as “an approach to investing
that aims to incorporate ESG factors into investment decisions, to better manage risk and
generate sustainable, long-term returns.”23 No standards exist to define the three types of
ESG criteria. For example, the PRI considers climate change impact, resource depletion,
waste pollution, and deforestation as examples of environmental criteria. ESG investing has
benefitted from the wide range of indices and other financial information that has become
available. Financial data information providers have more strict criteria to, for example,
screen companies to decide whether they can be placed into ESG equity indices. Thomson
Reuters, for example, uses three types of environmental indicators to screen companies to
be included in ESG indices: resource use, emissions, and product innovation.

ESG investing could be considered to be a traditional type of investing because it seeks to
maximize risk-adjusted returns, as traditional investors would—but it uses ESG criteria as a
screening tool to achieve that objective. In the 2000s another set of institutional investors
sought to move from the passive negative screening (that is, excluding certain types of
companies or projects from investment portfolios) associated with early SRI investing to a
more active approach that seeks to support specific outcomes along with (or even in lieu of)
financial returns. This investment approach is known as impact investing. Figure A.1 illustrates
these concepts. It is important to understand these concepts because several definitions of
sustainable finance rely on them (BlackRock 2016).

SUSTAINABLE FINANCE DEFINED

Sustainable finance can be understood as a broad concept defined by the use given to resources
raised and allocated. Although the definition of concepts such as ESG and impact investing relies
on approaches used to select investments and investors’ objectives, the definition of sustainable
finance and concepts such as climate and green finance refer to the use given to financial
resources. Sustainable finance is a broader and newer concept whose meaning is still evolving.
Table A.1 presents a selection of definitions used by different organizations.

                                     FINANCING

                                     Further clarification of the meaning of sustainable finance can be obtained by defining
                                     a subset of sustainable finance; these definitions sometimes, erroneously, are used
                                     interchangeably. The UN Environment Inquiry prepared a Background Note on Definition and
                                     Concepts seeking to illustrate some of the components of sustainable finance (Figure A.2).
Sustainable finance supports investments across a broad set of sectors that are required to
build an inclusive, economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable world. The UN SDGs
in fact define multiple areas—from health to resilient infrastructure—that are required to create
a sustainable world. Driven particularly by the immense challenge posed by climate change,
there has been a substantial interest and increase in climate change financing. The United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defines climate financing
as “local, national or transnational financing, which may be drawn from public, private and
alternative sources of financing … to significantly reduce emissions, notably in sectors that
emit large quantities of greenhouse gases … and to adapt to the adverse effects and reduce
the impacts of climate change.”24 Several terms are used for financing for emissions reduction
(that is, mitigation, in the terms used by the UNFCCC) including zero-emissions, low-carbon,
low-emissions, and clean energy financing.

It is important to differentiate climate financing from the term green financing, which, in
addition to climate, includes other areas necessary to support environmental sustainability,
including biodiversity and other resources conservation. Furthermore, the term green financing
is increasingly associated with financial flows from private institutions.

CASE STUDY: BRAZIL – STEPS TO SUSTAINABLE FINANCE

Brazil has a long tradition of harnessing its financial system for sustainable development. This
process has involved a powerful dynamic between government policy, financial regulators,
public financial institutions, and market actors (Vendramini, Belinky, and Monzoni 2015). This
stretches back to the launch of the Corporate Sustainability Index by the B3 market in 2005,
which has since outperformed the traditional benchmark.25 The Banco Central do Brasil
(BACEN) took its first steps to address socio-environmental risk factors in 2008. Following
the Paris Agreement, the country is now developing a strategic approach to mobilizing
private capital for climate action and sustainable development. Importantly, sustainable
finance offers one route out of the country’s current economic difficulties. The emerging
recovery is “investment led and sustainability shaped,” with green and sustainable finance
offering a way of mobilizing capital for high-quality vital agri-business and infrastructure
projects.

Over the past decade, key steps in Brazil’s move toward a sustainable financial system
include:

      ¢¢ Strengthening risk management. Beginning in 2008, Brazil’s central bank introduced
         new requirements limiting landowner access to subsidized rural credit to those
         who can demonstrate compliance with environmental legislation. In 2014, BACEN
         introduced requirements for socio-environmental factors to be mainstreamed
         into the governance of risk by banks and other financial institution and published
         guidelines for financial institutions to implement Social and Environmental
         Responsibility Policies (SERP) regulations.

      ¢¢ Measuring green lending. The Brazilian Federation of Banks, FEBRABAN, has
         completed one of the world’s first estimates of how much lending has been
         provided for the green economy. At the end of 2015, 17 percent of total corporate
         loans were allocated to the green economy, with sustainable transport the largest
         category.26 This exercise is rooted in a low-carbon economy database that provides
         the foundations for more comprehensive green tagging of loans in Brazil. The most
         recent edition of the study “Measuring Financial Resources Allocated to the Green
         Economy” accounted for 87 percent of the total credit loans of the banking sector
         (FEBRABAN 2017). The full report presents the methodology used to measure the
         volume of financial resources allocated to sectors of the green economy as well as
         to sectors that have the potential to cause environmental damage. In 2015, a total
         of R$51 billion was invested in projects for the generation of renewable energy,
         representing less than 2.3 percent of total financing for corporate clients (R$2.1
         trillion).

                                                                 ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                          ¢¢ Integrating sustainability into the investor and insurance sectors. A growing number
                                             of Brazil’s major asset owners and asset managers have a good awareness of ESG
                                             issues. The Superintendence of Private Pension Funds (PREVIC) could strengthen
                                             this trend by ensuring that the consideration of material environmental, social, and
                                             governance (ESG) factors is part of the primary analysis of a prudent investment
                                             process (PRI 2017). In 2016, the Superintendence of Private Insurance surveyed the
                                             insurance sector to better understand the integration of sustainability factors. It is
                                             now considering a range of actions including improving disclosure, incentivizing
                                             green investments, and integrating environmental risks into underwriting policy.

                                          ¢¢ Mobilizing the green bond market. In 2016, FEBRABAN, along with the Brazilian
                                             Business Council for Sustainable Development (CEBDS), issued voluntary
                                             recommendations to grow the green bond market, based on global best practice
                                             tailored to Brazil’s circumstances (FEBRABAN 2016). Since the guidelines were
                                             brought out, the number of Brazilian issues has more than doubled.

                                          ¢¢ Designing a strategic investment plan. Brazil’s Council for Sustainable Market
                                             Development first came together in September 2016 to address the market
                                             challenges to leveraging green finance. It brings together Brazil’s public and
                                             private banks, private companies (in the energy, agriculture, and logistics sectors),
                                             asset managers, pensions, and insurers (Kidney 2017). The Council is working on a
                                             Strategic Investment Plan to identify the key opportunities, challenges, and solutions
                                             for green financing, both debt and equity.

                                          ¢¢ Carbon pricing. FEBRABAN is currently working on measuring the impact of carbon
                                             pricing in the financial system, which is expected to lead to the development of a
                                             methodology for pricing carbon and related distressed assets within the banking
                                             sector.

                                     CASE STUDY: CHINA – ESTABLISHING THE GREEN FINANCIAL SYSTEM

                                     The understanding and exploration of green finance has been a gradual, evolving process
                                     in China. For a long period after the “reform and opening-up” policy in 1978, economic
                                     development was central to the Chinese government; environmental factors, on the other
                                     hand, were not considered to be important variables that could affect the decision making
. 88                                 of financial institutions. Until after the mid-1990s, China’s financial policies gradually imposed
                                     restrictions on certain high-pollution and energy-intensive industries in response to the
                                     central government’s requirements for economic restructuring and upgrading as well as

                                     environmental protection (PBoC and UN Environment 2015).

                                     In 2007 China’s Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) began by developing Green Credit
                                     Guidelines that evolved from an initial, principle-based approach to a standardized, metrics-
                                     driven performance assessment. In 2014, the People’s Bank of China established a Green
                                     Finance Task Force that produced 14 recommendations across four broad themes: information
                                     flows, legal frameworks, fiscal incentives, and institutional design (UN Environment Inquiry
                                     2016d). Following these key initiatives, and an estimate that an annual investment of at least
                                     2 trillion yuan (US$320 billion) is needed to achieve China’s environmental targets during the
13th Five-Year Plan (2015–2020) (IISD 2015), China made rapid progress in developing a green
financial system to demonstrate a systematic approach with a series of high-level policies. The
aim of these policies was to address the enormous environmental challenges and ecological
civilization as national strategic priorities.

The CBRC introduced the Green Credit Statistics System in 2014; this system was among
the first emerging market examples of regulatory guidance to define green loans. Green
credit loans are classified into 12 categories with subcategories, reflecting consensus within
industries on what projects are considered green. A tool has also been developed for banks
to calculate the environmental benefits from green credit lending, including reduction in
carbon emissions, water pollution (chemical organic demand, or COD), and savings on water
use. With a standardized definition for green banking assets, it is easier for banks to issue
green bonds or pilot other green banking products, such as asset-backed securitization.
CBRC Green Credit Statistics also track data on loans with compliance issues on (a)
environment, (b) safety, (c) deploying technologies mandated to be phased out, and (d)
occupational health.

At the end of 2015, CBRC’s green credit statistics for the top 21 Chinese banks (accounting
for around 80 percent of total banking assets) show that (a) on the risk management
side, the majority of the top 21 banks have adopted environmental and social (E&S) risk
management practices at different levels; and (b) on the green loan origination side, the loan
balance toward green credit exceeded US$1 trillion, representing 16 percent growth year-on-
year, which is 2 percent higher than the overall lending growth rate. Green credit now makes
up approximately 10 percent of these banks’ portfolios.

The policy signal culminated in August 2017, right before the G20 Summit in Hangzhou. The
China State Council approved the “Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System”—
issued jointly by seven ministerial agencies including the People’s Bank of China—providing
essential next steps for implementing the overall strategy of promoting ecological civilization
and determining how to mobilize and incentivize more social (or private) capital to invest
in green sectors, while restricting investment in polluting sectors. The Guidelines set forth
35 measures and incentives that can be grouped into the following nine action items (PBoC
2016a, 2016b):

     ¢¢ Establish the green financial system;

     ¢¢ Develop green lending;

     ¢¢ Enhance the role of the securities market in supporting green investment;

     ¢¢ Launch green development funds and mobilize social capital through public and
        private partnerships;

     ¢¢ Develop green insurance;

     ¢¢ Improve environmental rights trading market and develop related financing
        instruments;

                                                                                                     .89
                                                        ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                           ¢¢ Support local government initiatives to develop green finance;

                                           ¢¢ Promote international cooperation in green finance; and

                                           ¢¢ Prevent financial risks and strengthen implementation.

                                     The Guidelines also called for relevant government departments in China to adhere to the
                                     responsibilities assigned by the Guidelines, and faithfully implement all their requirements.
                                     There are follow-up documents for each of the key ministries on how to support and
                                     implement each of the action items.

                                     Key findings show some impressive progress being made in the Guidelines. This list is only a
                                     sample, as there are many other examples (UN Environment Inquiry 2017c):

                                           ¢¢ Green bond issuance (domestically and internationally) reached US$34 billion in
                                              2016, up from US$1 billion in 2015, following the issuance of a domestic green bond
                                              catalogue and green bond guidelines. The China Security Regulatory Commission
                                              issued guidelines for green bonds issued by listed corporations in March 2017.

                                           ¢¢ Promoting environmental stress testing by financial institutions became a key
                                              component of the Guidelines. A seminar was held in Beijing in mid-July 2017 to
                                              discuss the scope, methods, and purpose of environmental risk analysis. This effort is
                                              led by the Green Finance Committee of China Society for Finance and Banking.

                                           ¢¢ The Securities Regulatory Commission publicly encouraged Chinese investors to
                                              become Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) signatories in October 2016.

                                           ¢¢ Pilot zones will be set up in the Guangdong, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang
                                              provinces and the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region to boost green finance in
                                              China. The decision was made at the State Council executive meeting on June 14 to
                                              improve the green financial system (english.gov.cn 2017).

                                     FINANCIAL SYSTEM

. 90                                 The European Union (EU) has often been at the forefront of efforts to promote green
                                     and sustainable finance, driven by civil society advocacy, financial institution efforts, and
                                     initiatives by Member State governments as well as by action taken at the EU level itself.

                                     However, what has been missing has been an overarching strategy that responds to the
                                     scale of the financing challenge represented by the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable
                                     Development Goals. For this reason, the European Commission launched a high-level expert
                                     group in September 2016 to produce a roadmap for a sustainable financial system.27 The
                                     group brings together experts from across the financial system along with academics, civil
                                     society representatives, and public sector organizations.


                                     27 For details about the European Commission’s work on this roadmap, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-
                                     economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance_en
Until recently, EU action to promote sustainable finance focused mostly on the deployment
of public finance through the European Investment Bank and the EU budget. This approach
was given added importance with the launch of the EU’s plan for economic recovery
following the financial crisis: at least 40 percent of the next phase of the European Fund for
Strategic Investments is expected to be allocated to climate action. Increasingly, however,
sustainability factors have also been incorporated into EU financial regulation, notably in
terms of corporate disclosure and pension regulation. In addition, there has been growing
interest in incorporating the sustainability dimension into the EU’s Capital Markets Union,
which is designed to find new ways of mobilizing finance for infrastructure and small and
medium enterprises (SMEs), for example, through fintech innovations (UN Environment
Inquiry 2016e).

The momentum for change built on increasing action at the national level to incorporate
sustainability into financial system strategy. Key policy highlights include:

      ¢¢ France. The Energy Transition Law has a specific focus on finance, with new
         reporting requirements for financial institutions and investors on their alignment with
         climate goals. In addition, France has introduced labels for green financial products
         and Paris has launched a dedicated Finance for Tomorrow initiative.28

      ¢¢ Italy. A one-year national dialogue on sustainable finance produced a comprehensive
         set of recommendations in February 2016. This has led to the establishment of a new
         national observatory, focusing on Milan as a center for sustainable finance and on
         ways to mobilize sustainable finance for the country’s reindustrialization plans (UN
         Environment Inquiry 2017d).

      ¢¢ Netherlands. The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) has led a national assessment of the
         implications of climate change for the economy and financial system. This has
         prompted the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors
         into financial supervision as well as the formation of a sustainable finance platform
         with private sector institutions.29

      ¢¢ Sweden. The government has made sustainable development a goal for the financial
         sector. This has been followed by initiatives to promote sustainability disclosure
         by pension funds, explore labeling for financial products, and scale up green bond
         issuance (Government of Sweden 2017).

      ¢¢ United Kingdom. The Prudential Regulatory Authority has investigated the
         implications of climate change for the insurance sector; this has been extended
         to the banking sector. The City of London has established its own Green Finance
         Initiative,30 and the government is promoting green finance in its international
         relations with Brazil, China, and India.

                                     The interim report of the EU’s high-level expert group was published in July 2017. This
                                     identified a two-fold focus for sustainable finance: first, strengthen financial stability and
                                     asset pricing by improving the assessment of long-term sustainability factors; and second,
                                     mobilize capital to support the transition to sustainable development in the real economy,
                                     notably for households, SMEs, and infrastructure—identifying a gap of €180 billion per
                                     year in investment for climate action alone. Although many initiatives are underway across
                                     Europe, urgent action is still needed both to help stimulate economic recovery and to meet
                                     key environmental targets.

                                     To start with, a set of five principles was highlighted. These stressed the need for the
                                     financial system to consider full value, to be productive, to be resilient, to demonstrate
                                     alignment with sustainability, and to take a long-term perspective. Putting these principles
                                     into practice led to a series of early recommendations for reforms in the policy architecture
                                     and market infrastructure, including:

                                          ¢¢ The introduction of a classification system for green and sustainable assets, including
                                             an EU green bond standard;

                                          ¢¢ The establishment of a common set of principles for implementing fiduciary duty;

                                          ¢¢ Further strengthening of disclosure rules, notably to incorporate recommendations
                                             of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures;

                                          ¢¢ The introduction of “sustainability tests” for all future EU financial regulations and
                                             policies;

                                          ¢¢ Consideration of a Sustainable Infrastructure Europe to match-make between private
                                             investors and public authorities; and

                                          ¢¢ Positioning the European supervisory authorities—for banking, insurance, and
                                             securities—to respond to the sustainability challenge.

                                     A range of tough issues was identified for further discussion, including how to overcome
                                     market short-termism, how to integrate sustainability into credit ratings and market
                                     benchmarks, how to establish “capital raising plans” setting out investment pipelines, and

CASE STUDY: INDIA – DEVELOPING RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY
EFFICIENCY MARKETS

Financing India’s goals for inclusive and sustainable development requires more, lower cost,
and longer-term capital. Raising incomes for the 800 million people living on less than US$2
per day, creating livelihoods for the 12 million people entering the workforce every year,
and regenerating the natural resource base at a time of climate change requires innovative
approaches to sustainable finance.

The past two years have seen a marked shift in both market and policy efforts to rise to
the challenge. In 2016, a joint report produced by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry and the UN Environment Inquiry outlined a set of steps, which were
welcomed by the government (UN Environment Inquiry 2016f). A set of interlocking actions
have been taken to scale up finance for renewable energy:

      ¢¢ Priority sector lending. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requires banks to allocate
         40 percent of their lending to priority sectors in the Indian economy, including
         agriculture, infrastructure, education, and small and medium enterprises (UN
         Environment Inquiry 2016f). In April 2015, the priority sector lending framework was
         expanded to include lending for decentralized renewable energy (RBI 2015). The aim
         was to encourage lending for renewables, which would increase access to energy
         and would not necessarily be financed through market forces alone.

      ¢¢ Market commitments. As part of its effort to increase India’s renewable energy
         capacity to 175 gigawatts (GW) by 2022, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
         has agreed to voluntary financing commitments with 40 banks to finance 78 GW of
         renewable energy capacity by 2019.31 This will require investments of approximately
         US$100 billion, US$70 billion of which would come from debt.

      ¢¢ Green bonds guidelines. As of July 2017, Bloomberg estimates that US$2.1 billion
         of green bonds were issued in India (compared to US$9.3 billion in China). Last
         year, the Indian market represented the 7th largest green bond issuer worldwide,
         with a total issuance of US$2.7 billion. A key factor in the growth of this market
         has been the role of the development of disclosure requirements by the securities
         regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).32 The guidelines
         build on international best practice, provide greater certainty for issuers and
         investors, and will be a catalyst for market development. L&T Infrastructure Finance
         Company raised R677 crore (US$103 million) in the first green bond approved
         by SEBI (Mahapatra 2017). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) provided
         the financing. While India may not be the largest national green bond market, it
         has been notably innovative. In 2016, IFC also invested in the country’s first green
         bond focused exclusively on green residential buildings with Punjab National Bank
         Housing Finance. Several financial institutions—both traditional banks and nonbank

                                     CASE STUDY: MOROCCO – A NATIONAL ROADMAP FOR SUSTAINABLE
                                     FINANCE

                                     At the 22nd Conference of the Parties (COP 22) in November 2016, Morocco launched a
                                     national roadmap for aligning the Moroccan financial sector with sustainable development
                                     (Bank Al-Maghrib 2016). Developed in collaboration with Bank Al-Magrib (Morocco’s central
                                     bank), regulatory authorities, and market associations, the roadmap sets out a strategic
                                     vision for Morocco’s financial center around five axes:

                                          ¢¢ Extending risk-based governance to social and environmental risks;

                                          ¢¢ Developing sustainable financial instruments and products;

                                          ¢¢ Promoting financial inclusion as a driver for sustainable development;

                                          ¢¢ Building capacity in the field of sustainable finance; and

                                          ¢¢ Ensuring disclosure (transparency and market discipline).

                                     Several Moroccan authorities are now seeking to take the recommendations of the roadmap
                                     and put them into practice.

                                     Insurance: ACAPS, Morocco’s supervisory and regulatory authority for insurance, is now
                                     designing a strategic approach to implement roadmap targets into the insurance market.
                                     At a high level, the roadmap confirms the importance of insurance firms as sources of
                                     sustainable finance instruments and as sources of capital for investments in development
                                     projects. ACAPS is now developing a strategy to achieve targets for the insurance sector in

CASE STUDY: RUSSIA – CREATING MARKET FOR RESIDENTIAL ENERGY
EFFICIENCY FINANCE

   The Challenge

Over 140 million people live in Russia, with almost 100 million living in multifamily buildings
(MFBs). Most of these buildings require energy efficiency repairs because little consideration
for energy efficiency was given at the time these buildings were built (the average age of an
MFB in Russia is 43 years). With the Russian housing sector being the second largest end-
user of energy, Russia can significantly reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprint
(Russia is the world’s fifth-largest GHG emitter) by mobilizing private sector investment in
the energy-efficient modernization of its housing stock.

Despite this potential, little investment into MFB energy-efficient retrofits has taken place
because of a range of barriers. These barriers can be categorized into three main groups: (a)
an underdeveloped legal and regulatory environment, (b) a lack of financing mechanisms for
MFB retrofits (despite a well-developed mortgage market to finance purchases of individual
apartments/houses), and (c) the low level of awareness about energy efficiency among
all stakeholders (government, financial institutions, and home owners). Addressing these
barriers required a systematic approach and change.

This case study describes how the Russian government, with support from the World
Bank Group, has been addressing these challenges to create a new market for financing
energy-efficient retrofits of MFBs. The key milestones on the way to a new market included:
(a) the development of a new legal and regulatory framework for MFB retrofits, (b) the
development of a corresponding institutional framework, (c) the launch of a state incentive
program targeted at energy efficiency in MFBs, and (d) capacity building for all groups
of stakeholders (the public sector, the financial sector, and the general public). In the four
years since the Russian government has embarked on this reform agenda, a combination of
policy actions, institutional development, and public finance measures has resulted in over
US$4 billion mobilized for investment in MBF modernization across the Russian Federation.

   Key Milestones

Russia lacked a basic legal framework for facilitating the capital renovation of MFBs. Putting
this framework into place was a prerequisite for enabling energy-efficient renovation in
MBFs. Therefore the first and most critical step toward reforming the housing sector was
the adoption of the Law on Capital Repairs in 2013—a groundbreaking legislation that gave
impetus to a new system for financing the renovation of MFBs. This law formed the basis
for private sector participation in MFB retrofits: it made homeowners financially responsible
for their building retrofits, created a mechanism for channeling funds from homeowners

                                                                                                    .95
                                                       ROADMAP FOR A SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
                                     into financial institutions, and created conditions for private sector players (for example,
                                     commercial banks, construction companies, energy efficiency equipment manufacturers) to
                                     work together to facilitate MFB renovation.

                                     The new system became functional as the law removed main risks that had precluded
                                     these players from entering this market. It has also enabled banks to create specialized
                                     savings and loans products. The new legal framework introduced the notion of special
                                     accounts—a bank account attached to an MFB with special features designed to accumulate
                                     and protect savings for building retrofits. As part of its strategy for the development of
                                     the housing sector, the Russian government has placed an emphasis on the transition to a
                                     special accounts system and the development of private sector financing for capital and
                                     energy-efficient repairs of MFBs. In four years since the start of a new system about 80,000
                                     buildings have set up special accounts, having accumulated US$500 million.

                                     Once the basic framework for MFB renovation had been put into place, the Russian
                                     government took the next step on its housing sector reform path with a focus on energy
                                     efficiency. In 2017 the government piloted a state program that provides financial incentives
                                     to MFB homeowners for combining building retrofits with energy efficiency measures. The
                                     program is designed in a way that integrates private sector investment with public policy
                                     objectives. This program provides financial assistance to homeowners in exchange for
                                     achieving measurable reduction in buildings’ energy consumption. At the same time, the
                                     program aims to spur market growth in bank lending for MFB retrofits by providing access to
                                     bank loans on preferential terms.

                                        Early Signs of a New Market Developing

                                     The Russian market for residential energy efficiency financing is in an early stage of
                                     development but has already reach several milestones: (a) over US$4 billion in private
                                     savings have been mobilized over the last three years, (b) banks have made their entry into
                                     the sector by providing specialized savings and loan products, (c) a government program
                                     has been put into place that provides targeted financial incentives to promote energy
                                     efficiency, and (d) a multitude of private sector players are working together to make the
                                     Russian housing stock energy efficient.
