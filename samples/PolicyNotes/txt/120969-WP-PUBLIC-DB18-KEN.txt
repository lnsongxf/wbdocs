About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        legal framework to promote, stimulate and encourage high standards of
        safety and health in the workplace. As such employers must:
        • Prepare and, revise a written safety and health policy statement for the
        workplace giving consideration to the organisation and arrangements for
        carrying out that policy;
        • Notify employees any revision of the policy statement;
        • To establish a safety and health committee in the workplace where there
        are twenty or more persons employed in the workplace;
        • not to penalize an employee who is a member of a work place safety and
        health committee for doing anything in pursuit of safety and
        health;


        A company must obtain a Certi cate of Registration of a Workplace from the
        Directorate of Occupational Health and Safety in respect of each of the
        premises used by the company as a workplace.

    6   Make a company seal                                                              2 days,                  between KES 2,500

        The requirement for companies to obtain a company seal has been made
        optional as a result of passing the Companies Act, 2015. However, in practice
        companies still get seals made. Seal makers request a copy of the certi cate
        of incorporation in order to make a company seal.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      Agency : National Environment Management Authority (NEMA)

      Following the enactment of new Environmental Management and Co-
      ordination Act on February 27, 2009, companies now have to obtain approval
      of projects from the National Environment Management Authority. Projects
      of all risk categories are subject to approval and an environmental impact
      assessment (EIA), including the BuildCo warehouse. It takes 30 days on
      average. The cost is set at 0.05% of warehouse value (0.05% * KES
      32,500,000.00). Prior to February 11, 2009, the fee rate was 0.1% of
      warehouse value.

      The regulation regarding environmental impact assessment approval for
      Kenya has been in place since 1999. However, in recent years NEMA started
      enforcing the rules more vigorously. NEMA conducts periodic inspections
      during the construction. If new projects at the moment of inspection do not
      have an environmental impact assessment they may order the project be
      closed and erected objects demolished. Therefore, construction companies
      are now obtaining the environmental approval before the building is
      completed. However, the legislation is not clear on what categories of
      building this regulation applies to.

      ii. A survey plan from Survey of Kenya;
      iii. Ownership documents
      iv. Up-to-date rates payment receipts.
      v. Structural plans


      The City Council will issue an invoice that must be paid, this can take up to 2
      —3 weeks to be obtained. The drawings are reviewed by all relevant
      departments simultaneously. Once the structural and architectural drawings
      are approved, they will be signed on by the governor of Nairobi. When all
      signatures have been obtained, the approved plans are scanned and
      uploaded in the system so that they can be retrieved by the architect.

       On June 27, 2013 the Nairobi City County adopted the new Financial Act 2013
       which became e ective as of October 1, 2013. The Act modi ed the method
       of assessing the building permit fees and consolidated several costs into
       one. The building permit fee is now based on the size of the building. The
       Joint Building Council Rates provide the estimated cost per square meter
       which varies depending on the type of building (e.g. o ce block, residential,
       industrial complex, etc.).


       For the Doing Business case study, the estimated cost is KES 21,000 / sq. m.
       The fees are as follows:
       (i) Building plan approval fee: 1% of the estimated cost of construction
       (ii) Construction sign board fee: KES 25,000
       (iii) Application fee: KES 5,000
       (iv) Inspection of building le: KES 5,000
       (v) Occupation certi cate: KES 5,000

       When construction is about to commence, the Contractor will apply for a
       construction permit. However, with approved drawings construction may
       start while the application for a building permit is being processed.

       BuildCo must have the following items approved: project plans, architectural
       drawings, location survey of property documents and others.

       the documents online. The engineer must also do the same after the
       architect's plans have been stamped. The engineer does not have to wait
       one month like the architect to bring in the hard copies.

       Agency : National Construction Authority (NCA)

       BuildCo has to register the proposed construction project with the National
       Construction Authority (NCA) and ll a project registration form providing
       details of the construction work (that can be downloaded from the NCA
       website since 2012, www.nca.go.ke). This is line with the adoption of the
       National Construction Authority Regulations (2014) that mandate
       contractors to register their construction projects and obtain compliance
       certi cate from NCA before construction. It takes around a week to obtain
       the compliance certi cate. Upon submission of the application, BuildCo
       receives a temporary certi cate that testi es the registration is under
       process.
       Most of the time, construction companies start building just after
       submission at NCA without waiting to receive the compliance certi cate as
       they should be doing. NCA conducts periodic inspections during the
       construction looking for registration certi cates and structural aws. NCA
       ensures that the safety of the workers on site and the general public is
       respected.
       BuildCo submits the project registration form to the authority with several

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Lands o ce

      With e ect from August 27, 2010 when the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 was
      promulgated, the Land Registration Act (No. 3 of 2012) repealed the
      Government Lands Act (Cap. 280) and consent to transfer leasehold land
      held by the Government of the Republic of Kenya under the repealed Act is
      now required to be obtained from the lands o ce. Previously, such consent
      was required to be obtained from the Commissioner of Lands and that o ce
      was abolished by the repeal of the Government Lands Act.

      report
      Agency : Lands o ce Valuer

      Once the draft transfer has been led at the land o ce, an inspector visits
      the site to verify the development and state of the property. Due to lack of
      transport, in practice, the inspector often has to be picked up in person and
      driven to the site. Previously, such inspections were conducted on a random
      basis, but now every transaction requires such an inspection. The issues
      involved are similar to the inspections by the land o cer and, therefore, may
      happen within 1 day to up to over one month. Once the valuer has inspected
      the property to assess its value, a report is compiled after which the value is
      endorsed on the transfer and then it is submitted for assessment of the
      Stamp duty.

      The payment of Stamp Duty is made at a Commercial Banks designated by
      the Ministry of Land. If the amount exceed k.shs. 1 million, payment is made
      by RTGS bank transfer. It takes about 4 days for the Kenya Revenue Authority

      franked or embossed evidencing payment of stamp duty.

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the

                                                         whether a unitary secured transactions system exists. Then two case

                                                         scenarios, case A and case B, are used to determine how a nonpossessory

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                     Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest      registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population      secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                   In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit       only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set
  registry as a percentage of adult population           of legal provisions relating to the use of movable collateral.

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants

    Getting Credit
This topic explores two sets of issues—the strength of credit reporting systems and the e ectiveness of collateral and bankruptcy
laws in facilitating lending. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                         scenarios, case A and case B, are used to determine how a nonpossessory

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                     Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest      registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population      secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the         - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                     and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                         economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                        - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                        - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                      equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)              - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                        commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                        - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                 - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                  - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                        movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          receivership     After Mirage's default on payment, as the debenture holder, BizBank would initiate
                                     receivership by filing an application requiring the High Court of Kenya to verify an identified
                                     receiver pursuant to Part VII Receivers and Managers of the Companies Act. Mirage or other
                                     unsecured creditors may appeal against the appointment before the Court, and according
                                     to Section 223 of the Companies Act, the Court can stay or restrain proceedings accordingly
                                     based on relevant parties' application, then the receivership proceeding can be converted
                                     into liquidation. However, the conversion is unlikely to happen for Mirage's case as BizBank
                                     holds 74% of the total outstanding debt and it's likely that the Court would approve its
                                     receivership request.

Outcome             going concern    The hotel will continue operating as a going concern after the BizBank appointed receiver sell
                                     it as a going concern to a third party.

Time (in years)     4.5              The receivership will approximately take 4.5 years until BizBank is repaid some or all of the
                                     money owed to it upon the completion of the proceeding. The delay is largely due to the
                                     inefficiency of court and difficulty to organize hearings. It takes about 2 years until the final
                                     judgment is made to approve BizBank's receivership appointment. This takes consideration
                                     of all possible delaying tactics adopted by Mirage or other unsecured creditors who are likely
                                     to defense BizBank's application and stop the receivership proceeding. Then it would take
                                     additional 2.5 years to find a potential buyer of the company, sell it as a going concern and
                                     receive the sale proceeds.

Cost (% of          22.0             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 22% of the value of the
estate)                              debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
                                     government agency fees (1.4%), attorney fees (up to 10%), receiver fees (up to 10%), and fees
                                     of accountants, assessors, inspectors and other professionals (2%), other costs (2%).
