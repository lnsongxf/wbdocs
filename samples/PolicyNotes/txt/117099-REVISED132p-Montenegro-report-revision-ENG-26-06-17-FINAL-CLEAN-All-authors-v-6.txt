Executive Summary


The report presents options for early retirement in special and hazardous conditions in
Montenegro. The recent reforms of pension system, including rising of retirement age to 67
are in accordance with European trends, however, reintroduction of early retirement
possibilities from 2010 raises concerns regarding the sustainability of the social security
system. Reforms aimed at improving efficiency and sustainability of pensions are also
recommended by the European Commission.

Population ageing in Montenegro accelerates as a result of both declines in fertility and
increase in life expectancy. Old-age dependency ratio (number of people aged 65 and more
per 100 people in age group 15-64) will rise from 19 in 2010 to 47.1 in 2065. At the same time,
only 50% of working-age people in Montenegro has a job, and among those in age group 50
and over this is only 23.6%. The gap in employment rates to the EU countries is large and did
not change in the past decade. High cost of labor, related also to social insurance contributions
needed to finance early retirement in many occupations with low-hazard, though in the past
considered as hazardous ones can be one of the reasons for low employment levels, both in
the case of youngest and oldest workers.

In recent years, the increase in the number of pensioners is faster than the increase in the
number of workers, which means that the system dependency is worsening. Pension
contributions finance less than 70% of total expenditures – there was some improvement in
this indicator between 2012 and 2014, but it worsened again in 2015. There are various routes
to early retirement in Montenegro: for those with long work experience, also for workers who
lost job due to bankruptcy (in particular aluminum sector, metal-processing industry, or state-
owned companies), mine workers, for workers in hazardous occupations, those in special
retirement rules and also those working in the so called „armed services“, which are treated
similarly as those in the extended service. In the case of extended service, the retirement age
is lowered depending on the type of extended service period (12/14, 12/15, 12/16,12/18 or
12/24). The regular pension contribution rate (20.5%) is increased by a supplementary
contribution, ranging from 6% to 28%, depending on the extended service rule. The
supplementary contribution rate is not sufficient from an actuarial perspective to finance the
extended service.

The available data, as provided by the Tax Authority, indicates decreasing number of workers
entitled to extended service period and also decreasing number of such workers for whom
the social contributions were not paid in time. The data on accrued extended service periods
for early retirement is not publicly available, which reduces transparency of the system.
Moreover, data on extended service period are not regularly shared among the ministries and
agencies responsible for implementing tax and pension policies, which creates uncertainty
related to supplementary contribution payments and future expenditures accrued on the
basis of these rights.
                                                                                               4
Furthermore, the legal options for re-employment of the first-time pensioners are liberal: they
can maintain the right to pensions earned and full wage. Beneficiaries of the survivor pensions
are not able to keep their pensions in the case of employment or self-employment (with two
exceptions to this rule, one of which refers to widows and widowers). This is another push
factor that provides incentives for early retirement.

The international policy directions clearly show reforms towards increasing retirement age.
These reforms combine measures that are related to improvements of workability of people,
through labor market, health care and lifelong learning measures. These include also adoption
of workplaces and work conditions to the needs of the ageing workforce. In all EU countries
reforms are introduced that increase the legal retirement age. In 17 countries, there are
penalties in benefit formula for early retirement.

One of the routes to early retirement is the work in the arduous or hazardous conditions.
These conditions are frequently defined in relation to factors, which can have long-lasting
impact on individual health and cannot be prevented by suitable measures. Poland is one of
the examples of effective reforms of early retirement due to hazardous conditions. The
reform, introduced in 2009, reduced the scope of early retirement by developing a new list of
hazardous workplaces, based on the new definition focusing on the impact on health. This
new list replaced the old broad list of occupations eligible for early retirement. The new
“bridging” benefit is paid to the narrow group of workers between early retirement age (which
is 5 years lower than the regular one) and legal retirement age. The bridging benefits are
financed by additional contribution paid by employers and the subsidy from the state budget.
The pension measures are combined with labor market reforms supporting longer work. The
results of the reform are both sharp decline in early retirement pensioners and increase of
employment rate in age group 55-64 years.

Based on the international experience, it is recommended that extended service pensions in
Montenegro are narrowed to those working in workplaces that include conditions with long-
lasting impact on health, such as working under ground, in hot and cold temperatures, forced
posture, heavy physical work. This group based on international experience should cover
below 2% of the workers (excluding military and police). The conditions for the extended
service should be adopted based on the experience of professionals in occupational medicine.

Montenegro employs exceptionally high number of military and police personnel. Most of
employees, especially in the police (internal affairs), are eligible for extended service period.
It is recommended to analyze and review which jobs and positions are hazardous and arduous
and revise the list accordingly, primarily in the police.

Other routes to early retirement, in particular due to long work service should be removed.
The extended service early retirement pension should be financed by actuarially fair separate
contribution paid by employees and employers, for a period of early retirement that is no
longer than 5 years. The separate contribution should be administered by the current pension

                                                                                               5
administration, which would increase the transparency of funding, as well as improve the
quality of data on the coverage of the extended service period. Furthermore, labor market
reforms are recommended focusing on adjusting work conditions to the needs of older
workers, re-training and improvements of work flexibility and work. Options of early
retirement for long service periods should be revisited. The public information campaign
accompanying the reforms should aim at raising social awareness on the need for such
reforms.

Introduction

The aim of this report is to present options for reforming early retirement system in
Montenegro. The pension system in Montenegro went through a series of rationalizing
reforms in the past two decades (Golubović, 2008; World Bank, 2015). The most important
changes include rising retirement age to 67, introducing point formula and widening earnings
period taken into account for calculating of the pension. At the same time, however, the early
retirement options were reintroduced in 2010, which contributed to high level of pension
expenditure (11% of GDP), low system dependency ratio and high current deficit in the
pension system.

The early retirement in Montenegro is possible through several channels including retirement
for long service period (40 years for men and gradually rising to 40 years for women) as well
as early retirement possible from age 62. Furthermore, workers in many occupations
considered hazardous are eligible for early retirement with extended services period at low
additional cost, which does not cover the expenditure related to the payment of these
pensions. The list of occupations is broad, including numerous occupations in various sectors
(for example flight attendants, truck drivers, bus drivers, ballet dancers, opera singers) (World
Bank, 2015).

The social security system in Montenegro is imbalanced and its deficit is rising. The system
dependency ratio1 in 2015 was equal to 64, which is relatively high compared to the
international standards. The number of new pensioners who at the time of retirement were
below age 65 increased by 26.6 thousand over 2010-2015 period, i.e. on annual level this
category accounted in average for 5.1% of the total number of pensioners in the observed
period. Contribution revenue covers less than 68 per cent of expenditure for pension and
retirement benefits (as of 2015).

The current system solutions are also not in line with EU-supported and agreed labor market
and pension policies towards activation of older workers, longer stay in the labor market and
raising the overall labor participation rate. The employment rate of older workers in
Montenegro is one of the lowest, comparing to the EU countries. Therefore, there is a need
for reforms that would stimulate longer activity in the labor market, while respecting a need
for and establishing adequate system for selected hazardous occupations where the need of
early retirement is sufficiently proven by evidence. Such reform direction is desired from both
national and European perspectives.

Given the on-going EU accession negotiations, it is also worth putting the challenges ahead of
the pension system in Montenegro in the European context. The European Commission’s
White Paper. An Agenda for Adequate, Safe and Sustainable Pensions (European Commission,

2012) sets forth a series of challenges for Member States’ pension systems in the light of
population ageing. These include: securing financial sustainability of pension systems,
maintaining adequacy of pension benefits and raising the labor market participation of
women and older workers.

The 2015 Annual Growth Survey (European Commission, 2015) recognizes efforts made by the
member states to reform their pension systems but at the same time calls for further reforms
that are necessary to increase the efficiency and financial sustainability of pensions. The
reforms should aim at preserving the adequacy of pension systems, so that a decent level of
income after retirement is ensured. Given the trend of increasing longevity, in many countries
a more dynamic view on the age at which people can retire needs to be established, including
linking statutory retirement ages to life expectancy more systematically to ensure an
adequate balance between life spent working and spent in retirement.

These challenges are also adequate to the Montenegrin pension system. (European
Commission, 2008) in its assessment of the social protection and social inclusion in
Montenegro pointed out that the main goals should be the creation of an institutional
framework that will encourage people to work longer and more productively. The government
must also keep in mind that objectives should be oriented towards raising employment rates
to overcome some of the troubling existing trends. The main objectives are related to making
the pension system more sustainable through sound public finances, or by balancing benefits
and contributions. Thus, the reform of the early retirement system, including solutions for
hazardous occupations in Montenegro is a challenging, but necessary task.

In the report, we present the potential options for the reform directions aiming at introducing
solutions that would help to regain the system sustainability and promote longer working
lives. The recommendations are supported by the evaluation using the example of Poland (as
a good practice example from the Central and Eastern Europe region) as well as economic
analysis of the available information from the Montenegrin social insurance system.

The analysis is based on the available data related to hazardous occupations and early
retirement pensions in Montenegro. It should be underlined that the availability of data
related to this part of early retirement system is limited. There are also many inconsistencies
in the data, which indicates low reliability of information possessed by the social security
administration. Any further work and developments in this area should also include
improvement of the availability and quality of data related to early retirement and hazardous
occupations in Montenegro.

The report is structured as follows. In the first section, we refer to the demographic and labor
market context in Montenegro, which indicate the risks and challenges ahead of the pension
system in Montenegro. We also discuss some of the myths that are related to the perception
of older workers’ on the labor market. In the second section, we present the current situation
of the pension system in Montenegro in general terms. The third section focuses on the

                                                                                              8
analysis of the available information on the current and future prospects of the early
retirement scheme. In section four we present recent developments in the EU and OECD
countries related to early retirement solutions, including the developments on early
retirement for hazardous and arduous conditions. Special attention is put on the description
of the 2008 reform of early retirement of hazardous and arduous conditions in Poland and its
outcomes. The Polish approach could be used as a model solution in the approach to limit the
list of extended service occupations.

In section five we present recommendations for the reform of policies related to the extended
service period pensions as well as general early retirement policy in Montenegro.




1. Demographic and labor market context


In this section, we present a short overview of the demographic and labor market
developments in Montenegro. Demographic trends, particularly those related to the
population ageing and rising share of people above retirement age, affect the current and
future situation of the pension system. However, it is also under influence of the labor market
situation; low employment rates transfer to the lower contribution revenue and higher social
security system deficits, thus additionally worsening the situation of the pension system.

1.1. Demographic developments

Population in Montenegro is ageing relatively fast. This phenomenon, which Montenegro
shares with many of the post-transition economies, is caused by increases of life expectancy
on the one hand and sharply falling fertility rates on the other. Results of the 2011 population
census revealed a relatively high increase of the average age of the population of 37 years
(increase by 1.1 years compared to a decade before). UN population projections indicate that
over the next few decades Montenegrin population will age significantly; the size of the
population in age group 65 and over will increase significantly. Its share in the total population
is expected to almost double by 2065 compared to 2015 (Figures 1 and 2). By the same token,
population in age group 15-64 years will decline in size (by almost 27%) and its share (around
9.5%) it total population that is projected to decrease by almost 15%. Old-age dependency
ratio (people aged 65 and more per 100 people in age group 15-64) will more than double,
from 19 in 2010 to 47.1 in 2065.

          1.2. Labor market situation in Montenegro
          Employment rate in Montenegro in 2015 was lowest than any of the EU countries except for
          Greece. Only 51.4% of the population aged 15-64 had a job in 2015 while employment rate
          for the older population (aged 50 years or more) stood at only 23.6%, which is also one of the
          lowest compared to the EU countries (Figure 3).

          Moreover, comparison of the developments of the employment rate of people in working age
          with those aged 55 to 64 (Figure 4) shows a persistent widening gap between employment
          rate in Montenegro and EU 27, rising especially from 2008, after the outbreak of the economic
          crisis, and particularly for men.


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       10
         Employment of the working age population shows some signs of improvement as of 2013,
         however development in that year was less of a result of increased economic activities and
         more of statistics. Namely, adoption of the Law on the Prevention of Illegal Activities end June
         2013 resulted in an increased reporting by the employers to the Tax Authorities (and
         consequently to Monstat) of the employed persons who prior to that worked unregistered for
         these employers.

         Employment of the population aged 55 to 64 (particularly men) started to decrease in 2010
         after the introduction of a general early retirement at 62 with 15 years of service 2, which did
         not exist previously. In addition to that, early retirement for special categories (police and
         military that retire with 50 years of age and 20 years of service) was extended for miners who
         can now retire with 30 years of service (of which 20 in jobs with extended service calculation).
         Decline in employment of the population aged 55 to 64 as of 2013 is further explained by
         granting of the same opportunity to also workers in the aluminum industry in 2013 and in the
         metal-processing industry in 2014. Extension of an early retirement in both cases was a part
         of the re-privatization process of the bauxite mine and aluminum industry. All these economy
         sectors (police, mines, aluminum industry) were male-dominated, which partially explains
         drop in number of employed male aged 55 to 64. General trend of decreasing deployment of
         this age group for both genders is expected to continue, as in 2015 the new possibility for
         early retirement was granted to men (after 30 years of service) and woman (after 25 years of
         service) working in the by the state co-owned companies that went bankrupt.

       As shown in the World Bank’s Labor Markets Technical notes (2011 and 2012, with revisions
       under preparation), and World Bank (2015) labor market outcomes are highly unsatisfactory
       in Montenegro. Employment rate and labor force participation are low, while the exit age
       from the labor market is significantly lower than in other developing countries. The costs of
       low labor participation and early exit are high system dependency ratio of 1.6 insured per
       pensioner, more than 10% of GDP spent on pensions, and high overall social insurance
       contributions required to finance social protection, which are close to 35% of wages, of which
       20 p.p. is devoted to pensions. The tax wedge in Montenegro is higher compared to other
       countries in the region.

       It is worth comparing developments in Montenegro and Poland4; the latter had quite higher
       employment rate of the population group aged 15 to 64 compared to Montenegro in 2005
       and has managed to maintain it even after 2008. In the case of population in age group 55-64,
       the situation in Montenegro and Poland was similar in 2005. Afterwards, Poland managed to
       steadily increase employment rates of the population aged 55 to 64. Employment rates in this
       category have increased by 18.3 p.p. for men and 15.8 p.p. for women between 2005 and
       2014 (as discussed below, this is an outcome, among others, of the early retirement reform),
       which is faster than for any other age group.

       Overall low employment rate for the population aged 50 years and more is linked with the
       high inactivity of this population (Figure 5); only 36% of the population older than 50 years
       was active (either employed or unemployed) on the labor market in Montenegro in 2015.

        Poland is the EU country that in 2005 had employment rates for the population aged 55-64 closest to
       Montenegro and introduced reforms that led to the increase of this level after 2008.

This is somewhat lower than the average activity rate for population aged 50 years and more
for the EU as a whole that was 37.0% while the highest one was recorded in Sweden (44.9%)
and lowest in Greece (27.5%). Rather low level of activity among this population group in
Montenegro is reflected also in the explanation of the main reasons for inactivity of the age
group 15 and older, which was retirement. In 2012, according to LFS conducted by Monstat,
the main reason for inactivity within this group was retirement with 38.6% vs. 20% in EU 5 (it
was followed by education with 25.9% vs. 32.4% in EU and by other personal and family
responsibilities with 14.7% vs. 4.7% in EU). In 2015, percentage share of the inactive people in
the age group 15 years and older who are inactive due to retirement increased to 40.8% while
the active population size increased by 1.9%. These data indicate that there is a high number
of retired people in Montenegro, who are below the legal retirement age.

Montenegrin population has also shorter average working life. Duration of the working life for
EU as a whole was 35.4 years in 2014, while in Montenegro, the average period of paying
pension contributions (indicator closest to the definition of the working life), for the category
of old-age pensions, which excludes invalidity pensions and family pensions, was only 33 years
and three months in 2015.

Labor market policies need to take the active aging perspective. However, frequently these
policies are driven by the necessity to increase the employment rate of younger workers. The
policy makers frequently fall into the so-called “lump of labor” fallacy, which is that the
improvement of employment among the young population can be achieved by reduction of
employment among older workers. Also, myths of older workers are influencing these policies

                                                                                                             13
          and resulting in low employment rates of older workers. Those in ages 50 and over are
          perceived as less healthy and less productive. This fallacy has been repeatedly questioned by
          researchers. (Börsch-Supan, 2012), among others, provides scientific evidence that
          counteracts these myths in the long-term horizon.

          Evidence from Montenegro shows little substitution between the young and the old on the
          labor market since 2008. As indicated in Figure 6, increasing employment rate of older workers
          is accompanied by falling employment rate of younger workers. This development should be
          observed through the lenses of the economic developments since 2008 and the government
          measures. A decrease of employment rates of younger people is probably a result of
          contraction of the new employments due to the economic crisis. Concomitantly, employment
          rates of older workers continued to steadily increase (mainly for women and less for men, as
          indicated in Figure 4) as a reflection of employment structure by the sectors of the economy.
          Namely, almost 27% and over 7.5% of employees have worked in the public companies in
          2015 (down from 30% and 9%, respectively), i.e. in mining and manufacturing, where older
          workers make relatively large portion of employees.6 The increase of employment rates of
          the older population can also be a result of the Government’s policy measures introduced in
          20097. If we look at the relation between employment rates of young and older workers, we
          see that there is statistically negative, but not very significant correlation of the two measures
          in time. This is clearly seen in Figure 7, which indicates a little relation between analyzed
          employment rates.

            Privatization processes in mining and manufacturing industries as of 2011 motivated legaly enabled and factual
          early retirement of mainly the male older employees, which explains slower employment growth of older males
          as presented in Figure 4.

            The measures refer to the signing of the Memorandum on Social Partnership in the Circumstances of the Global
          Economic Crisis between the Government (Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Welfare), Federation of Trade
          Unions of Montenegro and Associations of Employers of Montenegro. The memorandum was particularly aimed
          at protecting the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, but also at maintaining of macroeconomic stability,
          continuing reforms on the road to EU, and preservation of competitiveness of the economy.

                                                                                                                                                     14
There is a hidden cost of the early retirement that is paid by the labor market that should be
recognized. The use of early retirement reduces the size of active labor force participants. As
a result, pension expenditure is higher and contribution revenue is lower. This frequently leads
to the increases of tax wedge and further pressure to reduce labor market demand. Reforms
of early retirement scheme contribute not only to the improvement of the pension system,
but also improve labor market performance for younger generations.

Reducing the opportunities for early retirement will not lead to worsening the labor market
situation of the younger people. The increase of their employment (but also preserving of
employment of the older employees) will depend more on the reduction of the level of taxes
levied on wages8 and on overall economic growth.


2. Pension system situation


Demographic trends and labor market situation affect the pension system. Low average
duration of the working life and low employment (and activity rates) contribute to the
negative situation in the pension system. While Montenegrin population is aging, the number
of insured people has been constantly growing (except for the 2009 contraction due to the
economic crisis). However, legally created opportunities on one hand and pressures from the
real economy for early retirement (due to the privatization processes and to them related
bankruptcies) on the other hand reflect concomitantly to the increase of the number of
pensioners. As the growth of the latter group is faster, this leads to the increase of the system
dependency ratio and high costs of social security contributions and taxes, which affect the
labor market. This vicious circle needs to be reversed both for the improvements on the labor
market and pension system.

The current situation of the pension system reflects, on one hand, economic developments
after the outbreak of the global economic crisis in August 2008, but also the legislation and
early retirement provisions created as of 2010 (Figure 8). By the end of 2009, the average
number of insured persons was increasing at the rates higher than the average number of
pensioners, due to the economic growth and smooth adjustments to the economic crunch
(Figure 9). However, due to the latter, as of 2010 a number of opportunities were created,
general and exceptional, to take on retirement age legally increased in that year (67 for both
men and woman) and retire early. That resulted in a stronger growth of the number of
pensioners compared to the number of insured persons (2.5% vs. 0.2%, respectively). Due to

 Currently, the rates of such taxes are not high, but the way of their application to the salary base results in the
overal tax burden that is almost double to the original tax rate. This feature causes evasion of pension (and other)
contribution payments of the current workers, urges employers to support early retirement and demotivates
new employments.

          the expiry of the time-limited exceptional options for early retirement, a growth of the
          number of pensioners took a slower pace as of 2013. Concomitantly, in that year the number
          of insured persons increased, among other, for the statistical reasons explained earlier.

          Table 1 shows a development of the number of insured individuals as of 2003 when the first
          round of the pension reform was performed. It introduced increasing of the statutory age to
          65/60 for men/women but did not offer the general early retirement option. Along with the
          increase of economic activities, these reform features contributed to the decrease of the
          dependency ratio (Figure 10). The second round of the pension reform, executed through the
          adoption of the new Law on Pension and Disability Insurance in 2010, which enabled early
          retirement under general and exceptional conditions, resulted (along with slow economic
          recovery) in the increase of the dependency rate. The rise in the dependency rate flattened in
          2014 but picked up again in 2015 due to the reasons described earlier. Obviously, an inflow of
          the early pensioners has made an impact to the growth of a total number of pensioners
          exceeding 100 thousand and continuing to grow further, as expected.

      The inflow of new pensioners as of 2010, and especially since 2011 was fairly large, mainly as
      a result of early retirement possibility. PIO fund data on the number of new pensioners shows
      that in 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2015, the largest inflow of pensioners was in relatively young
      age groups: between 51 and 62 years of age, as well as noticeable share of those retiring
      between ages 45 and 50 years (Figure 11). The option for early retirement is created also
      through a transition period in which the conditions for old-age retirement can be fulfilled, with
      the number of years of age lesser than the statutory (67 years of age), i.e. 60 (with 15 years of
      service for men and women), and 55 for women with 35 years of service. These opportunities
      have significantly affected the inflow of new pensioners aged between 51 and 62 years.
      Looking at the number of beneficiaries of the pensions acquired under more favorable terms
      (data exclude the accelerated retirement), the share of those who were retired on the basis
      of fulfilling the conditions of 62 years of age and 15 years of service continuously grew by
      September 2016 compared to other options9 (from 27.2% in 2011 to 43.5% in 2014), when it
      amounted to 40.7%(Figure 12). Influx of the new beneficiaries was especially high in 2015,
      mainly owing to those among them for whose retirement conditions were legally enabled in
      December 2014 and time-limited to only a few months of 2015 (this category amounted to
      70% of the total annual influx).10

        Given the rise in the number of beneficiaries, the pension system in Montenegro is not self-
        sufficient. The revenues from collected contributions are not enough to cover of expenses of
        the pension benefits. Table 3 shows that the ratio of revenues from contributions and
        expenditures for pensions and retirement benefits was increasing by the outbreak of the crisis
        and by the end of 2008 it amounted to 76.7%. However, in 2009 it contracted significantly to
        56.1%. The ratio recovered in 2010 but continued to decrease in 2011 and 2012, due to a
        strong increase in expenses for the pension benefits (by 7.8% and 6.2% on annual basis,
        respectively). It recovered in 2013 to 63.1% due to a significant increase in revenues from
        contributions (by 11.8%), which was mainly a result of the efforts to legalize the grey economy.
        The ratio continued to increase in 2014 (to 70.3%), but it decreased in 2015 (to 68.7%).
        Consequently, the share of the PIO Fund expenditures for pensions and retirement benefits in
        GDP increased in 2009 and again in 2011 and 2012, but in 2013 it started to decrease, due to
        the stronger growth of GDP (which was partially a result of the fight against the grey
        economy). The share of the PIO Fund’s revenues in GDP declined in 2009 and in 2011, but then
        it started and continued to rise (in 2012 as a consequence of the GDP contraction) until 2015
        when it dropped again. The deficit (expressed as pension expenditures minus contribution
        revenues) reached 5.1% in 2012, resulting in rising of the share of the revenues from the
        (state) budget in total PIO Fund revenues to 42.8%. In 2015 both figures declined to 3.3% and
        32.0%, respectively.

        Increase of expenditures for pensions and retirement benefits was in the large extent a result
        of growth of pensions paid on the basis of early retirement (Table 2). The largest increase in
        the PIO Fund expenditures for pensions and retirement benefits was recorded in 2011-2012,
        following the adoption of amendments to the Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (the
        Law). These amendments enabled various forms of early retirement, which were further
        altered through the changes to this Law during the entire observation period (to support the

                                                                                                                                                                    18
processes of privatization of the state-owned companies), as explained below. Consequently,
pensions that were paid on the basis of early retirement participated in the annual growth of
total expenditures for pensions and retirement benefits of the PIO Fund with 30% in 2011 and
83% in 2012. However, since 2012, the one-time effect of the time-limited conditions for early
retirement on the level of pensions paid on the basis of early retirement was becoming
smaller. By 2015 this figure was becoming more influenced by the pensions paid to those who
decide to retire with 62 years of age and 15 years of service, as enabled through Art. 17a of
the Law. In that year influence of the pension beneficiaries who retired under more favorable
conditions other than those whore retired under Article 17a and pensions paid to them to the
expenditures of the PIO fund becomes more pronounced. Not only that the annual inflow of
pension beneficiaries who retired based on Article 17a decreased in 2015 compared to the
rest of beneficiaries who retired under more favorable conditions; the pensions paid to the
later amounted to 66% of the annual increase of the pension expenditures paid to the
beneficiaries who were entitled to the early retirement.

3. Early retirement in Montenegro


In this section, we present the legal and statistical analysis of the early retirement system in
Montenegro as well as the assessment of the impact of early retirement on the performance
of the pension system.

3.1. Old-age pensions

One of the crucial measures of a comprehensive pension reform launched in 2003 in
Montenegro was rising the statutory retirement age to 65/60 for men/women. The aim of this
measure was to contribute to a later exit from the labor market and to support the
sustainability of the PAYG system in a middle to long term. Within this reform Montenegro
managed to avoid introduction of the general early retirement option, however, it was
eventually introduced during the second round of the pension system reform in 2010. At that
occasion, early retirement was introduced with a view to compensating for rising statutory
retirement age (to 67 for both women and men) and smooth its impact.


The Law on Pension and Disability Insurance (the Law)11, the main legislation regulating
pension system in Montenegro, proscribes as of 2010 the three criterions for eligibility for the
old-age retirement, the first one being the age of 67 and minimum 15 years of service (Article
17, Paragraph 1)12. The transition period was set to the period 2010 – 2040, during which men
should gradually reach retirement age by 2025, and women by 2041 (Figure 13 and Table 1 in
Annex 3).

According to the second criterion for the old-age retirement (Article 17, Paragraph 2), as of
2010 both men and women have been entitled to an old-age pension when they reach 40
years of service (previously it was 35 years for women) regardless of the years of age

Gazette of Montenegro“, No. 79/2008, 14/2010, 78/2010, 34/2011, 66/2012, 38/2013, 61/2013, 6/2014,
60/2014-I, 60/2014-II and 10/2015. Some changes to the Law were made by the Constitutional Court of
Montenegro and through the adoption of the Law on unified registration and reporting system on the calculation
and collection of taxes and contributions („Official Gazette of Republic of Montenegro“, No. 29/05).

(previously the minimum age was 5513). Transition period applies for this criterion too; as of
2013 women are entitled to an old-age retirement as of the age 55 and 34 years of service,
which both increase by 3 months each year until 2033 when the years of service limit for old-
age retirement should reach 40 years as presented in Figure 14 and in Table 4 (Article 198a)14.
For workers with 40 years of service an additional benefit was introduced if they were applying
for the first time for an old-age pension; when determining the number of personal points by
application of the stipulations of the Article 21 of the Law,15 the insurance period over 40 years
would be increased by 40% (Article 202a).16


Later on, as of 2013, the second criterion was modulated at the three occasion for the three
type of workers with a view to accommodate better conditions for the workers of the
bankrupted companies and to help the owners more easily curb the labor costs.17 In August
2013, notwithstanding Article 17, workers whose employment in the aluminum industry was
terminated due to the bankruptcy were entitled to an old-age pension if they had attained 30
years of service, regardless of the years of age (Article 197j).18 The right to an old age pension
in accordance with this Article could have been exercised until September 30, 2013. Later on,
in December 2014, the right to retire under the same conditions was given to the workers of
the metal-processing industry whose employment was terminated due to the bankruptcy and
who in this process have not received severance pay (Article 197k).19 The right to an old age
pension in accordance with this Article could have been exercised until March 15, 2015.
Finally, in February 2015 the similar right to retire after 30 years of service for men and 25
years of service for woman (and regardless of the years of age) was given to the workers of
companies co-owned by the state, whose employment was terminated due to the bankruptcy.
The right to an old age pension in accordance with this Article could have been exercised until
July 15, 2015.20

   As of 2004 women were entitled to an old-age retirement as of 35 years of service and 50 years and 6 months
years of age, where the latter increased by 6 months each year until 2013 when the age limit for old-age
retirement had to reach 55 years (Article 198).

The third criterion for the old-age retirement introduced within the 2010 pension reform
referred to the mine workers who became entitled to retirement when they reached 30 years
of service, of which at least 20 years effectively spent on workplaces in the mines where years
of service shall be calculated at an accelerated rate (Article 17, Paragraph 3)21. However,
beginning July 201122 possibility to retire after 30 years of service was given also to the persons
who have spent 20 years working on the workplaces, i.e. jobs that are eligible for accelerated
service period (Article 197z). The latter option expired by December 31, 2011. At the same
occasion, the right to retire after 20 years of service, regardless of the years of age was given
to the one of the parents who has a child or is a caretaker of the child with severe difficulties
in development that is a user of the personal invalidity benefits, regardless of the child’s age .
In addition, the level of the pension of such parents, i.e. caretakers, is increased by 20% to the
level calculated by the Law. This stipulation is still valid.


In exception to the PDI Law, amendments to the two other laws enabled old-age retirement
under favorable conditions for the two groups of employees of the Agency for National
Security and of one group of employees of the Ministry of Interior, i.e. police. Namely, the Law
on Amendments to the Law on Agency for National Security23 introduced two options for
employees of this Agency; first option (Article 52b) introduced termination of employment by
May 1, 2015 for the employees who by April 30, 2015 turned 50 years of age and 25 years of
service, of which at least 15 years effectively spent on jobs with accelerated service period
2015. The right to an old age pension in accordance with this Article could have been exercised
from March 7, 2015 to July 1, 2015. The second option was created for the employees of this
Agency who terminated employment at their personal request by May 1, 2015 if, by April 30,
2015 the employee turned 50 years of age and 20 years of service, of which at least 10 years
effectively spent on jobs with accelerated service period. The right to an old age pension in
accordance with this Article could have been exercised from March 7, 2015 to July 1, 2015.
Amendments to the Law on Internal Affairs24, enabled opportunity for an old-age retirement
for the employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, i.e. of police, who terminated
employment at their own request by April 1, 2015 if, by January 31, 2015 they turned 40 years
of age and 20 years of service, of which at least 10 years effectively spent on jobs with ESP.
The right to an old age pension in accordance with this Article could have been exercised from
January 13, 2015 to July 1, 2015.

Influence on the increase of the number of pensioners in Montenegro made by the
opportunities for the old-age retirement created by the PDI Law (and lesser so by the Law on
Amendments to the Law on Agency for National Security) including through the beginning of
the rather generous transition period as of 2010, was the most exaggerated in 2011 (Table 4).
However, opportunities created through the Amendments to the Law on Internal Affairs
contributed to the stronger inflow of the old-age pensioners in 2015.

3.2. Early retirement

In addition to regulating the old-age retirement, the Law also proscribes general conditions
for early retirement; the right to an early retirement within the PAYG system an insured person
has when she/he turns 62 years of age and 15 years of service (Article 17a25). However, women
shall become entitled to early retirement related to the years of age only as of January 1, 2022
(Article 197e). The 2010 pension reform increased also the minimum age for an early
retirement to a total of five years. The transition period was determined (2010-2040), for
which the right to old-age retirement could have been achieved under favorable conditions,
as explained earlier and presented in Figures 13 and 14 and in Table 1 in Annex 3. These
favorable conditions could be observed as a specific kind of early retirement, as they enable
old-age retirement at the age earlier than statutory proscribed 67. That is significant for the

                pension system especially when it comes to woman, who as of 2013 are becoming eligible to
                old-age retirement as of age of 55 and with 35 years of service, i.e. as of age 60 and with 15
                years of service). Such a combination of conditions for early retirement, especially related to
                the short number of years of service, does not exist in any EU country. Early start of the
                transition period (in terms of the years of age) for the old-age retirement, as well as
                possibilities for early retirement, crate conditions for the (too) early exit from the labor market
                and its related distortions, despite the permanent reduction of the pensions by 21% attached
                to the retirement under these conditions (based on the 0.35% of a decrement for each month
                of the retirement prior to the statutory retirement age, as will be further explained).
                Additionally, early start of retirement buts an additional burdening of the PAYG based pension
                system.

                The Law further proscribes special conditions for early retirement through the merit
                (privileged) pensions of the two special groups of occupations; first, occupations subject to
                special retirement rules, and second, hazardous occupations. For these two groups of
                occupations the Law proscribes: (i) workplaces and occupations (in general, while detailed
                definitions are provided in the secondary regulation) for which the service/insurance period is
                calculated as extended service period, (ii) extended service period for insured persons with
                disabilities and for woman who gave birth to a child, (iii) lowering of the age limit for the
                entitlement to old-age pension, (iv) procedure and record-keeping of workplaces and
                occupations and insured persons for which the extended service period applies, (v)
                supervision, financing, and penalties.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                         25
The Law applies only to full-time employees (except in the case of employees with disabilities
when the Law applies to also part-time employees) including also those whose full working
time (referred to in Article 69) includes working hours shorter than 40 hours per week
established for certain jobs because of special working conditions.


The group eligible for the privileged pensions by the Law covers insured persons that are
subject to general pension rules, but with accelerated service period factored in (Article 69).
This group encompasses:
    1. workplaces that have harmful impacts on health and work ability of employees,
despite the fact that general and special protective measures prescribed by the regulations on
occupational safety are applied;
     2. jobs/occupations in which the physiological functions of the body after certain year
of life are falling to such an extent that it prevents successful job performance;
     3. insured persons with disabilities; and
     4. insured women who gave a birth to a child.
The first two items cover insured persons who are working on especially difficult, dangerous
and unhealthy workplaces and jobs, and those insured persons who work at workplaces or
jobs in which after reaching certain age she/he cannot successfully carry out their professional
activity, years of service in the effective duration is calculated with an accelerated rate under
the conditions stipulated by this Law. The Law proscribes that the degree of acceleration of
insurance depends on the severity, risks and hazards of work, or the nature of work, and
cannot exceed 50%. However, degrees of acceleration are stipulated by the secondary
regulation (they range from 14 months registered as service for each 12 months actually
worked).


The Law further describes in detail the workplaces and jobs considered as hazardous (Article
70); “Workplaces or job at which service period is calculated at an accelerated rate because
labor is especially difficult, dangerous and harmful to the health is the workplace, i.e. job, at
which, despite the fact that all general and special protection measures prescribed by the
regulations are applied, there are significant adverse impacts on health and working ability of
the insured person that, during full working time, insured person is working next to sources of
harmful effects, in a continuous work process.
The full working time shall also include working hours shorter than 40 hours per week
established for certain jobs because of special conditions.
Workplaces or jobs at which service period is calculated at an accelerated rate because the
performance of professional activities is limited after reaching certain age is the workplace or
job where, because of the nature and difficulty of the job, physiological functions decrease to
such an extent that prevents the continued successful performance.”


                                                                                              26
The Law defines the extended service period for insured persons with disabilities who have a
physical disability of at least 70%; veterans from the first to the sixth group; civil war invalids
of groups I to VI; blind persons, persons suffering from muscular dystrophy or muscular and
neuromuscular diseases, paraplegia and cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. The degree of
the extended service period for insured persons with disabilities is 12/15 (every 12 months
spent in these positions shall be included in the service/insurance period as 15 months) in all
cases (Article 74). Further on, the Law stipulates that insured women who gave a birth to a
child are entitled to the accelerated service period in a way that they shall be granted six
months of special service for each child they gave birth to (Article 74a).26


Insured persons are entitled to the calculation of the service period at an accelerated rate
provided that they have effectively spent on the workplaces, i.e. on the jobs referred to in the
Law (Article 70) a total of at least 10 years, or a total of at least five years if, based on the work
performed on these working positions or jobs, their disability has been established (Article
71). The insurance period will be increased for the time effectively spent at work. When
exercising the right to pension and disability insurance, cumulative years of service shall be
calculated at an accelerated rate achieved on the workplace or jobs referred to in Article 70
of the Law. The minimum of 10-year working period is relatively short, compared to other
countries. For example, in Poland the minimum required period is set at the level of 15 years.


The Law defines also the age-limit lowering for the entitlement to old-age pension (Article 18)
depending on the length of time for which the insurance period is calculated as extended
service period and on the degree of extended service period. With that regard, for workplaces,
occupations and disabled persons entitled to accelerated service period the age limit for
entitlement to old-age pension, as defined in Article 17, Paragraph 1 (67 years of and at
minimum 15 years of service) is lowered in the following way:
    i.     by 1 year for every 6 years for workplaces or occupations where the extended
           service period is calculated as 12/14;
    ii.    by 1 year for every 5 years for workplaces or occupations where the extended
           service period is calculated as 12/15 (including for the persons with disabilities, as
           defined in Article 74);
     iii.   by 1 year for every 4 years for workplaces or occupations where the extended
            service period is calculated as 12/16;
     iv.    by 1 year for every 3 years for workplaces or occupations where the extended
            service period is calculated as 12/18.

In the period January 1, 2004 - December 31, 2012, stipulations of Article 18 as presented
above were applied to the lowered retirement age (lower than 67) as stipulated in Articles
197, 198 and 199 (last two being valid only for women).


However, in exception to the other persons entitled to accelerated service period, to whom
the rules from the Article 18 above applied, a particular group of workplaces and occupations
was entitled to additional lowering of the age limit (Article 197a):
1) authorized officers under the regulations on performing interior and police affairs;
2) authorized officers of the National Security Agency;
3) professional military personnel serving in the Army of Montenegro;
4) employees of the bodies and organizations that, in terms of regulations on defense, work
at jobs where insurance service is calculated at an accelerated rate;
5) authorized officers in terms of regulations on the execution of criminal sanctions.
Persons from this group became entitled to an old-age pension if they had at least 50 years of
age and 20 years of insurance, of which at least 10 years effectively spent (and calculated in a
cumulative way) on workplaces at which insurance service is calculated at an accelerated rate.
Furthermore, even if the person did not have a status defined in 1) to 5) as listed above, but
were working in these positions at least 20 years, they were entitled to an additional lowering
of the age limit (Article 197b). In addition, the level of the pension of such persons was
increased by 20% to the level calculated by the Law (Article 197v). Stipulations from these
three articles were valid in the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2012 (as stipulated by
the Article 197d)27.


General exceptions were re-introduced with the 2010 amendments to the Law, enabling
lowering of the age limit in the period 1 January 2013 - 31 December 2040, as defined under
Articles 197dj (for both men and woman) and 198a (only for women). During the period 2013
– 2040, insured persons eligible for extended service period were entitled to lowering of the
age limit for reaching old-age pension retirement age in accordance with the stipulations of
Article 18, as presented above.


As of the 2010 amendments to the Law that enabled transition period for reaching the
retirement age of 67, stipulations of Article 18 as presented above were applied to the lowered
retirement age as prescribed by the Articles 197dj and 198a (Annex 2).


Starting from 2010 for each month of earlier retirement, before the statutory retirement age,
monthly decrement is 0.35% (Article 27a), i.e. 21% for those who have retired five years before


27
  Introduced through Artcile 12 of the Law on Changes and Amendments to the Law on Pension and Dissability
Insurance („Official Gazzette of Montenegro“, No. 79/08).

                                                                                                       28
         the legal retirement age (further to that, pension level calculated with the decrement applied
         shall be retained also after reaching age of 67). In exception to this rule, for men who will start
         with early retirement in 2011 and by 2024 (Article 197ž), i.e. for women who will start with
         early retirement in 2022 and by 2040 (Article 198e), monthly decrement of 0.35% will be
         applied for each month of retirement prior to statutory retirement before certain years of age,
         starting with 62 in 2022 (Figure 15 and Table 2 in Annex 3). Annual early retirement decrement
         of 4.25% in Montenegro is set close to those in the countries with demographic features
         similar to Montenegro, actuarially neutral decrement ranges between 4-5%. However, it could
         be increased with a view to bring additional fiscal savings and social fairness and to demotivate
         early retirement (the latter particularly if the years of service conditioned for early retirement
         would not be changed).

         3.3. Workplaces and jobs subject to accelerated service period

         The list of workplaces and occupations subject to accelerated service period is regulated by
         the secondary regulation under the PDI Law (Article 72) and adopted by the Ministry of Labor
         and Social Welfare, except for the public administration and military in which cases the
         regulation is adopted by the Government (accelerated service period of the insured persons
         with disabilities and of insured women is regulated by the Law, as noted above). Workplaces
         and occupations, as well as the degree of extension of the service period are under the Law

and as of 200728 subject to review after five years (Article 72). As will be explained further, last
reviews of the existing, i.e. adoptions of the new regulation regulating the degree of extension
of the service period were made in April 2009 for military personnel, in December 2010 for
public employees and in November 2010 for employees of private and state-owned
companies.


In November 2010 Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare adopted Regulation on determination
of the workplaces and occupations for which the insurance service is calculated at an
accelerated rate and the procedure and method for their determination 29 (Regulation).30 In
Article 2, the Regulation defines 24 different sections (concerning economic activities,
occupations and working conditions)31 within which there are 139 workplaces and jobs in
private and state-owned companies.32 The list of workplaces and occupations subject to
accelerated service period valid as of 2010 is narrower than the one valid in the former period.
However, it is still broad ranging from ballet dancers, bus drivers, chimney sweepers to pilots.
Depending on particular workplaces and occupations, the Regulation defines their entitlement
to the one of the four degrees of the extended service period: 12/14, 12/15, 12/16, and 12/18,
meaning that every 12 months spent in these positions shall be included in the
service/insurance period as 14 (15, 16, or 18) months. Thus, retirement age of the persons
working on such workplaces will be reduced proportionally to accelerated service period.


The Regulation contains also the Methodology for preparation of professional documentation
for establishing and reviewing of jobs subject to accelerated service period. According to the
Regulation, employers, other interested parties and the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund
of Montenegro can initiate establishment of the new and revision of the current workplaces
and occupations subject to accelerated service period and acceleration degree.

   Before that, workplaces and occupations subject to accelerated service period were regulated by the Rulebook
on establishing workplaces, i.e. jobs for which the service period is calculated with extended duration and on the
procedure and method for their determination , „Official Gazette of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, No. 48/97,
15/98, 34/98, 47/99, 48/99, 72/99, 7/2000, 17/2000, 26/2000, 48/2000, 22/2001, 51/2001, 15/2002, 32/2002,
64/2002 and 69/2002. This Regulation covered 41 different sections and over 400 workplaces and jobs (however,
this Regulation was valid for the former state union with Serbia, which had the much more diversified economy).
31
   The sections are as follows: I Mines; II Geological mining research; III Iron industry; IV Foundry; V Blacksmith;
VI Refractory stonemason; VII Forestry; VIII Production of explosives and explosive materials; VIII Naval
shipbuilding; IX Traffic; X Construction and maintenance of transmission; XI Construction; XII Printing industry;
XIII Leather - manufacturing; XIV Textile industry; XV Pharmaceutical industry; XVI Power generation; XVII Meat
industry; XVIII Working under low temperatures; XIX Working under water; XX Utilities; XXI Health institutions;
XXII Emergency medical assistance; XXIII Mounting of technology equipment in power engineering and in
chemical industry; XXIV Artistic activity.

   Detailed list of these sections and workplaces, as well as of the degrees of extended service period, can be
found in Annex 4.

                                                                                                                30
Currently valid list of workplaces and occupations (adopted originally in 2003 and revised five
times since) subject to accelerated service period in the public administration is regulated
through Regulation on determining the workplaces, i.e. jobs in the state administration to
which insurance period is calculated with an increased duration,33 adopted by the
Government. Regulation is adopted in 2003 and has been amended at five occasions since,
last time in December 2010. This Regulation defines (Article 3) five ministries and
organizational segments of the Government and 25 groups of jobs (as listed in Annex 4) within
that are subject to accelerated service period. The five ministries and organizational segments
are:
I Ministry of Internal Affairs, including the three organizational segments (in total 72 types of
jobs):
        1) The Directorate for Emergency Situations;
        2) The Department for Internal Control of Police; and
        3) The Police;
II General Secretariat of the Government; jobs in the Air-service: use of aircraft;
III National Security Agency; officials with special duties and powers in the Security and
Intelligence System;
IV Ministry of Justice; authorized officials with the task of execution of imprisonment,
detention, educational measure of committal to an educational institution and ensuring
judicial bodies; and
V Ministry of Defense; authorized officials working in military intelligence, counter-
intelligence and security affairs.


For most of the workplaces and occupations, this Regulation defines entitlement to the degree
of the extended service period 12/16 meaning that every 12 months spent in these positions
shall be included in the service/insurance period as 16 months. Only the professional pilots in
the public service are granted 12/18 degree.34 All the other rights related to the pension and
disability benefits of this group of employees, i.e. persons insured within the PAYG system,
have been defined by the Law.


The Government has adopted in April 2009 a separate regulation to regulate accelerated
service period for the military personnel, Regulation on the establishment of duties, or
transactions in which the service period of professional military personnel shall be calculated

military personnel (civil servants working in the Army of Montenegro are not included) is
entitled to pension insurance with extended service period:


     1. 12/14 degrees are granted to; professional military personnel not covered by the next
        three provisions (articles 2, 3 and 4 of this Regulation).
     2. 12/15 degrees are granted to; professional military personnel not covered by the
        previous two provisions (articles 2 and 3 of this Regulation) but who are carrying
        duties, i.e. occupations in the Army of Montenegro;
     3. 12/16 degrees are granted to; all the jobs concerning electronic monitoring in the units
        for electronic reconnaissance and all occupations of crypto in units of the Army of
        Montenegro (Army) and the Headquarter of the Army of Montenegro (Headquarter)
        2) intelligence affairs and military police units of the Army, the Headquarter and the
        Ministry of Defense;36
     4. 12/18 degrees are granted to; professional military personnel carrying: a) duties of
        maritime diversion maker in a maritime squadron; b) duties in the company of special
        forces; c) duties of divers; d) duties in the decompression chamber or hyperbaric
        chamber - persons engaged in prospecting and coaching persons for the corresponding
        duties in the submarine service, if they have spent on such prospecting and coaching
        at least 90 hours per year.


In addition to that, the Law on use of units of the Army of Montenegro in the international
forces and the participation of Civil Guard, police and employees of the public administration
in peacekeeping missions and other activities abroad37 prescribes that for the professional
military personnel who are participating in international peacekeeping operations accelerated
service period amounts 24 months for each 12 months (Article 15).




3.4. Supplementary contribution rate for pension insurance of the early retirees

supplementary contribution rate for their employees who are eligible for calculation of the

for this addition remains unclear as this type of occupations was already covered by the Regulation adopted by
the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.

insurance/service period as extended service period, with a view to finance their full pension
(Article 8). This is defined by Article 8 of the Law, besides the contribution rate for pay-as-you-
go (PAYG) pension insurance system (first pillar), which amounts to 20.5%39. Article 16 defines
the following supplementary contribution rates for extended service period:
    1. 6% for workplaces or occupations where the extended service period is calculated as
        12/14;
    2. 9% for workplaces or occupations where the extended service period is calculated as
        12/15;
    3. 12% for workplaces or occupations where the extended service period is calculated as
        12/16;
    4. 18% for workplaces or occupations where the extended service period is calculated as
        12/18;
     5. 28% for workplaces or occupations where the extended service period is calculated as
        12/24;

There is no supplementary contribution rate that should be paid for insured persons with
disabilities. For the second and the third pillar supplementary contribution rates have not
been defined.

Supplementary contribution rates, along with reducing the retirement age for specific group
of occupations are one of the three ways the governments are using to compensate failing of
the salaries to provide financing of the early retirements and disability risks (the third one
being imposing obligations on employers and trade unions to establish occupational pension
funds). However, in today's technological progress and global world differences between
occupations have been diminishing rapidly; jobs and working conditions have changed, labor
mobility is higher, people take more jobs in their careers, and do more part time work than in
the past. From the social angle, it is understandable that the society tends to provide some


39
  The pension contribution rate is paid at rate of 5.5% by employer and at rate of 15.0% by the insured person
when he/she is: a persons employed by the employer; persons performing temporary and occasional work;
elected or appointed persons, if for the position of getting paid; citizens of Montenegro employed on the territory
of Montenegro with foreign or international organizations and institutions, foreign diplomatic and consular
missions or by foreign legal entities or individuals, as well as foreign citizens and stateless persons employed in
Montenegro by domestic legal or private persons and by unless the international agreement provides otherwise.
The same rule applies also to; foreign citizens and stateless persons who are on the territory of Montenegro
employed by foreign legal entities and individuals, and by international organizations and institutions and foreign
diplomatic and consular offices unless the international agreement provides otherwise and/or they are not
insured under the regulations of another country . The pension contribution rate is being paid only by the
insured person when employees are: 1) members of the board of directors in a company or other legal entity,
and members of the management boards of public companies and institutions that for his work receive
compensation; 2) citizens of Montenegro employed abroad; entrepreneurs and individuals who are engaged in
professional or other activity as a primary occupation; 3) persons who achieve contracted fee, if they are not
contributors on other grounds; and 4) farmers. Pension contribution is being paid by Employment Agency of
Montenegro in the case of persons entitled to an allowance in accordance with the law regulating employment,
and by the religous community for priests, clerics, monks, and nuns.

                                                                                                               33
occupations or groups with additional security and benefits in their old age. Special treatment
should not be accompanied by unfair or inequitable treatment. Therefore, finding equilibrium
between the pension system's objectives of economic sustainability and social fairness
presents a challenge in every society.

In Montenegro, contribution rates (standard and supplementary) produce contributions
insufficient for financing the early retirement (which is allowed penalty-free after 40 years of
service, same as for non-hazardous occupations). For example, for a young 18-year old
entrants, with average service period of 30 years, of which 20 in positions with accelerated
12/18 service,40 retiring at the age of 48, pension contribution would need to be at least 50%
to yield a 50% replacement rate, which is more than double the current basic contribution
rate.41 Currently, the insured person with 12/18 accelerated service period is subject to a
contribution rate of 38.5% (20.5% standard plus 18% supplementary contribution rate). If the
standard contribution rates are treated as given, it means that the supplementary
contribution rates are not actuarially balanced and should be increased if the retirement
period for all the occupations with accelerated service period shall remain unchanged or vice
versa; if the retirement period is appropriately increased the supplementary contribution
rates could remain unchanged. In any other case, early retirement and/or extra accrual rate
and /or top ups to general formula provisions have to be financed from other sources, such as
transfers from the budget.



3.5. Trend in number of employees entitled to ESP in Montenegro in the period 2011
– June 2016

For the purpose of precise analysis of their impact on the Montenegrin pension system, it is
necessary to examine the details of the insured persons who are currently entitled to the
extended service period (ESP), including their total number, age, etc. While the data of the
Pension Fund in this area are limited and incomplete, the Tax Authority has adequate data
that are representing a sufficient base for accurate and serious analysis, assuming that they
cover all employees who are entitled to ESP.

According to the data of the Tax Authority42, the total number of insured persons entitled
to ESP, on various bases (Box 1), was at the end of June 2016 (8,303) for one quarter lower
compared to the end of 2011 (11,122).43 At the same time, to a number of such persons


40
   Yielding a total of 40 years of service, minimum required service period.
41
   In the example above the retirement period would be similar to service period – around 30 years.
42
   The Tax Authority data refer to employees for whom their employers paid contributions for ESP in the certain
years (for the 2016 period refers to th e January - June). Data are presented in the periods in which the payments
were made and not in those in which the liabilities for payments of contributions for ESP were created.
43
   It should be noted that in theory it is possible that a number of persons entitled to ESP is bigger than the
number shown in the Tax Administration data, because the data reflect the part of employees for whom their

                                                                                                              34
insurance for ESP was paid on two, and rarely on the three bases. At the beginning of the
observed period majority of such cases was registered in the corporate sector. However, their
share was cut down with a reduction in the number of employees in the metal industry, which
employed most of the insured persons entitled to ESP in the corporate sector. A similar trend
was observed with police personnel. At the same time, an increase of multiple ESP insurance
for persons employed in the military was recorded (Table 5).

The existence of payment of the pension insurance for ESP on several bases for a certain
number of insured person renders impossible the analysis of the data structure upon the
number of persons entitled to an accelerated retirement; therefore, the analysis must be
carried out upon the number of bases for payment of the ESP pension benefit, which is
bigger than the number of persons entitled to ESP (from 4.6% in 2011 to 1.1% in 2016). This
should be borne in mind when interpreting the data and indicators presented in the following
analysis. Multiple insurances for ESP are a reflection of the practical needs of employers to
use working hours of their employees in carrying out tasks which, in accordance with the
relevant regulations, may create the conditions for paying contributions for ESP related
insurance based upon different bases (which relate to the different acceleration rates).

Corporative sector includes, among others, the health system that largely comprises insured persons employed in public health institutions. However, due
to limitations of the Tax Authority data it was not possible to extract these specific insured persons and include them as a separate segment of the public
sector. This should be kept in mind when interpreting data that refer to corporate and public sectors, including in the forthcoming analysis of Tax
Authority data in this section of the report.

employers have paid contributions for ESP. That refers to the private sector. However, bearing in mind that the
right to ESP mainly have employees who work (or have worked) in companies in the metal industry that has in
total gone through the privatization process, including reducing the number of employees through dismissal or
retirement of redundancy, it can be considered that the number of employees with the right to early retirement
options presented through the Tax Administration data reflects more or less true state of affairs. As for the state
sector, the percentage of the basis for which there is a liability of the ESP payment, but not also a corresponding
payment, is relatively small, as discussed below. Therefore, it may be considered that a problem of under-
reporting of employees entitled to ESP in the public sector was not present.

In addition, according to the Tax Administration data in the period January 2011 - June 2016
there was a certain percentage of the insured persons entitled to ESP, primarily in the
corporate sector, for which there was a liability for payment of contributions for ESP (or who
were registered with the Tax Authority), but for whom the payment upon that liability was not
performed by their employers in a given period for which the liability was created (i.e. in the
period of one calendar year for which the data were observed). In fact, the highest
percentages of unpaid contributions were recorded for codes 52 and 54 (22% and 51%,
respectively), which were commonly used in manufacturing industries that undergo multiple
privatization cycles (Table 6, rows 2 and 7).

contained in the Rules is used for registration of payments to employees in the army, ANB and IECS who are

months) the amount of liabilities upon which no payments were made was significantly
reduced, for over 60%. Also, compared to 2011 payment of contributions for ESP was by 8.5%
bigger in 2015 and it was also by 9% bigger compared to the amount of total liability for ESP
contributions in that year. This is a result of payments for ESP contributions made by
employers in certain years for the liabilities that were not paid on time in previous years. This
trend was specifically pronounced in the period after 2013 in which the Law on Prevention of
Illegal Business Activities was adopted, as was explained earlier in the document. In addition,
in that year restructuring of tax and social contribution debts of employers to the state budget
was expedited. In the observed period 2011 – 2015, the total amount of liabilities for payment
of ESP contributions has decreased by 13.7%, i.e. by 1.4 Mill. Euro, which is a result of the drop
in a number of insured persons entitled to ESP.

The problem of non-payment of contributions for ESP was only marginally present when it
comes to employees in the public sector, but as for them another type of anomaly was
present – overdue payment of contributions for ESP. Namely, the amount of contribution
that is not paid in the year in which the liability was created gets paid in the next and / or
future years. This is evident from the rows 3 and 4, i.e. 8 and 9 in Table 6; thus, for almost all
codes used by the public sector (72-78) the amount of payments made in a single one-year
period was higher than the amount of the liability for that period, ranging from 24% to 46%
(except for the code 72 for which there is a certain small percentage of the unpaid liabilities
for contributions for ESP). As a result, the amount of total payments exceeded the amount of
total liabilities for ESP contributions. On the one hand, it can be regarded as positive that the
state is paying contributions for ESP if not on time, but then at least in a subsequent period.
However, this practice, despite understanding its causes (insufficient availability of funds in
the state budget to carry out the payment), prevents PIO Fund from adequate financial
planning and execution of its budget. This causes an increase in transfers from the state
budget, which jeopardizes its own planning and execution, but also complicates any serious
analysis needed to design public policy in this area.

The total number of bases, and similarly total number of employees entitled to ESP, was
reduced from 2011 to the end of June 2016 to 3,256 or by 28%; at the same time the number
of these bases decreased to a greater extent in the corporate then in the public sector (by
2,228 or 47% versus 1,028 or 15%). Consequently, the share of the bases for calculation of ESP
contributions of the corporate sector in the total number of bases was reduced in the
reporting period from 41% to 30.3% in favor of the bases relating to employees in the public
sector (Table 7).

At the end of June 2016, in the total number of bases (8.397), the largest share accounted
for by men entitled to ESP (7,807 or 93%), while the share of bases that referred to women
was significantly lower (590 or 7%). This structure was only slightly changed from 2011 (Table
8) despite higher nominal and relative reduction in the number of bases related to the men
entitled to ESP (by 3,107 persons or 28.5%) compared to a reduction in the number of bases
related to women entitled to ESP (by 149 persons or 20.2%). There, a share of the bases
related to women entitled to ESP at the end of June 2016 was slightly higher in the public in
relation to the corporate sector (7.5% vs. 6.0%). The structure of the bases pertaining to men
was changed so that the number and proportion of men increased in the public at the expense
of the corporate sector (where the number of insured persons entitled to ESP was reduced in
the manufacturing industry). Increase of the share of the public sector occurred despite the
reduction in the number of employed men, which was greater in the police, the NSA and the
PSEA than in the army (641 vs. 327 bases). The reason for that was because a reduction in the
number of men in corporate exceeded the reduction of such number in the public sector. The
same trend, in terms of their share in the corporate or public sector was recorded in the
structure of the bases that are related to women.

When observed upon the years of age, of the insured persons entitled to ESP, it is evident
that the range from 41 to 50 years of age has the largest share in the total number of bases,
where the latter has decreased over the observed period 2011 - June 2016 (Figures 16 and
17). The share of this age range has increased significantly in 2014 (43.6%) in comparison with
2011 (39.6%). The share of the age ranges from 31 to 40 years of age is growing even though

                                                                                                                        39
the nominal number of people in this range fluctuates at around 3,000 thousand. The number
of people ranging from 21 to 30 years of age has been increasing both in nominal and relative
terms. The share of both these ranges in the total number of grounds is growing at the expense
of reducing the number of persons older than 50 years, which is expected due to the very
essence of retirement plan with accelerated rate.

At the end of June 2016 compared to the end of 2011 a reduction of the number of bases
relating to persons older than 50 years (2,269) accounted for a 70% reduction in the total
number of bases (3,257). In this reduction about 81% (1,832) was related to the reduction in
the corporate, while 19% referred to the reduction in the public sector. In the corporate
sector, the reason for this abatement was mainly a reduction of the number of employees
during and after the privatization of the state-owned companies (ex. in KAP, Bauxite Mine and
Ironworks). In the public sector the reason was the targeted reduction in the number of
employees, which is mainly made possible through the process of amendments to the Law on
Pension and Disability Insurance, which generally provided more favorable early retirement
options, as explained above. This is probably the reason why in this period there was a
decrease in the number of bases in the range of 41-50 years of age (527 in the public and 463
in the corporate sector), as well as in the range of 31-40 years of age (162 in the public and 64

                                                                                                               40
        in the corporate sector), while the number of bases ranging from 21 to 30 years of age
        increased by 228, to a greater extent in the corporate than in the public sector (125 vs. 103
        persons).

        When the share of the various acceleration rates in the total number of bases is observed,
        it can be seen that the overall reduction in the number of bases (3,257) was contributed the
        most by the reduction in acceleration rates 12/14 (by 1,380 bases or 42.4%), as shown in
        Table 9. This was mainly a result (with up to 99%) of a reduction in the number of bases used
        by the corporate sector; however, besides this sector, the same acceleration rate was used
        also for a portion of the military personnel entitled to ESP in the Army of Montenegro and
        employees of the health sector (still, in the observed period no health institution registered or
        paid contributions for ESP for their employees). A relatively large reduction was recorded with
        acceleration rates 12/16 and 12/15 (whose share in the overall reduction was 31% and 22%,
        respectively), while the reduction of the number of bases within acceleration rates 12/18 and
        12/24 was significantly lower (by 3% and 2%, respectively).

        Within the reduction of the acceleration rate 16/12, which in the reporting period amounted
        to 1,002, the largest share of 699 (or 70%) had a reduction within the code 72 (authorized
        police officers). Most of the remaining reduction in the context of this acceleration rate
        related to the corporate sector (295 or 29.5%), while only 8 or 0.5% related to the reduction
        of military personnel. The largest share in the acceleration rate 12/16 has the code 72
        (authorized police officers), on average about, 82%, while the share of the base 53 (corporate

presented in Figure 18.

Within the reduction of the acceleration rate 12/15, which in the reporting period totaled
708, or 30.3%, the largest decrease of 578 (or 61%) had a reduction of the code 52 (the
corporate sector), while the reduction of the code 75 (military personnel) amounted to 130
(or 9.3%), as presented in Figure 19. Acceleration rates 12/18 and 12/24 are used for the ESP
entitled employees of the Army of Montenegro; the total number of bases for these two
acceleration rates dropped by the end of June 2016 by about 36%, to less than 300 (Table 9).
This development led to an increase in the share of acceleration rates 12/16 in the total
number of basis from 51.6% to 59.8% (Figures 20 and 21) at the end of June 2016.

         Data submitted by the Tax Authority show a favorable trend (Table 10) of the reduction in
         number and change in structure of insured persons who are entitled to ESP, despite an
         increase of the average number of employees in Montenegro by 7.7% in 2015 compared to
         2011, according to the official employment data by Monstat. This trend can be attributed to
         the reduction of the number of miners, employees of manufacturing and of the state-owned
         enterprises that have been privatized as of 2011. This trend was also contributed by the
                                                                                                                                                                43
reduction in the number of civil servants who have retired on the basis of one-off
opportunities for early retirement, enabled through the amendments to the Law on Pension
and Disability Insurance, as previously explained. Thus, the total number of the insured
persons entitled to ESP decreased by 25.3%; concomitantly, the number of insured persons in
the army, police, NSA and IECS decreased by 33.8%, while in the corporate sector it was
reduced by almost 43%.

Owing to this downward trend, the proportion of the number of the ESP entitled employees
was reduced from 2011 to June 2016 from 6.9% to 4.7%. However, even more accurate
impression of the reduction shall be acquired if the total number of employees with
accelerated service is observed without those employed in the public sector (in the military,
the police, the NSA and the IECS), i.e. if only those employed in the corporate sector are
observed. Their share in total official employment was reduced in the reporting period from
2.7% to 1.4%, which is a percentage adequate to the one considered as international best
practice. These percentages are even lower if the number of the ESP entitled employees in the
corporate sector is viewed in relation to employment according to the Labor Force Survey,
conducted by the State Bureau of Statistics, Monstat.45 However, the share of the ESP entitled

  Namely, according to the Labour Force Survey (LFS) the number of employees in Montenegro is higher than
the official average number of employees ranging from 20% to 25% (in 2011 and 2015, respectively), or up to
28% in June 2016. This percentage seems to be somewhat smaller if we exclude employees covered by the LFS
that do not work full-time (ranging from 15% to 19% and 23% in these years and periods). In this regard, the

                                                                                                                                         44
employees of the Army of Montenegro, police, the NSA and the IECS in the total official
employment, amounting to 3.3% in June 2016, remains very high. According to estimates of
employed in police and military in Montenegro,46 in 2014 some 95% of employees in police
(internal affairs) were entitled to ESP. The share in army (national defense) in the same year
stood at 14%, largely due to ESP eligibility revision in the military in 2009.



3.6. Conditions for re-entering of the retirees to the labor market


Many options for early retirement (including through early start of the transition period for
old-age retirement), eligible under the PDI Law, per se create an environment supportive to
the early retirement and contribute to the increase of the PIO Fund expenditures for pensions.
At the same time, the PDI Law implicitly allows employment of the old-age and early retirees
and their reactivation on the labor market.

The Labor Law does not prescribe any age limitation for any type of employment contracts
(open ended time, part-time or lump sum assignments, i.e. honorariums). It only mandates
that the employment contract ends at the age of 67 but can be extended if the parties agree.
The Law on Personal Income Tax (Article 46)47 treats retirees48 employed upon open-ended
contract equal to any other employee; thus, they are obliged to pay 9%, i.e. 13% personal
income tax (PIT) depending on the level of their salary (up to, i.e. over Euro 720, respectively).

The Law on Social Insurance Contributions provides even an incentive for the employed
retirees,49 as in the case of their employment upon an open-ended time contract their
employers would not be obliged to pay for their health and insurance from unemployment,
but only for their pension insurance. The same pension contribution rates would apply as for
any other employee, meaning that employee, i.e. retiree would pay 15%, and employer 5.5%
pension contribution (20.5% in total) calculated to the gross salary.50 However, if such retiree
would get employed additionally upon the part-time contract, he/she would be obliged to pay
on this new contract only a PIT at the rate of 9%, calculated to the 70% of the compensation
received upon this part-time contract (but they would not be obliged to pay a pension


share of the ESP entitled employees in the total number of employees as per LFS would be even lower compared
to the share calculated against the official employment; it would range from 2.2% in 2011 to 1.1% in June 2016.

   It has been circumstantially understood that these stipulations refer to the old-age and early retirees as well
as to the exceptions among the family pensioners, as explained further in the document.

insurance as they would already be paying it upon the open-ended contract). Still, if the retiree
is not employed upon open-ended contract and gets employed upon only a part-time contract,
he/she would be obliged to pay both PIT at the 9% rate and pension contribution at 20.5%
rate, applied to 70% compensation received upon their part-time contract.51 In the case a
retiree would be employed as a member of the governing board of the public or private
company, he/she would be obliged to pay the PIT at the rate of 9%, i.e. 13% depending on the
level of his/her compensation (up to, i.e. over Euro 720, respectively). He/she would also be
obliged to pay pension contribution at the rate of 20.5% calculated to the compensation
received for their position in the governing board.52

In contrast, the PDI Law clearly defines suspending of the pension payment to the beneficiaries
of the family pensions who start to work or get self-employed in the territory of Montenegro
or abroad (Art. 112, paragraph 3). Exceptions to this rule (Art. 112, paragraph 4) are the
beneficiaries of survivors' pensions who are children under the age of 19 or children over this
age attending school, but no later than 24 years of age, or 25 years of age if attending faculty
that lasts longer than four years (Art. 46, para 1, 2 and 3). Exemptions also apply to
beneficiaries of family pension engaged in an activity (who are not covered by the pension
insurance in any other way) carrying out the work based on the part-time contract, lump sum
assignments, as well as activities under other contracts in which they are entitled to a
compensation (Art. 11, paragraph 1, item 2). In such cases, features of the Law on Social
Insurance Contributions and of the Law on Personal Income Tax also apply.

Widows and widowers, according to the PDI Law of 2003 (Art. 44, paragraph 1, item 1) are
able to acquire the right to a survivor's pension and to permanently retain it if they have, at
the time of the death of their spouses, reached 52 years of age. From 2010 to 2012, the age
limit for widowers was 50, and for the widows 48 years and six months, i.e. 49 years, and 49
years and six months, respectively (Art. 207). This rule was somewhat modified in 201053 (Art.
207a) in a way that the life limit changed to 50 years of age attained in 2013, which was
gradually increased by six months of age until 2017 and the age of 52 years. From the
standpoint of ensuring social rights for unemployed spouses of deceased insured persons,
these solutions are generous and friendly but do not provide an incentive to stay in the labor
market. The necessary motivation, of the employers primarily, for hiring these social
categories, could possibly be provided through other laws, primarily the Law on Social
Insurance Contributions and the Personal Income Tax Law.

To old-age pensioner who gets employed or self-employed the PDI Law provides the right to
a re-determination of pension upon termination of the employment or business, and if he/she

was in the insurance under this Law for at least a year (Art. 112, paragraph 1). This possibility
is given also to users of early retirement pensions, which, after the termination of re-
employment or self-employment, are entitled to an old age or early retirement. The PDI Law
does not define how to perform again the determination of pensions "returnees", thus the re-
determination should be implicitly done in the manner in which the determination of the old-
age pensions is made to all pension beneficiaries. That manner implies that the level of
pension is determined on the basis of net personal income achieved during the total number
of years through which the worker paid in pension contributions. In doing so, on the basis of
annual personal coefficient determined for each calendar year according to the provisions of
Articles 19 to 27 of the Law favorable personal coefficient shall be calculated, which the
insured person has achieved during any from 12 to 40 consecutive years, depending on the
calendar year of retirement (Article 200), as presented in Figure 22.

As discussed above, the legal options for re-employment of the first-time pensioners are
liberal and thus have a positive effect on the labor market; the PDI Law allows keeping the
right on pensions earned at the first time retirement in the case of employment of the old-age
and early old-age retirees under any type of the employment contract. Only the beneficiaries
of the family pensions are not able to keep their pensions in the case of employment or self-
employment (still, there are two exceptions to this rule, one of which refers to widows and
widowers). Concomitantly, other relevant laws (the Labor Law and the Law on Personal
Income Tax) do not treat employed retirees any different than any other employee, while the
Law on Social Insurance Contributions provides even incentive in the particular cases of
employment of the retirees. However, increase of employment of the retirees and of any

4. Review of international practice in the area of early retirement for special
and hazardous occupations


As indicated in the introduction, many of the European countries are currently introducing
pension system changes that are aimed to prolong working lives and increase retirement age.
The demographic change projected in the EU countries, if not accompanied by reform
measures would lead to an increase in public pension expenditure. Due to ageing populations,
demographic factors are projected to be the main (and usually the only) increasing driver of
public pension expenditure in the upcoming decades. The contribution of the demographic
factors to the change in public pension spending per decade until 2060 is assessed in
(European Commission DG ECFIN, 2015). The demographic effect is at its strongest in the first
two decades of the projections (2013- 2030), when the post-war baby-boom generation
reaches the retirement age54.



Tightening of the eligibility for a public pension (through higher retirement age and/or reduced
access to early retirement and better control of alternatives to early retirement) is one of the
ways to constrain public pension expenditure in nearly every Member State. Legal retirement
age is the most important parameter of pension systems that affects transition from work to
retirement. (Chomik & Whitehouse, 2010) analyzed pensionable ages in the OECD countries
since 1950s, indicating a shift in trend of falling retirement age that occurred in mid 1990s
(Figure 23). Pensionable age started to increase for both men and women, which is expected
to continue as a result of implemented reforms through raising the general retirement age
and equalization of retirement ages for men and women.



As shown in Figure 24, in most of the EU countries the legal retirement age will be increasing
between 2011 and 2040. It is expected to reach 67 for men and women in Czech Republic,
France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, Italy and Sweden and even exceed this limit in
Ireland, Italy, Finland and Denmark (where the retirement age is expected to reach 70).




54
   The smallest impact is projected for Luxembourg least over the 2013- 2020 period (+0.6 p.p.) while the
demographic impact is the largest in Poland (+3.5 p.p.). The impact for the EU as a whole is 1.7 p.p. over the same
period. Between 2013 and 2060 the demographic impact is projected to be the lowest (3.6 p.p) in Denmark and
highest (12.4 p.p.) in Poland.

                                                                                                               48

Creating conditions for prolonging working lives through different measures were underlined
as important policy direction already from the beginning of 1980s. International Labor
Organization in its Older Workers Recommendation No 162 adopted on June 4, 1980
underlines that countries should, within the framework of a national policy to promote
equality of opportunity and treatment for workers, whatever their age, and of laws and

                                                                                                                49
regulations and of practice on the subject, take measures for the prevention of discrimination
in employment and occupation with regard to older workers. Additionally, where the reasons
for the difficulties in adaptation encountered by older workers are mainly related to
advancement in age, measures in respect of the type of activity in question should to the
extent practicable be applied so as to:

   i.   remedy those conditions of work and of the working environment that are likely to
        hasten the ageing process;
  ii. modify the forms of work organization and working time which lead to stress or to an
        excessive pace of work in relation to the possibilities of the workers concerned, in
        particular by limiting overtime;
 iii. adapt the job and its content to the worker by recourse to all available technical means
        and, in particular, to ergonomic principles, so as to preserve health, prevent accidents
        and maintain working capacity;
 iv. provide for a more systematic supervision of the workers' state of health;
  v. provide for such supervision on the job as is appropriate for preserving the workers'
        safety and health.
These recommendations are in line with the policy of active ageing, which is a part of the
Europe 2020 strategy, focusing on prolonging working lives. There are many factors that relate
to improvement of work ability, which are shown in Figure 25. Such policies should be
implemented in parallel with the legislated increases in retirement age, to prevent potential
social losses.

                                                                                             50
There are three main policy directions, which are implemented in the EU and the OECD
countries. (OECD, 2013) underlines that recent pension reforms, among others, are aimed at
lengthening working lives so that people build higher pension entitlements and improve their
retirement income. Measures adopted have been of three main types: i) increases in the
statutory retirement age; ii) improved provision of financial incentives to work beyond
retirement age, e.g. through work bonuses and increases in pension benefit at retirement; and
iii) less or no early retirement schemes.

It should be noted that there are many policies and solutions that allow people working in
hazardous and arduous conditions to prolong their working lives. Such policies are desirable
in the context of population ageing and the need to improve employability of older workers,
as indicated in Figure 25. Such measures include (see for example: Riedel & Hofer, 2013;
Syndex, 2014):

   •   lifelong learning to improve or acquire competences and qualifications so that a new
       job can be envisaged;
   •   improvement of working conditions, in particular removing the conditions that are
       related to health worsening;
   •   reduction of working time;
   •   changes in work organization;
   •   better reconciliation of professional and private life (including also solutions
       supporting careers of older family members);
   •   adapting work places to the needs of older workers;
   •   developing opportunities for flexible work arrangements.


Given the factors related to demographic, social and economic changes, the major challenge
is to move forward from reparation/compensation to prevention whenever possible .
(European Commission, 2012; Syndex, 2014).

In the last decade, most of the 34 OECD countries have passed legislation that raises the
retirement age or the length of work requirements that earn entitlement to full pension
benefits.

In this section we present the summary of the outcome of early retirement policy changes in
the EU countries with respect to the retirement age and share of population in early
retirement as well as examples of recent reforms in the field of early retirement and labor
market that were recently enacted in the EU countries, drawing from the summary presented
in the 2015 Ageing Working Group report (European Commission DG ECFIN, 2015). We also
provide some statistical information on the use of early retirement based on the results of the
special LFS module conducted by the Eurostat in 2012. This statistical data allows for better
understanding of transition from employment to retirement in the EU countries.


                                                                                            51
A specific example of Poland is also shown, as one of the most comprehensive reform activities
conducted in recent years in transition economies that leads to the positive outcomes with
respect to reduction of early retirement and stimulating higher labor market participation of
older workers. We conclude with an analysis of how the international practices are applicable
in the case of Montenegro.



4.1. Transition to retirement in the EU countries


The results from the EU Labor force survey (LFS) and its 2012 ad hoc module on the transition
from work to retirement for the European Union (EU) allows to investigate the magnitude of
challenges related to the existence of early retirement provisions in the EU countries. There is
a significant variation in the scale of early retirement between the EU countries.

In 2012, 35.1 % people aged 50-69 in the EU-28 received a pension. Of these, 87.4 % received
an old-age pension. The share of people receiving a pension was the highest in many of the
transition economies, which reflects the generous approach to early retirement in these
countries. In 22 Member States, over 20 % of persons receiving an old-age pension retired
early. The highest proportions were reported in Italy (73.9 %), Ireland (68.5 %) and Spain
(59.9 %) and the lowest in Bulgaria (5.2 %), the Czech Republic (5.3 %) and Estonia (10.9 %).

Drawing early retirement pension in many countries does not mean withdrawal from the labor
market. Some 17% of old-age pensioners still work. The reason for continuing employment,
particularly in many of the new member states is the need of additional income. This indicates
that early retirement with low benefit may not be an efficient solution, as people still need
supplementary source of income and have higher risk of poverty at older ages, when they will
not be able to work anymore.

On average in the EU-28, persons aged 50-69 who receive an old-age pension and who took
part in an early retirement scheme were 58.0 years old when they retired. Those receiving an
old-age pension who did not take part in an early retirement scheme were 59.9 years old on
average, i.e. an average of 1.9 years older. Broken down by countries, the difference in the
retirement age is biggest in Italy (a gap of 4.7 years, the difference between retiring at 61.5
and at 56.8), Ireland (a gap of 4.6 years, i.e. retiring at 64.1 compared to 59.5) and Spain (a
gap of 4.3 years, i.e. retiring at 64.3 compared to 60.1). These countries are also among those
having a higher percentage of early retirements.

4.2. Early retirement changes in EU countries


The approach to early retirement in many of the European systems was similar to the solutions
adopted in Montenegro. In general, early retirement was granted for people working in
selected occupations (assessed as hazardous or arduous in the context of a given country) or
for very long working careers (30 years or over, depending on the country). Below we present

                                                                                                                    54
the general trends in the early retirement policies in the EU. In section 4.3. we present specific
solutions applied to people working in arduous and hazardous conditions that exist in the EU
countries.

Changes of the eligibility criteria leading to increase of retirement ages55

In recent years, we observe different policy measures applied to increase the effective
retirement age. Many of these changes affect access (eligibility) for early retirement. The
detailed list of changes in early retirement eligibility is provided in the Annex 5.

In general, there is a tendency to reduce possibility of early retirement for very long career
records. Such options for early retirements are either withdrawn (for example in Poland) or
career requirements are increased. Another reform direction is to raise the early retirement
threshold, reducing the gap between early and legal retirement age. Finally, in the case of
selected categories of workers (i.e. those with disabilities or working in difficult conditions)
conditions for early retirement are tightened by reducing the number of
occupations/conditions that grant access to early retirement. Table 11: summarizes examples
of recent reforms in selected EU countries that focus on increasing the age in (early)
retirement systems.

countries

 Country       Changes undertaken
 Austria       From 2014 new pension reform measures came into effect. Access to early retirement
               was tightened and invalidity pension scheme was modified. The early retirement scheme
               “Korridorpension” can still be accessed at the age of 62, but the required number of
               insurance years is increased to 40 years by 2017. Women’s statutory retirement age is
               increased from current 60 years between 2024 and 2033. The early old-age pension
               scheme for long term contributors “Hacklerrgelung” was tightened by increasing the
               relevant retirement age by two years to 57 for women and 62 for men.
               Deductions for early retirement were raised from 4.2% p.a. to 5.1% p.a. (for heavy worker
               regulation to 1.8% p.a.). The bonus for later retirement continues to amount to 4.2% p.a.
 Belgium       Pension reform legislated in December 2011 subject to minor changes until April 30th,
               2012. The minimum early retirement age and the minimum number of career years
               required for eligibility are gradually increased between 2013 and 2016 from 60 to 62 years
               and from 35 to 40 years, respectively. People with a 42-year career will still be eligible for
               early retirement at 60 (and at 61 with a 41-year career). In the civil servant scheme, the
               pension amount will take into account the earnings over the last 10 years instead of the
               last 5 years (not applicable to those who reached the age of 50 on January, 1st 2012). For
               the unemployed, the minimum career length requirement is gradually increased to 40
               years. The minimum age will remain 60 years in general, and be increased to 60 years for
               specific cases to which a lower age presently applies. Pension entitlements for the
               unemployed before the age of 60 years as well as entitlements for certain periods of

Country    Changes undertaken
           unemployment and certain career interruptions are reduced. The age of access to the
           survivor scheme was raised in 2014.



Bulgaria The normal retirement age in Bulgaria will gradually rise to reach 65 years for both men
         and women in 2037, parliament has decided.
         The period of work needed to make a worker eligible for receiving full pension benefits
         will gradually rise by two months a year to reach 40 years for men and 37 for women in
         2027.
         The retirement age for miners, aircraft pilots and workers in nuclear power plants
         e.g. first category of labor, will rise to 55 years. Currently the retirement age for men
         working in those sectors can is set at 52 years and 8 months, while women can retire when
         they reach the age of 47 years and 8 months.
         The retirement age for employers working in hazardous condition such as those employed
         in metallurgy, petrochemical industry and public transport will increase to 60 years.
         The retirement age for police officers and members of the military will increase to 52 years
         and 10 months in 2016 and will gradually rise until it reaches 55 years.
Czech    In 2011 the retirement age was increased above 65 years, depending on the year of birth.
Republic Younger cohorts (both genders) are subject to an additional increase of 2 months. For
         example, persons born in 1978 the statutory retirement age is 67 years and 2 months.
Denmark The retirement age increase specified in the 2006 Welfare Agreement is accelerated. The
         retirement age for voluntary early retirement pensions (VERP) will be increased from 60
         to 62 years from 2014-2017 (formerly 2019-2022 in the Welfare Agreement), while the
         public old-age pension age will be increased from 65 to 67 years in 2019-2022 (as opposed
         to 2024-2027 before). VERP is reduced from 5 to 3 years from 2018- 2023. The basic
         amount for VERP is increased, while private pension wealth lowers the VERP amount to a
         higher degree than now. Furthermore, the system of automatic enrolment for members
         of the unemployment insurance scheme into the VERP is cancelled. A new senior disability
         pension is introduced as an administrative fast track into the disability pension for persons
         5 years before the statutory retirement age.
Estonia  Retirement age is increased to 65 years for both males and females gradually by 2026.
Greece   The pension reform increases the statutory retirement age from 60 to 65. The minimum
         age for retirement is set at 60. Penalties apply for persons with less than full contributory
         career.
Germany For persons born after 1946 the statutory retirement age is increased gradually from 65
         to 67 years of age (to be reached for those born in 1964 and later). Early retirement for
         persons with minimum contributory period of 35 years will remain at 63 years of age, but
         the maximum penalty for early retirement, due to the increase of statutory age, will be
         raised from 7.2% to 14.4%.
         As a compensation for the longer duration of pension payments, the pension is reduced
         by 0.3% for each month of drawing a pension prior to the standard retirement age (in case
         of old-age pension for persons with severe disability before the age of 65).
Spain    The 2013 pension reform restricts access to early retirement by increasing the minimum
         age from 63 to 65 by 2027. There is also a new sustainability factor in the pension formula
         that links changes in the life expectancy and the amount of new retirement pension.
Finland    New early retirement is introduced with a minimum age of 62 and an actuarial reduction
           of 0.6% per month for retirement before age 63 for those born before 1952. The so called
           “unemployment pipeline” is 61 years of age for those born in 1957 and later

 Country       Changes undertaken
 France        Following 2010 pension reform, the standard pension age will be increased for all pension
               schemes from 60 to 62 and the full pensionable age will increase from 65 to 67. Both ages
               increase by 4 months each year from generation born in 1951 to those born in 1955. The
               early retirement for long contributory careers is also increased by 2 years. Some
               categorizes will still be granted full pension at 65. In 2014 required number of years for
               full benefit is increased from 41.5 years to 43 years in the period 2020-2035.
 Italy         Early retirement on joint age and contribution requirements was abolished. Under
               Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) regime, early retirement is allowed up to 3 years
               before standard retirement age with 20 years of contribution and amount of pension at
               least 1200 EUR per months. Early retirement regardless of age can be paid to women with
               41 years of work and 42 years of work for men. Penalty is applied to the pension.
 Latvia        Early retirement with a large penalty (50%) is possible for those with long contributory
               periods. Gradual increase of retirement age to 65 by 2025.
 Hungary       From January 2012, early retirement schemes are gradually eliminated by either phasing
               out several forms of entitlements or by transformation into non-pension benefits. There
               is exception of women with 40 eligibility years of more.
 Poland        Early retirement granted as "bridging pensions", outside general system. Applicable to
               persons working in special conditions or performing special character of work, up to 5
               years prior to legal retirement age, for those that worked before January 1, 1999. For
               those      who    started    their    work     afterwards:    no    special  condition.
               Exception: miners have special system, in which they can retire even without age
               condition, if they have worked more than 25 years underground.
               Early retirement also possible in armed forces (from age 55 since 2012). From 2013 the
               legal retirement age started to increase by 1 month per 4 months to reach 67 for men in
               2020 and for women in 2040. In 2016 the newly elected President and the government
               announced reversal of this change, which is discussed in the Parliament.

As a result of retirement age changes introduced in recent years, the effective retirement age
in the EU countries is projected to increase, both for men and for women, between 2014 and
2060. The average increase for men is 1.7 years and for women 2.3 years, however there are
significant differences observed between countries. Projected increase in average effective
retirement age for men and women by country are shown in Figure 30. It should be noted that
the magnitude of the increase does not depend on the level of effective retirement age in
2014 – even countries with high retirement age plan further increases.

Penalties for early retirement in the benefit formula

Apart from the changes in early retirement through changes in the eligible age, countries also
introduce financial incentives to influence retirement behavior of individuals. Countries apply
penalties and bonuses in the pension calculation for those who exit the labor market
earlier/later. Table 12 presents a summary of applied penalties to retire early. Penalties
understood as permanent reduction of the level of benefit are applied in 14 out of 28 EU
countries. In most of the countries the penalty amounts to 0.5% per each month of earlier
retirement.

Another solution that is used is the reduction of benefit during the receipt of the early
retirement. In Latvia, half of the regular pension is paid during early retirement and the full
benefit is restored when the statutory retirement age is reached. In Poland, the early bridging
pension benefit is calculated based on individual account value (taking into account both NDC
and Financial Defined Contribution (FDC) schemes) and life expectancy at the age of 60. In the
period when bridging pensions are paid (from early to statutory retirement age), mandatory


                                                                                                           58
pension accounts are not increased with new contributions, which leads to lower account
value and future benefit level.

To sum up, tightening or eliminating the use of early retirement is achieved through different
measures including raising the age from which people can claim early retirement, reducing the
access to early retirement to only selected workers employed in specific hazardous or arduous
conditions and also through introducing financial disincentives through penalties in the
pension formula. Some of the countries apply different measures at the same time, to improve
the overall expected outcomes of policies.



4.3. Work in special conditions in selected countries: early retirement and prevention
mechanisms.


Early retirement and special pensions for workers in hazardous or arduous jobs are a special
part of the pension landscape in the European countries. As underlined by (Zaidi &
Whitehouse, 2009):

   •   these special schemes are justified only for narrowly defined groups who continue to
       face the risk of premature mortality due to exposure to hazardous or arduous working
       conditions;
   •   the continuation of these schemes owes more to institutional resistance to change
       rather than their usefulness as a supplementary public pension scheme;
   •   if privileges of early retirement are to be continued for some occupations or jobs, they
       should be financed based on contributions by employees and employers.


Early retirement due to work in special conditions provide a mechanism to compensate
workers in two types of situations. Frist, working conditions in these jobs have an impact on
the health of workers and the effect reduces their working careers due to disability or sickness.
It can also lead to premature mortality. Second, there are jobs of the nature which workers
may not be able to perform as they get older.

As (Zaidi & Whitehouse, 2009) point out no generic rigorous justification of special pension
schemes for workers in special conditions can easily be stated and applied across the
countries. This is partly because their development is based on in the history of each country’s
schemes – they came into existence as a response to what was considered to be risk-bearing
occupation: these could be inherently dangerous (mining); difficult to perform in the old age
(airline pilots) or even culturally protected (for example musicians or bullfighters in Spain).

A horizontal definition of arduous work is proposed by (Syndex, 2014, p. 6):


                                                                                              59
         “Occupations involving exposure of the worker over a period of time to one or several
         factors leading to professional situations susceptible to leave long-lasting and
         irreversible effects on his/her health; these factors are related to physical constraints,
         psychological risks, an aggressive physical environment, working organization and
         working rhythms, including shift work” (p. 6).

This horizontal definition can be completed by the following considerations (Syndex, 2014, p.
6):

     • the exposure to both physical and psychosocial risk factors can negatively impact on
       the health and well-being of workers;
    • some factors are systematically considered as being the source of arduousness at
       work: repetitive movements, noise, carrying heavy loads, exposure to chemicals …;
    • sectoral social partners can agree on other factors as being sources of arduous
       working conditions: psychosocial risks…;
    • the consequences of arduous work increase with age;
    • there are external factors clearly linked to arduous work:
           o precariousness at work;
           o Externalization of work: outsourcing and sub-contracting trends.
Given the overall direction of pension reforms, special (early) pensions for workers in arduous
jobs are discussed and seen as one of the main measures adopted by the governments to
tighten access to early retirement, as discussed in the previous section.

There are different national approaches to policies related to workers in hazardous and
arduous conditions. However, in recent years there is a significant policy shift towards
prolonging working lives in all EU countries. There are three main trends in how countries are
addressing the arduousness and hazardousness of work (WAHJ) (Natali, Spasova, &
Vanhercke, 2016): (a) narrowing access to special schemes targeted at WAHJ by introducing
stricter conditions on age and contributory periods; (b) individual assessment of work
conditions and work ability for the purpose for granting pensions and other benefits; (c)
redesigning specific rules and schemes with a view to increasing efficiency and sustainability.
Several countries also strive to enhance the ability to work by means of health and safety
programs and other innovative activation schemes (for example Belgium, Germany, Denmark,
Finland, France, Norway, Sweden).

It should be noted that on the European level there is the lack of systemic data collection on
WAHJ. In 2016, the European Social Protection Network published summary of policies
towards workers in hazardous and arduous in European countries (Natali et al., 2016),
including individual country reviews56. Also, the recent work presented in (Syndex, 2014)

includes field research of practice in 9 European countries57 aiming at better understanding
“arduous occupations” in the European pension debate. In this chapter , we summarize the
results of the review for the 8 countries. Polish case is discussed in depth in the following
section.

These reviews indicated that there are different definitions and approaches in the EU
countries. The most popular one is providing the recognition of the arduousness and
hazardousness of work for the broad category of workers based on the list of
conditions/occupations/sectors (22 out of 35 countries covered in the ESPN review), which is
similar to the approach adopted in Montenegro.

There are different approaches to define hazardous and arduous jobs. In most of the cases,
the WAHJ are described through a list of strenuous physical or (in some cases) mental work
conditions and/or jobs and occupations.

The assessment of the ESPN roughly estimate that WAHJ represent between less than 1% and
4% of the total workforce in the European countries. This share is also decreasing in recent
years, both due to downturn of sectors with WAHJ employment and revision of the lists of
conditions that are recognized as WAHJ.

Belgium has a concept of demanding work, which is defined mainly by the work in atypical
hours (shift or night work). In Germany access to early retirement due to work conditions was
successively reduced and finally abolished.

In Italy, the definition includes “a psycho-physical effort particularly intense and continuous,
due to factors that cannot be prevented by suitable measures”. By the reform measures
introduced in 2011, the eligibility conditions for early retirement include working at least half
of the working career under certain risks

     •   extremely arduous workers;
     •   night shifts between midnight and 5 am;
     •   workers on selected assembly lines;
     •   public transport drivers.


In Austria, the heavy work regulation takes into account 6 criteria:

     •   shift work and changing work hours with an extent of six hours on six working days in
         a month;
     •   working under extreme heat or cold;

     •   working under chemical of physical influences which result in a reduced working
         capability of 10%;
     •   men spend at least 2,000 and women 1,400 work calories during an eight-hour shift;
     •   care of disabled or diseased persons with intensive care needs;
     •   employees with reduced working capacity of 80% can make use of the pension for
         strenuous work.

Since 2007 the national insurance scheme in Austria compiles list with occupations that are
classified as arduous.58 The reform in 2014 introduces a requirement of rehabilitation which
precedes taking up disability pension. Heavy worker regulation includes the following
conditions: night shift work, exposure to excessive noise, heavy labor with 20 years and night
heavy labor with 15 years. The retirement age is 57 for men and 52 for women. Only about
1% of pensioners (1,147 people) received pension for arduous work (Syndex, 2014).
Additionally, in some sectors of occupation (i.e. construction work) there are sectoral solutions
of transitional allowance that are pre-financed by the employers.

In France, there is a coordinated approach to arduousness based on four key areas: definition,
prevention, tracing the factors involved and compensation. Special work conditions are
characterized by the combination of two conditions: workers’ exposure to one or more
professional risk factors that are likely to have clear, irreversible effects on their health in
long term, and factors linked to physical constraints, an aggressive physical environment and
certain work patterns. If the work is considered as arduous, three instruments are applied: (i)
individual arduousness traceability sheet, (ii) early retirement mechanism and (iii) collective
agreement or action plan to prevent arduousness. Private employers as well as public
employers that employ under private-law contracts are required to draw up an
agreement/action plan to prevent arduousness, if they employ at least 50 people, of which
at least half is exposed to one of the factors in arduousness. Agreement/action plan must
concern:

     •   reduction of multiple exposure to risk factors or the adjustment and organization of
         the job to limit the impact of the risk factors;
     •   improving working conditions (in particular organization), enhancing skills and
         qualifications of employees, organizing the ends of workers’ careers and keeping
         people in work.


From 2013, all private sectors workers in arduous conditions are covered by the personal
account for preventing arduousness. Workers accumulate points based on their exposure to

one or more arduous work factors. Workers receive one point for each quarter of exposure
(two points if they are exposed to more than one factors), to a maximum of 100 points.
Workers can use their points to fund training courses for reorientation to a less arduous job,
maintain their salary level if they switch to part-time work or contribute to three months’
pension.

In Denmark the arduous work is defined in two concepts. First, the “wear and tear” that is
related to (physical or mental) gradual decrease in functional ability to a level lower than
“normal” functioning for that age. Second, the working capacity, understood as ability to
perform work in a satisfactory manner. If the requirements of the work are constant
throughout the working life the “wear and tear” eventually reaches the critical point where
the person is no longer able to do the work satisfactorily.

The industries particularly threatened by the “wear and tear” are identified by the Ministry of
Employment as those with highest risk of early retirement or long-term absence due to
sickness. It covers a total of 18 industries59 and 38% of all employees. There are no rules
establishing general early retirement due to this kind of work.

The Welfare Reform has taken initiatives aimed at preventing “wear and tear” and improving
working environment, particularly in the identified industries. These include establishment of
the Prevention Fund, which provides support for:

     •   initiatives that prevent physical and psychological “wear and tear” and accidents at
         work and occupational diseases;
     •   initiatives that help to retain older people as well as employees with reduced working
         capacity in employment;
     •   initiatives that contribute to inclusion to the labor market.


In Spain, retirement age reduction coefficients may be applied on the basis of two
assumptions:

     •   occupational activities in the scales, categories, or specializations in which the work
         exposes to exceptional level of arduous, dangerous, unhealthy or toxic work;
     •   occupational activities in the scales, categories, or specializations in which the work
         performance depends on the physical or psychological requirements that decline from
         certain age.

The procedure envisages the following steps:



59 civil engineering, construction, demolition and completion, electronics, metal and machinery, plastic, glass and
concrete, textile and paper, logistics, wood and furniture, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, slaughterhouses,
nutrition and stimulants, police, emergencies and prisons, haircuts and other personal care, cleaning, passenger
transport, day care centres and residential care and home care.

                                                                                                               63
   a. ground work by the National Institute for Health and Safety in the Workplace (INSHT)
      to produce technical papers that measure how arduous, toxic, unhealthy or dangerous
      an activity is on the basis of an analysis of specific indicators;
   b. if the report concludes that working conditions cannot be changed and application of
      reduction coefficients or lowering the retirement age is necessary, the cost calculation
      study is conducted to determine which reduction coefficients can be applied;
   c. the minimum retirement age is set for each activity and the relevant reduction
      coefficients are set.


Based on these coefficients the statutory retirement age for an individual worker is reduced
by application of the appropriate values. The minimum age cannot be lower than 52 years of
age. In order to be eligible, the worker must prove that she/he carried out the activity that
entitles for reduction coefficients. (Syndex, 2014) underlines that this procedure has not been
applied as the INSHT reports are too general and the social partners cannot reach agreement
to apply the new early retirement mechanisms effectively. There is no preliminary list of
potentially arduous occupations. There are also selected occupational groups that have access
to early retirement, which include: workers included in the mining statute, flight personnel,
railway workers, artists (singers, dancers and trapeze artists), bullfighting professionals,
firemen, and members of the Basque Police Force.

In Romania, there is a classification of labor conditions, including special working conditions
and difficult working conditions. The pension contributions differ depending on the job
classification:

   •   jobs in special working conditions: jobs where the degree of exposure to professional
       risk factors or to specific conditions pertaining to some categories of public services,
       during at least 50% of the normal working time, can lead in time to occupational
       diseases, to dangerous behavior in the activity, with severe consequences on
       occupational health and safety (these jobs include for example range of professions
       from the iron and steel sector and other metalworking sectors);
   •   jobs in difficult (outstanding) working conditions: jobs where the degree of exposure
       to professional risk factors or to specific conditions pertaining to some categories of
       public services, during the entire duration of the normal working time can lead to
       occupational diseases, to dangerous behavior in the activity, with consequences on
       occupational health and safety.


The inclusion of a workplace in the difficult conditions involves:

   •   nomination of the workplaces by the employer together with the representative trade
       unions or workers’ Health and Safety representatives who assess the workplaces to
       identify the presence of occupational risks;

                                                                                            64
       •
       obtaining the approval from Territorial Labor Inspectorate;
       •
       declaration to the territorial pension offices on a monthly basis of the list of all people
       working in difficult conditions.
On August 1, 2013 a total of 1213 jobs and 32,993 workers were included in difficult working
conditions jobs (0.76% of total workforce).



4.4. Police and army forces in the EU


In the EU countries, the police and army officers are treated as working in conditions that
enable for earlier retirement – the types of regulations depend on the country solutions.

The share of both police and army personnel in all but 2 EU countries (Greece and Cyprus) is
below 3% of the total employment, and in 20 countries is below 2% of the total employment.60
In Montenegro, however, it stands at 7.6%, well above the top-ranked EU countries – Greece
and Cyprus (Figure 31). Even the share of police personnel in Montenegro eligible to ESP of
2% (column Montenegro-ESP) exceeds the share of total employment in police in all EU
countries. In the military, the ESP-eligible personnel accounts for 0.8% of employment, which
exceeds total employment in military in 13 EU countries.

4.5. Policies towards WAHJ


There are two main trends in the end-of-career measures that are identified in the case of
workers in hazardous and arduous conditions:

(i) measures that facilitate early exit measures;

(ii) measures prolonging working life.

Grouping of countries according to the types of measures that are implemented is shown in
Figure 32. As one can see, the largest group of countries combines both types of policy
measures.

Figure 32. End-of-career policy mix for workers in hazardous and arduous jobs




Source: (Natali et al., 2016)

The measures that are linked to prolonging working lives usually base on the linking of the social, labor
market and health policies to support working lives. They aim at enhancing functional capacities of
workers, through empowerment and rehabilitation. One of the best practices in this area is the
approach in Denmark (Kvist, 2016) with three-pronged strategy: occupational health and safety
focusing on prevention; rehabilitation and active labor market policy measures focusing on reinsertion
into the labor market; and social protection focusing on prolonging working lives and reducing early
labor market exit.

Active labor market policies usually cover measures such as vocational training, counselling, job
handovers or different work ability provisions. Measures that are applied include for example:

    •    extra leave for older workers (assuming they need extra time off to remain healthy and fit for
         work);
    •    possibility of reduced hours;
    •    flexible timing of breaks at work;
    •    exempting older workers from overtime, irregular working hours, weekend work and team
         work;
    •    providing further training measures.




                                                                                                      66
Early exit measures in most of the cases are guaranteed through separate pension rules within the
general system – that is the approach similar to the one in Montenegro. Some countries allow also for
partial retirement (i.e. Switzerland, Germany).

In the course of the last several years (2009-2016) almost all EU countries introduced measures that
tighten early exit (with exception of the Czech Republic), as discussed earlier.

Some of the countries also introduced measures that support work ability. Some of the examples
include:

    • tightening eligibility conditions and prolonging work capacity through prevention and
      rehabilitation measures in Sweden;
    • “Flex Job Reform” program with re-insertion measures in Denmark (based on the wage
      subsidies for employers hiring older workers with limited employability);
    • tripartite agreement on “An inclusive work life” in Norway (2014-2018). The most common
      measures used concerning IW-goal no 3 are information, shorter and more flexible working
      time, supplementary vacation etc., in some cases with wage compensation;
    • in France workers can earn points according to their exposure to different factors which can
      be used for vocational training, part-time work on the same pay or early retirement;
    • in Austria, reduction in access to early retirement is combined with rehabilitation and training
      programs.
The measures related to tightening access include for example:

    •   phasing out early retirement and no possibility to accumulate new eligibility in Hungary;
    •   revision of jobs that were considered arduous in Croatia, following the increased role of
        automation;
    •   reforming pensions inherited from the Soviet regime in the Baltic states.


4.6. Country case: Poland as an example of best practice reform of pensions for WAHJ


As shown in section 2, the evolution of the employment rates of older workers in Poland shows
a significant increase after 2008. This is a result of the package of the reform measures
introduced from the beginning of 2009, consisting of:

    -   replacement of the early retirement system inherited from the pre-reform pension
        system with the “bridging pensions” scheme;
    -   introducing a set of measures for increasing labor market activities of workers aged 50
        and more, the so-called “Program 50+. Solidarity of generations”.


Below, we describe these two components of policy package related to extending working
lives.

The bridging pension scheme in Poland

The concept of “bridging pensions” was marked in the initial pension reform proposal,
elaborated in 1998 and 1999. At that time, Poland inherited a typical pension system with

                                                                                                   67
wide-spread early retirement privileges. The list of occupations eligible for early retirement
covered more than 300 items (1000 types of work places), there was a separate legislation
with early retirement rights for: miners, railway workers, teachers, armed forces (most
importantly: army, police, border guards, professional firemen, prison guards) as well as
judges and prosecutors. Additionally, women with long careers could retire at age of 55 (if
they have worked for 30 years). People with disabilities could also retire five years prior to
official retirement age (i.e. women at age 55 and men at age 60). As a result, in the general
pension system, the average age of retirement has been constant at the level of around 55
years for women and 59 years for men.

In the Law on Pensions from Social Insurance Fund that introduced the NDC system in Poland,
almost all pension legislation in ”civil” sector was consolidated (with exception of teachers’
pensions that sustained their regulations in the Law – Teachers’ Charter). The law envisaged
that after the vacatio legis period (necessary to recognize the accrued pension rights) until the
end of 2006, new bridging pensions scheme would be introduced. Due to political economy
considerations, discussed below, this deadline was extended until the end of 2008.

The introduction of the bridging pension scheme also resulted in the end of the possibility to
retire early due to long work career record. As this change was announced in the law already
in 1998, the change came into force without additional transitory requirements and its impact
on increasing the actual retirement age was immediate.



Main assumptions of the bridging pensions system

Given the long list of various occupations with early retirement rights, it was decided that
establishing the scope of the new system requires a new approach, instead of revising the
existing list, trying to remove selected items. The new approach61 was based on work
conditions that would establish eligibility for bridging pensions, instead of naming occupations
or job places. There are two types of work that were defined62 - the work in special conditions
and the work of special nature.

Work in special conditions - work performed in conditions under risk factors, which with age
can, with a large probability, cause a permanent health damage, performed in special
conditions of work environment, determined by forces of nature or technological processes,
that despite of application of available means of technical, organizational or medical
prophylactic face workers with requirements that exceed their capabilities, limited due ageing



61 Initially proposed by prof. Igor Tomes, former Minister of Labour and Social Policy in the Czech Republic and
World Bank consultant. One of the reforms undertaken by prof. Tomes in Czech Republic was the successful reform
of early retirement scheme.
62 In the report, we refer to the final definitions adopted in the Law on Bridging Pensions in 2008. During the policy

discussions, these definitions were modified, but not in the way that would affect the general assumptions of the
bridging pension scheme.

   Risk factors determined by the forces of nature:

   a)   work under ground,
   b)   work on the water,
   c)   work under water,
   d)   work in the air.


   Risk factors determined by technological processes:

   a) work in hot conditions of a microclimate — work performed in the premises in which
      the value of the thermal load index WBGT is 28°C and above, and the level of
      metabolism of an employee is above 130 W/m2,
   b) work in cold conditions of a microclimate — work performed on the premises of the
      air temperature below 0°C,
   c) very heavy physical work — work that over a shift requires an effective energy
      expenditure exceeding 8400 kJ in a case of men, and exceeding 4600 kJ in a case of
      women,
   d) works in conditions of elevated atmospheric pressure,
   e) heavy physical work associated with very high static load resulting from having to work
      in a forced, unchanging posture of the body; heavy physical work is defined as requiring
      an effective energy expenditure over a shift exceeding 6300 kJ for men and exceeding
      4200 kJ for women, and works in forced posture requires a significant tilt and (or) back
      sprains while putting force in excess of 10 kG for men and 5 kG for women (according
      to the OWAS method category item 4) by at least 50% of the work shift.

The work of a special nature - work requiring special responsibility and special psychophysical
performance, whose ability to discharge in a manner not prejudicial to public security,
including the health or life of other persons diminishes before pensionable age as a result of
the deterioration of psychophysical efficiency associated with a process of individual aging.

Based on these definitions, a list of specific work types in special conditions and of special
nature were prepared. The list for works in special conditions consist of 40 items (work under
ground in mines, work in steel factories with blast furnaces, work under water, working on sea
ships, work in cold (sub-zero) temperatures, very heavy physical work) and the list of works of
a special nature consist of 26 items (for example: pilots of air vessels, air traffic controllers,
bus and tram drivers in public communication, railway engine drivers, medical staff working
with drug-addicts, surgical teams working in emergency conditions, operators of atomic
reactors). In the new approach, for each of the work types several job places can be assigned
(Figure 33).

According to the list of conditions, defined by the law, employers reviewed their job places, in
co-operation with trade unions, to establish the list of individuals and job places covered by
the bridging pensions arrangements. In the case of disagreements, the decision to assign the
job place was transferred to the labor inspectorate, and finally if these were not resolved, to
the labor court. For each of the workplaces the employer pays the contribution of 1.5% of
wage to a Bridging Pensions Fund (FEP), managed by Social Security Institution. Bridging
pensions are financed from that fund, which also receives subsidies from the state budget,
that are seen as financing of pre-2009 liabilities that are treated as public finance obligations.
Given the early stage of development of bridging pensions, current contribution inflow covers
the expenditure of the FEP. The level of contribution is not calculated to meet the actuarial
balance of the system, given the scale of public liabilities for the rights accrued in the past, but
its role is rather to keep employers aware of the cost of bridging pension, given their role in
assessment of work places and individuals eligible for bridging pensions. On the other hand, it
was important to keep the level of contributions relatively low, so that the overall tax wedge
is not increased significantly, which would cause disturbances on the labor market.

It was also decided that the new scheme will cover only those who worked in “old” special
conditions before January 1st, 1999. All those who started work afterwards will not have a right
to bridging pensions, it is expected that they will re-qualify to maintain work ability until
retirement age. Thus, the bridging pensions system is transitory and, eventually, will be
phased out. That means that all workers who started their employment after 1999, covered

                                                                                                                                                                                        70
by the general system (that means excluding miners, armed forces, judges and prosecutors)
will not have a right to early retirement.

Those who worked in conditions that prior to 1999 were eligible for early retirement (covered
by list A of special conditions and list B of special character), received compensation in a form
of higher initial capital on the NDC account (and thus higher pension) in the general system.

As far as eligibility conditions are concerned, bridging pensions can be claimed up to 5 years
before legal retirement age, by those workers, who have worked for a total of 20 years
(women) or 25 years (men), including at least of 15 years of work in special conditions or of
special nature. The level of bridging pension is linked to the value of individual pension account
(taking into account both NDC and FDC accounts63). Bridging pensions are paid from a separate
Bridging Pensions Fund, financed by employers’ contributions and state budget.

Upon retirement, the beneficiary claims regular pension based on general pensions
regulation; until then the individual account is not used for any pensions payment. There are
also strict conditions regarding combining of receiving bridging pensions and working – it is
not allowed to continue to work at the same job that was a basis to receive a bridging pension.

Work of the Medical Experts Committee

One of the most important premises of developing the assumptions for the bridging pension
system was that the definitions of work types as well as list of working conditions for this
scheme will be developed by experts – specialists in occupational medicine.

In the period of preparing and adopting bridging pensions (1998-2008) there were three
medical experts committees that worked on definitions and lists of work types. During the
initial phase work experts agreed that early retirement should not be seen as compensation
for work in harmful conditions, where defined norms are exceeded. Employers are obliged to
eliminate such work conditions on the ground of international recommendations and the
regulations of the Labor Code in Poland.

First group of experts worked between 1998 and 2000. It was the Committee for Rights to
Lower Retirement Age for People Employed in Special Conditions or Special Character. The
Committee prepared a comprehensive report with the first proposal of definitions and lists of
work types. Based on the data from Social Insurance Institution, they also assessed the
potential coverage of the proposed system (around 200 thousand workers). The Report served
as a basis for development of the bridging pensions scheme that was presented by the
government and discussed with social partners until the beginning of 2001.




63Technically, for those people who are members of pension funds, the value of NDC account is artificially increased
for the purpose of bridging pension calculation by amount equivalent to the accumulation resulting from FDC
contribution. In that way, there are no differences in the basis for calculating bridging pensions between members
of different pension funds.

                                                                                                                71
The following government returned to the work on bridging pensions in 2005 and the Team
of Experts of Occupational Medicine for verification of the list of work types in special
conditions and of special nature was established. They worked for two years until 2006.

Finally, the third Team of Experts of Medicine and Occupational Safety that worked in 2008
supported the finalization of the elaboration of the reform proposal.

The first Committee was established by the government and comprised of experts –
researchers from Universities or Research Institutes specializing in the field. In the second and
third committee, members were designated by all social partners: government, trade unions
and employer organizations.

Reports of all three Committees were presented to the social partners who could proposed
modifications that were justified by relevant medical proofs.

Political economy of introducing bridging pensions

The establishment of bridging pensions system took a decade, as the first proposal was
formulated in 1998 and the final law was adopted in 2008. The length of time devoted to the
discussion of bridging pensions arrangement was related to a significant political sensitivity of
this topic. In particular, representatives of professions covered with special regulations:
railway workers, teachers and miners were opposing changes, as they did not want to forego
the rights that they have enjoyed.

The elaboration of final proposals was also slowed down by political cycles and elections in
2001, 2005 and 2007. Due to political decisions, the armed forces (after 2001 elections) and
miners (before 2005 elections) were excluded from general system and their early retirement
schemes were to a large extent reinstated. In 2005 and 2006 (each time before upcoming
elections) the Parliament also postponed the introduction of the envisaged bridging pensions
scheme, in total by two years. What is important, not only those working in special conditions
or special nature, but also women with work career exceeding 30 years could retire earlier at
age 55. Additionally, in 2007 the Constitutional Tribunal in Poland decided that, following the
equal rights principle, men should be given similar right from age of 60. This sentence paved
the way for men covered by the old pension system (born between 1946 and 1948) to retire
before the age of 65.

Despite these postponements subsequent governments (in 2006-2007) continued discussions
on the bridging pensions scheme. Each of the governments presented the draft law for social
consultations, but did not finalize the legislative process.

Only after 2007, the new majority government decided to conclude the work on the bridging
pensions. During the final round of consultations, numerous meetings were organized both in
a Tripartite Committee as well as by the Team of Medical Experts. Their work was reflected in
the law proposal presented to the Parliament in mid-2008. Redefinition of criteria for early


                                                                                              72
retirement was also supported by another sentence from Constitutional Tribunal that
indicated that due to changing working conditions and technological development, there is a
need to revise the list of occupations for early retirement formed in early 1980s.

The social debate on bridging pensions was also conducted, aiming to explain the need for the
change, due to the high costs generated by the system. A dedicated web page was also
designed and launched to facilitate the information dissemination as well as implementation
of the new scheme from 2009. PR activities related to the bridging pensions helped to reduce
the societal pressure to further sustain early retirement.

In 2012, after the Parliamentary elections, the Government followed the path established by
the bridging pensions and proposed to raise and equalize retirement ages of men and women.
This change that came in force from 2013 means that retirement age is raised by one month
every four months for both men and women until it reaches 67 (which will happen in 2020 for
men and 2040 for women). Additionally, a minimum retirement age of 55 was introduced for
the armed forces, while judges and prosecutors after 2017 will be retiring at age of 67.
However, it should be noted that newly elected government in 2015 announced reversal of
the increase in the statutory retirement age and return to the initial 60/65.

Program “Solidarity of Generations. Program 50+”

The work on prolonging working lives in Poland was a two-pronged strategy. The limitation of
early retirement in the new bridging pension system was also accompanied by the
comprehensive program aimed at promoting activity of older workers, called “Solidar ity of
Generations. Program 50+”. The program followed the concept of developing virtuous circle
of activation and prolonging working lives through integrated measures. Based on the
available national and international evidence, the Program included a range of
recommendations for labor market policy related to the following objectives:

1. Improvement of work conditions, promotion of employment of workers above age 50 and
    age management;
2. Improvement of competences and qualifications of workers 50+;
3. Reducing the labor cost related to employment of workers 50+;
4. Activation of unemployed and at risk of job loss aged 50 and over;
5. Labor market integration of people with disabilities;
6. Increasing opportunities for female employment through development of care services
    facilitating reconciliation of work and family responsibilities.
Following the program recommendations, several legislative changes were made, reducing
the cost of labor, including reduction of contribution to Labor Fund (financing labor market
policy) as well as reducing the cost of extended sick leave for employers through shifting the
financing of part of sick leave to the social insurance system. A number of activation measures
were developed and financed by the Labor Fund also programs funded by the European Social
Fund.

                                                                                            73
The new version of the “50+ Program” was adopted at the end of 2013, following its mid-term
revision. The revision reinforced the overall goal of increasing employment rate of people in
age group 55-64 to 50%. The program includes the following objectives:

    1. Adjustment of skills and raising qualifications of people 45+, in line with labor market
       requirements;
    2. 50+ friendly organization culture and work environment;
    3. Improving efficiency of activities promoting longer working lives;
    4. Promoting active and healthy ageing;
    5. Developing co-operation for employment of people 50+
    6. Social transfers stimulating activity of people 50+


Impact of changes on early retirement incidence

The introduction of the bridging pensions helped to raise the employment rates of older
workers, that happened despite the economic crisis in Europe in 2008 and following years. It
should be underlined that Poland maintained positive economic growth, which helped to
maintain the focus on activation of workers 50+. The outcome of the change is also seen in
the pension system statistics. First, the inflow to pension system of new retirees reduced and
the average retirement age increased, particularly for women (Figure 34). In 2015, the higher
inflow was due to the fact, that first people retiring in the new system reached retirement age
– as a result, the average retirement age also increased for both men and women.

At the same time, the overall number of people receiving retirement transfers: old-age, pre-
retirement benefits and allowances and bridging pensions reduced. In 2004 first limitations to
access early retirement through pre-retirement benefits and allowances were introduced, as
a reaction to the growing number of pre-retirement transfers that peaked in that year
exceeding 1,6 million people. This change resulted in a gradual decline of early retirement
transfers that accelerated after 2008 when bridging pensions were implemented.

As a result, in 2011 the number of people receiving benefits before retirement age fell to the
level that was not seen for the past 15 years and keeps falling further (Figure 35). The total
number of old-age pensioners, after two decades of increases, stabilized at the level of around
5 million beneficiaries, which given the population ageing is a positive development. (Figure
36). Between the peak in 2008 and 2014 the number of pensions paid below retirement age
dropped by two thirds (from 1.27 million to 0.47 million) and the average number of bridging
pensions paid in 2015 was 13.7 thousand, just a little fraction of the observed decline in early
retirement payments. By the same token, the employment rate in the group 55-64 increased
from 26.1 in 2004 to 44.3% in 2015, which is one of the most dynamic increases in the EU
countries.

Concluding, the Polish experience can be seen as an example of efficient policy intervention.
This was a combination of series of factors, such as:

    •    Co-operation with medical experts and use of evidence in reform proposal;
    •    Integrated approach combining measures in pension policy and employment policy;
    •    Maintaining dialogue with social partners;
    •    Comprehensive approach limiting all potential routes to early retirement.

5. Conclusions and recommendations for reforming early retirement system for
special and hazardous occupations in Montenegro


Montenegro faces significant challenges in the labor market and pension system. Employment
levels are low, particularly among workers in age group 50 and over. There is a need for
coordinated policy aiming at both improving employment rate in this age group as well as
increasing actual retirement age.

It should be noted that several up-to-date reform efforts went in a good direction. Some
harmonization of pension legislation allows introducing measures that apply to all workers
simultaneously. It also allows creating a unified database of workers employed in arduous
occupations that is necessary for the implementation of policies aimed at this group. This
allows for easy development of the registry of individuals with early retirement through
extended service. Regulation of workplaces and jobs, i.e. grades of accelerated service period
through the secondary legislation enables easier changes and reviews in these areas, in the
frequency enabled by the law (every five years) as well as design the appropriate financing
structure. However, there are still 5 legal acts that regulate early retirement and 2 amending
regulations in this area.

Based on the assessment presented in this report, there are several policy measures that are
recommended.

Limiting early retirement due to long service and revision of other early retirement routes

The general early retirement due to the long service should be abolished . Long service
pensions have been removed from pension systems in most of the EU countries. The example
of Poland clearly indicates that such policy change can be beneficial both from the labor
market (an increase of employment rate) and pension system (an increase of actual retirement
age) perspectives. Prevention and rehabilitation measures should be strengthened as “early
warning” solutions avoiding expensive deactivation of older workers. Additionall y, we
proposed to examine whether the insured disabled persons should be covered by the same
law as all other persons being that the main intention of the law is to work as a ‘preventive
measure’ against the loss of working ability.

Possibilities to retire early through other benefit programs should be examined and limited.
In all jobs (including miners) the early retirement age should be clearly set, not higher than 5
years below standard retirement age. This means that the early retirement age should be
introduced also in the case of miners, who should be covered by the general early retirement
regulations, similarly to other professions in difficult conditions.

It is recommended that the pension system remains universal, covering all types of workers,
which is beneficial for the mobility of the labor force.

                                                                                             76
Revision of the list of occupations covered by early retirement scheme


Second, the list of occupations that give a right for early retirement should be further reviewed
and narrowed. As shown in the EU countries experiences, the share of workers eligible for
early retirement should be limited below 2% of the workforce, preferably around 1%
(excluding the army and the police).

Montenegro employs exceptionally high number of military and police personnel.
Furthermore, 95% of employed in the police (internal affairs) are eligible to ESP. It needs to be
analyzed and reviewed which jobs and positions in the police are hazardous and arduous and
the list revised accordingly. The ESP eligibility issue in the military is less acute due to revision
implemented in 2009. However, with still high employment in military, the list of jobs eligible
to ESP would also need to be further addressed.

The types of work eligible for extended service period should be redefined, limiting them to
such categories that require provisions due to the risk of health damage or due to
responsibility for safety of other people. While the current definition of early retirement
already refers to the lack of possibility to remove hazardous condition, the definitions should
be updated, taking into account the current technological progress. Following the example of
Poland, this work should be conducted in co-operation with occupational medicine experts
(internal and, if necessary, international).

Defining types of work, instead of occupations is also recommended, to avoid revisions and
updating related to constantly changing lists of occupations. This would also mean revising the
tasks or job content at certain workplaces, i.e. revision of the early retirement for all military
personnel.


The work types covered by the extended period could include: work in special conditions, work
of special nature, work related to public safety (designated for armed forces such as police or
military)64. The new list should go along with:
                            • general changes in the economy,
                            • technological development,
                            • general regulations concerning safety at work.

As a rule, early retirement should be granted only in case where the work conditions cannot
be changed and improved through any prophylactic measure (technological, organizational
and medial). Application of these criteria could reduce early retirement for some occupations.



64
     As it is done for example in Poland, Romania or Italy.

                                                                                                  77
Furthermore, the minimum required length of period that gives a right to extended pension
should be also reviewed by the medial experts, to take into account the maximum potential
exposure to specific work conditions that can lead to health detriment.

Based on the developed list, employers, in co-operation with trade unions or employees’
representations should identify workers in defined work places that would create a registry of
workers in special conditions for the purposes of both preventive and compensatory
measures.


Transparent financing of early retirement

The current financing of early retirement for special and hazardous jobs should be modified,
to increase its transparency. Currently, supplementary contribution paid by employers is
merged with general old-age contribution. As a result, the supplementary contribution
finances both the early retirement payment and the part of the old-age pension paid from
regular retirement age.

We recommend separating the early retirement due to employment in special or hazardous
jobs from general pension system and creating separate scheme that would be used for
financing of early retirement (Figure 37). The level of supplementary contributions should be
calculated at the level necessary to finance the payment of benefit from earlier retirement age
to the legal retirement age. In order to finance a transfer equivalent to around 40% of pervious
wage for 5 years, the contribution rate should reach around 6% of wage (assuming wage
growth and rate of return on contribution account equal to 2% annually and 35 years of
accumulation). The early retirement part should be financially separated, but it should be
administered by the current social security administration (PIO).

To increase transparency of financing of pensions for special and hazardous jobs and prepare
regular assessment of the cost of early retirement. Level of additional contributions should be
calculated to cover the actuarially assessed cost of the extended time of benefit payment
before the legal retirement age is reached. The goal should be to reduce the level of tax wedge,
which reduces the labor demand and increases the level of informal economy.

Additionally, most of the hazardous jobs that created future beneficiaries entitled to ESP
(metal processing industry) are actually vanishing along with the change of the economic
structure. In Montenegro, we are seeing less and less of any entrepreneurial and business
ideas in processing industries due to their overall market conditions – high national labor costs
combined with competition from the cheaper Chinese and East-Asian markets. That means
that the scheme may require some tax financing, resulting from the higher cost of the current
benefits which are not matched with contributions coming from reduced number of jobs in
ESP.

Another option for compensating for the difficult working conditions and risky workplaces
would be to transfer the burden from the state to the employer who would provide the
compensation through the higher salary. Increase of the annual retirement decrement should
be considered as well as of the supplementary contribution rates. Increase of the latter should
be adjusted to the specific degrees of acceleration to enable sufficient replacement rate for
persons who are eligible for early retirement. Alternatively, if the supplementary contribution
rates would remain unchanged then the retirement period should be appropriately increased.


Individual prevention measures applied to workers in special and hazardous jobs

Third, for workers employed in the special and hazardous jobs, the coordinated policy mix
should be introduced, including prevention measures applied during the working period as
well as compensation in the form of early retirement pension. Following the French example
it is recommended that workers in arduous conditions are covered by the personal account
for preventing arduousness.

Workers should accumulate points based on their exposure to one or more arduous work
factors. Workers receive one point for each quarter of exposure (two points if they are
exposed to more than one factors), to a maximum of 100 points. Workers could use their
points to fund training courses for reorientation to a less arduous job, maintain their salary
level if they switch to part-time work.

Other recommended accompanying measures include:

   -   Developing a training and re-qualifications scheme for older workers, focused on
       improving the skills level and adjusting it to the current needs of the labor market, such
       scheme should allow participants to gain new qualifications or refresh the existing
       ones;

                                                                                              79
   -   Promoting age management development among enterprises, focused on changing
       the stereotypes of employers related to employment of older workers and developing
       work organization measures supporting longer working lives;

   -   Improvement of overall work conditions and work quality level, that would help to
       reduce inflow to early retirement and disability pensions;

   -   Introducing flexible worktime measures for older workers as well as possibility to
       have additional leave to support the rehabilitation and prevention of losing workg
       ability;

   -   Developing a government ALMP program supporting re-employment of older
       workers, following the examples of Scandinavia or Poland.

   -   Seeking ways to reduce the labor costs of older workers (like already mentioned
       revision of the contribution level for extended service).


Labor market policy and labor market regulations should also support longer working lives.
While the existing rules of combining pensions and work are conducive to maintain formal
employment of working pensioners, it is important to look for solutions that stimulate longer
work and reducing factors that push older workers towards early retirement and economic
inactivity.


Develop public information activities


Finally, the reform activities should be accompanied by public information campaign that
would explain the need to reduce early retirement and promote longer working lives. Such
campaign should involve co-operation with social partners in broad-range of activities focusing
on changing the existing stereotypes and approaches. Such activities could be based on the
best national and international experiences. The World Bank future support to such campaign
could bring necessary resources and technical support in the designing and conducting the
campaign.


The public information should be aimed at employers and social partners, presenting the
benefits from extending working lives.

Given the current situation in Montenegro, the timing of the reform implementation is crucial.
Thus, preparatory activities should be initiated relatively quickly. This requires developing of
an integrated action plan, including the list of all necessary measures as well as clear division
of tasks.


                                                                                              80
Preparatory work, such as designing the terms of reference for the medial experts and
establishment of medical experts; team should be initiated as soon as possible, as such a
revision, together with consultation with social partners will take some time, judging from the
Polish experience (not less than 6 moths of actual work).

Before the legislative changes are proposed, the consensus-building activities should also be
conducted, including wide consultations of reform activities, given the long-term impact of
the proposed changes.

        1,200 euro per month in 2012 (2.8 times the
        old-age allowance, in 2012). Such a threshold is
        indexed with the five-year average of nominal
        GDP. A penalty is applied to the quota of
        pension calculated according to the DB
        method, which accounts for 1% at the age of
        61, 2% at the age of 60 and then increased by 2
        pp each year below 60.

         Retirement age linked to life expectancy - From
         2013, the SRA, the contribution requirements
         for early pensions regardless of age and the age
         requirement for early pensions under the NDC
         regime are all indexed to changes in life
         expectancy every three years (every 2 years as
         of 2021). Statutory retirement age - In 2014,
         the SRA is: 66 years and 3 months for men (all
         sectors) and women in the public sector; 63
         years and 9 months for female employees in
         the private sector; 64 years and 9 months for
         the female self-employed. The SRA of women
         in the private sector is gradually aligned to that
         of other workers by 2018. In all cases, 20 years
         of contributions are also required. For the
         newly insured after 1995, a pension of at least
         1.5 times the old age allowance is also
         required. The SRA is indexed to changes in life
         expectancy. According to a specific legislative
         provision, the SRA must be at least 67 in 2021.
         Based on the official demographic projections,
         such a target may be achieved in advance
         through the periodic indexation to changes in
         life expectancy.
