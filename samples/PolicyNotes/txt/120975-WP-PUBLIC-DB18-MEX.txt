About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      The validity of the statement (for construction work completion) is as follows:
      • Up to 300 square meters: 1 year
      • 300 -- 1,000 square meters: 2 years
      • More than 1,000 square meters: 3 years


      The cost for the water connection includes the installation of the main
      pipeline, board, and meter. The cost to connect to water and sewage
      services are included in this procedure since the proof of payment of such
      fees are needed to request connection to these utility services (procedure
      10). The cost is established by the Financial Code of the Federal District. This
      procedure cannot be done without the results of the previous one, so it
      cannot be simultaneous.

       (manifestacion de actualisacion del valor cadastral) is led for tax purposes
       with the Tax Ministry. The information in the new deed is updated only when
       the property (with the building included) is sold. In Mexico, the owner of the
       land is automatically the owner of the building unless otherwise speci ed.
       Only in cases where the owner of the building and the owner of the property
       are two di erent people would the building be registered.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

       A certi cate issued at the end of the inspection is needed by the time the
       supply contract is signed. This procedure may be performed simultaneously
       with other procedures. The costs associated with this procedure are
       determined by the Unidad Veri cadora and the applicant. If the wiring is
       done within the provisions of the Mexican Standards, usually one inspection
       is su cient to issue the approval (Dictamen de Veri cación), but if the
       applicant did not perform its electrical work within the rules, then the
       Unidad Veri cadora must make several visits to ensure that the wiring
       corresponds to the standards.

      Agency : Private company

      The monitoring of the internal wiring installations is done by a specialized
       rm (Unidad de Veri cación de Instalaciones Eléctricas ) which is responsible
      for checking that the wiring was done according to Mexican standards.

      The applicant must go to a Unidad de Veri cación de Instalaciones Eléctricas
      (UVIE), accredited with the Entidad Mexicana de Acreditamiento (EMA) and
      registered with the Ministry of Energy (Secretaria de Energia). The rm will
      verify that the electrical installation meets the safety standards established
      in NOM-001-SEDE 2012; the UVIE also oversees the external work that is
      performed by the client (construction of the electrical substation).


      A certi cate issued at the end of the inspection is needed by the time the
      supply contract is signed. This procedure may be performed simultaneously
      with other procedures. The costs associated with this procedure are
      determined by the Unidad Veri cadora and the applicant. If the wiring is
      done within the provisions of the Mexican Standards, usually one inspection
      is su cient to issue the approval (Dictamen de Veri cación), but if the
      applicant did not perform its electrical work within the rules, then the
      Unidad Veri cadora must make several visits to ensure that the wiring
      corresponds to the standards.

        Agency : Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE Distribución)

        At the signing of the contract for providing electrical service connection the
        certi cate of veri cation for the internal wiring installation must be
        submitted. The process of signing the supply contract is done after the
        security deposit has been paid for. Payment is made at the o ces of the
        company. It is possible to settle the security deposit with a bank guarantee.
        The meter installation is done by the Área comercial which coordinates with
        the Departamento de Distribuccion.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Article 116 of the Fiscal Code of the Federal District establishes that the
      property tax shall be calculated taking in to account the highest of (i) the
      purchase price, (ii) the cadastral value, and (iii) the value resulting from the
      commercial valuation by the scal authorities or authorized appraiser.



      The notaries usually have their own appraisers. Nevertheless, the parties
      may hire the appraiser they choose. When banks are involved in the
      transaction, they will usually bring in the valuers they usually work with.
      Sometimes parties have a previous valuation, and the notary can have it
      reviewed to see if it su ces. However, these previous valuations are usually
      not scal ones and therefore another one has to be done to determine the
      value of the property for the ISAI tax, but also for the VAT tax to which
      commercial constructions are subject to when transferred (please note that
      the land is not taxable under VAT, just the commercial constructions).

      The property transfer tax is calculated based on the cadastral value obtained
      through this procedure. The notaries can complete this procedure online
      through the Cadaster’s online platform receiving the response immediately.
      The value obtained is merely informative.

      If the value is requested in person the following documents are required:

      a. Application form (original and copy)

       With the entry into force in July 2013 of the Federal Law for the Prevention
       and Identi cation of Operations with Illicit Resources (Ley Federal para la
       Prevención e Identi cación de Operaciones con Recursos de Procedencia
       Ilícita) the notaries have to notify the Ministry of Finance (Secretaría de
       Hacienda y Crédito Público) if they provide services related with the transfer
       of a property above a certain amount.

   4   The notary gives the preventive notice to the Public Registry (IRCNL)             1 day     MXN 301.96 (4 daily
       Agency : Public Registry (Instituto Registral y Catastral del Estado de Nuevo               UMAs)
       León, IRCNL)

       Once the deed is signed the notary gives notice to the Public Registry
       informing of the conclusion of the transaction. The notice will have a validity
       of 90 days during which this transaction will have the priority over any other
       recordable action on the property.
       To complete this procedure the notary must present the following:
       a. Notice with the names of the parties of the transaction
       b. The purpose of the transaction
       c. The deed number
       d. Signature date
       The notary must bring the documentation to the Public Registry, pay the
       corresponding fees and receive the con rmation that the notice has been
       processed by the Registry. The procedure is regulated by Art. 2910 of the

                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.



What the indicators measure                            Case study assumptions

Time required to enforce a contract through the        The dispute in the case study involves the breach of a sales contract
courts (calendar days)                                 between 2 domestic businesses. The case study assumes that the court
                                                       hears an expert on the quality of the goods in dispute. This distinguishes

  Time for trial and to obtain the judgment

                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                     equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the             - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                         and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                             economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                            - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.

                                                            - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                          equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.

                                                            commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                            - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                     - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                    - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                      - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                            movable assets.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of enforcing contracts is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
enforcing contracts. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indicators.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator           Answer               Explanation

Proceeding          reorganization       The Law of the Commercial Insolvency Law (LCM) provides a unitary form of insolvency
                                         proceedings (concurso mercantil) which has two phases: Conciliation (reorganization) and
                                         Bankruptcy (Liquidation). Mirage would commence a reorganization proceeding
                                         (conciliation) by filing for a “concurso mercantil” in light of Art. 10 of the (LCM). It will be
                                         sufficient to demonstrate that the debtor is generally unable to pay its debts as they mature.
                                         One of the main advantages of this option is that once the “concurso mercantil” commences,
                                         all all enforcement actions against the debtor would be automatically suspended, allowing
                                         Mirage to reorganize.

Outcome             going concern        Since it would be possible to reach a reorganization agreement, the hotel will continue
                                         operating as a going concern.

Time (in years)     1.8                  It would take approximately 21 months to resolve an insolvency proceeding in Mexico City,
                                         similar to the case study, in which a debtor reaches a reorganization agreement with its
                                         creditors and the agreement is approved. All necessary steps to complete the entire process
                                         are included within this estimate, including the appointment of an inspector, a conciliator
                                         and insolvency administrator, and the preparation of the creditor’s claims. The period
                                         prescribed by Article 145 of the Commercial Insolvency Law is rarely enforced, but it is taken
                                         into account when approving the agreement.

Cost (% of          18.0                 The costs associated with an insolvency proceeding (in which a reorganization agreement is
estate)                                  approved) in Mexico would amount to approximately 18% of Mirage’s estate. The main
                                         components of this cost would be the attorney’s fees (5-11 %), as well as the inspector,
                                         conciliator and insolvency administrator (7%) and additional judicial costs (1%).

Proceeding         reorganization      The Law of the Commercial Insolvency Law (LCM) provides a unitary form of insolvency
                                       proceedings (concurso mercantil) which has two phases: Conciliation (reorganization) and
                                       Bankruptcy (Liquidation). Mirage would commence a reorganization proceeding
                                       (conciliation) by filing for a “concurso mercantil” in light of Art. 10 of the (LCM). It will be
                                       sufficient to demonstrate that the debtor is generally unable to pay its debts as they mature.
                                       One of the main advantages of this option is that once the “concurso mercantil” commences,
                                       all enforcement actions against the debtor would be automatically suspended, allowing
                                       Mirage to reorganize itself.

Outcome            going concern       Since it would be possible to reach an agreement on a reorganization plan, the hotel will
                                       continue operating as a going concern.

Time (in years)    1.8                 It would take approximately 21 months to resolve an insolvency proceeding in Monterrey,
                                       similar to the case study, in which a debtor reaches a reorganization agreement with its
                                       creditors and the agreement is approved. All necessary steps to complete the entire process
                                       are included within this estimate, including the appointment of an inspector, a conciliator
                                       and insolvency administrator, and the preparation of the creditor’s claims. The period
                                       prescribed by Article 145 of the Commercial Insolvency Law is rarely enforced, but it is taken
                                       into account when approving the agreement.

Cost (% of         18.0                The costs associated with an insolvency proceeding (in which a reorganization agreement is
estate)                                approved) in Monterrey would amount to approximately 18% of Mirage’s estate. The main
                                       components of this cost would be the attorney’s fees (5-11 %), as well as the inspector,
                                       conciliator and insolvency administrator (7%) and additional judicial costs (1%).
