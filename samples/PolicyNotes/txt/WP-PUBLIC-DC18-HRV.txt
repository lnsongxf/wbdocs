About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       obligations with the State Bureau of Statistics, the company must register
       with the competent tax authority. Once a company is registered at the State
       Bureau of Statistics, company data is sent electronically to the tax authority,
       which levies the annual company tax. The company must register for VAT at
       the Tax O ce, however, only after its rst invoice (within 15 days of
       issuance). Once the company is registered for VAT, all tax payments can be
       processed through an electronic system, e-VAT. If the company’s total
       taxable annual income exceeds HRK 230,000, it must register itself as an
       entity in the VAT system with the competent tax authority, based on the
       company's registered seat.

       Starting from January 01, 2009 a revision of the existing Croatian Law on
       Companies came into force (published in the O cial Gazette no. 146/2008).

       replaces tax number for legal entities. Personal identi cation number is
       de ned as identi cation mark of personal identi cation number that users
       of that number use in their o cial evidences and with change of dates.

       Agency : Municipal Authority

       BuildCo must obtain a decision from the Municipal Authority on utility fees,
       based on the construction permit. The amount of the fee depends on the
       building size (in cubic meters) and on the location. Zagreb is divided into four
       zones for the purposes of communal fee calculations. The communal fee is
       set from HRK 56 to HRK 118 per cubic meter of a building, depending on the
       zone. The Doing Business case study warehouse would be located in Zagreb
       zone III, with the communal fee set at HRK 75 per cubic meter. The fee can be
       paid in full or in installments.


       According to Regulation on Procedure of Determining Volume of Buildings
       for Communal Fee Calculation currently in force, the volume of the buliding
       is used, and as for the warehouse used in the Doing Buisness case study, the
       volume of the warehouse is 3901.5 cubic meters. Therefore the cost is 3901.5

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       prepared by the parties or by a lawyer. Pursuant to Article 52 of the Land
       Registry Act (O cial Gazette 60/13) in force as of May 16, 2013, Land Registry
       Department of the Municipal Court will allow a registration of ownership
       right only based on public documents or private documents with a notarized
       signature of at least a person whose right is going to be restricted,
       encumbered, terminated or conveyed. Pursuant to this regulation, Land
       Registry Department of the Municipal Court will allow a registration of
       ownership right based on the sale contact if a public notary veri ed /
       notarized the signature of the seller (a party whose property right will be
       restricted, encumbered, terminated or conveyed).


       Pursuant to Tari No. 29 of the Lawyers Fee Schedule and Cost
       Compensation (O cial Gazette No. 107/15) a lawyer is entitled to the
       remuneration for drafting a sale contract calculated according to the value
       of the property, increased by 25%. Pursuant to Tari No. 19, a lawyer is also
       entitled to the remuneration for drafting a request for land registry
       registration calculated according to the value of the property, increased by
       25%. Both amounts are further increased by VAT in the amount of 25%. If the
       property value is above HRK 500.000 a lawyer is entitled to an additional fee
       and if the property value is lower than HRK 500.000 there is a xed fee on a
       scale. The documentation shall include: Land register extract (obtained in
       Procedure 1).

       by the parties on the appropriate registration form approved by the Ministry
       of Justice. However, the request shall not be rejected just because it was not
       submitted on the prescribed registration form. The participation of an
       attorney is not mandatory, but if one is involved, his fees will be about 0.5%
       of the property value. The Registry conducts the registration Procedure and
       renders the decision issuing the property title. The process of recording the
       sale agreement with the competent land register court takes around 30-90
       days, when the proceedings are conducted by an experienced lawyer.
       Depending on the various courts, this process may take even longer. It
       should be highlighted that only the nal decision, the one allowing the
       registration, produces the legal e ect. However, regardless of the time when
       the nal decision is rendered, the date of applying for registration will be the
       date marked in the Registry as the moment of transferring the ownership
       title.


       From that moment the party is protected towards all applications submitted
       afterwards. This rule is called the rule of priority: the buyer has the legal right
       to dispose of the property (to sell, lease, bequeath, transfer by gift, and
       mortgage the property). From that moment until the nal registration the
       buyer has "quasi ownership". Therefore, even before the registration is
       completed, the rst buyer - quasi owner can sell the property to another,
       second buyer. However there is a risk if the nal registration of the rst
       buyer - quasi owner is not allowed. In that case he will be liable for damage
       towards the second buyer. In practice the other contractual party will
       probably not be willing to enter into the legal transactions with the person
       who is not the legal owner of the real-estate in question (or take the risk).
                                                                                                                                  Page 33

      probably not be willing to enter into the legal transactions with the person
      who is not the legal owner of the real-estate in question (or take the risk).


      From 2004 the Court no longer accepts incomplete applications. If the
      registration form contains certain de ciencies, the court will not invite the
      applicant to correct the request but will immediately dismiss the application.
      The applicant may submit a new request, which will then have a lower rank.
      This has resulted in some reduction of backlog at the Courts and has also led
      to higher demand for professional assistance with the application process.


      Furthermore, changes in 2005 entrust the Land Registry clerks with the
      authority to decide on applications, with judges deciding on appeals. With
      registration moving from a judicial process to a more administrative
      process, this is a welcome change that indicates potential for decreasing the
      amount of time for registration. Recent internal reorganization of the Land
      Books also indicates future potential for increased e ciency.

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
