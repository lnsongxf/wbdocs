About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

  1   Consult and purchase the application for development permit (Form 1)               1 day              no charge
      Agency : Department for Physical Planning and Housing (DPPH)

      The application is requested by the Department of Physical Planning.
      Companies often consult with the authorities about the project.

  2   Submit development permit application                                              1 day              GMD 13,021
      Agency : Department for Physical Planning and Housing (DPPH)

      The application for a development permit consists of:
      • Form 1
      • Drawings (three sets)
      • Evidence of ownership

      The application must be submitted with three complete set of drawings.
      After the development permit is issued, one set of drawings will be returned
      to the owner, and this set of approved plans must be kept at the building
      site, open to inspection by the authorities. The owner must also show
      evidence of ownership (photocopy of the title deed, lease document or
      certi cate of occupancy), or land tax payment for land owners.


      The cost since January 2008 has been GMD 10.00 per sq. m. and GMD 15.00
      for the form.

  3   Obtain development permit from Development Control Unit (Form 2)                   28 days            no charge
      Agency : Development Control Unit (Department of State for Local
      Government)

      Upon scrutinizing evidence of land ownership, land use, and building plans,
      the Planning Authority approves the application, and the Development
      Control Unit issues a development permit, which consists of the following:
      • Form 2
      • Approved plans, stamped and signed (one set)
      • Form 4, Commencement notice. The developer must complete and send
      Form 4 to the Department of Physical Planning before starting any
      construction work
      • Form 9, Notice of completion


      The authority does not have an o cial fee schedule. The Development
      Control Regulations were adopted in 1995 and have not been altered since
      then. Lack of time-limits for this procedure exacerbates the fact that
      applicants must constantly follow up. In principle, the Planning Authority
      should be noti ed of the commencement of the construction works, but this
      does not happen in practice.

  4   Submit Commencement Form (Form 4) to the Department for Physical                   1 day              no charge
      Planning and Housing (DPPH)
      Agency : Department for Physical Planning and Housing (DPPH)

      At the beginning of the construction works, the Department of Physical
      Planning should be noti ed. The developer must ll out Form 4 and send it
      to the Department for Physical Planning and Housing (DPPH)

       Agency : Development Control Unit (Department of State for Local
       Government)

       The Department of State for Local Government has the right to inspect
       during construction. Often the inspection will occur if there is a problem
       reported or if the department suspects that the developer did not pay all the
       required fees. BuildCo does not need to request the inspection. There will be
       on average 2 inspections during the construction period.

   6   Receive inspection - II                                                         1 day     no charge

       At the end of the construction works, the Planning Authority must be
       noti ed. The developer must ll out Form 9 and send it to the Development
       Control Unit. The Authority would then come out to the construction site to
       issue a certi cate of completion. This step is not widely done in practice;
       however some companies do follow this requirement.

   8   Receive nal inspection                                                          1 day     no charge

       The certi cate of completion is needed to obtain a water connection. There
       is no need to update the property title for the inclusion of the building.

       Agency : National Water and Electricity Company (NAWEC)

       The developer must apply to the National Water and Electricity Company for
       the water and sewage connection. Moreover, the developer must complete
       the works down to, and including, a manhole within 3 meters of the plot
       boundary nearest to the sewer. After the application for the water and
       sewage connection, the water and electricity utility performs an inspection.
       The application fee is deducted from the connection fee.

      Agency : NAWEC Pre-quali ed contractor

      When customers apply for a service that would require an extension of poles
      or transformer, NAWEC provides them the list of Prequali ed electrical
      contractors and they would contact them directly. Usually, customers
      contact more than one contractor for a quotation and in most cases, they go
      for the lowest price.

      This is the survey done by NAWEC to conduct a feasibility study. The Survey
      usually involves that someone will come and visit the premise and make an
      estimate. Someone from the applicant’s party has to be present at the time
      of the inspection.

      Getting the meter in the past was sometimes a problem, but NAWEC claims
      that they have this size on store. NAWEC’s Business Unit will request the
      material. Once the meter has been installed, electricity starts owing right
      away. The customer’s electrician takes care of the electricity to start owing
      by connecting internal and external wiring.

No.   Procedure                                                                           Time to Complete     Associated Costs

  1   Application for Ministerial Consent to transfer leasehold property                  1 to 3 months        D 200 for the
      Agency : Department of Lands and Surveys                                            (simultaneous with   Application form
                                                                                          Procedures 2 and
      Because the State owns most of the land in Banjul, the property is technically
                                                                                          3)
      leased (land in Banjul can be freehold or leasehold). The vendor buys and
      submits the Application form for Permission at the Department of Lands and
      Surveys. The Lands Department conducts an internal search for other les
      connected with the property. These les need to be attached to the
      application. The application then leaves the Lands Department and goes to a
      di erent o ce within the Department of State for Lands. The Secretary of
      State for Local Government and Land indicates approval and then the
      application is sent back to Lands Department. The Director of Lands issues
      the letter of consent for the transfer of the property. The lease is usually 99
      years, with the option of another 99 years. The vendor also brings receipt
      showing that land rents have been paid up to date. The ministerial consent is
      required for leaseholds. With regular follow up it can be obtained in one to
      three months, but can take up to a year if there is no follow up and there are
      mortgages attached to the property.

  2   Preparation of Transfer Deed by a lawyer                                            5 days               2-3% of purchase
      Agency : Lawyer                                                                     (simultaneous with   price (lawyer’s fees)
                                                                                          Procedures 1 and
      The lawyer then prepares the transfer deed. Sometimes the lawyer prepares
                                                                                          3)
      the sale-purchase agreement, if payment is by installment.

  3   Title search by lawyer at the O    ce of the Registrar of Deeds                     2 days               included in
      Agency : Registry of Deeds o ce                                                     (simultaneous with   Procedure 2
                                                                                          Procedures 1 and
      The purchaser’s lawyer conducts a title search at the O ce of the Registrar
                                                                                          2)
      of Deeds within the O ce of the Attorney General. The search costs about D
      200-500, but this is usually included in the lawyer’s fees. Sometimes, the
      lawyer may need to conduct an additional search at the Lands Department if
        les are missing at the O ce of the Attorney General.

  4   Payment of Capital Gains tax and Stamp Duty at the Department of                    1 day                5% of purchase price
      Income Tax                                                                                               (Stamp Duty)
      Agency : Gambia Revenue Authority or Guarantee Trust Bank

      Once permission has been received, the vendor must pay capital gains tax
      and the purchaser pays stamp duty at the Department of Income Tax.
      Details of permission are inserted into the transfer documents. And, as of
      2007, all those wishing to pay taxes must possess a tax identi cation number
      (TIN) issued by the Ministry of Finance, usually upon a company's
      registration/incorporation. Stamp Duty will not be accepted unless Capital
      Gains tax has been paid. Once they are paid, the purchaser will obtain
      receipts with proof of payment and the transfer deed will be stamped.
      Capital Gains Tax = 10% of the purchase price or 25% of the sale pro t
      (whichever is greater). Capital gains are not included in the calculation of
      cost for the case study. The stamp fees as of the Stamp Act establish a 2% of
      sales price stamp duty. However this rate has been updated since after 2002
      to 5% of the sales price, based on 2002 budget speech of the minister of
       nance.

  5   Transfer deed is brought to the Registrar General’s O        ce for registration    5 days               D 1000 (Registration
                                                                                                               fee)              Page 26

       Agency : Registry of Deeds o ce                                                                              fee)

       The transfer deed is given a serial registration number, entered into the
       registers. One copy is retained with the Registrar General, and another one
       is returned to the purchaser. In theory, the document is signed by the
       Registrar General – but often it is done by one of the lawyers in the Registrar
       General’s O ce. Together with the original lease document, this document
       constitutes the new title. The registration fee is a xed fee.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Doing Business 2018          Gambia, The


    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
