About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        Under the statutory pension insurance scheme, an employer must
        subscribe its employees for pension insurance with a pension provider
        handling earnings-related pensions. Supplemental pension insurance is
        optional.


        The employer also pays the pension institution statutory employee earnings-
        related contributions, such as: accident insurance, unemployment
        insurance, and group life assurance premium. A social security contribution
        is also payable to the Regional Tax O ce.


        The employer must insure its employees against accidents and occupational
        diseases, according to Section 3 of the Occupational Accidents, Injuries and
        Diseases Act, which has been in force as of 1 January 2017. In addition,
        certain collective labor agreements require that employers provide their
        employees with group life insurance. No proof of insurance is needed to
        start operations.


        The accident insurance is paid to the insurance company and must be
        obtained before the work for the company starts. The group life insurance is
        also paid to the insurance company. The group life insurance is compulsory
        only if the applicable collective labor agreement requires the employer to
        take the group life insurance. Unemployment insurance is paid to The
        Unemployment Insurance Fund.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

      Agency : Building Supervision Authority

      BuildCo must set a date for a startup meeting with the building supervision
      authority and convene all necessary persons to the meeting. The meeting
      must be held before the beginning of construction (some excavation work
      can be done, but the foundation may not be laid before the meeting). At a
      minimum, the following persons should attend the meeting: the person
      starting the building project, the head designer, and the site manager. The
      meeting attendees must be agreed with the building supervision authority.

      Agency : Owners and titleholders of surrounding properties

      According to Section 133 of the Land Use and Building Act, neighbours shall
      be noti ed when an application for a building permit is submitted, unless
      noti cation is clearly not necessary with regard to the neighbours' interest,
      due to the smallness or location of the project, or to the contents of the
      plan. 'Neighbour' refers to owners and other titleholders of adjacent or
      opposite properties. The fact that the application has been submitted shall
      at the same time be publicized on the building site by suitable means.
      When needed, a review shall be conducted on the building site in order to
      assess how the building ts in with the surroundings and the impact of
      construction, and in order to hear the neighbours. The applicant and the
      titleholders of the neighbouring properties shall be noti ed of the time and
      date of the review.

       Agency : Real Estate O ce

       This report can be obtained any time online from http://kartta.hel. / . The
       report is required to ensure that the height of the new building is in
       proportion with other buildings in the same neighborhood. The statutory
       zoning map/local detailed plan is the only document stating the allowed
       building height.

   7   Obtain building permit                                                            38 days    EUR 9,144
       Agency : Municipal Building Inspection

       The building permit is issued by the Municipal Building Inspection. BuildCo
       must provide the necessary information to the local building supervision
       authority to decide on the building permit application. The quality and the
       extent of the required information depend on the project features.

       The following documentation is usually required for warehouse projects:
       • The completed application form issued by the building supervision
       authority. The owner or the holder of the building site must sign the form. If
       there are several owners or holders, all must sign the application form.
       • A power of attorney is required only if a representative les the building
       permit application (This is not applicable to the warehouse project
       considered here.)
       • The establishment of the ownership title is required because the building
       permit can be granted only based on the application made by the owner or
       the holder of the building site. Usually one of the following documents is
       presented to the building supervision authority:
       1. The deed of sale of the real estate
       2. The lease contract
       3. The deed of title
       4. The extract from the trade register
       5. The building permit map and the extract from the real estate registry
       6. The decision to deviate from the provisions, regulations, prohibitions, and
       other restrictions on building and other action must be attached to the
       application, in original, if the project requires such a decision
       7. The certi cate of the decision’s legal validity must be presented before the
       actual launching of the building project (This is not applicable to the
       warehouse project.)
       8. The environmental permit is required if the use of the building poses a
       threat of environmental pollution. The decision on the building permit can
       be postponed until the environmental permit is attached to the application
       (This is not applicable to the warehouse project.)
       9. Three master drawings must be attached to the application. One
       document will be archived with the building supervision authority, and the
       other will be returned to the applicant with the nal decision. The master
       drawings to be followed in construction master drawings are approved in
       connection with the grant of the building permit.
       10. Report of the height of the building site
       11. The ground investigation report of the building site. If needed, also
       enclosed with the building permit application will be an account of the site’s
       health e ects and ground levels, and the type of foundation and any other
       measures required as a result. This report may be produced by BuildCo.
       12. The o cial opinion on the connection of the wastewater drain and the
       water pipeline
       13. Noti cation to the neighbors. When the building permit application is
        led with the building supervision authority, the neighbors must also be
       noti ed. The applicant may do this personally by using the o cial form,
                                                                                                                Page 15

       noti ed. The applicant may do this personally by using the o cial form,
       obtained from the building supervision authority. Otherwise, subject to a fee,
       the applicant may request the building supervision authority to conduct the
       noti cation.
       14. Forms for o cial statistics. The building supervision authority must
       deliver information on building projects to the Population Register Center.
       Thus, the forms in question must be attached to the application. These
       forms are available at the building supervision authority or at the public
       printing center.
       15. The o cial form on the building designer. Every building project must
       have a quali ed head designer in charge of the construction design and the
       quality of the design as a whole.


       Other documents are required, as follows:
       1. Working designs
       2. Calculation of permitted building volume
       3. Report on re load, parking spaces, handling construction waste; on
       environmental issues, with photographs (can be produced by BuildCo)

       HSY Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority is responsible for all
       matters of connections to the water distribution and sewerage systems.

       The procedure for ordering a connection is as follows:
       • Helsinki Water customer service sta provides the new customer with a
       statement on the connection. The street address of the plot or property is
       required, as is the owner’s name, address, and phone number.
       • Helsinki Water provides the customer with a preliminary estimate of the
       recently introduced connection charge.
       • The customer should acquire a building permit for the plot.
       • After the customer has obtained the building permit, Helsinki Water will
       send the customer the connection charge notice. The property owner can
        le a complaint within 14 days of receiving the notice. Unless a complaint is
       made, the proposed charge will be considered as having been accepted by
       the customer.
       • Water service connection and meter installation will be conducted after the
       connection charge is paid. The customer is responsible for the construction
       and maintenance of the connection pipes and conduits and their nancing.
       Before the start of on-site construction work, a supervisor responsible for
       the construction of the water facility and sewerage system -- approved by
       the municipal building control o cials -- should be assigned. Helsinki Water
       always takes care of installation of water meters with seals, water main
       connection with water-sealed joints, and connections to the sewerage
       system on the customer’s properties. Service charges will be invoiced at

       Network
       Agency : Helen Electricity Network

       The application for a new connection can be submitted through an online
       form (i.e. to obtain the contract for getting connected to the distribution
       grid) or in person at Helen’s customer service point. If submitted online, the
       customer can choose to provide the required documents either directly
       online, or send them via email/regular mail. The required documents include
       the blueprints of the buildings internal wiring, which have to be approved by
       the utility before the building is connected to the grid.

   2   Purchase material and carry out external works                                       3 calendar days      EUR 3,000
       Agency : Helen Electricity Network

       The customer needs to purchase and install the connection cable from the
       building to the perimeter wall, since the utility does only the external
       connection works, and everything inside the boundary wall of the building is
       the customer’s responsibility. The meter is installed only after the
       connection cable is installed.

   3   Submit electrician's statement on internal wiring and receive external               30 calendar days     EUR 7,640
       works from Helen Electricity Network
       Agency : Helen Electricity Network

       The customer's electrician submits a document where he states that all the
       wiring has been done according to the rules and regulations. The person in
       charge of the wiring has to be a certi ed electrician and have the licenses
       that are required to do inspections. The electrician does not have to be
       registered with the utility company and there is no veri cation whether they
       are certi ed or not.

   4   Sign supply contract with retailer                                                   1 calendar day       EUR 0
       Agency : Helen Electricity Network

       The customer has a choice of retailers for electricity supply. In the case of
       most retailers, the application is done online, and no paperwork needs to
       submit.

   5   Request and receive meter installation and electricity ow                            7 calendar days      EUR 0
       Agency : Helen Electricity Network

       The meter is installed when the customer’s electrician informs the utility that
       it can be installed (not at the same time as the connection). The installation
       is done by Empower Oy. The customer does not need to contact this
       company separately, it is taken care of by the utility. Electricity starts owing
       once the meter is installed, and once Empower Oy has informed the utility
       that the meter has been installed.

      The sale agreement can be prepared by the seller or the buyer, no
      involvement of a lawyer or real estate agent is required by law. In general the
      seller present an extract from the Land Registry and extracts from the Title
      and Mortgage Registries demonstrating ownership and any registered
      encumbrances, but these are not formally required.



      The agreement must be in writing and contain at a minimum the following
      information (according to the Code of Real Estate 540/1995, as amended):
      name of the seller and buyer, the object of purchase (including real estate
      number), the purchase price or equivalent compensation and possible
      subsequent conditions. The agreement must also contain the purpose of
      transfer.



      The sale agreement shall be signed both by the seller and buyer, in the
      presence of the attesting notary. The attesting notary checks the ID of the
      seller and buyer and veri es the formal validity of the sales agreement.
      Failure to follow these requirements will result in the transaction being
      automatically null and void. Note that an attesting notary is required only
      when ownership (freehold title) of the real estate is assigned. When the right
      of tenancy (leasehold) or other right to possess the property is assigned, the
      presence of the attesting notary is not required. The attesting notary must
      inform National Land Survey of Finland of the transaction and the buyer
      must apply for the registration of its title at their o ces (see Procedure 3).



      In November 2013 National Land Survey Finland introduced the E-
      Conveyancing system. When seller and buyer use the new E-Conveyancing
      system, no notary is needed to conduct the transaction which can be done

      The transfer tax must be paid to the Finnish Tax Administration within six (6)
      months of the date of the transfer/purchase agreement. In practice,
      payment of transfer tax is a prerequisite for the registration of title and,
      accordingly, transfer tax will become immediately due and payable upon
      application for registration of title. As the application for registration of title
      is automatically led upon completion of the transfer if the e-conveyancing
      system referred to under Procedure 1 is used, in such case transfer tax will
      also become immediately due and payable. In the event that the buyer fails
      to pay the requisite transfer tax within six (6) months of the date of the
      transfer/purchase agreement, the Finnish Tax Administration may impose a
      higher transfer tax (up to 8%)

      Agency : National Land Survey of Finland

      The buyer shall register its title to the property in question with the Title and
      Mortgage Register within 6 months of the date of the purchase agreement.
      The application for registration of title shall be submitted by mail or in
      person to the o ce of the National Land Survey of Finland dealing with
      registration matters in Helsinki or Vaasa, or by email to
      kirjaamisasiat@maanmittauslaitos. .


      The National Land Survey of Finland reviews the preconditions for transfer of
      title and provided that they are met and the transfer tax has been paid (see
      Procedure 2 above), registers title to the property in question in the buyer's
      name. Provided that the parties are using the e-conveyancing system, the
      application for registration of title will automatically be led simultaneously
      with the signing of the purchase agreement. The transfer of property will not
      become opposable against third parties until the buyer's title thereto is
      registered


      The application for registration of title shall include: (i) Evidence of payment
      of the purchase price if such payment is a precondition for transfer of
      ownership; (ii) Evidence of payment of transfer tax (as described under
      Procedure 2 above); (iii) minutes of the board meeting of each of the seller
      and buyer resolving on the respective sale and purchase of the property.
      The registration fee can be paid at a bank or online based on an invoice sent
      by the National Land Survey of Finland post registration.

      In the event that the property in question exceeds 5,000 m2 in size (or in the
      cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Kauniainen or Vantaa, exceeds 3,000 m2 in size),
      under the Pre-Emption Act (608/1977, as amended), the municipality may
      have a pre-emption right in respect of the property. If the municipality
      decides to use its pre-emption right, it shall notify the buyer, seller and the
      National Land Survey of Finland of its decision to do so within three months
      of the original sale transaction. The owner of the property may, however,
      request that the municipality con rm in advance that the right of pre-
      emption will not be used. The buyer's title to the property may only be
      registered after the three-month deadline unless the municipality gives
      advance notice that it will not use the pre-emption right. Based on the case
      study assumptions, the pre-emption right will not be triggered by the
      transaction

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Time (in years)      0.9               It takes 11 months to resolve insolvency in Finland. The reorganization plan must be
                                       proposed within four months after the commencement of the reorganization proceedings.
                                       After the approval of the plan, a debtor company starts to comply with it and its
                                       implementation might take approximately 1-7 years.
