About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                        Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

       A site visit is required to determine the shortest route for the network
       extension works and to do the load ow study to check the impact of the
       load growth to the end of line. Upon check that the voltage is within the
       limits stipulated by the FEA (Fiji Electricity Authority) Grid Code, a copy of the
       result is forwarded to the Systems Protection & Control team. The latter
       team can then carry out the protection co-ordination and advise the
       switching team. A quotation for the capital works is sent to the potential
       customer.

       Agency : Fiji Electricity Authority

       FEA opens a job le which is then sent to the Finance department and supply
       team to check if all materials are available. The utility conducts all external
       connection works, including the installation of the pad mounted transformer
       and service cables. Upon payment receipt, an acknowledgement is made to
       the customer who is reminded of the progress in the construction.

       The Authority's team will prepare a project execution le which will comprise
       of all copies of the correspondences, the payment details, the project
       drawing with the single line drawing, the ood- ow detail and the project
       estimate with the bill of materials, and the project cost. The job le once
       approved & bill of material con rmed is sent to the Distribution Projects
       Manager to co-ordinate the necessary switching co-ordination and then
       implementing the actual work and commissioning of the power supply to the
       extended grid. A formal request is then sent back to the Design team of the
       commissioning of supply to the new grid. The design team will then process
       the "Application for Permit & Power Supply form" (which was kept in the
       scheme le until capital works is completed). The connection fees and two
       months' security deposit is mentioned on the approved form for the client
       to pay. This form is then sent to the Regulatory team to co-ordinate electrical
       wiring works inspection & connections for supply from the grid to
       installation.

      The seller needs to register and obtain a Capital Gains Tax Clearance Certi cate from
      FRCA con rming either that CGT has been paid, or satisfactory arrangement for
      payment of the tax has been made, or no tax is payable. The seller needs to submit the
      following documents:

      a) CGT Declaration form (which is available at the following link from the FRCA website:
      http://www.frca.org.fj/docs/forms/2011/IRS228%20CGT%20Statutory%20Declaration.pdf)
      (b) CGT Return form (which is available at the following link from the FRCA website:
      http://www.frca.org.fj/docs/forms/2011/IRS230-CGT%20Return.pdf)
      (c) copy of the certi cate of title
      (d) copy of the last registered transfer of the subject property in favour of the seller
      (e) copy of the stamped transfer of the property from the seller to the buyer


      It would be advisable to attach documentary evidence of all claims in respect of the ‘cost
      of the property’ so that there is timely processing of the application for CGT Clearance
      Certi cate by FRCA. Where documentary evidence is not available, letters could be
      written or statutory declarations could be provided to FRCA to explain the reasons for
      non-availability of the required documents. This would assist FRCA to process and issue
      of the CGT Clearance Certi cate.

      Where CGT is payable and the seller does not have the funds to pay the CGT,
      arrangements could be made with FRCA for issue of the CGT Clearance Certi cate based
      on an undertaking from the seller’s lawyer to FRCA to the e ect that the lawyer will hold
      the sale proceeds in the trust account and will pay the CGT to FRCA before paying the
      balance sale proceeds to the seller.

      formality is accomplished, they submit the transfer documents for registration. The
      registration fee (FDJ 11.5 for properties over FDJ 100,000 + VAT of 15.0%) is paid. The
      Registrar of Titles must not register an instrument for the transfer of a capital asset
      unless the seller or the purchaser furnishes the Registrar with a CGT Clearance
      Certi cate con rming that CGT has been paid or satisfactory arrangement for payment
      of the tax has been made or no tax is payable. It is possible that some new mortgages
      might still be in "the pipeline" and are not yet recorded on the property at the
      settlement (the mortgage has been submitted in the registry, but it has not been
      inscribed yet). To avoid nding later about a mortgage on the property, it is possible to
      request a "guaranteed search" (under section 30, 31 and 32 of the Land Transfer act)
      where the registry checks and certi es that there are no other mortgages registered.
      Under the Land Transfer Act Amendment Decree No. 34 of 2011, the Registrar of Titles

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                        Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if

  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population         secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                      In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit          only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set

                                                            - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                            - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                            - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                            largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                            - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                            loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                            of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                            to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                            where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                            property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                            In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                          several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the           - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                       and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                           economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                          - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                          - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                        equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                          commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                          - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                   - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                  - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                    - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                          movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator          Answer                Explanation

Proceeding         receivership          After Mirage's default, BizBank will file an application to appoint a receiver as the debenture
                                         holder. The court would then appoint an official receiver, who would collect statement of
                                         affairs, finalize creditors' claims, and try to sell Mirage's business as a going concern. Sale
                                         proceeds will be paid to Mirage then. This is the most likely in-court procedure in Fiji.

Outcome            piecemeal sale        No, the hotel will stop operating and Mirage assets will be sold piecemeal as a result of the
                                         receivership proceeding. In Fiji, businesses do not generally continue to operate as a going
                                         concern at the end of the proceedings.

Time (in years)    1.8                   It takes 1.8 years from Mirage's default until BizBank is repaid some of the money owed to it
                                         through the receivership proceeding. The delay in the completion of receivership is resulted
                                         from the advertisement of the sale and execution of the sale.

Cost (% of         10.0                  The costs associated with the receivership case would amount to approximately 10% of the
estate)                                  value of the debtor's estate (FJD 754,782). Costs incurred mainly include court or
                                         government agency fees (FJD 400), attorney fees (FJD 2,500), costs of notification and
                                         publication (FJD 200), variable receiver fees, variable fees of accountants, assessors,
                                         inspectors and other professionals, and variable fees of auctioneers.
