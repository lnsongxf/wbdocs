About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       not including the day of submission of documents and the day of issuance of
       the registration certi cate.



       The registration fee is RUB 4,000, which can be done through a terminal
       machine at the o ces of the Federal Tax Service, a wire transfer or any other
       means which would allow the founders to provide an evidence of payment to
       the Federal Tax Service.



       After submitting the application for registration, it is possible to check the
       readiness of the documents online, including the results of the decision
       taken (decision about registration,decision about suspension, refusal of
       registration). In recent times, there have been more cases of suspension of
       registration in order to verify the information disclosed in the Uni ed State
       Register of Legal Entities (EGRUL).



       On the day of pick up, the applicant will receive a package of documents,
       including Abstract of the state registration, abstract of tax registration with a
       Tax Identi cation Number (TIN), one of the original company charters (that
       the applicant submitted) stamped by the government, and proof of business
       entry in the uni ed State Register of Legal Entities. Since January 1, 2017,
       Certi cates of state registration of legal entities, which were stamped on the
       special blanks of the Russian Federal Tax Service, have been cancelled, and
       the Lists of the record in the Uni ed State Register of Legal Entities are
       issued instead. The registration documents can be sent by mail, if an
       applicant indicated in the application form that he wants the documents to
       be delivered by mail. Upon the completion of the company's registration, the
       Registration Authority shall send the information about the new company to
       the Federal State Statistics Service and the social funds (Pension Fund and
       Social Insurance Fund) for the purposes of the company's registration with
       these authorities.



       The procedure could also be done online
       http://www.nalog.ru/rn77/service/gosreg_eldocs/- with electronic signature.
       However, obtaining online signature is costly and time consuming. In
       practice, most businesses do not utilize the online services. The online
       service has been available since 2012.

       On 6 April 2015, the President of the Russian Federation signed Federal Law
       #82 that eliminates requirement for a company seal. However, in practice,
       majority of the businesses still obtain a company seal as part of the process
       of starting a business. If the new company decides to have a seal it must
       insert the respective provision to its Articles of Association.

       A basic company seal typically costs RUB 500. More sophisticated seals can
       cost RUB 1,000-1,500.

       either (a) have the signature form notarized and then it can be brought to
       the bank when opening the bank account, or (b) they can certify the

        related to certifying the signatures in amount of RUB700.


        Starting from May 5, 2014 this procedure became optional. If the founder is
        able to attend the Uni ed State Register and le all the documents in person,
        the application does not have to be notarized and the registration o cer
        can certify the founder’s signature instead. However, this is possible only in
        case when all the founders are able to visit the Uni ed State Register in
        person, otherwise the application must be notarized.

        Agency : Seal maker

        On 6 April 2015, the President of the Russian Federation signed Federal Law
        #82 that eliminates requirement for a company seal. However, in practice,
        majority of the businesses still obtain a company seal as part of the process
        of starting a business. If the new company decides to have a seal it must
        insert the respective provision to its Articles of Association.


        The cost of acquiring a company seal at the average market price is RUB 350.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Alternatively, checking and veri cation ownership rights of the seller can be
      performed on-line on the main web page of the Federal Service for State
      Registration, Cadastre and Cartography (www.rosreestr.ru).


      The Buyer can also obtain a paper copy of the extract from Real Estate
      Property Register by making an application as individual (not the legal entity)
      with the cost being RUB 200. There is also an option to access the
      information resource of Rosreestr: any individual or legal entity may obtain
      an electronic extract from the Property Register and verify ownership title to
      any real estate facility and existence of encumbrances, if any.


      The procedure includes the following steps:
      1) obtaining an electronic access key (free of charge);
      2) re lling one's account with the help of a credit card for a minimum sum of
      RUB 150;
      3) receiving the electronic extract from the Property Register within a day
      with the charge being RUB 1 for one query.

      Agency : Local Utility Company

      At the request of the buyer, the seller obtains a “reconciliation report” from
      the local utility, showing that no outstanding debts are owed to the utility
      company. Usually, the seller’s accountant can obtain this report within a day
      by requesting it directly from the local utility. Although not a legal
      requirement, the reconciliation report is commonly obtained in transactions
      involving commercial real estate, so the buyer can rest assured that the
      property is free from any possible creditors and to avoid problems with
      future utility hook up.

       The most common way to apply for state registration of title transfer is
                                                                                               Rosreestr
       completed within 9 business days. An application and relevant documents
                                                                                               7 working days
       are submitted at the Multifunctional Centers (MFCs), which provide services
                                                                                               (online registration)
       on federal, regional and municipal levels, using a "One-Stop-Shop" principle
       and are widely spread across all regions of the country. MFC accepts the
       application and documents, sends them to Rosreestr internally, and receives
       them back (all electronically).


       It is also possible to apply for state registration of title transfer directly at the
       Roseester, which is completed within 7 business days. However, the option is
       less popular since Roseester centers are more scarce.


       Additionally, since 2013 the application together with all relevant documents
       can also be submitted in an electronic format, using the following link:
       https://rosreestr.ru/wps/portal/p/cc_present/reg_rights#/ However, the
       online application for the registration of the property transfer is subject to
       the special requirements set forth by the Order No. 723 of the Ministry of
       Economic Development and Trade dated 29 November 2013. For example, all
       documents submitted online be signed by the encrypted digital signature of
       a relevant person. In practice, submission of documents in electronic format
       is not frequently done, since there are only a few legal entities/individuals
       who have the encrypted digital signature software necessary for the
       transaction.

  2   Seller obtains a “reconciliation report” from the local utility                   1 day
      Agency : Local Utility Company

      At the request of the buyer, the seller obtains a “reconciliation report” from
      the local utility, showing that no outstanding debts are owed to the utility
      company. Usually, the seller’s accountant can obtain this report within a day
      by requesting it directly from the local utility. Although not a legal
      requirement, the reconciliation report is commonly obtained in transactions
      involving commercial real estate, so the buyer can rest assured that the
      property is free from any possible creditors and to avoid problems with
      future utility hook up.

       The most common way to apply for state registration of title transfer is
                                                                                               Rosreestr
       completed within 9 business days. An application and relevant documents
                                                                                               7 working days
       are submitted at the Multifunctional Centers (MFCs), which provide services
                                                                                               (online registration)
       on federal, regional and municipal levels, using a "One-Stop-Shop" principle
       and are widely spread across all regions of the country. MFC accepts the
       application and documents, sends them to Rosreestr internally, and receives
       them back (all electronically).

       It is also possible to apply for state registration of title transfer directly at the
       Roseester, which is completed within 7 business days. However, the option is
       less popular since Roseester centers are more scarce.

       Additionally, since 2013 the application together with all relevant documents
       can also be submitted in an electronic format, using the following link:
       https://rosreestr.ru/wps/portal/p/cc_present/reg_rights#/ However, the
       online application for the registration of the property transfer is subject to
       the special requirements set forth by the Order No. 723 of the Ministry of
       Economic Development and Trade dated 29 November 2013. For example, all
       documents submitted online be signed by the encrypted digital signature of
       a relevant person. In practice, submission of documents in electronic format
       is not frequently done, since there are only a few legal entities/individuals
       who have the encrypted digital signature software necessary for the
       transaction.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                    Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest     registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population     secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                  In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit      only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set
  registry as a percentage of adult population          of legal provisions relating to the use of movable collateral.

                                                        Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                        (BizBank) are used:
                                                        - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                        - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                        - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                        largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                        second largest business city.
                                                        - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                        The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                        loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                        of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                        to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                        where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                        property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                        a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                        In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                        charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s
                                                        combined movable assets (or as much of ABC’s movable assets as
                                                        possible). ABC keeps ownership and possession of the assets.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                        several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the         - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                     and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                         economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                        - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                        - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                      equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)              - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                        commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                        - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                 - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                  - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                        movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Time (in years)   2.0              In accordance with Article 51 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), a bankruptcy case must
                                   be considered within 7 months of the day the petition was received by the arbitrazh court.
                                   Liquidation proceedings by law are limited to 6 months and can be extended by 6 more
                                   months (art. 124 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)). Therefore, the time dictated by law
                                   is 19 months. However, in practice, liquidation proceedings are extended several times and
                                   for longer periods. One reason for extension, for example, is that not all mechanisms were
                                   used to collect on the debt, and court decisions on this issue become effective only after
                                   appeals. Additionally, time is needed to execute judicial acts.

Cost (% of        9.0              The total cost of the insolvency proceedings will be around 9% of the value of the estate. The
estate)                            main expenses will include: attorneys' fees - around 2.5%, fees of the insolvency
                                   representative - around 4.5%, fees of accountants and other experts - around 1.5%,
                                   auctioneer's fees - no more than 1%, and other fees (court fees, mailing fees, etc.) - 0.1%.

Time (in years)    1.8                  In accordance with Article 51 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy), a bankruptcy case must
                                        be considered within 7 months of the day the petition was received by the arbitrazh court.
                                        Liquidation proceedings by law are limited to 6 months and can be extended by 6 more
                                        months (art. 124 of the Law on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)). Therefore, the time dictated by law
                                        is 19 months. However, in practice, liquidation proceedings are extended more than once
                                        and for longer periods. One reason for extension, for example, is that not all mechanisms
                                        were used to collect on the debt, and court decisions on this issue become effective only
