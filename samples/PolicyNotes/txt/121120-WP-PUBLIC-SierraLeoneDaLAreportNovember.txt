Note: For the losses estimation, rental income losses were calculated using a proxy from 2015 Sierra Leone Housing and
Population Census and field survey findings, which provided an average annual rent for a property in Western Area Rural and
Western Urban and an approximate number of rental properties in the affected area. Other losses included the cost of temporary
shelter (excluding basic services) and the cost of demolishing moderate damaged buildings in the river channel, demolishing
remaining structural elements of destroyed buildings, and removal of construction debris. International Organization for Migration
(IOM) estimates to set up a temporary shelter (without services) per household for three months (USD 2,600), based on their
similar experience in Democratic Republic of Congo experience, was used as a baseline to estimate losses for around 100
households currently living in camps (based on 30 August 201—ONS update). The average cost of demolishing a single and
multi-story building as well as the cost of removing the construction debris was acquired through discussions with a few local
contractors and real estate experts.

are required to supply electricity to their customers in

electricity, EGTC was quick in evacuating its maximum

          assets is valued based on pre-disaster value of
          assets (as determined by the unit cost associated

building, (ii) damage to WASH, (iii) damage to furniture, (iv)    (MEST), one school (1 facility) was fully destroyed,
damage to learning materials, and (v) damage to teaching          while 34 schools (23 facilities) incurred damage to the
materials.
