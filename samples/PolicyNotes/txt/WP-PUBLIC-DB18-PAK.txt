About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

     Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

       Agency : Sub-Registrar of Conveyance/Assurances

       The conveyance deed must be executed before the registering authority.
       Execution of the deed is done before the Sub-Registrar of
       Conveyance/Assurances of the area, o cial responsible under the
       Registration Act. Registration of the deed automatically follows the execution
       of sale deed. A receipt is issued immediately, but the deed is delivered a few
       weeks later. The name of the buyer is recorded in the new deed, showing the
       change in ownership. The documentation shall include: Conveyance/Sale
       Deed ID of parties Original title deed of seller If parties have authorized
       someone else through a power of attorney, the power of attorney in original
       with copies. The buyer will conduct post registration procedures, such as
       changing the name at the utility companies, property taxation and municipal
       services.

       Agency : Land authority ofthe district where the company is located

       Once the registration process described above is completed, and the sale
       deed has been collected from the sub-registrar o ce, the mutation process
       is carried out by the buyer at the relevant land authority for transfer of
       ownership.


       A property mutation is the change of the title ownership under certain
       conditions such as sale/purchase or death of an owner and even if the
       property is bought through a power of attorney (PoA). Through mutation,
       while the new owner gets the property in his name, the government is able
       to charge property tax from the right owner. The new owner needs to pick
       up the application with the purchase agreement with the sub-registrar and
       scanning o ce’s stamp and take it to the Director’s o ce of the concerned
       land authority. The owner is only the o cial owner once the mutation is
       completed and the new title issued.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

                                                      several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the       - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                   and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                       economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                      - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                      - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                    equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)            - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                      commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                      - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                               - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                              - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                      movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Indicator         Answer            Explanation

Proceeding        foreclosure       After Mirage's default on payment, the BizBank will bring a recovery action (foreclosure
                                    proceedings) under Section 9 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance
                                    2001, against the Mirage at the Banking Court. This is the most effective way for BizBank to
                                    recoup its investment with the security interest over Mirage's assets.

Outcome           piecemeal sale    After Court's decision on Mirage's case, BizBank would gain possession of Mirage's assets
                                    and sell them piecemeal in a public auction by the court appointed auctioneer. The hotel will
                                    stop operating.

Time (in years)   2.8               The foreclosure procedure until BizBank is repaid some or all of the money owed to it takes
                                    approximate 2.8 years. BizBank would initiate foreclosure 3 months after Mirage's default.
                                    The Court will then review the case, notify all relevant parties, hold a hearing and appoint an
                                    official receiver. This period usually takes about 4 months. Then it takes approximate half a
                                    year for the court appointed official receiver to finalize creditors' claims and an additional 4
                                    months to have the court's final decision made. The court would then appoint an auctioneer
                                    to conduct the sale of Mirage's assets. Execution of the auction sale until BizBank is repaid
                                    takes around 1 year.

Cost (% of        4.0               The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 4% of the value of the
estate)                             debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
                                    government agency fees (0.1%), attorneys’ fees (2%), costs of notification and publication
                                    (<1%), fees of accountants, assessors, inspectors and other professionals (1%), and fees of
                                    auctioneers (1%).
