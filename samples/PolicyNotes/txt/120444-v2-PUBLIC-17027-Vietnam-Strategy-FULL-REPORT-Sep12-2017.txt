Foreword



Vietnam’s economic success, initiated by the Đổi Mới reforms in the late 1980s,
lifted over 40 million people out of poverty. Lately, however, Vietnam has been
facing a new wave of challenges. Adverse impacts of natural hazard shocks and
rapid degradation of natural resources threaten its gross domestic product (GDP)
and related social development gains. The 2015–2016 drought and saltwater
intrusion (SWI) event has had far-reaching socioeconomic effects, including
food insecurity, water scarcity, associated health issues, and loss of livestock.
It developed into a national crisis, with close to 2 million people affected due
to damaged livelihoods and the country seeking international help. Though
drought and SWI are cyclical events, the severe impacts in 2015–2016 were
exacerbated by the combination of adverse El Niño effects and the complex
water resource management challenges in important tributaries of the Mekong
River. Given that over 18 percent of GDP comes from the agricultural sector,
the crisis revealed an urgent need for the government of Vietnam (GoV) to
take immediate and long-term actions to address the critical gaps in disaster
preparedness and to adopt a holistic and integrated approach toward a
resilient future for people and their livelihoods.

Climate change is real and is having broad impacts across the world. Climate
change projections draw a grim picture of Vietnam’s climate vulnerability in the
coming decades. A transformation of different sectors—including agriculture,
water resource management, energy, fisheries, forestry, and infrastructure—is
needed to counter climate threats and enhance Vietnam’s adaptive capacity.
To improve disaster preparedness and build longer-term resilience, Vietnam
should act now to adapt to changing climate. As in many countries, Vietnam’s
risk and vulnerability are intensified by unplanned urban development,
inappropriate land use, and ecosystem degradation. Yet it is still possible for
the country to correct course if its policy makers and communities take action.

 This report takes a deeper look at the drought and SWI crisis faced by Vietnam,
identifies the gaps across key sectors, and recommends the principal short-
and longer-term actions needed for integrated disaster risk management.
The recommendations are based on global experiences in good governance
with intersectoral coordination in disaster forecast and early warning, and in
community empowerment in water resource management and agricultural
production.

        Several of the measures proposed by the GoV to strengthen critical infrastructure
        and to build capacity for greater climate resilience are already part of the
        World Bank’s active portfolio. With the Bank’s financial and technical support
        to the GoV in implementing and adopting the identified measures, the country
        will be better prepared to sustain its growth in the face of increasing climate
        risks. The Bank has substantial experience in helping to build resilience of
        communities through sustainable development of agriculture and water
        resources, disaster risk management, and climate change adaptation. The
        Bank aims to support Vietnam’s recovery efforts, including its efforts to increase
        resilience by adopting longer-term vulnerability reduction measures.

        These challenges are not unique to Vietnam, and are being experienced by
        other developing countries as well. In view of this, this report is highly relevant
        and provides timely recommendations for both Vietnam and other countries
        in the fast-evolving climate change context.

    The drought and SWI may make it harder for Vietnam to meet its targets under
    the Socio-economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2016–2020. These targets include a
    gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5–7.0 percent a year, and a reduction
    in the share of poor households by an average of 1.0–1.5 percent a year. The impact
    of adverse climate conditions on the economy is already evident: in the first half of
    2016, GDP growth was recorded at 5.5 percent3, much lower than the 6.5 percent
    average growth in 2015. The World Bank lowered its 2016 growth projections to 6.2
    percent, down from earlier estimates of 6.5 percent. The average GDP growth was
    recorded at 6.2 percent for 2016,4 below the government’s 6.7 percent target.

    Like past floods and typhoons, the prolonged drought and SWI of 2015–2016 have
    hurt people’s livelihoods and assets, making it difficult for affected households
    to bounce back and recover. Although disasters do not discriminate, poor and
    near-poor households are often more exposed to and disproportionately affected by
    the impacts of disasters. Other disproportionately affected groups include women
    and girls, who are typically responsible for household water gathering, and ethnic
    minorities located in the drought-stricken provinces of the Central Highlands. Such
    impacts underscore the importance of efforts that target the most vulnerable and
    that promote inclusive planning and implementation at the local level.

    The serious socioeconomic and environmental effects of the 2015–2016 drought
    and SWI in Vietnam are due to both adverse climate conditions associated with
    El Niño and gaps in the capacity of the government and communities to manage
    the impact of those conditions. Although many good practices have been initiated
    in programs and policies across the country, the current situation shows that more
    investment is needed to meet the growing challenges arising from climate change
    and from increasing disaster risks.

Key Findings
Vietnam’s capacity to manage drought and SWI risks with timely warnings
linked to effective disaster preparedness, response, and recovery needs to be
strengthened. Institutional fragmentation across water supply, energy, and agriculture
sectors limits efficient and sustainable land and water resource management,
particularly at the river basin or watershed level. In addition, Vietnam’s disaster
risk management (DRM) and climate change adaptation (CCA) policies, plans, and
investments are fragmented. As a result, DRM and CCA are not consistently or
effectively integrated into socioeconomic development planning at national and
subnational levels or within sectors. Furthermore, given the absence of a systematic,
participatory, and inclusive approach to socioeconomic development planning, it is

    difficult for the country to ensure that resilience measures are appropriately planned
    and implemented at local level.

    Fragmented sectoral approaches and institutional arrangements are limiting
    Vietnam’s capacity to manage risks from drought and disasters more broadly.
    There are existing interministerial coordination bodies related to DRM, climate change,
    and water resource management;5 but their mandates overlap somewhat and also
    leave potential gaps in critical functions of integrated drought risk management.
    These gaps are reflected both horizontally (between ministries), and vertically
    (between central and subnational levels). Furthermore, many actions developed under
    the planning processes of these interministerial committees are not implemented
    because the bodies lack both the necessary authority and the necessary budgetary
    and financial resources.

    The country has plans to improve and better coordinate regulations, policies, and
    actions related to climate change, disaster risk, natural resources, environmental
    protection, and land use. The SEDP 2016–2020 recognizes that drought and SWI in
    particular require immediate attention. To accommodate both the broader and more
    specific agendas, Vietnam needs an integrated approach that not only addresses the
    recent crisis but also institutionalizes mechanisms to promote longer-term resilience and
    address the country’s vulnerabilities to drought, SWI, and other hydro-meteorological
    hazards.6 These efforts must also recognize that unplanned urban development,
    vulnerable rural livelihoods, inappropriate land use, and ecosystem degradation are
    key drivers of risk in Vietnam and compound the country’s vulnerability.

      Not investing in risk reduction today misses an opportunity for social, economic, and environmental
      progress that will have impacts for years to come. Potential solutions and opportunities for
      action sit at the nexus of these core development questions:
        •	 Although the average 2016 GDP growth of 6.2 percent represents a recovery from a lagging
           5.5 percent in the first half, it was still below the government’s target of 6.7 percent, and can
           partially be attributed to the agricultural losses due to the drought and SWI. How does the
           current rice production policy increase Vietnam’s risks for even greater losses in the future?
        •	 Vietnam could see losses of over 9 percent of GDP per capita in the case of a major
           disaster, and given that currently only about 5 percent of assets in the country are covered
           by insurance, is the government prepared to pay the outstanding bill?
        •	 Water is Vietnam’s most precious natural resource, but the per capita use of nearly 1,000 liters
           per year is about twice the global average. Without changing incentives for more sustainable
           water usage, how can the country manage the increasing risks of drought and water scarcity?
        •	 Climate hazards are a threat to vulnerable people across the world, with the power to push
           more than a million people back into poverty in the next 15 years. Given that farmers are
           especially likely to fall back into poverty, how many of these million people will be in Vietnam?

Next Steps: Developing an Action Plan
A phased approach is proposed to address urgent needs for drought and SWI
risks and longer-term resilience to all types of disaster risks across key sectors.
Vietnam needs to undertake strategic planning and coordinated implementation of
critical measures and recovery efforts to tackle the impacts of drought and SWI and
work toward greater climate resilience. Such an approach will raise awareness among
stakeholders in both the public and private sectors. One main goal is to ensure that
current and future development activities are sustainable and climate resilient. Such
planning must be backed by sound knowledge and scientific understanding in order
to target and prioritize investments in technology development and adoption, in
infrastructure, and in capacity building. The phased approach would include actions
for the short, medium, and long term:
  •	 In the short term, Vietnam must evaluate the multi-sector coordination and
     implementation challenges specifically related to drought and SWI.
  •	 In the medium term, it must empower the existing Central Committee for Natural
     Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC) to assist interministerial coordination
     and serve in an advisory role for integrated DRM.

    BOX O.1: Mexico’s National Program Against Drought

    In January 2013, in response to recurrent drought that had affected most parts of Mexico since
    2010, the country’s president announced the National Program Against Drought (PRONACOSE).
    Coordinated by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA), the program aims to develop tools
    for a new proactive and preventive approach for integrated drought management at the level
    of the 26 basin councils across the country. Its specific objectives can be summarized as follows:
     •	 Initiate a targeted training program on drought basic concepts and best practices in order
        to develop local capacity for sustainable integrated drought management in Mexico.
     •	 Raise awareness at the basin level and develop a host of drought prevention and mitigation
        measures.
     •	 Establish an interagency committee to coordinate and direct existing drought programs,
        guide and assess PRONACOSE, and fund the actions proposed by stakeholders at the
        basin level.
     •	 Involve experts and researchers in responding to the identified needs in drought management.
     •	 Develop a communication and outreach program that emphasizes vulnerability, participation,
        prevention, and the evolution of drought.

    Assessing implemented activities and ensuring sustainability through feedback in various phases
    are important elements of the framework of PRONACOSE, which is due to run till 2018. As a
    starting point in 2013, CONAGUA developed the Prevention and Mitigation Measures for Drought
    Programmes (PMPMS) for each basin council, building on global experiences. PMPMS addresses
    the drought characteristics and vulnerability of each basin. CONAGUA staff and researchers
    from 12 national institutions were trained to standardize the activities and contents of these
    programs, which were implemented in the second and third years (2014–2015). After evaluation
    of the implemented programs in 2016–2017, the programs are to be improved, updated, and
    implemented again from the sixth year (2018). A continued gradual implementation beyond
    the sixth year is expected through ownership of the programs by the basin councils.

          In the short term, Vietnam should evaluate the multi-sector coordination and
          implementation challenges specifically related to drought and SWI. The objective
          is to identify gaps in the policies, programs, and investments undertaken by MARD,
          the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE), and other relevant
          ministries. Based on the detailed evaluation, overall guidance could be provided to
          improve the effectiveness and coordination horizontally across sectors as well as

vertically at national, regional, and provincial levels. The CCNDPC should establish
a dedicated task force to identify measures that specifically address drought and
SWI. Selected global experiences from Mexico and Brazil show how drought
management has been integrated effectively into government policy, as highlighted
in boxes O.1 and O.2.




      BOX O.2: Transition to Proactive Drought Management Approaches in Brazil

      Northeast Brazil experienced a prolonged and severe drought between 2010 and 2014—the region’s
      worst drought crisis in 100 years. The event focused federal attention on drought management
      approaches, with authorities seeking to move away from ad hoc and reactive crisis response
      mechanisms toward a more proactive drought preparedness, planning, and management approach.

      There were considerable short- and long-term challenges that threatened to hamper the transition.
      For instance, the paucity of information available on the economic and social impacts of the
      drought made it difficult to draw up disaster preparedness plans. In addition, the responsibilities of
      different institutions for the various drought preparedness activities (e.g., vulnerability assessments,
      monitoring, and recovery) were ill-defined. To close these gaps, national and state dialogues were
      held with the aim of introducing an integrated National Drought Policy and highlighting specific
      priority areas for the institutions involved. Led by the Ministry of National Integration, these
      discussions resulted in the formalization of a National Drought Policy with three broad pillars:
        •	 Monitoring and forecasting/early warning activities
        •	 Vulnerability/resilience and impact assessments
        •	 Mitigation and response planning and measures

      The policy was piloted within regions most affected by the drought, and concrete adaptation
      plans were implemented at the regional and local levels. For example, in Northeast Brazil, an
      online drought monitor was launched, and tailored drought preparedness plans relevant to
      different environments were catalyzed and put in place—e.g., for river basins, urban water supply
      systems, and rural agricultural systems. Based on the forecasted severity of an upcoming drought
      and the affected geographical areas identified by the drought monitor, different preparedness
      activities are triggered.

Medium- and long-term actions are needed to strengthen the country’s path
toward institutionalizing resilience through integrated disaster risk management
and climate change adaptation approaches. In the medium term, an empowered
CCNDPC offers a new model for implementing integrated DRM, one that requires
multi-sector coordination. A national program should be integrated within the broader
DRM and CCA policy frameworks, and empowerment of the CCNDPC should be

            facilitated by enabling legislation to carry out coordination and advisory roles at the
            central and provincial levels.

            To sustain economic growth and build climate resilience, there must be a long-term
            commitment to integrated water resource management and land-use planning.
            Vietnam needs to implement comprehensive water-use policies that maximize efficiency
            between and within sectors and that are appropriate across the country at the river
            basin or watershed level. To optimize efficiency within sectors, policy interventions
            should encourage adoption of water-saving and soil moisture–retaining technologies.
            Through area-based planning, DRM, community engagement efforts, and other
            interventions, policy tools should facilitate the “waterproofing” of economies. Policies
            should seek to reduce the socioeconomic impacts of extreme weather events, rainfall
            variability, and uncertainty.

            The actions listed and discussed below take account of the impacts at national, eco-
            regional, and community levels and bring a multi-hazard perspective to bear on
            climate change impacts and extreme events.

1.	Balance investments in modernizing hydro-meteorological monitoring and
   forecast systems with processes to enable effective use of forecast and early
   warning for better disaster preparedness and response actions. Location-specific
   drought monitoring and seasonal forecasts are critical to improving the effectiveness
   of drought mitigation measures for agriculture. Timely and accurate information
   is critical for rural communities; there must be better operational guidelines for
   issuing warnings connected to a drought monitoring system. Translating weather
   and early warning information into different sets of user advisories will ensure more
   efficient use of information. It will also maximize benefits of favorable weather
   conditions and reduce the adverse impacts of hazardous weather events. Advisories
   that are linked to well-designed preparedness plans and response protocols are
   an essential element of proactive risk management.

2.	Devise a national financial protection strategy so that the government can
   better plan for the efficient financing of rapid response and recovery in the
   aftermath of disasters. A cost-effective financial protection strategy builds on
   an optimal combination of financial instruments that allows disaster losses to be
   absorbed. The mix of instruments could include contingency budgets, multi-year
   national and local disaster reserves, contingent credit, and risk transfer instruments
   such as insurance. International experience shows that if large-scale agricultural
   insurance is properly implemented as a public-private partnership, it can smooth
   agricultural income during droughts and other extreme weather events and thereby
   provide protection for vulnerable populations (see box O.3 for an example). It is
   also important to thoroughly review the policy, legal, and operational frameworks
   for the disaster reserve funds, as well as the funds’ actual operations, particularly
   in drought-hit provinces where existing funds were not used effectively.

3.	Use social assistance programs that provide livelihood support to help people
   recover from disasters. Regular social assistance programs like cash transfers
   and public work programs buffer individuals from shocks; they also equip them
   to improve their livelihoods and create opportunities to build a better life for
   themselves and their families. Some countries have successfully adapted these
   programs and their delivery systems to make them more responsive to disasters,
   and such solutions are also being considered in Vietnam. Under a pilot program
   currently being carried out in Can Tho City, the local social assistance delivery
   system is being strengthened and adapted so that in the event of flooding it can
   scale up operations and deliver assistance to flood-affected households.
   Institutionally, the role of Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA)
   and its social assistance portfolio and programs would need to be elevated within
   the overall national DRM framework. This would allow MoLISA to play a meaningful
   role in DRM, and by extension create an enabling environment for post-disaster

     BOX O.3: Public-Private Partnership in Agricultural Disaster Insurance in China

     China has implemented many policy measures to strengthen agriculture insurance. These
     include (i) providing a legal foundation for the management of agriculture insurance operations;
     (ii) providing premium subsidies for certain crops covered by insurance; and (iii) providing tax
     benefits for agriculture insurance operators. In addition, China is in the process of establishing
     a more mature catastrophe insurance framework. An agriculture insurance disaster risk reserve
     system has been established as protection against the risk of major agricultural disaster. Under
     this system, insurance companies set aside reserves at a defined ratio to the agriculture insurance
     premium and accrued underwriting profit, to gradually establish a mechanism for dealing with
     agricultural disaster shocks.

     To improve insurance coverage and compensation standards for large-scale farmers, agricultural
     disaster insurance will be piloted in a total of 200 major grain-producing counties in 2017–2018.
     These pilot counties mainly plant rice, wheat, and corn, and are located in 13 major grain-
     producing provinces, including the top three producers, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Shandong.
     As post-disaster reconstruction is mostly financed by the state, the disaster insurance system
     is designed to ease the government’s financial burdens.

     In 2016, about 26 insurance companies operating at the agricultural insurance market offered
     about 170 types of insurance products covering main crops, cash crops, livestock, forest, fruits,
     vegetables, medicinal herbs, and local agricultural products. In this successful public-private
     partnership model, from 2014 to 2016, the average agricultural insurance coverage amount
     accounted for 20 percent of agricultural output value. Moreover, 9.67 percent of direct economic
     loss of agricultural production was covered by the compensation amount of RMB 26.7 billion,
     which is seven times the amount of government relief funds.

            4.	Undertake a thorough analysis of risks and vulnerabilities. Different risks are
               faced by different sectors (agriculture, water management, and natural forests)
               and different regions (for example, the Mekong Delta and Central Highlands),
               and these differences have to be understood to properly tailor risk reduction.
               Vietnam has to shift focus from post-disaster crisis management to pre-disaster risk
               management for drought and SWI, just as it has done for other more frequent and
               rapid-onset disasters. Factors in different eco-regions that compound communities’
               vulnerability—for example, population density and rice monoculture practice—have
               to be taken into account. A more comprehensive nationwide risk and vulnerability

      BOX O.4: Examples of Ongoing Activities In Vietnam to Support Integrated DRM Across
      Sectors

      1. Adaptive Social Protection Feasibility Assessment for Tra Vinh Province in Mekong
      Delta: Since January 2016, more than 2 million people in 18 provinces in southern Vietnam
      have been affected by the El Niño–linked drought and saltwater intrusion crisis. The capacity
      of the government and communities to manage the impact of the adverse climate conditions
      was limited by fragmented sectoral approaches and institutional arrangements; as a result,
      there was no policy integration, and the serious socioeconomic and environmental effects of
      the crisis were exacerbated. Efforts are now under way to adapt social assistance programs
      to provide livelihood support to affected people to help them recover from climate disasters.
      For example, Tra Vinh—one of the 18 provinces to declare a state of emergency during the
      crisis—is now piloting the World Bank’s Social Assistance System Strengthening Project (SASSP).
      In collaboration with MoLISA and the Tra Vinh Department of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs
      (DoLISA), the World Bank is currently assessing the feasibility of developing adaptive social
      protection (ASP) in Tra Vinh. Building upon and leveraging the work already undertaken on
      flooding (a rapid-onset disaster) in neighboring Can Tho City, the Tra Vinh engagement focuses on
      both flooding and drought (slow-onset disaster). The objective is to better prepare the provinces
      to manage household disaster risk. Specifically, it is intended to help to integrate MoLISA and
      social assistance into ASP and move Vietnam toward more integrated DRM.

      2. Water Balance Assessment in Ninh Thuan Province in South Central Vietnam: To improve
      the institutional framework and technical capabilities for better drought preparedness in Ninh
      Thuan Province, and to assess gaps in and opportunities for water resources management, a
      preliminary assessment of water resources availability was conducted in the Dinh River basin in
      2015–2016. In view of DARD’s (Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s) 2020–2030
      Agriculture Development Plan (pending the government of Vietnam’s approval) for new reservoir
      construction in the province, new water supply alternatives have to be identified to make Ninh
      Thuan’s water supply systems more resilient to extreme weather conditions. In October 2016, the
      Water Partnership Program (WPP) approved a work plan to enhance drought/climate resilience
      with full technical support from government counterparts acting at national and provincial levels,
      including NAWAPI (National Center for Water Resources Planning and Investigation). The program
      has undertaken water system analysis in the entire Dinh River basin. It addresses water use across
      sectors (hydropower, irrigation, urban/rural water supply, and aquaculture) and covers both surface
      water and groundwater sources. Keeping environmental constraints and minimum supply cost in
      mind, the ultimate objectives are to determine the optimal size of reservoirs (present and future)
      and the optimal level of groundwater extractions to meet current and future demands.

      3. Supporting Sustainable Coffee Production and Rejuvenation in Central Highlands: Climate
      change–induced higher temperatures and frequent dry spells have significantly affected coffee
      yields in the Central Highlands. To facilitate a sustainable transformation in coffee production that
      would increase farmers’ income while reducing negative environmental impacts, a component of
      the Vietnam Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project (VnSAT) is under way. A total of 62,000


                                                                                               box continues next page

     small-scale coffee plantations were selected in five target provinces in the Central Highlands
     to promote good farm management practices, increase adoption of water-saving technologies
     and tree management, and train farmer organizations and cooperatives. The objective is to
     integrate DRM into all these activities while helping provinces to improve coffee production.
     In 2016, VnSAT provided training on “three reductions, three gains” (3R3G) and “one must,
     five reductions” (1M5R) cultivation techniques. 3R3G refers to reduction in three inputs (seed,
     chemicals, and water) and gains in three outputs (productivity, quality, and economic efficiency).
     1M5R refers to use of registered seeds and reductions in five inputs—seed, chemical fertilizer,
     pesticide, water use, and post-harvest losses. In May 2017, an assessment of coffee planters
     who had received training revealed that Dak Lak and Lam Dong Provinces achieved positive
     results in general, though some criteria were not met.
     Note: The three examples above are the most recent activities supported by GFDRR (Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
     and Recovery) to strengthen and integrate DRM into ongoing larger World Bank–supported projects.




                analysis, carried out at commune level (as mandated under the government’s
                community-based DRM program) will identify the priorities and provide solutions
                for a more efficient last-mile delivery of support for risk reduction and adaptation.

            5.	In deltas, river basins, and other ecosystems, work to coordinate integrated
               water resources management and appropriate land use across the water,
               energy, and agriculture sectors. The interlinked impacts of development from
               various sectors, and the efficacy of different investments in the face of climate
               change and dynamic upstream development, remain poorly understood in these
               highly complex environments. More generally, a sustainable urban and rural water
               supply will require province- and basin-wide integrated planning in addition to
               new technical and institutional solutions, given that groundwater and surface
               water are two major and separate water sources. Local communities affected by
               water insecurity need to become more involved in decision making about water
               management, and provinces should develop their own integrated water resource
               management plans. Example 2 in box O.4 describes a project to assess water
               balance in the Dinh River basin in Ninh Thuan Province in South Central Vietnam.

            6.	Climate-smart agriculture practices should be more widely adopted. Climate-
               smart agriculture (CSA) leverages good agricultural practice (GAP) and integrates the
               three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental)
               by jointly addressing food security and climate challenges. While rice remains
               Vietnam’s dominant food staple, its importance in the national economy and diet
               is declining; policy makers should therefore consider forward-looking approaches
               to enable flexible land-use planning based on agro-ecological suitability, likely
               climate change impact, and risks and profitability to the producers. Existing policies


                                           T O W A R D I N T E G R AT E D D I S A S T E R R I S K M A N A G E M E N T I N V I E T N A M
OV E R V I E W                                                                                  13




     and incentives that encourage rice production in marginal areas need revisiting.
     To reduce the risk that climate change poses to agriculture, it is also important
     to identify the exposure, sensitivity, and vulnerability of different eco-regions and
     take appropriate measures to meet their specific needs. Various short-, medium-,
     and long-term solutions for increasing the adaptive capacities and resilience of
     communities are available, revolving around early warning and climate information
     services, “designer” crop varieties, adjustments to cropping calendars and intensities,
     proper natural resource management (water, soils, forests, aquaculture), diversification
     (rice-shrimp; salt- and drought-tolerant fruit trees; grass/fodder and vegetable
     intercropping; multi-species fish culture; livestock), and improved information and
     knowledge dissemination. Investment in research and development and continuous
     technology generation are important with effective information dissemination.
     Example 3 in box O.4 describes an ongoing activity under the Vietnam Sustainable
     Agriculture Transformation Project (VnSAT) to promote sustainable agriculture by
     helping small-scale coffee farmers in the Central Highlands to increase income
     while reducing negative environmental impacts. Box O.5 gives an example of
     how farmers in Thailand benefited from the government’s policy to restrict winter
     dry-season rice cultivation as an emergency response to climate disaster.

7.	Use community-based approaches—including investments, capacity building,
   and planning activities—to promote the implementation of resilience measures.
   Community-based approaches enable genuine participation in decision making
   across all sectors and can be implemented as stand-alone projects or as part of
   larger-scale investment programs. Experience shows that mainstreaming DRM and
   CCA in socioeconomic development plans needs to happen first in communes,
   where budgets are small but risk and vulnerability reduction can be achieved.
   Several international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have supported
   local planning in communes and at higher administrative levels.7 This approach
   has proved successful when carried out as part of community-based projects in
   provinces with high levels of poverty, significant climate-related vulnerabilities,
   and limited financial and human resources. Given that the drought-stricken areas
   involve many micro-climate zones, the planning of recovery investments should
   involve the participation of stakeholders at the commune level. In this way solutions
   can be tailored to specific circumstances.

8.	Identify vulnerable populations and communities that are at most risk to
   climate change and support communities by empowering individuals. Livelihoods
   can be improved by providing timely information and adequate training about
   good agricultural practices and opportunities available for risk reduction and
   mitigation. Communities can also be empowered through building farmers’ groups,

     BOX O.5: Restricting Rice Production and Sales as Emergency Response in Thailand

     Thailand’s rice harvest dipped to its lowest in nine years in 2016 due to El Niño–caused water
     shortages. The following measures were taken to manage the water crisis:
      •	 A shift from rice to corn production: The government worked with private associations,
         including the Thai Feed Mills Association, the Thai Seed Trade Association, and the Bank for
         Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), to encourage farmers in irrigated areas
         to shift from marketing year (MY) 2016/17 off-season rice production to corn production.
         Close to 0.3 million hectares (ha) of farmland located in the northern and northeastern
         regions was targeted to reduce off-season rice supply by 1.25 million metric tons (MT) and
         increase corn production by 1.4 million MT. Participating farmers are eligible for a loan of
         B 4, 000 per rai (US$714 per ha) from the BAAC.
      •	 Stabilization of domestic rice prices: In November 2016, the cabinet approved the On-Farm
         Rice Pledging Program for fragrant and glutinous rice (for farmers) and the Interest-Rate
         Subsidy Program (for millers/traders) with the aim of keeping about half the newly harvested
         fragrant and white rice off the market in order to stabilize domestic prices. Participating
         farmers receive a direct payment of B 13,000 per MT of pledged fragrant rice (US$371 per
         MT). Nonparticipating farmers receive a direct payment of B 2,000 per MT (US$57 per MT).

     The restriction on winter dry-season rice cultivation was lifted following abundant rainfall in
     early 2017, which replenished major reservoirs supplying the agriculture sector and resulted in
     a remarkable recovery in rice crop acreage (estimated increase of 975,000 ha) and vegetative
     vigor compared to 2016.

                 improving gender and overall equality (by involving women and youth in local
                 development), encouraging good governance, and promoting cooperation from
                 government agencies. Such inclusive approaches also help vulnerable groups and
                 individuals to understand their rights, responsibilities, and entitlements. For
                 example, a dynamic partnership between the government, an international NGO,
                 and local communities enabled farmers in Thanh Hoa Province in the North Central
                 Coast region of Vietnam to successfully form the Water User Cooperative (WUC)
                 to manage their water resources.8 Set up by the Cam Phu Commune as part of
                 the Thai Long Dam Project, the WUC mobilized local farmers to actively participate
                 and manage the local resources in a sustainable manner, leading to increased
                 government responsiveness and accountability. The farmers were fully involved
                 in decision making regarding water distribution plans and schedules, and in
                 resolving conflicts. The WUC benefited people at multiple levels—for example,
                 by promoting better access to irrigation and drinking water through controlled

    water supply. This, in turn, reduced the work load of men, women, and children,
    as farm activities became easier and collection of water for domestic use became
    less time-consuming. Farmers gained better incomes due to increased crop yields,
    crop diversification, and livestock and fish farming. For an example of a comprehensive
    development project in China, see box O.6.



      BOX O.6: Helping Chinese Farmers Adapt to Climate Change Through Comprehensive
      Agricultural Development (CAD)

      Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Loan Project III (IAIL3) in China was a large-scale initiative
      under Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) implemented by the State Office of
      Comprehensive Agricultural Development (SOCAD) within the Ministry of Finance. Activities
      under CAD are funded by the central government of China to support agricultural and ecological
      development, strengthen agricultural infrastructure, ensure national food security, advance
      agro-processing production, and increase farmers’ income. Building on the success of IAIL1
      and IAIL2, and partly financed through a World Bank loan, IAIL3 aimed to enhance adaptation
      of agriculture and water management practices by increasing awareness about climate change
      and through capacity building. It was implemented from 2005 to 2010 in five provinces—Hebei,
      Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan—in the 3H Plain of the Yellow, Huaihe, and Haihe River
      basins. The 3H Plain is the major agricultural zone in China. SOCAD incorporated climate change
      adaptation actions into IAIL3 with additional funding by the Global Environmental Facility
      (GEF) through the Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture project.
      Engineering, agronomic, and management measures were taken to promote water saving,
      increase agricultural yield, and secure farmers’ livelihood, as summarized below:
        •	 Yield improvement. Farmers’ income was increased by the use of early maturing and
           drought- and pest-resistant varieties of wheat to improve yields. Greenhouses were built
           through the project to encourage farmers to grow off-season vegetables, thus increasing
           their income.
        •	 Infrastructure improvement. Water-stopping walls and sluices were introduced as an
           adaptive water-saving measure. The walls help maintain the water table in addition to
           containing discharge of harmful chemicals into water bodies, and the sluices enable storage
           of irrigation water.
        •	 Education and outreach. Expert teams organized farmer training to raise awareness of and
           build capacity for climate change adaptation. Experts from China Agriculture University
           and the Home of Rural Women, a nonprofit organization, delivered targeted training to
           women, particularly addressing their active role in the project and adaptation activities.
        •	 Farmers’ participation. To encourage active participation of farmers, specifically women,
           water user associations (WUAs) and specialized agricultural associations were promoted.
           To encourage farmers to take ownership of managing and maintaining the facilities and
           adaptation methods, irrigation facilities were constructed and handed over to WUAs.

     Recommended Actions
     A holistic and integrated approach that includes both structural and nonstructural
     measures is proposed to address impacts of drought and SWI and to promote
     longer-term resilience measures across key sectors. Tackling the impacts of all
     types of disaster risks nationally will require well thought-out strategic planning and
     coordinated implementation of medium- and long-term measures from a multi-hazard
     perspective. Such planning must be backed by sound local knowledge, scientific
     understanding (for targeting and prioritizing investments for technology development
     and adoption), infrastructure creation, and capacity building. To effectively address
     the drought and SWI, an integrated approach using both structural and nonstructural
     interventions (policies, capacity building, information, technologies, infrastructure,
     and services) is needed.

     Table O.2 provides options drawn from global good practices as well as from Vietnam’s
     experience with the 2015–2016 drought and SWI. To develop location-specific action
     plans (short and longer term) for different geographic areas based on their vulnerability
     to external shocks (such as extreme weather) and socioeconomic characteristics, these
     preliminary recommendations should be further prioritized and refined.

     Some recommendations are grouped together in the table below, but they can be
     further expanded as necessary. Actions that are needed in the immediate or short
     term (less than two years) are given under the “short term” time frame. Those that
     require a longer implementation period (more than two years) are addressed under
     the “medium/long term” time frame. In the table, the time frames are indicated by
     green bars. When action begins in the short term and continues over a longer term,
     the green bar spans both time frames.

Support from the World Bank
The World Bank can offer both financial and technical assistance to support
the government of Vietnam (GoV) in implementing resilient development
investments. Drawing on lessons from global good practices and from tested and
proven measures in Vietnam, as well as on country-specific knowledge from an active
and long-standing investment portfolio, the Bank has developed priority actions
for the short, medium, and long term. Using proven global practices and involving
stakeholders at all levels will encourage adoption of the identified measures and
thus help to build resilience to drought and SWI.

The World Bank’s development assistance objectives fit into the longer-term
recovery time frame. The emergency response plan prepared by the United Nations
and the GoV provided both a summary of recommended actions for the humanitarian
phase (three to five months) and recommendations for longer-term recovery. An initial
review of the Bank’s active portfolio focused on several of the actions listed in the
emergency response plan’s recovery table, including measures to strengthen priority
infrastructure and to build capacity for greater climate resilience in the government
and among local communities. Considering that a portion of recovery could be
supported by reprogramming from existing development allocations, there is also an
urgent need to transform risk management over the longer term so that the normal
flow of development interventions is not jeopardized. Efforts that build on or address
gaps in the country’s ongoing programs to promote resilience will have immediate
and substantial benefits for future economic growth.

Introduction




Drought, saltwater intrusion (SWI), and other natural hazards such as floods and
tropical cyclones are perennial issues in Vietnam, bringing damages at the local,
regional, and national levels that hinder economic performance and achievement
of development goals. Communities suffer from the loss of assets, livelihoods, and
labor force; all too often the most vulnerable are locked into endemic poverty cycles.
Indeed, the threats facing the country are growing with each passing year, as climate
change leads to disasters that are more frequent and severe.

The underlying causes of vulnerabilities must be addressed to strengthen resilience
to future disasters. The real challenge is to achieve institutional paradigm shifts
toward climate resilience rather than implement one-time initiatives focusing on limited
regions or short-term projects. The World Bank’s approach to recovery in Vietnam is
to ensure that current and future development activities accelerate efforts to build
resilience. Considering that reprogramming from existing development allocations
will support a portion of recovery, only a longer-term transformation of how Vietnam
manages disaster risk will ensure that normal development is not jeopardized.

The World Bank has substantial experience working to develop the resilience
of communities in drought-affected areas. The many projects carried out in other
countries in sustainable development of agriculture, water resources, disaster risk
management (DRM), and climate change adaptation (CCA) hold important lessons
on how to plan recovery and shape future drought resilience programming. Going
forward, the World Bank aims to support Vietnam’s further recovery through increased
resilience—effectively pairing the programming of immediate recovery interventions
with longer-term vulnerability reduction measures.

Context in Vietnam




Vietnam is a remarkable success story of rapid growth, poverty reduction, and
shared prosperity. Since the launch of the Đổi Mới reforms in the late 1980s, Vietnam
has sustained rapid economic growth, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth
averaging 5.5 percent annually. Real per capita GDP more than tripled between
1990 and 2014, lifting more than 40 million people out of poverty. Vietnam has great
potential to reach further milestones in poverty reduction, shared prosperity, and
sustainability—but it currently faces a new set of challenges. Its growth model is
threatened by adverse impacts of pollution, climate change, and rapid degradation
of natural resources and environmental assets. Meeting this threat will require
transforming several sectors, including agriculture, energy, fisheries, forestry, and
infrastructure, and reducing the exposure of urban and rural areas to rapid- and
slow-onset climate hazards.9



2.1	 Socioeconomic Context
The agricultural sector remains at the core of Vietnam’s economy and contributes
more than 18 percent of GDP.10 Since the 1990s, steady advances in smallholder
rice productivity, along with intensification and cultivation of high-value crops, have
played a central role in Vietnam’s successes in poverty reduction, national food
security, and social stability. Aggregate land productivity—measured as value added
per hectare (ha) of agricultural land—increased rapidly in the 1990s and is now higher
than in all regional peer countries with the exception of Malaysia. Use of high-yield
rice strains and other inputs, along with construction of a dike network, has allowed
cultivation of up to three rice crops a year and enabled Vietnam to increase rice yields
fourfold since the 1970s.11 The growth of aquaculture, both intensive and extensive,
is rather ad hoc and often plagued by shrimp disease and pollution. Coastal forests

     and mangroves have been degraded in several sections of the coastline, resulting
     in more severe coastal erosion, which further aggravates SWI.

     While water resources in Vietnam remain plentiful, there are increasing concerns
     about the sustainability of the water supply from river basins and groundwater.
     In recent years, upstream damming and reservoir construction in neighboring
     countries have decreased this water supply significantly. In-country water resources
     account for only about 37 percent of the total water volume. These resources are
     concentrated mostly in the Red River and Mekong River Deltas and in the Central
     Highlands. Apart from the quantity of water, the quality of surface water is also
     significantly declining, with increased pollution and salinity. Municipal water supply
     companies, households, and farmers all rely on extracted groundwater. In several
     areas, groundwater extraction is well above the rate of recharge of groundwater
     aquifers and causes low-lying areas—including the Mekong Delta—to subside at
     rates faster than projected sea-level rise.12

     The Socio-economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2016–2020 proposes that climate
     change response, disaster prevention, resource management, and environmental
     protection be mainstreamed into development planning at all levels. Further,
     the SEDP includes plans to improve and better coordinate regulations, policies, and
     actions for managing climate change, disaster risk, natural resources, environmental
     protection, and land use. Matters that require immediate attention include medium-
     and long-term recovery from the drought in the Central Highlands and the South
     Central regions, to prevent SWI and retain freshwater. The SEDP 2016–2020 includes
     two major targets: a GDP growth rate of 6.5–7.0 percent a year, and a reduction in
     the ratio of poor households by an average of 1.0–1.5 percent a year. The 2015–2016
     drought and SWI have jeopardized the achievement of the targets for many provinces,
     and perhaps the whole country, and may have consequences in the future, as well.
     The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) had warned that drought-induced
     damage to agricultural output could drag growth down to 5.45 percent for 2016.
     Even though the GDP grew at a rate of 6.2 percent in 2016, it was still below the 6.7
     percent target for the year.

     Hydro-meteorological hazards have a disproportionate impact on the poor and
     vulnerable, whose access to assets, resources, and services is limited. Poverty
     also contributes to the impacts of such hazards by increasing people’s vulnerability
     and reducing their capacity to respond to and cope with hazards. Given the country’s
     increasing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and its persistent challenges
     in reducing poverty and ensuring sustainable development, the poverty-disaster
     nexus is important for Vietnam.

2.2	 Natural Hazards Overview
Vietnam is one of the most hazard-prone countries in the East Asia and Pacific
region, with frequent storms and flooding responsible for substantial economic
and human losses. Over the past 20 years, disaster events in Vietnam have caused
more than 13,000 deaths and property damage in excess of US$6.4 billion.13 Almost
60 percent of Vietnam’s land area and over 70 percent of its population are at risk of
multiple natural hazards, including typhoons, floods, droughts, SWI, landslides, forest
fires, and occasional earthquakes.14 Table 2.1 presents a region-specific overview of
natural hazard exposure, and shows that drought and SWI represent distinct levels
of hazard for the Mekong Delta, South Central Coast, and Central Highlands.

The results of a financial risk assessment show that Vietnam faces an Annual Expected
Loss (AEL) of US$786.4 million, or the equivalent of 0.8 percent of GDP (2010 values).15
Damages from floods represent the highest risk in the country, followed by storms and
droughts, as shown in figure 2.1. Climate change is projected to increase the impact
of disasters, especially the frequency, severity, and intensity of hydro-meteorological
events.16

     2.3	 Climate Change Projections
     Projections show that Vietnam could be significantly affected by climate change.
     Vietnam ranked seventh among countries most affected by extreme weather events
     between 1995 and 2014.17 A 2007 World Bank report lists Vietnam among the five
     countries likely to be most affected by climate change, in large part due to its location
     and the economy’s dependence on sectors such as agriculture. According to the
     report, a 1 m rise in sea level would partially inundate one commune out of five—or
     5 percent of the national land area, 11 percent of the population, and 7 percent of
     agricultural land—unless appropriate measures are taken to prevent it.18

     Climate predictions for 2040 show changes that would significantly affect coastal
     lowlands and low-lying deltas—regions where population and economic assets
     are concentrated. These changes include intensified heat and cold waves and 28–33
     cm sea-level increases (compared to 1980–1999). Temperature increases in Vietnam
     have averaged about 0.26°C per decade since 1971 (twice the global average), and
     the number of heat waves has also increased nationally (figure 2.2). In addition, a
     southward shift has been observed in the typhoon trajectory in the past five decades,
     a trend that could intensify storm risks in an area already significantly exposed to
     other growing disaster risks, such as coastal erosion and salinity intrusion.

Seasonal variability in precipitation and higher temperatures pose increasing
drought risk in many provinces. Seasonal variability in precipitation is projected
to increase in Vietnam, and higher temperatures will result in more heat waves, with
the wet season getting wetter and the dry season drier. Due to higher interannual
rainfall variability, many provinces—especially in the South Central Coast region—face
a higher risk of drought.19

The country’s exposure and vulnerability to climate change require a well-informed
approach that accounts for the demographics, socioeconomic context, political
dimensions, and biophysical landscape in allocating resources and coordinating
land use and resource planning. A climate-resilient approach to development is
needed to reduce the country’s vulnerability. The government of Vietnam (GoV) has

     a good understanding of climate-driven risks (both extreme and chronic events) in
     the medium term (5–10 years) and long term (35–40 years), and it is making efforts to
     increase resilience, especially in extremely vulnerable areas such as the Mekong River
     Delta. The 2011 National Climate Change Strategy emphasizes proactively coping
     with natural hazards, monitoring climate, adopting measures to adapt to climate-
     induced events, enhancing coping capacity, and investing in advanced science and
     technology to manage climate change.20

     The impact of severe drought and SWI in the Mekong Delta and Central Highlands
     has compounded Vietnam’s vulnerability to climate change. Due to its location
     and dependence on agriculture, Vietnam faces a high risk of multiple natural hazards,
     with over 60 percent of its land area under threat—a threat that is exacerbated by
     climate change. Vulnerability to climate change reflects a system’s susceptibility to
     adverse effects.21 Thus the key to reducing Vietnam’s vulnerability lies in limiting
     adverse impacts and increasing adaptive capacity (figure 2.3). To identify priorities
     and solutions, a comprehensive nationwide vulnerability analysis should be carried
     out as soon as possible at the district and commune levels.

The impact of climate change in Vietnam (as in all countries) is directly related to
exposure, which is a function of geography, and to sensitivity, which is a response
to climate-related stimuli. Compared to the 1980–1999 baselines, Vietnam is predicted
to be exposed to more severe heat and cold and higher sea levels by 2040. Hotter
temperatures are already being experienced (figure 2.2), and the Mekong Delta, South
Central Coast, and Central Highland regions are now exposed to severe drought and
SWI (table 2.1). Vietnam’s sensitivity—defined by demographic and environmental
conditions—lies in the seasonal variability of its precipitation and its higher-than-
normal temperatures. Indirectly, freshwater deficit due to low rainfall resulted in SWI
in the South Central Coast and Mekong Delta regions. Together, hotter temperatures
and low rainfall, and the resulting drought and SWI, have tested Vietnam’s adaptive
capacity—and have revealed the country’s adaptation deficit.

Background of the 2015–2016 Drought
and Saltwater Intrusion




At the end of 2015, warmer-than-average temperatures and prolonged periods without
rainfall attributed to El Niño caused the strongest and longest drought in Vietnam in
90 years.22 The situation was worsened by SWI in the South Central Coast and Mekong
Delta regions, the result of decreased freshwater from rainfall, reduced upstream
river flows, and falling groundwater levels. Because affected provinces were located
in regions that usually produce key agricultural exports and food crops (rice, coffee,
pepper, fruit, and aquaculture products), the drought has proved especially harmful.
Table 3.1 gives an overview of the impact in the 18 severely affected provinces.



3.1	        Overview of Impacts and Key Affected Regions

3.1.1 Drought and Saltwater Situation Snapshot


      •	 Twenty-two out of 63 provinces (35 percent of the country) were affected by the
         2015–2016 drought and associated SWI (figure 3.1). Eighteen provinces were severely
         affected, including 14 that declared a state of emergency.
      •	 Financial support from the central government was requested by all affected provinces
         across the Mekong Delta, South Central, and Central Highlands regions.
      •	 More than 2 million people had insufficient access to drinking water during the peak
         of the drought (February–May 2016). The cost of purchased water in some affected areas
         increased more than tenfold, beyond the reach of poor households. As a result, water-related
         diseases and cases of severe acute malnutrition also increased.


                                                                                                            box continues next page




22	   At the end of June 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Resources Directorate had officially
declared the drought at an end in the Mekong Delta, Central Highlands, and Southeast regions. The drought continued
in South Central Vietnam until September 2016.

     •	 More than 1.1 million people living in drought-affected areas needed food assistance
        (including 83,835 children and 120,000 pregnant and lactating women who were undernourished).
     •	 Crop damage in drought-affected districts varied from 60 to 90 percent of planted crops.
     •	 Two million people were affected due to damaged livelihoods, lost assets, and disruption
        of basic services.

The drought, SWI, and their compounding impacts threatened national agricultural
production; a total of 659,476 ha of crops were damaged or lost, 24 with over 50
percent of the affected rice classified as extremely damaged or completely lost.25
Most affected households did not generate significant income during the drought
period because the damaged fields produced drastically lower rice yields. Besides,
many households were already in debt due to previous crop losses and did not have
sufficient resources to stabilize their livelihoods by restoring farmland or aquaculture
plots. The drought also impacted livestock.

The 2015–2016 drought and SWI affected Vietnam’s national rice production
targets and limited its ability to export rice. For example, direct economic damages
and losses to the 18 most-affected provinces were estimated at VND 15,032 billion
(about US$674 million; table 3.1), representing 0.35 percent of national GDP and
resulting in negative agricultural growth for the first time in decades.26 The Department
of Crop Production estimated a cost of approximately VND 34 trillion (US$1.5 billion)
to address the damages caused by drought and SWI.27 Vietnam’s rice exports fell
about 23 percent, to below 5 million tons—an eight-year low.28 The average rice
export price in April 2016 was around US$408 per ton, down about 5 percent per
ton from a year earlier. Similarly, drought effects (and lower yields from old trees)

               The drought and SWI had significant adverse economic repercussions for Vietnam’s
               agricultural output and exports. The MPI had warned that drought-induced damage
               to agricultural output could drag growth down to 5.45 percent for 2016. Although other
               sectors contributed to a growth of 6.2 percent, it was still below the 6.7 percent target
               for 2016. At a subnational level, provinces across affected regions lost on average
               2.17 percent of their GDP due to the drought and SWI (with likely underreporting).
               Provinces with particularly high economic losses (based on CCNDPC reporting) were

Mekong Delta Region

During the 2015–2016 drought, affected provinces in the Mekong Delta region
were impacted by the most extensive SWI in 90 years (figure 3.1). Saltwater
intrusion is usually a cyclical, natural phenomenon in the Mekong Delta. But in 2016,
SWI started two months earlier, extended inland an average of 50–60 km further, and
contaminated land about 20–30 km further inland than is typical (figure 3.3).

By the end of April 2016, SWI had affected approximately 40–50 percent of
arable land in the Mekong Delta, an area that provides more than half the country’s
rice, 70 percent of its fruit exports, and 60 percent of its fishery exports.32 As a result
of SWI, the rice cultivation area in this region declined by 16.7 percent between
mid-March 2015 and mid-March 2016.33 The most impacted province was Ca Mau,
with more than 49,000 ha of paddy crops affected. The respective figures for Kien
Giang and Ben Tre are 34,000 ha and 13,844 ha.34

of the 13 provinces in the Mekong
Delta were seriously impacted by SWI,
with the highest salinization increases
recorded at the Ben Tre and Tien Giang
stations. Provinces in the Mekong Delta
experienced delayed summer-autumn
crops, which put the cultivation of an
additional 500,000 ha of rice paddy—
representing over 30 percent of the
agricultural land in the region—at risk.

     coastal erosion during the dry season, which resulted in even further SWI in southern
     areas.

     Central Highlands and South Central Regions

     In the Central Highlands and South Central regions, the drought impacted nearly
     70 percent of cultivated area.35 Local authorities estimated that about 40,000 ha
     of paddy rice in three South Central provinces (Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Binh
     Thuan) were unirrigated (figure 3.4), and almost 31,000 households lacked access to
     safe water to meet daily needs. Estimates for the Central Highlands indicated that
     in Dak Lak, Lam Dong, Dak Nong, and Kon Tum about 150,000 ha of agricultural
     lands (in addition to 10,000 ha used for coffee cultivation) remained unirrigated.
     According to estimates, coffee and cocoa exports along with pepper production fell
     by 25 percent.36 Cashew production fell by 11 percent.37

3.2	 Response to 2015–2016 Drought and SWI Crisis by
the Government of Vietnam
By April 2016, the GoV had distributed 9,936 tons of relief food to the three
drought-affected regions (Mekong Delta, South Central Coast, and Central Highlands),
trucked in 2 million m3 of water, and provided 630,000 doses of Chloramine B and
400,000 Aquatabs for water-insecure households. In April 2016, the GoV and United
Nations (UN) launched an emergency response plan to address immediate lifesaving
and livelihood-protection interventions for the next three to five months and to identify
longer-term actions for resilience.38 The GoV had also provided around VND 1 trillion
(US$45 million) for drought relief nationally, including water-related services and
food and cash support to affected households across 18 provinces since late 2015.

Provinces’ immediate needs were identified as seedling and crop recovery,
water storage, and provision of water supplies, including those for filtering
and treating salinized water. Provinces tried to respond to the impacts of drought
and SWI, notably by rescheduling winter-spring crop planting; applying integrated
reservoir and irrigation management for agricultural production; promoting water-
saving irrigation and farming techniques; establishing temporary dams, pumps, and
drainage to increase water storage; and using public water filters. They also proposed
other urgent investments in water resources and salinity management to address the
drought and SWI in the medium and long term, including embankments, pumping
and drainage stations, and upgrades of the sluice gate system.

On March 15, 2016, the GoV requested support from the international community
for its relief efforts, with priority given to ensuring water supply, storage, and
treatment in drought-affected areas; food security and nutritional support; and
increased monitoring of potential outbreaks of disease. On April 26, 2016, the GoV
and the UN launched an appeal to the international community to support the US$48.5
million emergency response plan,39 which included a summary of recommended
actions for the humanitarian phase (three to five months) and initial recommendations
for recovery over the next two years. The plan also identified the following strategic
goals and mainstreaming priorities for the resilience and recovery component:

1.	Ensure that the most vulnerable have sustainable access to clean water for human
   consumption and domestic use and are able to ensure their food security and
   rebuild their livelihoods; enhance health and nutrition monitoring for children,
   pregnant and lactating women, and other vulnerable groups.

     2.	Promote investment in sustainable water and sanitation infrastructure and systems
        that can increase resilience to future extreme climate events such as droughts
        and floods.

     3.	Strengthen community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) planning
        within communes, and strengthen national information management, assessment
        mechanisms, and the monitoring of drought and its impacts, including identification
        and targeting of the most vulnerable.



     3.3	 Focus on Medium- and Longer-Term Preparedness
     and Resilience Building
     The country must build on its ongoing programs to promote resilience and must
     also address substantial gaps and challenges. It is important to focus on medium and
     longer-term preparedness and resilience building. A continuation of the emergency
     response plan—referred to as the Drought Recovery Plan—was announced by the
     GoV and UN on October 24, 2016.40 This plan estimated a recovery need of US$368
     million in 2017 and US$687 million for 2018–2020. It found that water levels in the
     Mekong were still below average, though heavy rains had contributed to rising levels.
     Drought and SWI continued in the Central Highlands and Mekong Delta but were
     less severe than in 2015. The drought affected 2 million people (including 1 million
     females and 0.52 million children) and impacted agriculture (nearly 660,000 ha of
     rice, fruit, pepper and coffee), aquaculture (over 69,000 ha), and livestock (caused
     the deaths of over 8,300 animals).

     The Drought Recovery Plan released by the GoV and the UN is a targeted four-
     year plan that seeks to (i) enable good governance by strengthening government
     ownership and capacity, elevating transparency and accountability, and enhancing
     monitoring and evaluation; and (ii) address social issues (like gender equality and
     rights of the most vulnerable) and cross-sectoral investments (like improving and
     maintaining the ecosystem).

     The development assistance objectives of the World Bank fit into the medium-
     and longer-term recovery time frame (see appendix for more details). An initial
     review of the World Bank’s active portfolio focused on several of the actions listed in
     the emergency response plan recovery table, including strengthening measures for
     priority infrastructure and capacity building of government and local communities
     for greater climate resilience. Although most activities and investments within the

CHAPTER 4

Highlighting Key Challenges in Vietnam




This section provides an overview of the critical issues that exacerbate the effects of
drought and SWI. As part of its efforts to strengthen a proactive approach to multi-
hazard DRM, the GoV will need to address existing limitations in drought and SWI
preparedness, response, and recovery. It will have to confront a number of issues—for
example, unsustainable water and land resource management—that could increase
risks from climate hazards and even hinder basic development progress. In the face
of climate change, shortcomings that drive climate vulnerability in agriculture and
livelihood sectors should be seen as a growing liability for the country if unaddressed.



4.1	        Institutional and Legal Issues
The government of Vietnam faces significant institutional and legal challenges
in addressing drought and SWI risk. Many critical functions for managing drought
and other natural hazards fall across different institutions responsible for managing
forests, agriculture, and water and land use. The Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MoNRE) is responsible for hydro-meteorological monitoring and
forecasting and water resource management more broadly, including quantity and
quality of water, and land-use planning. On the other hand, the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development (MARD) leads on disaster prevention and control and on
water and land-use plans for agriculture and rural development. This fragmentation
and overlapping in the institutional setup are duplicated at provincial and city levels.
Equally important, overlapping sectoral policies and legal frameworks often lead to
confusion in implementation at all levels.41

Although Vietnam’s existing legal framework for DRM provides basic guidance
on responding to a range of natural hazards, it does not adequately address
slow-onset hazards such as drought and SWI. Most of the policies and legal

41	   These frameworks include the Water Resources Management Law (2012), the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention
and Control (2014), the Irrigation Law (being prepared), the Hydro-Meteorological Law (being prepared), the Environment
Protection Law (2014), the National Climate Change Strategy (2011), and the National Disaster Prevention, Mitigation,
Response and Recovery to 2020.


T O W A R D I N T E G R AT E D D I S A S T E R R I S K M A N A G E M E N T I N V I E T N A M                              45
46                                                               HIGHLIGHTING KEY CHALLENGES IN VIETNAM




     frameworks cover various natural hazards, including drought and SWI, and provide
     basic measures for response.42 But many of these measures are more appropriate
     for rapid-onset floods and tropical storms, with which institutions are more familiar.
     Despite frequent droughts, the GoV has yet to develop national drought risk policies or
     a drought risk reduction framework. The drought, SWI, forest fires, and desertification
     of 2010–2011 showed the need for drought risk reduction strategies that address
     the root causes of drought, not merely temporary responses that address symptoms
     only. The 2015–2016 drought and SWI have only intensified this need.

     Fragmentation and overlapping of the existing water resource legal frameworks
     complicate the management of water-related hazards. The Law on Water Resources
     (2012), the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (2014), and the pending
     Irrigation and Hydraulic Engineering Law have not led to effective and integrated
     water resource management that sustainably exploits and protects water resources.
     This challenge is complicated by the lack of an institution responsible for ensuring that
     water resources and use are managed sustainably. Currently, four ministries—MoNRE,
     MARD, the Ministry of Construction, and the Ministry of Industry and Trade—and their
     respective provincial departments are involved in water resources management, each
     with a sectoral focus. Notably, there is no water-monitoring system, no inventory of
     water resources, and no effective measures for water security or efficiency. Further,
     illegal and unplanned use of water by industry and agriculture has been reported
     in recent years.43



     4.2	 Balancing Structural and Nonstructural Measures
     Nonstructural measures have the potential to provide cost-effective solutions
     to drought and SWI but are underutilized compared to structural measures.
     Although the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control recognizes the role
     played by nonstructural measures in managing natural hazards, current capacity is
     still focused on structural measures and emergency response. Nonstructural measures
     could address a range of risks associated with extreme events and the impacts of
     climate change, but putting these measures in place has proved challenging in
     Vietnam. In the agriculture sector, for example, an efficient irrigation technology has


     42	    The measures relevant to drought and SWI include (i) adjusting the structures of plants, animals, and crops based
     on forecasts, warnings, and developments of drought and seawater intrusion; (ii) rationally operating reservoirs and water
     supply works; prioritizing supply of water for residential use; economically using water and preventing water loss; (iii) pri-
     oritizing supply of electricity and necessary supplies and fuels for pumping stations; and (iv) observing the level of salini-
     ty and appropriately regulating the closure and opening of sluices for water collection and salinity prevention in specific
     circumstances.
     43	    See “Assessment Report on Implementation of the Water Resources Law 1998 and Recommendations for
     Amendments, and Change in the Next Law” (GoV 2011); this report was used to prepare for the new law on water
     resources in 2012.

been applied for coffee in the highland areas. But this has not yet been scaled up
for other crops or industrial plantation due to the high investment cost and weak
operation and maintenance capacity of the users.

Various nonstructural measures to address drought and SWI are available, but none
has been taken to scale in Vietnam:
  •	 Rainwater harvesting and soil moisture conservation have been adopted in parts
     of the country (figure 4.1, left), but technical assistance and financial incentives are
     needed to encourage households, farmers, and the private sector to implement
     these “no-regrets” measures more effectively.
  •	 Recycling water is not a practice or priority among individuals or the GoV. More
     work needs to be done to promote recycling for both nonpotable purposes
     (agriculture, irrigation, industrial processes, toilet flushing, and construction)
     and potable purposes (recharging of groundwater aquifers and augmenting of
     surface water reservoirs).
  •	 Water-use efficiency could mitigate the effects of drought but is not practiced in
     many sectors, and will require behavioral, operational, and equipment changes
     in cities as well as on farms and in rural areas.
  •	 Alternative crops (figure 4.1, right) require less water than rice and can be sown
     when drought/SWI postpones regular planting or kills existing plants,44 but their
     use in Vietnam remains limited. Currently, there is no effective and coherent policy

           or support to guide larger-scale application. The GoV, and specifically MARD,
           should expedite the Agricultural Restructuring Program to 2020, which calls for
           agricultural diversification and includes rice targets. Alternative crops will help to
           reduce demands on water and increase coverage by drought- and salt-tolerant
           plant species. Further, alternative cultivation techniques, notably alternate wetting
           and drying (AWD) of rice (part of the system of rice intensification; SRI), would
           reduce water use, increase efficiency, and reduce methane production of rice fields.

     More effective strategies are needed for developing and managing Vietnam’s water
     supply reliably and sustainably. These strategies must recognize that groundwater
     and surface water are separate and major sources. Groundwater must be used
     sustainably, and river water has the potential for sustainable development if it is
     naturally replenished at a rate compatible with the rate of usage. But the variable
     nature of river flow and transborder water usage jeopardize rivers’ ability to reliably
     supply freshwater—and given that hydrologic variability tends to increase with the
     effects of climate change, the reliability of water supply from rivers is likely to decrease.
     Indeed, Vietnam is already experiencing greater within-year flow variability in rivers
     and longer drought periods than in the past.



     4.3	 Hydro-meteorological and Environmental
     Monitoring, Forecasting, and Warning Services
     The hydro-meteorological monitoring, forecasting, and warning services offered
     by the National Centre for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF) are
     insufficient to support the needs of users who are impacted by climate hazards.45
     The NCHMF’s forecast capacity and reliability for drought and SWI have improved
     in recent years because of investments in hydro-meteorological instruments and
     collaboration on data collation and analysis. But its hydro-meteorological services—in
     particular environmental monitoring services, forecasts of different durations (short,
     medium, and long term), and specificity within those forecasts for different users—
     have yet to meet the needs of different sectors. This failure is the result of (i) weak
     capacity and fragmentation of the monitoring and observation networks; (ii) inadequate
     computing and technical capacity to improve modeling for seasonal forecasts; (iii) lack
     of a robust communi¬cation system for data transmission, dissemination of forecasts,
     and sharing of information with stakeholders; and (iv) poor targeting and delivery of
     weather and climate information and hydro-meteorological services to end-users.



     45	  The NCHMF receives daily observations from provincial hydro-meteorological stations, and analyzes the data
     before releasing information to the Standing Office or Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and
     Control, under MARD, which in turn releases it to the provinces and mass media for drought preparedness and response.


                                   T O W A R D I N T E G R AT E D D I S A S T E R R I S K M A N A G E M E N T I N V I E T N A M
HIGHLIGHTING KEY CHALLENGES IN VIETNAM                                                         49




Ineffective use of forecast and early warning in decision making creates barriers
for effective preparation and implementation of DRM. Part of the problem is that
early warning information is highly technical and not user-friendly, which limits its
use by government decision makers at all levels. In turn, the capacity of end-users
to understand and benefit from early warnings is also limited. During the 2015–2016
drought and SWI, many farmers did not understand the seriousness of the situation
and did not follow recommended actions as communicated in advisories from
provincial Departments of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARDs) or local
People’s Committees. For example, some farmers still sowed a third rice crop, despite
warnings about drought and SWI.

Vietnam has not yet established agro-meteorological services that would enable
appropriate decisions and adjustments related to weather variability at the farm
level. The GoV and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have funded several
studies and pilots of agro-meteorological advisory schemes in recent years, including
establishment of the Centre for Agricultural Meteorology (CAMET) under the Institute
of Meteorology, Hydrology and Environment (IMHEN), which is intended to be
responsible for research on agro-meteorological services. But neither institution has
a systematic, reliable approach to producing tailored agro-meteorological advisories
for farmers in the different agro-ecological regions, which differ from one another in
exposure and sensitivity (for example, population density and rice monoculture elevate
sensitivity). Farmers still lack effective advisories that would enable them to make
appropriate decisions about planting, harvesting, fertilizing, irrigating, and adjusting
cropping patterns. The importance of such information increases significantly during
extreme climate conditions such as the 2015–2016 drought and SWI.



4.4	 Data and Information for Managing Drought and SWI
In addition to limitations in hydro-meteorology services, there are several challenges
related to data that limit efforts to manage drought, SWI, and other hazards:
  •	 Inadequate data collection, management, and publication. Currently, there
     is no systematic method for collecting data on drought at any level of the
     government (national, provincial, or local). Salinity monitoring is limited and does
     not contribute to analysis or figure in advice to farmers. There are currently no
     protocols or mandates for routine data sharing across government departments
     and research institutions, even though sharing could help to manage data’s
     expense. In addition, published materials tend to be overly complex, and would
     benefit from simplification and inclusion of both historical and real-time data.46


46	   Data quality is problematic because historical data are often missing or inadequate.

       •	 Inadequate drought indices. Current indices are inadequate for detecting the
          early onset or end of a drought period. No single index is enough to measure the
          complex interrelationships between the various parts of the hydrological cycle
          and their impacts; multiple vulnerability indices must be integrated to account for
          such factors as rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, climate change projections,
          sea-level rise, river water availability, and groundwater levels. In turn, these factors
          need collating with socioeconomic information to better anticipate impacts.
          This more extensive analysis would then trigger mitigation and response efforts
          adjusted to various drought intensities or impacts.
       •	 Inefficient methods for assessing the impact of drought or salinity. Currently,
          there is no systematic method for collecting data on drought and salinity levels at
          national, provincial, and local levels. 47Such a method would have clear benefits:
          it would clarify drought and SWI risk and be useful in drought disaster impact
          assessments, which provide the evidence base for decisions about investment
          and policy development. Several additional steps could be taken to improve
          drought and SWI assessment methods, including building DRM capacity and
          better engaging with the Agricultural Extension Centers at provincial and local
          levels, developing tools for assessing drought and SWI, and involving mass
          organizations’ networks of staff and volunteers in efforts at the subnational level.



     4.5	 Post-Disaster Financing Capacity
     Vietnam’s current post-disaster financing mechanisms support only short-term
     response and do not enable a sustainable budget for medium- and longer-term
     recovery. The 2013 Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control established a
     contingency fund for disaster response at all levels. Provisions were made later under
     the 2015 State Budget Law that reserved for disaster contingency 2–4 percent of the
     total annual budget for capital and recurrent expenditures at all levels. In addition,
     Circular 49 (Decision No. 49//2012/QD-TTg of November 8, 2012) requires one-time
     grant support to farmers and households whose crops, livestock, trees, and fisheries
     are affected by natural hazards or epidemics, including drought and SWI. But given
     the compounding effects of drought and SWI on livelihoods—a result of damage
     to crops, other productive assets, and related infrastructure—and given the lack of
     efficiency and transparency in support implementation, these funding sources rarely
     meet actual needs. While emergency relief is mainly funded out of state and local
     contingency budgets, public reconstruction and ex ante risk reduction are funded
     primarily through the normal capital expenditure budget. This approach does not

     47	   For example, teams used assessment templates for tropical storms, typhoons, and floods in their recent drought
     and SWI assessments because there were no specific assessment methods for drought and SWI, and no time to develop
     them.


                                   T O W A R D I N T E G R AT E D D I S A S T E R R I S K M A N A G E M E N T I N V I E T N A M

enable “building back better” methods in the recovery phase, through which higher
upfront costs could be justified to decrease the likelihood of future damage.

Even though the Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (2013) mandated
the establishment of a disaster reserve fund (DRF) in every province, these
funds have not been used for the recent drought/SWI response. Only 33 out of
64 provinces have established their DRFs to date. A number of operational, financial
management, resource execution, and reporting challenges make it difficult to fully
channel the funds across all provinces. To increase resilience to climate change, it is
critical to ensure that funds are used efficiently and reach individuals and communities
promptly.

Vietnam offers few specific national or provincial bank loan programs or other
mechanisms for households and farmers seeking to reestablish their farming
activities. Instead, farmers must borrow from commercial banks or social banks (for
example, the Bank for the Poor). In some cases, banks may offer special conditions
for the loans, such as extending the payment deadline, reducing interest, or even
canceling the debt. But little guidance is available to help agribusiness, small and
medium enterprises, the commercial sector, and industry develop water-efficient
business plans. Nor are there low-interest loans to support such efforts.

Compensatory programs to increase production are inadequate, and farmers in
affected areas have limited access to insurance and risk transfer mechanisms.
While compensatory programs do exist, they are not readily available to the poor
rural households who most need them. Over the past five years, several agricultural
risk reduction insurance pilots were implemented both by the government and
private sector. However, challenges still remain to scale up these schemes, most
notably concerning premium funding, data infrastructure, and capacity of the local
insurance industry.



4.6	 Divergence of DRM and CCA in Socioeconomic
Development Planning
Fragmented DRM and CCA policies, plans, and investments limit the GoV’s ability
to manage drought, SWI, and other climate risks effectively. The most pressing
issues facing the GoV are a lack of capacity, poor coordination across agencies and
sectors, institutional fragmentation, and inadequate data quality and management.
The GoV is not exploiting synergies between its CCA and DRM priorities. Instead,
DRM and CCA issues are considered separately and managed by MARD and MoNRE
respectively, with limited coordination between the ministries. An earlier attempt

52                                                          HIGHLIGHTING KEY CHALLENGES IN VIETNAM




     to set up a national platform for DRM and CCA—comprising periodic consultation
     meetings and a bi-yearly forum for development partners, national and international
     NGOs, and relevant government agencies—was discontinued in 2013.48

     Despite some successes, DRM and CCA are not integrated consistently and
     effectively into SEDPs at national and subnational levels or within sectors.
     With technical and financial support from international organizations and NGOs,
     many provinces have had success in integrating DRM and CCA into SEDPs. These
     approaches have the potential to be standardized and scaled up, but challenges remain:
     expertise in participatory risk assessment and planning is limited, and financing for
     community-based DRM (through the national CBDRM program) is insufficient. As a
     result of weak inter-sectoral coordination in DRM planning, each sector and province
     develops its own plans without much consultation and coordination with others.
     As there is no central budget allocation, local government authorities are required
     to allocate their own budgets, and often they prioritize structural measures over
     community-based approaches. In June 2016, the MPI issued a circular (No. 05/2016/
     TT-BKHDT) to guide the integration of natural disaster prevention and control content
     into SEDPs at commune and ward levels. The circular took effect in July 2016, and
     official guidelines to support its implementation are being developed by the United
     Nations Development Programme (UNDP), MARD, and various international NGOs.

     An integrated data management system, including standard-compliant spatial
     data infrastructure and risk information platforms, is missing in all line agencies for
     spatial planning, infrastructure development, and operations and maintenance. A
     system or interconnected systems would visualize the potential risks and alternatives for
     safeguarding socioeconomic development. Equally important, improving government
     capacity at all levels in risk-sensitive land-use planning requires that good policies,
     guidance, and strengthened institutional agreements are in place. Both MARD and
     MoNRE have responsibilities for watershed and river basin management, specific
     hazard monitoring and mapping, and development and land-use planning. Both
     should respond more effectively to the land-use planning needs of local governments.



     4.7	 Participatory and Inclusive Approaches
     Participatory approaches to DRM, water resource management, and adaptive
     livelihoods are needed in drought- and SWI-affected areas to ensure solutions
     are tailored to specific circumstances. Under such participatory and decentralized
     approaches, decision-making power rests with the lowest administration level, in line


     48	  The platform would have involved MARD, MoNRE, donors, UN agencies, the Red Cross, the Vietnam Women’s
     Union, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society organizations.

with the well-known “four-on-the spot” motto that has become standard in disaster
preparedness and response.49 In addition, a greater share of the budget goes to
capacity building for participatory DRM, socioeconomic planning, public awareness,
and public education (to encourage lasting behavior change), and a greater share
of management responsibilities rests with local communities.

It is important to integrate gender equity and the needs of vulnerable groups
into planning. Community-based approaches should continue to seek inclusiveness
as they work to strengthen capacity for DRM, water resource management, and CCA.
A growing body of evidence suggests that an increased burden falls on women and
girls in drought-affected areas. For example, the time absorbed by water collection
has increased as women and children (mostly girls) have had to travel greater distances
to find water (figure 4.2). The heavy rainfalls and more frequent floods predicted to
result from climate change also increase women’s workloads, as women will have to
devote more time to collecting water and to cleaning and maintaining their houses
after floods.

     4.8	 Managing Challenges and Risks of Climate Change
     An integrated and holistic approach to climate-smart agriculture is essential.
     There is an increasingly urgent need to consider risks—not only to agriculture but
     also to other sectors, including water resource management, forestry, and aquaculture—
     in order to devise precise and tailored solutions. In seeking to prevent avoidable
     risks and mitigate inevitable risks, these location-specific solutions require a better
     understanding of different hazards’ nature, frequency, and severity. A focus shift from
     post-disaster crisis management to pre-disaster risk management is essential (figure
     4.3). With climate change likely to increase the severity and frequency of some natural
     hazards, inaction will only exacerbate the adverse impacts that farmers and communities
     already face.

     The impact of climate change is central to the risk management decision-
     making process. Extreme weather events can wipe out small farmers and damage
     livelihoods of entire communities. Crop loss–induced market volatility can set off
     a chain reaction and disturb the entire system from producers to processors; it
     can also affect exporters, governments, and lending institutions, leading to larger
     socioeconomic impacts. When populations are unprepared to mitigate risk and to
     recover from climate-induced disasters, governments and international development
     agencies must occupy themselves with recovery support rather than real capacity
     development. It is therefore imperative that governments understand climate risks
     and invest in prevention, mitigation, and preparedness.

Climate change has aggravated the production risks that farmers already face
at the farm level because of limited natural and financial investment resources.
Among the factors that damage the livelihoods of farmers, and especially small
farmers, are gaps in information about good agriculture and farm management
practices, limited crop diversification, poor management of water resources, and a
lack of good financial tools to help them withstand the impacts of adverse weather.
Farmers’ risks to climate change are seen in production losses, market and price
volatility, and disturbed enabling environment (figure 4.4).

The agricultural supply chain is long and therefore highly sensitive, and it can
be broken or damaged by weather or climate-related events. Extreme weather
events—more likely because of climate change—may introduce new pests or damage
storage facilities, which could result in heavy post-harvest losses. Some climate
hazards could break the supply chain altogether. To ensure that links between farm
and market are strong, risks of this type must be taken into account. It is critical
that infrastructure be strengthened before a climate hazard hits and creates food
insecurity (figure 4.5).

Climate change influences the enabling environment by affecting a region’s
major dependent variables, including natural resources, related regulations
and policies, and governance. While the precise extent of these factors and their
implications for the enabling environment cannot be measured without in-depth and

              critical analysis, it is still possible to predict some potential implications. Establishing
              links between climate change and production can thus be useful to policy makers
              and facilitate informed decision making. For example, crop diversification and the
              inclusion of salt-tolerant crop varieties will diminish production risk in the delta region.
              While risk itself might not be the sole driver of farmers’ choices, it could become a
              primary consideration along with expected outcome.



              4.9	 Climate Change and Land Use
              The impacts of climate change in Vietnam present a challenge for GoV responses
              to drought and SWI because they call for significant changes in land use. Projections
              of climate change effects in Vietnam include increased drought in some areas of the
              Mekong Delta, the Central Highlands, and South Central Vietnam;50 increased heat
              waves in central Vietnam; and variable rainfall and below-average river flow in the
              Mekong River basin. Given these projections—and given the difficulty of influencing
              interventions in other riparian countries—the GoV must maximize its ability to deal
              with both river floods and droughts, in part by optimizing water retention and storage
              in uplands and lowlands and by improving overall water and land-use management.
              Local authorities and farmers must be prepared for adverse impacts of drought and

SWI on aquaculture and agriculture in the Mekong Delta and in the Central and
Highlands regions. Both short-term and medium- to long-term solutions will be
required to increase communities’ adaptive capacities and resilience.

Risk-informed land-use planning can mitigate natural hazards and can also promote
and leverage the SEDP process. Land-use planning is especially challenging for
stakeholders because of the conflicting values and demands of different land users.
Risk- and climate-sensitive land-use plans should be informed by DRM and CCA policies
to ensure coordinated development of settlements, infrastructure, transport, utilities
and other services, cultural heritage, environmental resources, and conservation sites.
The approach must shift from one that adjusts water management based on land
use to one that adjusts land use based on water availability and the threat posed by
SWI. In coastal zones, for example, mangrove forests contribute to coastal protection,
biodiversity, and adapted livelihoods, but they are threatened by intensive shrimp
farming and tourism as a consequence of poor local governance. Appropriate policies
are needed to encourage diversification of agricultural systems, including financial
support to smallholders, and to strengthen the supply chain. Such policies will also
promote and benefit the SEDPs. Long-term adaptation plans need to be included
in the existing strategies for coping with the increased drought frequency.

Upstream deforestation and forest degradation are affecting water resources.
Natural forest is still being cut down for industrial tree cultivation in the Central
Highlands, and slash-and-burn cultivation is still practiced among some ethnic minority
groups. Coffee and other plantations need irrigation during dry periods in areas
where multiple hydroelectric dams control water. In the Central Highlands and the
South Central Coast region, drought risks and temperatures are high and increasing.
Sustainable forestry practices should be implemented to improve watershed functions
and as part of overall groundwater and surface water management.

Climate change poses a particular challenge for agriculture. The changing
hydrological characteristics of the extreme events, and their relation to the onset,
duration, and magnitude of the yearly monsoon season, will affect agricultural outputs
significantly. Sea-level rise will have important implications for the availability of land
for agriculture or aquaculture. Inundation and changes in the sediment and nutrient
balance (caused, for example, by upstream hydropower development) and the
salinity profile of coastal areas will affect productive lands in the delta region. Rice
production will require use of locally developed rice cultivars that tolerate salinity,
drought, and flood. Currently, agricultural systems in Vietnam are poorly equipped
to deal with climate variability. Going forward, land-suitability studies and investment
in agriculture diversification will be especially critical in remedying this situation.

     4.10	 Sustainable Water Resource Management
     Sustainable water resource management is a crucial challenge for the GoV in
     addressing the risk of drought and SWI. Vietnam has achieved lower-middle-
     income status, and its water use—industrial and domestic—has increased with its
     wealth. Moreover, water demand is expected to double in the next two decades51 as
     economic development continues and the pressures of population growth and climate
     change mount. Other challenges are posed by the growth of intensive agriculture,
     urban development, and tourism in water-stressed areas. This growth has created
     conflicting demands for often declining water resources and is driving both hydrological
     and agricultural drought risk—but it is hardly considered in development planning,
     which often proceeds without taking water availability into account, or without taking
     adequate measures for water management and conservation.

     These water resource issues are compounded by the increased and competing
     demand for water from power generation, fisheries and agriculture, and domestic,
     commercial, and industrial consumption. Vietnam’s need for water is driven partly
     by its high reliance on agriculture as a source of income, with rice production quotas
     for communes contributing to this problem. The agricultural sector is relatively
     resource-inefficient, and its heavy dependence on resource inputs such as water raises
     sustainability concerns. Vietnam has no efficient system for allocating and monitoring
     water for different sectors and users; use of water by industry and agriculture may
     be inefficient or illegal—a particular problem where critical groundwater resources
     are concerned.

     Increasing water demand, and the differing interests of water users among
     neighboring riparian countries, are expected to challenge regional cooperation in
     water management. Within the Southeast Asia subregion, Vietnam manages about
     51 percent of the total area of the Red River Delta and 8 percent of the Mekong
     River basin. More than 60 percent of the country’s water resources are inflows from
     adjacent countries, making Vietnam especially sensitive to water use by these upstream
     neighbors. The increase in reservoir construction among these neighbors, compounded
     by global climate change (which is altering water availability, quality, timing, and flows)
     is creating additional pressure for negotiated water resource management among
     countries that share water sources. To sustain the water resources needed to cope
     with increased demands for socioeconomic development, to lessen tensions, and
     to avoid potential water-related conflict in the future, transboundary cooperation
     on the judicious use of water resources in both of Vietnam’s river basins is crucial.

CHAPTER 5

Global Good Practices and Recommendations




The following recommendations are based on global good practices and an
initial assessment of the drought and SWI situation and needs in Vietnam. It is
important to recognize that effective implementation of such measures depends
on addressing bottlenecks in institutional coordination and on ensuring financing
capacity (as described in section 4). Each issue would likewise benefit from more
detailed country-level study to tailor approaches to national, eco-regional, and
community levels and bring a multi-hazard perspective to bear on climate change
impacts and extreme events. The specific focus of the recommendations is on building
resilience to drought and SWI. However, they take account of the recommendations
outlined in both the Drought Recovery Plan (released jointly by the GoV and the UN
in October 2016) and a USAID study.52 The recommendations offered in this section
are summarized below:

Policies to build resilience through effective planning and implementation
(Getting the big picture right for disaster risk reduction)
  •	 Integrate resilience into socioeconomic development plans
  •	 Develop integrated national and regional drought management programs
  •	 Assess and maintain information on multi-hazard risk and climate vulnerabilities

Putting systems in place for smarter disaster preparedness, response, and
recovery
  •	 Implement user-focused hydro-meteorological services
  •	 Develop a financial protection strategy for emergency response and recovery
  •	 Enable household-level recovery through social assistance
  •	 Shift focus from crisis management to risk management

     the longer term to build resilience)
      •	 Develop and implement climate-resilient water resource systems
      •	 Promote climate-resilient and climate-smart agriculture
          Adopt climate-smart agriculture practices more widely
          Improve coastal zone management and aquaculture
          Adopt an integrated approach to adaptive delta management
          Promote climate resilience in Central Highlands
          Establish effective financing mechanisms for climate change adaptation
      •	 Invest in community-based approaches
      •	 Empower vulnerable groups and populations to be resilient



     5.1	 Getting the Big Picture Right for Disaster Risk
     Reduction
     Global experience shows that the more specific the recommendations, the more
     effective the process of change or adaptation. Such recommendations take into
     account the barriers to adopting the new or improved technology, and they also
     emphasize diverse geographies, farming systems, and socioeconomic situations.
     Thus in seeking to improve risk management and increase resilience, the GoV must
     analyze exposure, sensitivity, and vulnerability first at the district level and then at
     the community level; and these analyses must be reviewed and revised periodically.
     In Vietnam, targeted preventive interventions for risk and vulnerability reduction
     include protecting national and community-level seed reserves, producing and
     stocking fodder for livestock ahead of crises, promoting water harvesting, offering
     conditional cash assistance in case of shocks, and providing technical, financial, and
     social support to farmers’ groups. For planning and implementation to be effective,
     the right policies have to be adopted.


     5.1.1	 Integrate Resilience into Socioeconomic Development Plans

     Mainstreaming efforts, strategies, and programs for CCA (led by MoNRE) and
     DRM (led by MARD) should be better coordinated, and potential synergies should

be more effectively leveraged.53 According to policy-making practice, all economic
sectors and provinces must develop action plans related to CCA and DRM. The Law
on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control states DRM should be mainstreamed in
SEDPs.54 Guidance on CCA mainstreaming in SEDP planning was issued by MPI in
2013. This guidance was lengthy and complex, and uptake has been poor.

The NGO experience of integrating DRM and CCA into SEDP at commune and
district levels provides a key resource. The participatory approach promoted by
Oxfam, the Red Cross, and other international NGOs should be integrated into
Circular No.05/2016/TT-BKHDT (and forthcoming GoV guidelines) on mainstreaming
DRM and CCA into SEDPs. These guidelines will provide an important management
tool for socioeconomic development planning, and for mobilizing local resources
that serve the needs of the local community.

Experience shows that mainstreaming DRM and CCA in SEDPs needs to happen
first in communes, where budgets are small but risk and vulnerability can be
reduced. Several international NGOs supported local planning in communes and at
higher administrative levels. This approach, which was implemented within community-
based projects in provinces with high levels of poverty, significant climate-related
vulnerabilities, and limited financial and human resources, has proved successful. For
example, with support from Oxfam DRM and CCA strategies have been mainstreamed
into commune- and district-level SEDPs in Tra Vinh and Ben Tre Provinces (see box 5.1).

Effective mainstreaming in provincial SEDPs cannot be expected without local-
level DRM and CCA plans. A concern in Tra Vinh (and elsewhere in Vietnam) is that
the financial needs for CBDRM are much larger than the budget shared under the
national CBDRM program. This limitation makes it necessary to access provincial
resources to carry out the plans. The results in Tra Vinh have led to proposals for
provincial funding to improve DRM and CCA.




53	    The relevant plans and programs are the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change (2008), which
focuses on climate change impact assessment and development of adaptation and mitigation measures; the National
Climate Change Strategy (2011) and related national Climate Change Action Plan (2012) with priority actions on adap-
tation and mitigation; the National Green Growth Strategy (2012) and related national Green Growth Action Plan (2014),
also with a series of prioritized actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and the national CBDRM program (Decision
1002) on awareness raising and CBDRM, targeting 6,000 of the most vulnerable communes in the country.
54	    The key article is Article 16: “National and local socio-economic development or sectoral development master
plans and plans must have natural disaster prevention and control contents suitable to the characteristics of natural disas-
ters in each region and locality in order to ensure sustainable development.”

     BOX 5.1: Integrating DRM and CCA Into the SEDP in Tra Vinh Province

     Recognizing that mainstreaming DRM and CCA into commune SEDPs is important, the Tra
     Vinh Provincial People’s Committee (PPC) issued Decision 264, Implementation of the Action
     Plan of the National Target Program to Respond to Climate Change in Tra Vinh, for the period
     2010–2020. Oxfam supported this mainstreaming process through a local government-appointed
     SEDP Planning Task Force, comprising commune leaders and sector staff. Further, under the
     national CBDRM program, the PPC set up technical support groups at provincial, district, and
     commune levels. In the communes, community-based groups were formed to carry out CBDRM,
     including commune risk assessments. Oxfam promoted information sharing and discussions
     on DRM and climate change vulnerability between these two groups, which often comprised
     similar people. This coordination was necessary in order to accommodate specific requirements
     from the project, from DARD, or from the Department for Planning and Investment (DPI), as
     normally, people who are in charge of rolling out the CCNDPC (Central Committee for Natural
     disaster Prevention and Control) and SEDP are from two different departments. As a result of
     these interactions, climate change, disaster vulnerabilities, and risk reduction issues arising from
     the commune risk assessments were integrated into commune SEDPs and then district SEDPs.

     The Tra Vinh DPI showed a strong commitment to this effort, specifically to drafting planning
     guidelines for participatory SEDP that integrates DRM, CCA, and gender at commune and
     district levels. In 2014, with Oxfam support, the DPI used this approach to enable 19 communes
     in two districts (Chau Thanh and Cau Ngang) to incorporate key DRM and CCA issues into their
     SEDPs. The integrated planning was funded by the PPC (VND 410 million, US$18,000) and
     Oxfam (VND 230 million, US$10,000), which paid for equipment, documentation, staff training,
     and planning by the different groups. Oxfam in collaboration with DPI invested in strengthening
     technical capacities to carry out risk assessments and information collection. With years of effort
     following International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) support for a market-based
     participatory planning method with DPI, this participatory and integrated planning approach
     overcame challenges and helped to achieve national strategies and meet program targets.

     Oxfam has taken good practice and lessons learned from Tra Vinh to Ben Tre Province, where
     planning guidelines were improved with closer linkages to the national CBDRM program. People
     in the SEDP Planning Task Groups, technical support groups, and community-based groups
     have benefitted from peer-to-peer support, training, and capacity building. This has helped
     to integrate disaster risks, climate change, and gender into SEDP planning and has helped
     raise awareness in local communities. The approach is being promoted by Oxfam and other
     development partners for replication and scaling up in other provinces (to be included in the
     coming circular by MPI).

5.1.2	 Develop Integrated National and Regional Drought Management
Programs

Vietnam could consider a dedicated program that addresses the multi-sector
coordination and implementation challenges specifically related to drought. Such a
program could be integrated within the broader DRM and CCA policy frameworks.
Experiences from Mexico and Brazil show how drought management has been
integrated effectively into government policy (see boxes 5.2 and 5.3).



      BOX 5.2: Mexico’s National Program Against Drought

      In January 2013, in response to recurrent drought that had affected most parts of Mexico since
      2010, the country’s president announced the National Program Against Drought (PRONACOSE).
      Coordinated by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA), the program aims to develop tools
      for a new proactive and preventive approach for integrated drought management at the level
      of the 26 basin councils across the country. Its specific objectives can be summarized as follows:
        1.	 Initiate a targeted training program on drought basic concepts and best practices in order
            to develop local capacity for sustainable integrated drought management in Mexico.
        2.	 Raise awareness at the basin level and develop a host of drought prevention and mitigation
            measures.
        3.	 Establish an interagency committee to coordinate and direct existing drought programs,
            guide and assess PRONACOSE, and fund the actions proposed by stakeholders at the
            basin level.
        4.	 Involve experts and researchers in responding to the identified needs in drought management.
        5.	 Develop a communication and outreach program that emphasizes vulnerability, participation,
            prevention, and the evolution of drought.

      Assessing implemented activities and ensuring sustainability through feedback in various phases
      are important elements of the framework of PRONACOSE, which is due to run till 2018. As a
      starting point in 2013, CONAGUA developed the Prevention and Mitigation Measures for Drought
      Programmes (PMPMS) for each basin council, building on global experiences. PMPMS addresses
      the drought characteristics and vulnerability of each basin. CONAGUA staff and researchers
      from 12 national institutions were trained to standardize the activities and contents of these
      programs, which were implemented in the second and third years (2014–2015). After evaluation
      of the implemented programs in 2016–2017, the programs are to be improved, updated, and
      implemented again from the sixth year (2018). A continued gradual implementation beyond
      the sixth year is expected through ownership of the programs by the basin councils.

           5.1.3	 Assess and Maintain Information on Multi-Hazard Risk and
           Climate Vulnerabilities

           Institutions tasked with proactive risk management must develop a comprehensive
           understanding of natural hazard risks and vulnerabilities, including climate change
           impacts. The data collected will guide not only DRM and CCA strategies but also
           socioeconomic development and land-use planning. These risk assessments should
           be regularly updated with local-level data, based on different agro-ecological regions.

           Platforms and tools for sharing the risk assessment results and information need to be
           strengthened. Effective tools leverage maps to illustrate vulnerabilities and risks and
           to assist in decision making. Initiatives are under way—through MARD’s Department
           of Natural Disaster Management and Control and through MoNRE at the central and
           regional levels—to improve data management and sharing. Better policies, tools,
           and practices are needed for interagency sharing of data on hazards and climate
           risks to ensure that robust information is accessible for both official decision making
           and for the public. Utilizing local agencies and methods familiar to the community
           ensures effective communication. An example of how drought information can be
           managed and shared is offered by the U.S. National Integrated Drought Information
           System (NIDIS), a multi-agency platform that includes both monitoring and forecasting
           information about drought as well as data products on underlying risk for drought
           and related hazards (box 5.4).



     BOX 5.3: Transition to Proactive Drought Management Approaches in Brazil

     Northeast Brazil experienced a prolonged and severe drought between 2010 and 2014—the
     region’s worst drought crisis in 100 years. The event focused federal attention on drought
     management approaches, with authorities seeking to move away from ad hoc and reactive
     crisis response mechanisms toward a more proactive drought preparedness, planning, and
     management approach.

     There were considerable short- and long-term challenges that threatened to hamper the
     transition. For instance, the paucity of information available on the economic and social
     impacts of the drought made it difficult to draw up disaster preparedness plans. In addition,
     the responsibilities of different institutions for the various drought preparedness activities (e.g.,
     vulnerability assessments, monitoring, and recovery) were ill-defined. To close these gaps,
     national and state dialogues were held with the aim of introducing an integrated National
     Drought Policy and highlighting specific priority areas for the institutions involved. Led by the
     Ministry of National Integration, these discussions resulted in the formalization of a National
     Drought Policy with three broad pillars:


                                                                                                     box continues next page

        1.	 Monitoring and forecasting/early warning activities
        2.	 Vulnerability/resilience and impact assessments
        3.	 Mitigation and response planning and measures

      The policy was piloted within regions most affected by the drought, and concrete adaptation
      plans were implemented at the regional and local levels. For example, in Northeast Brazil, an
      online drought monitor was launched, and tailored drought preparedness plans relevant to
      different environments were catalyzed and put in place—e.g., for river basins, urban water supply
      systems, and rural agricultural systems. Based on the forecasted severity of an upcoming drought
      and the affected geographical areas identified by the drought monitor, different preparedness
      activities are triggered.

      BOX 5.4: Access to Centralized Information On Drought in the United States

      The U.S. National Integrated Drought Information System is a one-stop information portal on
      drought across the United States. The site aggregates information and research related to drought;
      for instance, it offers data on water supply, precipitation, and soil moisture that are produced
      by its partners in the public and private sectors and in academia. The aggregated information
      is presented in a coordinated and user-friendly manner via the Drought Early Warning System.
      Through a mix of data, maps, and other visual tools, the NIDIS seeks to provide a comprehensive
      overview of the drought situation in each U.S. region and across major U.S. river basins. The
      severity of the drought situation (ranked D1–D4) and extent of land area affected within a region
      or river basin are some of the types of data supplied.

      The information provided by the NIDIS is useful to a wide range of stakeholders. Users are able
      to search for tailored drought information for their area; by entering their zip code, they gain
      access to drought outlook reports, forecasts, local meteorological contact information, and
      information on the potential impacts of the drought. Importantly, the Drought Early Warning
      System also warns about natural hazards arising from drought events, such as wildfires and
      interruptions to the local water supply. There are also links to educational material to allow the
      general public to boost its knowledge about drought preparedness and response.

           5.2	 Putting Systems in Place for Smarter Disaster
           Preparedness, Response, and Recovery


     BOX 5.5: Building Resilient Livelihoods Through Good Risk Governance, Disaster Risk
     Monitoring, and Early Warning Alerts to Reduce Risk and Vulnerability

     Experiences in many countries reveal that institutional strengthening and good governance on
     risk reduction and crisis management are central to mitigating risk and the impact of natural
     hazards in the agriculture sector. In defining risk reduction and management measures, it is
     important to address different vulnerable groups such as farmers, fishers, pastoralists, and
     foresters. It is also critical to understand that not all farmers have the same need—for example,
     a small farmer has fewer resources than a farmer with large holdings; a woman farmer may have
     less access to financial and educational resources than a male farmer. Integrating well-defined
     measures into strong regulatory and developmental frameworks builds multi-layer resilience at
     household, community, and regional levels. Disaster risk monitoring and early warning alerts
     enable communities to better prepare for and quickly recover from natural hazard impacts.
     Information for early warning and action helps governments, organizations, and communities
     prevent or mitigate humanitarian crises associated with severe food insecurities and related health
     emergencies. Local, regional, national, and international partnerships to mobilize interactions
     and support should be built ahead of disasters, rather than during or after the devastation.

           5.2.1	 Implement User-Focused Hydro-meteorological Services

           To enable effective use of forecast and early warning for disaster preparedness
           and response actions, investments in both modernizing hydro-meteorological
           monitoring and forecast systems are required. Location-specific drought monitoring
           and seasonal forecasts are critical to effective drought mitigation; indeed, timely and
           accurate information on drought and weather is the starting point for supporting
           vulnerable communities. To meet this need, there must be clear operational guidelines
           for issuing warnings connected to a drought monitoring system. Advisories linked to
           well-designed preparedness plans and response protocols are an essential element
           of proactive risk management (box 5.5). Equally essential is the ability to get the
           information to the individuals who need it the most in a timely manner, and to ensure
           their participation and involvement.

           The quality of forecasts, warning services, and communication between hydro-
           meteorological services and end-users can be improved by integrating automated



                                    T O W A R D I N T E G R AT E D D I S A S T E R R I S K M A N A G E M E N T I N V I E T N A M

systems at national and regional levels.55 Hydro-meteorological systems provide
vital information for many productive sectors and for early warnings that save lives
and reduce damage to property. In Vietnam, efforts have been made to develop a
nationwide hydro-meteorological system, and the government and development
partners have invested heavily in hydro- meteorological equipment. However, some
of these steps have been taken without coordination among various stakeholders
and without considering the technical and human capacity of Vietnam’s National
Hydro-Meteorological Services to manage, operate, and maintain the equipment.

Institutional reform and technical capacity building must be instigated as an
essential part of modernization. Operating an integrated system is a complex and
precise procedure, one that will guide the modernization process and define the
operation of future hydro-meteorological services to be delivered at the national,
regional, and provincial levels. Current capabilities must be strengthened to provide
improved forecast and warning services to the end-user community. Toward that end,
relevant financial, technical, and human resources should be assessed, along with
the processes involved in effectively reaching end-users.

Forecasts and monitoring networks must be connected to effective early warning
systems, and services must be connected to users at the community level and
in critical sectors. Translating weather and early warning information into different
advisories for different users will allow more efficient use of information. It will also
maximize benefits of benevolent weather conditions and alleviate the adverse impacts
of hazardous weather events (see box 5.6). A mechanism to access users’ needs and
obtain their feedback on the quality of forecast and early warning information can
help to make the information dissemination system more efficient and increase the
resilience of the key productive sectors of the economy. Systems like Brazil’s drought
monitor (box 5.3) and the U.S. Drought Early Warning System (box 5.4) provide a
range of climate information products through online portals.

The MARD Agricultural Extension Centers should be reoriented to develop and
deliver user-driven agro-meteorological information products and services.
Improving linkages between the MARD Agricultural Extension Centers and MoNRE
hydro-meteorological services will contribute to more effective weather information–
based crop and livestock management strategies. When farmers have climatological
information blended with seasonal climate forecasts before the start of the cropping
season, they are better able to adapt to increased weather variability and make the
most efficient use of natural resources. The result is improved crop production and
food security. Moreover, agro-meteorological advisories based on short- and medium-
range weather forecasts are vital for stabilizing farmers’ yields and incomes through

55	    These include the observation equipment, data transmission, telecommunications infrastructure, and a modern
relational database with digital data archiving.

            the management of agro-climatic resources and other inputs such as seeds, seedlings,
            irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticides as well as reliable market information. As explained
            in box 5.6, India has successfully implemented meteorological services that connect
            forecasts with farmer advisory services during extreme weather occurrences.



     BOX 5.6: Weather-Based Agricultural Advice for Farmers in India

     The Integrated Agro-Meteorological Advisory Service (IAAS) was introduced in India in 2007 as
     an iteration of the All India Radio’s 70-year-old weather bulletins for farmers. The meteorological
     services provide weather data and five-day forecasts. Specialists translate these into agricultural
     advisories that alert farmers to weather-related events likely to affect their agricultural operations,
     such as strong winds, low temperatures, or periods of humid weather, which can harm crops and
     livestock or increase the risk of disease. The advisories also provide guidance on what actions
     farmers should take. Field units at the agricultural universities relay the advisories to farmers in
     local languages using a variety of channels, including SMS messages on mobile phones, local
     radio and newspapers, and face-to-face advisory and extension services. The IAAS also provides
     national and state-level advisory bulletins to aid in planning by national and state governments
     and the agro-input supply industry.

     Farmers receiving IAAS advisories have yields that are 10–15 percent higher, and costs that are
     2–5 percent lower, than farmers not receiving the advisories. These differences are largely the
     result of more modern agricultural production technologies and practices, better irrigation and
     pest/disease management, and improved post-harvest technologies. Since it started in 2007,
     the service has had an estimated economic impact of more than US$10 billion.

            5.2.2	 Develop a Financial Protection Strategy for Emergency
            Response and Recovery

            Developing a disaster risk financing strategy could help Vietnam improve planning
            for rapid response and recovery in the aftermath of a disaster. A cost-effective
            financial protection strategy builds on an optimal combination of financial instruments,
            where disaster losses can be layered and financed through a mix of instruments,
            including contingency budgets, national and local disaster (multi-year) reserves,
            contingent credit, and risk transfer instruments (including insurance). International
            experience shows that if large-scale agricultural insurance is implemented as a public-
            private partnership (see box 5.7 for an example), it can smooth agricultural income
            during droughts and other extreme weather events and thereby provide protection
            for vulnerable populations.

      BOX 5.7: Public-Private Partnership in Agricultural Disaster Insurance in China

      China has implemented many policy measures to strengthen agriculture insurance. These
      include (i) providing a legal foundation for the management of agriculture insurance operations;
      (ii) providing premium subsidies for certain crops covered by insurance; and (iii) tax benefits for
      agriculture insurance operators. In addition, establishment of a more mature catastrophe insurance
      framework is underway. An agriculture insurance disaster risk reserve system has been established
      as protection against the risk of major agricultural disaster. Here, insurance companies set aside
      reserves at a defined ratio to the agriculture insurance premium and accrued underwriting profit,
      to gradually establish a mechanism for dealing with agricultural disaster shocks.

      To improve insurance coverage and compensation standards for large-scale farmers, agricultural
      disaster insurance will be piloted in a total of 200 major grain-producing counties in 2017-2018.
      These pilot counties mainly plant rice, wheat and corn, and are located in 13 major grain-
      producing provinces, including the top three producers, Heilongjiang, Henan and Shandong.
      As post-disaster reconstruction is mostly financed by the state, the disaster insurance system
      is designed to ease the government’s financial burdens.

      In 2016, about 26 insurance companies operating at the agricultural insurance market offered
      about 170 types of insurance products covering main crops, cash crops, livestock, forest, fruits,
      vegetables, medicinal herbs and local agricultural products. In this successful public-private
      partnership model, from 2014–2016, the average agricultural insurance coverage amount
      accounted for 20 percent of agricultural output value. Moreover, 9.67 percent of direct economic
      loss of agricultural production was covered by the compensation amount of 26.7 billion RMB,
      which is seven times of government relief funds.

Successful recovery depends on speedy mobilization and effective disbursement
of funds. Inadequate disaster-financing arrangements have exacerbated adverse
socioeconomic consequences of many past disasters.56 Investments in recovery
planning and in tracking and monitoring mechanisms can support quick assessments
of disaster impacts, funding mobilization, and effective and targeted use of funds.
But in spite of considerable investment in disaster impact assessment methodology
and systems, these technologies are still used inconsistently, or the technologies
used may not be appropriate. Targeting of funds and humanitarian relief has proved
consistently challenging for NGOs like the Red Cross. Given the potential size of
the DRF in post-disaster financing at local levels, it is important to thoroughly review
the policy, legal, and operational frameworks for, as well as actual operations of, the
DRFs, particularly in drought-hit provinces. Benchmarking these against international

            practices can help national and subnational governments address constraints and
            fully operationalize the DRFs.

            Risk reduction insurance schemes are another form of protection against extreme
            climate impacts. To be effective, large-scale agricultural insurance schemes require
            engagement, innovation, and action from both the public and the private sector. Options
            for the government to consider include weather-based/index-based insurance, which
            relies on weather data and remote sensing data, or area yield insurance; any relevant
            data should be treated as a public good and made accessible to insurers. As part
            of the effort to develop a legal and regulatory framework conducive to effective risk
            transfer, the government has critical roles to play in collecting and auditing data, as
            well as in managing a central data repository. Identifying and developing need-based
            insurance plans most beneficial to various groups (farmers, fishers, agribusinesses,
            etc.) ensures the overall success of such programs.

            Governments seeking to make disaster relief response efforts faster, more affordable,
            and more effective should consider providing financial support to agricultural risk
            insurance; examples of successful government schemes are in box 5.8 and further
            below in box 5.19.




     BOX 5.8: Natural Catastrophe Risk Insurance Schemes

     Protecting farmers against droughts and related natural disasters through agriculture
     insurance in India

     India’s agriculture insurance program is one of the largest in the world, covering about 20
     percent of farming households. This program aims at protecting farmers against droughts as a
     way to reduce their vulnerability to shocks and enhance their access to credit. The government
     of India supports agricultural insurance through a variety of instruments, including subsidies,
     investment in data infrastructure, and mandatory bundling of insurance with rural credit. The
     World Bank has supported the design and implementation of this agriculture insurance program,
     in particular the expedition of the claims settlement process, through modern technology and
     use of insurance premium calculation methodology that better reflect risks.

     Financial protection for state governments against contingent liabilities arising from

      designed as a safety net for small-scale farmers (owning less than 20 ha and 60 Tropical Livestock
      Units) which covers small sum insured (about US$200 per ha). A federal premium subsidy of
      80–90 percent strongly encourages state governments to opt in to the insurance program.
      Alternatively, if they opt out, the federal government supports 60 percent of ex post disaster
      relief expenses (“direct support”). As a result, 30 out of 32 states have opted in to the insurance
      program. States can choose the type of insurance coverage (e.g., weather-based trigger, area
      yield–based trigger) and fully control the insurance payouts, which can even be used to pay
      next year’s premiums. Municipalities distribute payouts to farmers by check, and farmers need
      to show proof of identification and property title.

5.2.3	 Enable Household-Level Recovery through Social Assistance

Using social assistance programs can provide livelihood support to help people
recover from disasters. Regular social assistance programs like cash transfers and
public work programs buffer individuals from shocks. They also equip them to improve
their livelihoods and create opportunities to build a better life for themselves and
their families. In other countries, these programs and their delivery systems have
been adapted successfully to make them more responsive to disasters.

The GoV has begun efforts to strengthen the regular social assistance system
so that it is more responsive to hazards such as droughts and floods. Under a
pilot program in Can Tho City, the local social assistance delivery system is being
strengthened and adapted so that it can scale up operations in response to frequent
flooding and provide assistance to affected households. This program builds on both
national efforts to strengthen the existing system in order to identify those most in
need of assistance, and on provincial pilots that deliver cash in a predictable and
transparent manner. Much of what will be implemented in Can Tho could be shared
with provinces affected by drought. For example, as described in box 5.9, the ongoing
social protection work in Tra Vinh province in the Mekong Delta builds upon the Can
Tho flood program to focus on both flooding and drought.

     BOX 5.9: Adaptive Social Protection Feasibility Assessment for Tra Vinh Province in
     Mekong Delta

     More than 2 million people in 18 provinces in South Vietnam were affected after January
     2016 by the El Niño–linked drought and saltwater intrusion crisis. The limited capacity of the
     government and communities to manage the impact of the adverse climate conditions, restricted
     by fragmented sectoral approaches and institutional arrangement, resulted in lack of policy
     integration and exacerbated the serious socioeconomic and environmental effects. In view of
     this, efforts are underway to integrate social assistance programs to provide livelihood support
     to affected people to help recover from climate disasters also. For example, Tra Vinh—one of
     the 18 provinces to declare a state of emergency during the crisis—is a pilot province of the
     World Bank’s Social Assistance Strengthening Project (SASSP). In collaboration with MoLISA and
     Tra Vinh Department of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (DOLISA), the World Bank is currently
     assessing the feasibility of developing adaptive social protection (ASP) in Tra Vinh. Building
     upon and leveraging the work already undertaken on flooding (a rapid-onset disaster) in the
     neighboring province of Can Tho City, the Tra Vinh engagement focuses on both flooding
     and drought (slow-onset disaster). The objective is to better prepare the provinces to manage
     household disaster risk. Specifically, it is intended to help to integrate MOLISA and social
     assistance into ASP and the movement toward more integrated DRM in Vietnam.
     Note: The example above is one of three recent activities supported by GFDRR (Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
     Recovery) to strengthen and integrate DRM into ongoing larger World Bank–supported projects. See boxes 5.12 and 5.16
     for examples of the other two activities.




            Post-disaster assistance to support medium-term livelihood recovery could use
            the strengthened social assistance system as a vehicle. Since 2007, the Ministry
            of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) has provided emergency relief through
            cash and food transfers. However, global experience highlights the benefits of
            leveraging existing programs and/or delivery systems. Drawing on the existing social
            assistance system would allow the GoV to deliver assistance to affected households
            in a timely, coordinated, and transparent manner. This livelihood/income support
            could empower the most vulnerable households to better manage the risk of natural
            hazards and to better respond to their impacts when disasters occur. Box 5.10
            describes post-disaster assistance programs in Pakistan, the Philippines, and Mexico
            that rely or build on existing social assistance programs to deliver aid.

      Citizen’s Damage Compensation Program in Pakistan

      Following severe floods in 2010, the government of Paki¬stan established a temporary nationwide
      social safety net program that reached an estimated 8 million affected people. The program
      led to the government’s development of a social safety net disaster preparedness action plan.
      The program’s design allowed for its rapid implementation over a wide geographic area. Under
      its efficient beneficiary registration and payment distribution system, which was created in
      partnership with a commercial bank (United Bank Limited) and linked to the national civil registry,
      beneficiaries received US$204 through 2 million prepaid VISA-branded “Watan” debit cards
      issued for this purpose. The program was later extended to support recovery and delivered
      two additional payments of US$204 per recipient, totaling US$409 million per payment period.

      Adapting the existing Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) for Disaster Response in the Philippines

      In the three months following Super Typhoon Yolanda, which struck in November 2013, the
      government of the Philippines released US$12.5 million of unconditional cash transfers to existing
      beneficiaries of the Pantawid Pamiliya CCT program. Following pre-agreed procedures, the
      government waived the requirement that beneficiaries comply with the conditions of the CCT
      program in order to receive their payment; the waiver was in place for three months following
      the disaster. Further, the CCT program and the national household targeting system (Listahanan)
      were leveraged by the World Food Program and UNICEF, which topped up benefit amounts to
      beneficiary households in affected areas with emergency cash transfers.

      Mexico’s Temporary Employment Program (PET)

      Mexico’s Temporary Employment Program (Programa de Empleo Temporal [PET]) is a social
      safety net program that provides temporary employment in public works to marginalized groups
      and those whose livelihoods have been affected by natural disasters. The Immediate Temporary
      Employment Program (Programa de Empleo Temporal Inmediato [PETi]) is an emergency financing
      mechanism that was added to PET in 2003 to ensure PET’s timely and efficient functioning in
      response to natural disasters. It requires that all PET implementing ministries allocate a percentage
      (about 20 percent) of PET funding to a contingency budget. If necessary, additional funds from
      PET’s annual budget can be channeled through PETi. If this funding is also not adequate to
      support participation in the cash-for-work scheme for all people in need, Mexico’s Fund for
      Natural Disasters (FONDEN) can also provide supplementary resources to PET.

            Public works programs are also a viable social assistance instrument for post-
            disaster preparedness and response in Vietnam. These programs have been used in
            a number of countries to mitigate disaster risk, rehabilitate community infrastructure,
            and contribute to household recovery (see box 5.10 for an example from Mexico).
            They could be used in the same way in Vietnam; Decree No. 61/2015 lists activities
            related to “disaster prevention, response and climate change” among eligible
            projects and activities for public employment. By linking emergency assistance with
            the National Target Programs on Rural Development (NTP-NRD) and Sustainable
            Poverty Reduction (NTP-SPR), the GoV could help communities and households
            become more resilient. As box 5.11 suggests, such programs can be extensions
            of longer-term rural development programs designed to strengthen community
            resilience, rather than a response to disaster.

            Coordination among relevant agencies and their programs should be strengthened
            in order to provide an enabling environment for effective implementation of
            post-disaster social assistance. The primary agencies concerned with post-disaster
            social assistance include MoLISA (for social protection), MARD (for DRM), and MoNRE
            (for CCA). Institutionally, better coordination among the agencies will improve their
            ability to manage disaster risk effectively and efficiently, and by extension, to create
            an enabling environment for post-disaster social assistance implementation.



     BOX 5.11: Simultaneous Support for Disaster Preparedness/Resilience and Livelihoods of
     Rural Poor Under India’s Guaranteed Part-Time Rural Employment

     Public work programs are useful in securing the livelihoods of the rural poor, but they are usually
     implemented as a short-term response to a disaster rather than for longer-term preparedness and
     resilience. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005 implemented
     by the government of India aims to enhance livelihood security of rural households and to
     create public assets in rural areas, including roads and water tanks as well as infrastructure for
     water harvesting, drought relief, and flood control. Designed to help secure the livelihoods of
     the rural poor during lean periods, the program aims to simultaneously strengthen community
     resilience to disasters through community asset and infrastructure enhancement. Partnerships
     exist between the central and state governments and local NGOs, who develop and evaluate
     the program. Though a good model, efficient and effective implementation at the last mile is
     critical for the success of such programs.

5.2.4	 Shift Focus from Crisis Management to Risk Management

Effective last-mile delivery of support requires good risk and vulnerability analysis
to target local areas and populations. Risks are sector and location specific and are
compounded by socioeconomic and demographic factors. The exposure, sensitivity,
and vulnerability of different eco-regions have to be analyzed deeply to produce
the tailored risk mitigation and prevention solutions that are required for a move
from post-disaster crisis management to pre-disaster risk management (figure 4.3).
Separation and layering of risks allows for effective risk mitigation, prevention, and
coping; this point is discussed further in section 5.3.2.1 and illustrated in figure 5.1.



5.3	 Planning and Acting for the Longer Term to Build
Resilience

5.3.1 Develop and Implement Climate-Resilient Water Resource
Systems

In deltas, river basins, and other ecosystems, more effort is needed to coordinate
integrated water resources management across the water, energy, and agriculture
sectors. In these complex environments, the interlinked impacts of development from
various sectors and the efficacy of different investments in the face of climate change
and dynamic upstream development remain poorly understood. Vietnam needs to
implement comprehensive water-use policies that maximize efficiency between and
within sectors and that are appropriate at the river basin or watershed level across the
country. To optimize efficiency within sectors, policy interventions should encourage
adoption of water-saving and soil moisture technologies. Water pricing policies that
incentivize more sustainable water usage at household and production scales would
fill the most urgent gaps. Indeed, policy tools should facilitate the “waterproofing”
of economies: through land use planning, DRM, engagement of local people, and
other interventions, policies should seek to reduce the socioeconomic impacts of
extreme weather events and rainfall variability and to manage uncertainty in the future.

Each river basin should have an integrated planning framework and a multi-
sectoral decision support system. This integrated, multi-sector approach would
maximize the economic benefit of water usage in various sectors by balancing the
overall annual and monthly demand for and supply of water against water allocation
in each subbasin over space and time. Such a system would support the analysis and
assessment of various development options based on (i) cost, (ii) water demand, (iii)
water availability, (iv) economic impacts, (v) long-term consistency with development

     goals and trends in various sectors, and (vi) sustainable use of the water resources
     base. It would include two components: The first is a knowledge base, which could
     be used and shared by various sectors and which would encompass all available
     data for water demands and uses (namely agriculture, domestic, industrial, power
     generation, rural water supply, and the environment), options for development of
     water supply, and the hydrological system. The second component is a model for
     determining the best possible combination of options to satisfy all demands by
     maximizing the total net economic benefit under a set of assumptions about water
     demands, constraints, and future scenarios.

     To ensure reliable water supply in the future, increased volumes for lowland
     reservoirs are essential. Given that large reservoir volumes are less sensitive to
     the effects of climate change than small volumes, providing robust bulk supply
     infrastructure will entail building reservoirs that are as large as possible within
     engineering, environmental, social, and economic constraints. It will also entail
     managing sedimentation from the earliest stages of dam and reservoir projects,
     especially in the lowland reservoirs in the deltas, because storage loss due to
     sedimentation is the greatest threat to water dams and reservoirs. New design and
     construction should facilitate sedimentation management, and existing facilities may
     need to be retrofitted. In addition, underground aquifers can be recharged by using
     check dams to prevent water and soil runoff, and cisterns to collect and divert rainwater
     from rooftops to dry wells. In Thrissur district of Kerala state in India, about 100,000
     people have benefited since 200957 from such an initiative by the government and
     NGOs. Similar efforts are underway in the neighboring state of Karnataka through
     the World Bank assisted Watershed Development Project.58 In the first phase, also
     known as Sujala, about 230,000 farmers benefited from increased crop yields and
     household incomes. The second phase, initiated in 2013, partly converges with the
     Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act scheme (see box 5.11) to
     provide rural employment. It is expected to benefit about 160,000 farmer households
     in dry tracks across 7 districts by improving watershed management and promoting
     rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge.

     To maximize the benefits from existing irrigation infrastructure, it is critically
     important to use climate-smart irrigation and drainage systems with sustainable
     operation and maintenance. Water-efficient irrigation technologies (such as drip and
     sprinkler irrigation) should be encouraged and included in the provincial and basin-
     wide plans for water resources development and management. Such applications
     should be coupled with climate-smart agricultural measures, which rely on proper

management of soil, fertilizers, soil moisture conservation, and improved seedlings
and varieties to help ensure sustainable agriculture production.

Improving the sustainability of urban and rural water supply will more generally
require province- and basin-wide integrated planning in addition to new technical
and institutional solutions. Coastal cities such as Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang are
already seeing greater water security risks due to lower river flows and the resulting
increases in the extent of fluvial saline intrusion.

Local communities affected by water insecurity need to become more involved
in decision making about water management. One possibility for increasing
community-level involvement is to set up local water management committees
similar to the Water User Cooperative (WUC) that was formed as a result of a dynamic
partnership between the government, an international NGO, and local communities,
which enabled farmers in Thanh Hoa Province in the North Central Coast region
of Vietnam to successfully manage their water resources.59 Set up by the Cam Phu
Commune as part of the Thai Long Dam Project, the WUC mobilized local farmers to
actively participate and manage the local resources in a sustainable manner, leading
to increased government responsiveness and accountability. The farmers were fully
involved in decision making regarding water distribution plans and schedules, and
in resolving conflicts. The WUC benefited people at multiple levels—for example,
by promoting better access to irrigation and drinking water through controlled
water supply. This, in turn, reduced the work load of men, women, and children, as
farm activities became easier and collection of water for domestic use became less
time-consuming. Farmers gained better incomes due to increased crop yields, crop
diversification, and livestock and fish farming. In China, Water User Associations
(WUAs) were promoted as part of a comprehensive development program (see box
5.18 further below).

It is important that people understand the availability of and threats to water resources,
especially for agricultural production. In particular, the linkage between water scarcity
and climate change needs to be better understood by local people, as well as by
Agricultural Extension Center staff and local DARD and DoNRE officials.

Provinces can catalyze reforms by developing an integrated water resource
management plan. The case study of Ninh Thuan in box 5.12 explains the approach
taken to improve the province’s water resources planning and management practices.
Other drought-affected and vulnerable provinces could follow a similar process:
  •	 Action 1: Transform data into information for basic analysis and planning purposes.

              •	 Action 3: Conduct economic and financial analysis of all water-related activities
                 to assess water productivity.
              •	 Action 4: Conduct water systems analysis to serve as a modern planning tool.



     BOX 5.12: Water Balance Assessment in Ninh Thuan Province in South Central Vietnam

     To improve the institutional framework and technical capabilities for better drought preparedness
     in Ninh Thuan province, and to assess gaps and opportunities for better Water Resources
     Management (WRM), a preliminary assessment of the water resources availability was conducted
     in the Dinh river basin in 2015–2016. In view of DARD’s (Department of Agriculture and Rural
     Development) 2020-2030 Agriculture Development Plan pending GoV approval for new reservoir
     construction in the province, new water supply alternatives have to be identified to make Ninh
     Thuan water supply systems more resilient to extreme weather conditions. In October 2016,
     the WPP (Water Partnership Program) approved a Work Plan to enhance drought/climate
     resilience with full technical support from GoV counterparts acting at national and provincial
     levels, including NAWAPI (National Center for Water Resources Planning and Investigation).
     The program has undertaken water system analysis in the entire Dinh River Basin. It addresses
     water use across sectors (hydropower, irrigation, urban/rural water supply and aquaculture)
     and covers both surface water and groundwater sources. Keeping environmental constraints
     and minimum supply cost in mind, the ultimate objectives are to determine the optimal size
     of reservoirs (present and future) and the optimal level of groundwater abstractions to meet
     current and future demands.

            Finally, there is a need for a longer-term vision for integrated water resource
            management. The current National Water Resources Strategy is only through 2020.
            The plan and vision should address the longer term, perhaps 30 to 50 years. It should
            also seek to maximize efficiency between and within sectors.60



            5.3.2	 Promote Climate-Resilient and Climate-Smart Agriculture

            Existing agricultural systems should be reviewed, and appropriate, sustainable,
            natural resource–based farming systems and practices should be promoted. The
            current emphasis on rice production must give way to more diversified agriculture
            and cropping patterns. In some cases, farmers are already adapting to climate

impacts by planting resilient crop varieties, changing planting dates, and adapting
farming practices to a shorter growing season, as well as by using water-harvesting
techniques and soil moisture conservation. But farmers still face many barriers to
adaptation, often related to policy shortcomings, resource constraints, and lack of
technologies and information.

5.3.2.1 Adopt Climate-Smart Agriculture Practices More Widely

Climate-smart agriculture leverages good agricultural practices (GAP) and
integrates the three dimensions of sustainable development (economic, social,
and environmental) by jointly addressing food security and climate challenges.
While rice remains Vietnam’s dominant food staple, its importance in the national
economy and diet is declining; approaches that enable flexible land-use planning
based on agro-ecological suitability, likely climate change impact, and risks and
profitability to the producers should be considered going forward. The current policies
that encourage rice production in marginal areas (and other, related incentives) should
be revisited. In addition, efforts should be made to identify the exposure, sensitivity,
and vulnerability of different eco-regions and take location-specific measures to meet
their needs. Global experiences show that an enabling environment for managing risk
in agriculture can be created by cumulatively layering risks according to the severity
and probability of occurrence. As seen in figure 5.1, risk mitigation can be achieved
in layer 1, where farmers manage risks as part of their regular business strategies
(improving water-holding capacity of soil, introducing high-yielding seed varieties,
etc.). In layer 2, the risks are of medium impact (hail damage, market price variation,
etc.) and can be managed through market instruments (weather insurance, farmers’
cooperatives). Risk transfer occurs here, in addition to risk mitigation from layer 1.
In layer 3, risks are rare, extremely severe, and beyond the farmer’s control (severe
drought, floods, disease outbreak, etc.); they require government and supporting
institutions to intervene and help with recovery. Risk coping occurs in this layer. By
identifying and layering risks based on their severity, the government can create
an enabling environment where production and market events are more efficient.
Periodic review of these risks and layers is necessary for effective deployment.

A number of short-, medium-, and long-term solutions for increasing communities’
adaptive capacities and resilience are available; they make use of early warning
and climate information services, “designer” crop varieties, adjustments to cropping
calendars and cropping intensities, proper management of natural resources (water,
soils, aquaculture and crops), diversification (rice-shrimp, salt- and drought-tolerant
fruit trees; grass/fodder and vegetable intercropping; multi-species fish culture and
livestock), and improved information and knowledge dissemination. Beyond the

            Value chains should be strengthened to create better linkages between farm
            and market that in turn enable better risk management. Farm-to-market links
            depend on supply chains (figure 5.2), which are sensitive to climate risks. Good
            storage facilities not only limit supply chain–associated risks but also ensure the
            producer is not under pressure to sell immediately. Storage units also cut the supply
            chain short, which may increase the producer’s economic advantage. Government-
            sponsored fair-price produce markets, along with value addition through agro-
            processing, can help to strengthen farm-to-market links. Improved value chains at
            all levels are critical to building strong links. Overall, the GoV should seek to reduce
            risks related to production and markets as well as those related to policy failure.

The government can facilitate the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices
through improved policies, programs, and investments, including crop and
livestock insurance, social safety nets, integrated water resource management and
markets, and development and dissemination of drought-, heat-, saline-, and flood-
tolerant crops. The adoption of GAP—especially use of technologies to save water
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions—should be compulsory rather than voluntary.
Farmers should diversify their crops and move to crops that require less water; and in
saline-intruded areas, farmers should gradually transition from freshwater-dependent
aquaculture to sustainable brackish water aquaculture.

Government and public sectors must provide strategic support if such climate-
smart measures are to be implemented. Specifically, MARD needs to take the
following steps in a cost-effective, market-efficient manner:

  1.	Develop financing programs and incentive policies that encourage small farmers
     to adopt GAP, starting from major crops, such as rice, coffee, and vegetables;

  2.	Restructure the ministry’s public research and extension to focus on drought- and
     saline-resilient crops;

  3.	Review and update land use regularly;

  4.	Allow and facilitate transition from freshwater crops to sustainable brackish water
     aquaculture in coastal areas; and

  5.	Support a watershed development approach and improve on-farm water use
     efficiency.

In the short term, MARD and provinces might adjust their ongoing projects and
programs to entail the compulsory adoption of some minimum GAP. In the medium
term (three to five years), the ongoing Agricultural Restructuring Program should

  1.	Devote more resources to research, extension, and farmer training that focus on
     developing drought- and saline-resilient crops (with priority given to the Mekong
     Delta and Central Highland regions)

  2.	Develop additional infrastructure and financing programs (which will be linked to
     the extension programs) to enable small farmers to adopt newly recommended
     farming systems and cropping structures

  3.	Build capacity to allow small farmers to link with agribusinesses along value
     chains to improve their marketability and profitability

            Finally, in the long term (5 to 10 years), the central and provincial governments should
            revisit the existing food security strategy and rice land policy to allow conversion of
            rice lands to brackish water aquaculture in areas less suitable and less economically
            viable for rice.

            The GoV needs support in strengthening climate information through various means:
            better forecasting and early warning systems, better water resource management
            and use in irrigated areas, water harvesting and soil water conservation in dryland
            farming, mapping of vulnerable areas, and development and implementation of
            region-specific contingency plans based on vulnerability and risk assessments. Box
            5.13 gives an example of how farmers in Thailand benefited from the government’s
            policy to restrict winter dry-season rice cultivation as an emergency response to
            climate disaster. Integrating and implementing the right policies and procedures will
            support the conversion of more communes into climate-smart villages (CSVs; see
            box 5.14), especially in high-risk areas that are likely to suffer most from climate
            change.



     BOX 5.13: Restricting Rice Production and Sales as Emergency Response in Thailand

     Thailand’s rice harvest dipped to its lowest in nine years in 2016 due to El Niño–caused water
     shortages. The following measures were taken to manage the water crisis:
      1.	 A shift from rice to corn production: The government worked with private associations,
          including the Thai Feed Mills Association, the Thai Seed Trade Association, and the Bank for
          Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC), to encourage farmers in irrigated areas
          to shift from marketing year (MY) 2016/17 off-season rice production to corn production.
          Close to 0.3 million ha of farmland located in the northern and northeastern regions was
          targeted to reduce off-season rice supply by 1.25 million metric tons (MT) and increase
          corn production by 1.4 million MT. Participating farmers are eligible for a loan of B 4, 000
          per rai (US$714 per ha) from the BAAC.
      2.	 Stabilization of domestic rice prices: In November 2016, the cabinet approved the On-Farm
          Rice Pledging Program for fragrant and glutinous rice (for farmers) and the Interest-Rate
          Subsidy Program (for millers/traders) with the aim of keeping about half the newly harvested
          fragrant and white rice off the market in order to stabilize domestic prices. Participating
          farmers receive a direct payment of B 13,000 per MT of pledged fragrant rice (US$371 per
          MT). Nonparticipating farmers receive a direct payment of B 2,000 per MT (US$57 per MT).

     The restriction on winter dry-season rice cultivation was lifted following abundant rainfall in
     early 2017, which replenished major reservoirs supplying the agriculture sector and resulted in
     a remarkable recovery in rice crop acreage (estimated increase of 975,000 ha) and vegetative
     vigor compared to 2016.

      BOX 5.14: Climate-Smart Villages as an Integrated Community-Based Approach to
      Resilience

      Leveraging lessons learned from global experiences is critical in putting the right plans and
      procedures in place to strengthen resilience to climate risk. Experiences of national and international
      agencies such as ICAR, CCAFS-CGIAR, and CIMMYT show that communities are able to build
      climate-smart villages (CSVs) when they follow good farm management practices based on
      weather forecasts; use water, nutrients, and energy in an integrated and efficient manner; and
      are empowered by knowledge and gender equality. In such successful communities, there is
      support for farmers’ groups and cooperatives, as well as protection and inclusion of women,
      youth, and vulnerable groups. Strong links between stakeholders at all levels promote local
      adaptation of good practices. These CSVs are fully equipped for resilience to climate change.
      In Vietnam, Ma, My Loi, and Tra Hat villages—located in provinces in the northern (Yen Bai),
      central (Ha Tinh), and southern (Bac Lieu) regions, respectively—were chosen to build CSVs in
      2015.a Ma village in Yen Bai province was recently showcased as a successful CSV to encourage
      further integration of agricultural technologies to enhance adaptive capacity and build resilient
      livelihoods.b The success of these CSVs calls for the involvement of more communities and
      adoption across the country.

      Following good practices enables communities to build CSVs equipped for resilience to
      climate change

     5.3.2.2	Improve Coastal Zone Management and Aquaculture

     Central and provincial governments should adopt an inter-sectoral spatial planning
     (ISP) approach. ISPs improve effectiveness in coastal zone and marine management
     and reduce conflicts in planning among sectors. The current system has a range
     of problems: responsibilities for coastal zone planning are spread across different
     sectors; planners and policy makers operate on the basis of limited, imprecise, or
     out-of-date data; different sectors in the same province often compete with one
     another, which leads to duplicative investments and inconsistent (or conflicting)
     plans and approaches; and anticipated private investments are often not reflected
     in government plans.

     MARD and provinces should take the following steps to improve coastal zone
     and marine management:

      1.	Adopt an ISP approach by establishing and maintaining trained ISP teams at
         provincial and district levels and conducting ISP for all coastal districts and
         communes. Doing so will help to eliminate overlaps and enhance multi-sectoral
         coordination based on different sectors’ present and future demands and the
         need for sustainable management of land and water resources.

      2.	Stop treating SWI as an enemy, and stop unnecessary investments to fight and
         protect rice against saline intrusion in areas where rice production is no longer
         economically viable.

      3.	Facilitate the gradual transition to a brackish water economy in drought- and
         saline-intruded areas.

      4.	Adopt sustainable brackish water/marine aquaculture and co-management of
         near-shore capture fisheries by scaling up GAP that are already available in the
         regions.

     In the short term, MARD and the provinces should adjust their ongoing coastal
     projects and programs to scale up GAP; in particular, wastewater treatments and
     biosecurity standards to better control shrimp disease should be made compulsory.
     In the medium term (three to five years), MARD and the provinces should modify
     coastal dikes and sluice gates (originally constructed to protect freshwater rice) to
     develop sustainable brackish water aquaculture, including farming of shrimp-mangrove
     and eco-farming (box 5.15), rice-shrimp, and polyculture. Finally, in the long term
     (5–10 years), the central and provincial governments should formally move from
     fragmented sectoral planning to ISP, and should build capacity at all levels to empower
     local communities in sustainable co-management of coastal and marine resources.

      BOX 5.15: Management of Aquatic Farm Ecosystems in Coastal Regions of Bangladesh

      Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Global sea-level rises,
      coupled with more frequent and intense cyclones, monsoonal flooding, rising temperatures,
      and increased salinity, have led to water and food security challenges in the country’s coastal
      southwest. The International Water Management Institute started a project in 2012 to improve
      land, water, and ecosystem management, and to enhance the productivity and diversity of fish
      farms in villages along the southwest coast. The project adopted a participatory approach to
      engage local farmers in the process, and comprised the following activities:
        •	 Participatory forums involving 50 farmers in a weekly Farmers Field School to evaluate new
           climate-smart farming systems, water management, and strategies to cope with climate
           change
        •	 The identification of crops that could be grown on canal embankments and in increasingly
           saline environments, to reduce dependency on single-crop farming and improve household

5.3.2.3	Adopt an Integrated Approach to Adaptive Delta Management

The complexity of issues in the Mekong Delta necessitates an integrated approach
to its management and development. The Mekong Delta covers a range of sectors
(including agriculture, urban, energy, and environment) and divergent institutional
and policy landscapes; it also confronts problems at various temporal scales, from
daily operational issues to long-term climate change concerns. But in this complex
delta environment, the impacts of alternate development options on various sectors
remain poorly understood. Nor is it clear what investments will be most effective
in the face of climate change and dynamic upstream development. Delta planners
and decision makers face important strategic decisions, across sectors, on the future
direction and nature of development amid an uncertain future that partly lies outside
their control.

One way to simplify this complexity is to take an area-based (or spatial) approach
that emphasizes water resources management and appropriate land use. In
light of the 2015–2016 drought and SWI crisis, this approach must begin with better

     coordination across institutions. In particular, the following medium- and long-term
     measures should continue to be prioritized:

       1.	The current institutional landscape—in which planning and sectoral implementation
          roles are spread across several ministries and agencies—should be simplified.
          Using the new pilot regulation for regional coordination, the GoV should address
          fragmented planning and decision making by developing institutional mechanisms
          for overseeing delta-wide plans and investments.

       2.	Planning at the inter-sectoral, interprovincial, and interministerial levels should
          be strengthened. Currently, sectoral plans at provincial and regional levels are
          not reconciled; nor are they proof-tested against possible development/climate
          change scenarios to ensure they are robust.

       3.	Information systems and mechanisms should be developed to enhance data
          sharing, scenario analysis, research collaboration, and decision support. In the
          fragmented institutional environment, it is not surprising that data, information,
          and analysis are also fragmented across various research agencies (often affiliated
          with key sectoral ministries), with no protocols for data sharing and very limited
          collaboration.

             Promote Climate Resilience in Central Highlands
     5.3.2.4 	

     Water scarcity, soil erosion, and monoculture-related yield loss are major issues
     in the Central Highlands, and are becoming more pressing in the face of climate
     change. The Central Highlands region—where Robusta coffee plantations are
     well established and plantations of rubber, black pepper, cashew, and cassava are
     expanding—is already affected by severe drought (table 2.1). Predicted climate shifts
     are expected to raise the vulnerability level of these crops, according to a 2013 USAID
     study61 (see section 2.3 for more details). The problems can be laid out as follows:

       1.	By 2050, increased water scarcity, higher temperatures, and changing land use are
          expected to have major impacts on the cultivation of rubber, coffee, and cassava.

       2.	High incidence of storms and high rainfall will lead to more floods and flash
          floods, making crops and livelihoods more vulnerable.

       3.	In particular, increase in rainfall and storm frequency will increase soil erosion on
          the slopes, where cassava and maize culture is currently expanding.

       4.	Higher temperatures will affect yield in addition to increasing demand for more
          water to irrigate rice and coffee. Higher temperature will also result in an altitude

      shift for rubber, cassava, and coffee cultivation, affecting areas that are currently
      expanding.

  5.	Area expansion and forest encroachment—due to the changing land use for the
     cultivation of upland rice, coffee, and rubber—will indirectly affect the livestock,
     aquaculture, and fisheries sectors.

It is important to identify adaptation measures at crop, farm, and community
levels. Crops’ vulnerability to climate change (illustrated in figure 2.3) depends on
their exposure and sensitivity to the risk, and varies between species. Given the risks
that the Central Highlands are exposed to, resilient and sustainable cropping systems
have to be built with appropriate adaptations now. Adaptation options, some of
which are already in use in Vietnam, include the following:

  1.	At crop level. Use of stress-tolerant and early maturing varieties (specifically
     for coffee, maize, and cassava); crop diversification and sustainable cultivation
     using agro-forestry systems and tolerant crops like rubber, cashew, and pepper;
     altitude shift for coffee; alternative cropping (rubber instead of rice), SRI (if rice
     cultivation cannot be avoided); crop rotation and conservation agriculture;
     inter-cropping with legumes

  2.	At farm level. Mulching and cover-cropping; soil-erosion control on slopes; shift
     to organic/green manure; shade trees in coffee plantations; rainwater harvesting
     and other water saving techniques; shift in cropping calendar to avoid peak events

  3.	At community level. Involvement of local people in building community assets
     by adopting measures for soil erosion control in slopes (through drainage canals,
     rainwater capturing reservoirs, flood protection infrastructure); measures to
     address deforestation, groundwater overexploitation, and land degradation
     (as commercial coffee plantations take over natural forests); and measures to
     conserve water and soil (to avoid the excessive and wasteful irrigation currently
     practiced on coffee plantations).

Box 5.16 describes an ongoing activity to promote sustainable agriculture. A component
of the Vietnam Sustainable Agriculture Transformation Project (VnSAT), the program’s
objective is to help small scale coffee farmers in the Central Highlands to increase
their income while simultaneously reducing negative environmental impacts.

     BOX 5.16: Supporting Sustainable Coffee Production and Rejuvenation in Central Highlands

     Climate change induced higher temperatures and frequent dry spells have significantly affected
     coffee yields in the Central Highlands. To facilitate a sustainable transformation in coffee production
     to increase farmers’ income while reducing negative environmental impacts, a component
     of VnSAT is underway. A total of 62,000 small-scale coffee plantations were selected in five
     target provinces in Central Highlands to promote good farm management practices, increase
     adoption of water saving technologies and tree management, and train farmer organizations and
     cooperatives. The objective is to integrate DRM into all these activities while helping provinces
     to improve coffee production. In 2016, VnSAT provided training on “three reductions, three
     gains” (3R3G) and “one must, five reductions” (1M5R) cultivation techniques. 3R3G refers to
     reduction in 3 inputs (seed, chemicals and water) and gains in 3 outputs (productivity, quality and
     economic efficiency). 1M5R refers to use of registered seeds and reductions in 5 inputs – seed,
     chemical fertilizer, pesticide, water use and post-harvest losses. In May 2017, an assessment of
     coffee planters that were provided with training revealed that Dak Lak and Lam Dong provinces
     achieved positive results in general though some criteria were not met.



           It is also important for farmers to have access to information on market price fluctuations
           to build confidence in future markets, and to prevent abandonment of established
           crops in favor of crops that seem more lucrative. For example, when cashew prices
           dropped, some farmers in the region replaced cashew with coffee, rubber, or fruit
           trees.62 When cashew prices stabilized, but coffee and fruit plantations were hit by
           drought, these farmers were particularly affected.

           5.3.2.5	Establish Effective Financing Mechanisms for Climate Change
           Adaptation

           Mobilizing resources to address the increasing demands of climate change and green
           growth will require continued proactive engagement from the GoV to improve the
           scale and quality of financing. The government has already adopted a number of
           programs and initiatives, chief among them the National Target Program to Respond
           to Climate Change (NTP-RCC); this 10-year, two-phase program culminated at the
           end of 2015 and focused on scientific analysis, capacity building, and development of
           sector and provincial climate change action plans. While this program has helped to
           mainstream climate change within line ministries and provinces, there are opportunities
           to further enhance both the level and efficiency of public investment. The recent
           Climate Public Expenditure and Investment Review (CPEIR) notes that in 2012–2013,
           about 69 percent of the government’s climate change response expenditures from

the five key climate-relevant line ministries were from domestic sources, with a vast
majority directed toward adaptation.63 The CPEIR indicates that the GoV’s financial
commitment to a firm climate change response is ongoing, despite a tightening
fiscal environment. But it also finds that the magnitude, targeting, and effectiveness
of public financing is not yet sufficient to address Vietnam’s key climate-induced
development challenges and to promote a greener and higher quality of growth.
Vietnam’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) takes into account this challenge,
with resource mobilization for adaptation a recognized priority. The GoV is working
toward accessing additional international finance for climate change response and
green growth projects from official development assistance, targeted climate finance
initiatives such as the Green Climate Fund, and the private sector.



5.3.3	 Invest in Community-Based Approaches

Institutionalizing community-based approaches is essential for sustainable
development. Lessons learned through carrying out successive poverty reduction
programs and from Vietnam’s nascent national CBDRM program show that participatory
approaches strengthen community resilience and promote sustainable development.
Local people in the communes and wards often provide the most legitimate, informed,
and reliable sources of information about their locality and their own priorities.
People on the ground benefit more from both national and local-level strategies
and investments when the local government adopts a more participatory approach
and involves local people in risk assessment and disaster preparedness, and when it
integrates disaster risk and climate change into local socio-development planning.

For DRM, CCA, livelihood security, and integrated water resource management,
approaches that engage local people play a crucial part in building resilience.
Experience shows that many poor and near-poor households are pushed further
back into poverty following a disaster. Community-based approaches involve such
households in decisions about how to address future natural hazards and climate
change impacts. Unlike public investment programs for DRM and poverty reduction,
which work comparatively slowly, community-based approaches tend to offer more
immediate results. Combined with top-down approaches, they offer an effective
mechanism for reducing vulnerability to climate hazards and eventually for reducing
poverty.

Community-based approaches—including investments, capacity building, and
planning activities—can be used to promote the implementation of resilience
measures. Community-based approaches enable genuine participation in decision

           making across all sectors and can be implemented as stand-alone projects or as
           part of larger-scale investment programs. Mainstreaming DRM and CCA in SEDPs
           in communes achieves considerable reduction in risk and vulnerability, even though
           budgets are small. Several international NGOs have supported local planning in
           communes and at higher administrative levels; this approach has proved successful
           when carried out as part of community-based projects in provinces with high levels
           of poverty, significant climate-related vulnerabilities, and limited financial and human
           resources. Given that the drought-stricken areas involve many micro-climate zones,
           the planning of investments should actively involve stakeholders at the community
           level; in this way solutions can be tailored to specific circumstances.

           Partnerships and cooperation between governments and agencies are critical in
           strengthening the resilience of the most vulnerable. Box 5.17 describes two examples:
           (i) a partnership between the government in Guatemala and international agencies
           to build resilient communities in the Dry Corridor, and (ii) the Intergovernmental
           Authority on Development (IGAD) that is helping its member countries in the Horn
           of Africa (HOA) build climate resilient communities in a sustainable manner.



     BOX 5.17: Fostering Government Partnerships to Build Sustainable Communities

     Partnering for resilience in Guatemala
     In Guatemala, the government is partnering with three agencies—FAO, the International Fund
     for Agricultural Development, and the World Food Programme—in an initiative to build the
     resilience of communities and food systems in the Dry Corridor. In this region, where poverty,
     malnutrition, and drought risks are high and basic services are scarce, the partnership is promoting
     early warning systems to help families bounce back quickly from disasters. Longer-term risk
     prevention and mitigation activities include rehabilitating infrastructure, diversifying food
     production, and strengthening farmer organizations, as well as promoting community-based
     savings and loans, public-private partnerships, and inter-sectoral policy dialogue on resilience.

     Sustainable development initiative in the Horn of Africa (HOA)
     The Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) comprises eight member countries in
     the Horn of Africa (HOA), which is characterized by severe and frequent droughts. To address
     this concern and to build resilience to future climate disasters in a sustainable manner, IGAD
     undertook the Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative (IDDRSI) in 2011 to
     introduce sustainable development strategies, policies, and programs at member state and
     regional levels. Specifically, IDDRSI focuses on coordinated actions and enhanced partnerships
     at national, regional, and international levels to support sustainable development rather than
     simply provide humanitarian aid. With core functions in knowledge management and capacity
     development, IDDRSI aims to help communities and households by reducing food and nutrition

      insecurity through a holistic and integrated approach, and by addressing poverty and environmental
      degradation issues by building resilience to drought and other climate hazards in the region. The
      commitment to end drought emergencies is further enhanced by the IGAD Climate Prediction
      and Applications Centre (ICPAC), which offers climate services for sustainable development in
      the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA). It is the regional institution on climate information and its
      functions include DRM, capacity building, environmental monitoring, information dissemination,
      and awareness raising within the GHA. IGAD comprises eight member countries: Djibouti, Eritrea,
      Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Uganda. ICPAC is responsible for climate
      services in IGAD member countries as well as Burundi, Rwanda, and Tanzania.

Continued investment is needed to sustain the national CBDRM program and
ensure effective implementation across the country’s 6,000 communes. Under
the national CBDRM program, the GoV has established policies and participatory
institutional arrangements to carry out and manage community-based actions.
Community-based approaches should continue to seek inclusiveness as they work
to strengthen capacity for DRM, water resource management, and CCA. Specifically,
these approaches should be viewed as an integral part of continuing sustainable
development, consistent with the needs of current and future generations.

See boxes 5.9, 5.12 and 5.16 for examples of the most recent activities supported
by GFDRR (Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery) to strengthen and
integrate DRM into ongoing larger World Bank–supported projects in Vietnam.



5.3.4	 Empower Vulnerable Groups and Populations to be Resilient

Efforts to promote community empowerment must begin with individual
empowerment. Ultimately, the members of a community are the ones who must be
empowered with knowledge and access to information. Adequate training about GAP,
along with clear information about their entitlements, rights, and responsibilities within
and outside the community, equips farmers to be more prepared for and resilient to
climate change. Creation of farmers’ groups—based on farm size and type as well as
social factors such as gender and ethnicity—empowers farmers as a collective voice to
demand and expect better service, good governance, and cooperation from involved
agencies. In general, women farmers have less access to information and services
than male farmers; women who head households may have family responsibilities
that prevent them from accessing information. Including women farmers, youth, and
socially disadvantaged groups in community asset building and decision making
empowers them and the community as a whole (boxes 5.18 and 5.19).

     BOX 5.18: Helping Chinese Farmers Adapt to Climate Change Through Comprehensive
     Agricultural Development (CAD)

     Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Loan Project III (IAIL3) in China was a large-scale initiative
     under Comprehensive Agricultural Development (CAD) implemented by the State Office of
     Comprehensive Agricultural Development (SOCAD) within the Ministry of Finance. Activities
     under CAD are funded by the central government of China to support agricultural and ecological
     development, strengthen agricultural infrastructure, ensure national food security, advance
     agro-processing production, and increase farmers’ income. Building on the success of IAIL1
     and IAIL2, and partly financed through a World Bank loan, IAIL3 aimed to enhance adaptation
     of agriculture and water management practices by increasing awareness about climate change
     and through capacity building. It was implemented from 2005 to 2010 in five provinces—Hebei,
     Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan—in the 3H Plain of the Yellow, Huaihe, and Haihe River
     basins. The 3H Plain is the major agricultural zone in China. SOCAD incorporated climate change
     adaptation actions into IAIL3 with additional funding by the Global Environmental Facility
     (GEF) through the Mainstreaming Climate Change Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture project.
     Engineering, agronomic, and management measures were taken to promote water saving,
     increase agricultural yield, and secure farmers’ livelihood, as summarized below:
      •	 Yield improvement. Farmers’ income was increased by the use of early maturing and
         drought- and pest-resistant varieties of wheat to improve yields. Greenhouses were built
         through the project to encourage farmers to grow off-season vegetables, thus increasing
         their income.
      •	 Infrastructure improvement. Water-stopping walls and sluices were introduced as an
         adaptive water-saving measure. The walls help maintain the water table in addition to
         containing discharge of harmful chemicals into water bodies, and the sluices enable storage
         of irrigation water.
      •	 Education and outreach. Expert teams organized farmer training to raise awareness of and
         build capacity for climate change adaptation. Experts from China Agriculture University
         and the Home of Rural Women, a nonprofit organization, delivered targeted training to
         women, particularly addressing their active role in the project and adaptation activities.
      •	 Farmers’ participation. To encourage active participation of farmers, specifically women,
         water user associations (WUAs) and specialized agricultural associations were promoted.
         To encourage farmers to take ownership of managing and maintaining the facilities and
         adaptation methods, irrigation facilities were constructed and handed over to WUAs.

      BOX 5.19: Empowering Women Farmers and Protecting Vulnerable Groups Against
      Weather Risk Through Index Insurance in Rwanda and Kenya

      According to FAO estimates, giving women
      farmers the same access to credit and other
      financial tools available to male farmers could
      lead to 30 percent higher yields—resulting in
      up to 150 million fewer people going hungry.
      Natural hazards can severely affect small
      farmers, particularly women farmers, making
      them less interested in input investment and
      farm expansion. Insuring small farms against
      natural disasters through index insurance
      helps stabilize income in spite of weather
      uncertainties.

      The Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) and
      the World Bank Group have been supporting
      innovative, nontraditional index insurance
      programs in Sub-Saharan Africa since 2009.
      In Rwanda, fragmented landholding makes it difficult for farmers to access credit and risk
      management tools. However, by collectively enrolling farmers in index insurance programs, GIIF
      and its partners MicroEnsure and ACRE (Agriculture and Climate Risk Enterprise, formerly Kilimo
      Salama) have made it easy for women farmers to aggregate and seek coverage for weather-
      related risks. This approach is also commercially feasible for the insurer and has resulted in
      more stable incomes for women farmers. In Kenya, index insurance has enabled thousands of
      women farmers to continue farming even after recent droughts. They were able to buy seeds
      and fertilizers for the next growing season using funds provided by the ACRE program, which
      was initiated by GIIF and supported by Swiss Re.

      Similar index insurance programs are being implemented in other parts of the world, a step toward
      closing the gender gap in farming and making small farms more resilient and sustainable. For
      example, ACRE launched the Replanting Guarantee program in India in 2016 after a successful
      pilot project. Using rainfall as an index parameter, the program offers a payout to insured farmers
      if there is too little rainfall between June 15 and July 15 during the monsoon season.

Engage farmers by creating groups at the community level to build a strong
local foundation before initiating work at higher levels. Location specificity and
socioeconomic conditions come into play in such engagements. Inclusive approaches
to interviewing progressive farmers and sharing success stories encourage others
to follow. It is critical that such activities be tailored to the needs of different groups

     and communities. The information has to be available at the local level to ensure
     that it reaches—and addresses the needs of—individuals.

     Enable productive vertical and horizontal linkages between stakeholders.
     Familiarity with and trust in the information provider will influence how well information
     is received by farmers. It is thus important for Agricultural Extension Centers to be
     regularly and proactively involved with farmers rather than approach them only when
     disaster strikes. Center workers should be trained adequately and regularly so that they
     are themselves well informed. Better linkages and integration between research and
     extension are necessary, as training and implementation are continuous processes.
     It is equally important for the government and financing agencies to ensure that the
     funds disbursed to farming communities are utilized efficiently. An effective vertical
     and horizontal linkage between all the stakeholders is key to achieving this objective.



     5.4	 Recommended Actions
     A holistic and integrated approach that includes both structural and nonstructural
     measures is proposed to address impacts of drought and SWI and to promote
     longer-term resilience measures across key sectors. Tackling the impacts of all
     types of disaster risks nationally will require well thought-out strategic planning and
     coordinated implementation of medium- and long-term measures from a multi-hazard
     perspective. Such planning must be backed by sound local knowledge, scientific
     understanding (for targeting and prioritizing investments for technology development
     and adoption), infrastructure creation, and capacity building. To effectively address
     the drought and SWI, an integrated approach using both structural and nonstructural
     interventions (policies, capacity building, information, technologies, infrastructure,
     and services) is needed.

     Table 5.1 provides options drawn from global good practices as well as from Vietnam’s
     experience with the 2015–2016 drought and SWI. To develop location-specific action
     plans (short and longer term) for different geographic areas based on their vulnerability
     to external shocks (such as extreme weather) and socioeconomic characteristics, these
     preliminary recommendations should be further prioritized and refined.

     Some recommendations are grouped together in the table below, but they can be
     further expanded as necessary. Actions that are needed in the immediate or short
     term (less than two years) are given under the “short term” time frame. Those that
     require a longer implementation period (more than two years) are addressed under
     the “medium/long term” time frame. In the table, the time frames are indicated by
     green bars. When action begins in the short term and continues over a longer term,
     the green bar spans both time frames.

Support from the World Bank
The World Bank can offer both financial and technical assistance to support
the government of Vietnam (GoV) in implementing resilient development
investments. Drawing on lessons from global good practices and from tested and
proven measures in Vietnam, as well as on country-specific knowledge from an active
and long-standing investment portfolio, the Bank has developed priority actions
for the short, medium, and long term. Using proven global practices and involving
stakeholders at all levels will encourage adoption of the identified measures and
thus help to build resilience to drought and SWI.

The World Bank’s development assistance objectives fit into the longer-term
recovery time frame. The emergency response plan prepared by the United Nations
and the GoV provided both a summary of recommended actions for the humanitarian
phase (three to five months) and recommendations for longer-term recovery. An initial
review of the Bank’s active portfolio focused on several of the actions listed in the
emergency response plan’s recovery table, including measures to strengthen priority
infrastructure and to build capacity for greater climate resilience in the government
and among local communities. Considering that a portion of recovery could be
supported by reprogramming from existing development allocations, there is also an
urgent need to transform risk management over the longer term so that the normal
flow of development interventions is not jeopardized. Efforts that build on or address
gaps in the country’s ongoing programs to promote resilience will have immediate
and substantial benefits for future economic growth.
