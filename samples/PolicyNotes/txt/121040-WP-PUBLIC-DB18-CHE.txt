About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

        The fee ranges from CHF 600 (for capital of CHF 20,000) to a maximum of CHF
        10,000. The costs of the commercial register will be increased depending on
        the number of signatories and shareholders of the company (CHF 20 for
        each person and CHF 30 for each signatory power) according to the
        Ordinance on Commercial Register Fees.

        In 5 to 9 days, the Registry publishes the date of the statutes and all names
        of shareholders in the Swiss Commercial Gazette; the announcement fee is
        included in the registration fee. Entry in the Commercial Register protects
        the company’s trade name and makes it a legal entity. Required documents
        also include the Stampa Declaration Form and Lex Friedrich Declaration
        Form as well as automatic registration for income tax payment.

        In case the stamp duty threshold has been reached, every company has the
        duty to ll out a form, le it with the Federal Tax Administration, and pay the
        relevant amount due within 30 days upon registration in the commercial

        Within 30 days of being subject to VAT, an application for VAT registration
        can be led with the Federal Tax Administration only after incorporating the
        company with the Commercial Registry. According to Art. 10 Paragraph 2 Lit.
        A of the "Bundesgesetz über die Mehrwertsteuer," the turnover threshold for
        mandatory VAT registration is CHF 100,000. Because not every company is
        subject to VAT, a procedure exists to determine whether the company is
        subject to this tax.

        After the company has registered with the Commercial Registry, the
        Cantonal Social Security O ce (Ausgleichskasse) will send the application for
        registering employees in the social security system to each newly
        incorporated and registered company. This includes includes retirement and
        survivors’ insurance bene ts (AHV), disability insurance (IV), occupational

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      The parties (usually the seller) must give noti cation to the competent
      notary o ce (Notariatsamt) regarding a sales contract. In the case of the
      Canton of Zurich, this is a public o ce, which is in charge of the public notary

      contract cannot be established between private persons. The contract does
      not legally exist until it is authenticated with the help of a notary or the

      agree on the conditions of the future contract, there is no contract. With the
      result of their negotiations, they will go to the notary o ce to explain what
      they have agreed upon. The notary then will verify that these agreements are
      valid (conditions are legal, possible, seller and buyer are able from a civil
      point of view), and when necessary, the notary must help the parties to
      complete the contract to insure its validity.

  2   A notary public prepares the sale contract                                            7-14 days           CHF 150 (Excerpt
      Agency : Notary                                                                                           from the Registry of

      Preparation of the sale contract by a notary is mandatory in the canton
      Zurich, due to the cantonal law concerning land registration. For e.g. in the
      canton Basel-Stadt the parties can do it themselves. The sales contract must
      include the price of the land, the land parcel number, the information on
      both parties, and the extract from land register concerning this land parcel,
      as well as all costs which emerge by this contract. In the case of the Canton
      of Zurich, the "Notariatsamt" (notary) is also the "Grundbuchamt" (land
      registry). Therefore the extract is obtained at the same time. Otherwise an
      extract in the Canton of Zurich is obtained in 7-14 days and costs
      approximately CHF 150 (for an excerpt from the Registry of Deeds about a
      speci c property where all information can be taken out such as the
      measures of the property, the owner, the mortgages, etc.).

  3   The contract is signed before the public notary                                       1 day               0.1% of property

      If the contract has been signed and the money transferred the transfer of
      ownership title will be entered in writing in the register of the deeds by the
      registrar. In such contracts, before transfer of ownership title can take place,
      the money will be transferred to a blocked bank account and will only be
      released after registration. The registration fee (0.15% of property value) is
      paid at the moment of registration.
      The voters approved a reduction of the fee for the registration at the

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of enforcing contracts is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
enforcing contracts. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indicators.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
