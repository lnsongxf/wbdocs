The North-East Nigeria Recovery and Peace Building Assessment
(RPBA) was undertaken by the Federal Government of the Republic
of Nigeria, led by the Office of the Vice President and the State Gov-
ernments of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe.
The assessment was supported by the European Union (EU), the
United Nations (UN), and The World Bank (WB).

The Government of Nigeria Core RPBA Team consisted of Dr. Mari-
am Masha, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Internally
Displaced Persons and Focal Points from the six states, including:
Maurice Vunobolki (Adamawa); Mohammed Aminu Ibrahim (Bau-
chi); Dr. Baba Gana Umara (Borno); Aliyu M. Kamara (Gombe); Jeji
Williams (Taraba); and Muhammad Yusufari (Yobe).

The strong support and the contributions of the many different
national stakeholders was remarkable. The dedication of the RPBA
teams from the Federal and State Governments and three institutions
was exceptional. Special thanks go to the Federal and State Govern-
ments, the EU, UN and WB, and the United Kingdom’s Department
for International Development (DFID) for financial support pro-
vided for this assessment. In addition thanks to the EU for funding
the design and layout of this document. The efforts of all made this
report possible.

FOREWORD

Professor Yemi Osinbajo SAN, GCON
Vice President, Federal Republic of Nigeria



Since 2009, insecurity in the North-East of Nigeria has led to the loss of over 20,000 lives and the
displacement of over 2 million people. Throughout the region livelihoods have been disrupted, and
homes, public buildings and infrastructure destroyed. In a part of Nigeria where 80% of people rely
on agriculture for their livelihoods, much has been lost. People have been forced from their land and
livestock has been killed. In many areas, land mines and other remnants of war bring challenges for safe
and voluntary return.

While Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States bore the brunt of the direct impacts of the conflict, the three
neighboring states of Gombe, Taraba and Bauchi have taken in scores of people who have been displaced,
taxing their communities, economic resource, social services and infrastructure. Schools have been dam-
aged, health clinics destroyed and many people have been left vulnerable by this crisis. The Government
of Nigeria has made great strides in retaking and stabilising large portions of the North-East, but the
work to restore the lives of those affected is just beginning.

This assessment, led by the Government of Nigeria and supported by local, national and international
partners, has helped quantify the physical, social and economic impacts of the crisis in the North-East,
and will inform the process of stabilisation, peace building and recovery in the region. The RPBA is a
necessary tool that will help us gather the resources and develop the capacities to address these challenges.
The results will help reduce suffering in affected communities, restore a sense of normalcy and regain the
trust of people in the region.

MESSAGES FROM THE SIX STATES OF NORTH-EAST NIGERIA

Mr. Muhammadu Umaru Jibrilla Bindo
Governor of Adamawa State
In May 2013 a State of Emergency was declared in Adamawa as a result of the conflict with Boko Haram. Recent
advances by the military have made the State more secure and allowed some of the 136,000 displaced people to
begin returning home. In many cases, they found their homes and farmlands destroyed and remnants of war,
including mines, have further hampered transition back to their pre-existing agricultural lifestyle. Because of the
stable security situation in Adamawa and the will of its citizens to return home, full-scale reconstruction can and
must begin quickly. The Recovery and Peace Building Assessment has broken barriers and introduced a whole
new paradigm in Nigeria for systematic crisis impact assessment, recovery needs assessment and planning pro-
portional to impact recovery programmes based on objective criteria. We hope that this process will be a model
for other countries that may face similar crisis in the future.


Barrister Mohammed Abubakar
Governor of Bauchi State
Throughout the conflict with Boko Haram, Bauchi has served as host to many displaced people. It was
the first place violence occurred. However, through hard work, this violence was driven from the State,
allowing a refuge for neighbors looking for safe haven. Surveys show that 75% of displaced people want to
return home and the RPBA is helping us develop programmes to assist in that return while providing tools
to strengthen host communities. The RPBA is an example of a global good practice for the development
of institutional delivery mechanisms for recovery. The report provides the pros and cons of various options
for exploring and conceiving the right recovery model, allowing all six states to come to a unanimous agree-
ment on a hybrid institutional model for managing the recovery process.


Alhaji Kashim Shettima
Governor of Borno State
Since 2009, Borno State has been embroiled in a serious conflict leaving 1.4 million people displaced within its
borders. The violence has been overwhelming, destroying homes, farmland and infrastructure, as well as leaving
thousands dead and many more incredibly vulnerable. Two-thirds of all of the reported physical impact from this
conflict has occurred in Borno. The RPBA has helped us quantify the true extent of the damages which reach
nearly US$6 billion dollars. With such a staggering amount of need, special attention will be needed to ensure
the right human resources and funding mobilisation is put into place. The process has also been mindful of the
current security situation, allowing for incremental and prioritised implementation. This recovery process will
continue to be inclusive and led by the states, as it has since the beginning, ensuring the most urgent needs of
our communities are met. Recovery strategies in the assessment also focus on Building Back Better and Smarter,
looking at a range of improvements on the pre-crisis situation to help address some of the underlying causes of
the conflict. In view of the foregoing, Borno State Government is urging for an expedited implementation with
a view to alleviating the suffering of millions of the people affected by the conflict.




                                                                  VOLUME I : SYNTHESIS REPORT       RECOVERY AND PEACE BUILDING ASSESSMENT   Ix
NORTH-EAST NIGERIA




Alhaji (Dr.) Ibrahim Dankwambo OON
Governor of Gombe State
In Gombe, the main impact of the conflict has been social and economic as the State works to cope with
the significant needs of displaced people. The State also suffered collateral damage to infrastructure, in-
cluding to roads and bridges as transportation was diverted from conflict areas. The RPBA is significant
because it includes both direct impact and recovery needs assessments, as well as displacement-related
impacts and needs analysis allowing each state to develop the right recovery interventions based on local
needs, priorities and the security situation. Currently, there is relative peace in Gombe State, allowing
for quick action to address the needs of both those directly impacted by the conflict and the additional
impacts on the host communities. These quick interventions will prevent further deterioration of rela-
tionships between displaced people and host communities.


Arch Darius Ishaku
Governor of Taraba State
Taraba is hosting internally displaced people from both Boko Haram related violence and communal
violence. This has increased pressure on the social cohesion of the State. By using the RPBA to develop
programmes that increase social cohesion and focus on peace building, as well as generating economic
growth in the region, Taraba will have a better chance at ensuring long-lasting peace within its borders
no matter what the source of the conflict is. The RPBA process had continuous leadership and engage-
ment from the states and we must ensure that the post-RPBA phase builds upon the tremendous drive
and momentum created by the assessment to translate into quick, efficient and effective mechanisms for
delivering much needed recovery support to people affected by this crisis.


Alhaji Ibrahim Gaidam FCNA
Governor of Yobe State
The conflict in Yobe has been characterised by extreme violence and gross human rights abuses, including
mass killings, abductions, gender based violence and forced displacement. After Borno, Yobe State has
been the most significantly damaged by the conflict. The three tiered approach of the RPBA captures
vital information on social services, economic needs, infrastructure damage and service delivery gaps, and
will now allow for an integrated recovery strategy across all of these sectors. A central crisis analysis is the
underpinning of the assessment, identifying the structural drivers of the crisis as well as common stra-
tegic objectives for stabilisation and recovery. Information provided in the RPBA will encourage citizen
engagement in the recovery process, ensuring those left vulnerable by the crisis are actively involved in
rebuilding their lives and communities. This engagement will ultimately lead to greater social cohesion
and commitment to peace, as we rebuild Yobe for future generations.

JOINT FOREWORD OF THE

European Union, United Nations
and World Bank
Nearly fifteen million people have been affected by the insurgency of Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati
                                                                        __




Wal-Jihad, also known as Boko Haram, and the resulting military operations in the North-East of Nigeria
          __




since 2009. The human, social, and economic losses of the conflict, and the investments needed for the
recovery, peace building, and reconstruction of the North-East are overwhelming. Damage to education
and health facilities, to markets and farms, the loss of job opportunities and the psychological impacts
of the crisis are all adversely affecting an entire generation of Nigerians. The conflict has triggered a
humanitarian crisis, with increasing food insecurity and destruction of social services, infrastructure and
the environment, all of which has exacerbated already existing socioeconomic disparities. This is not just
a problem affecting the North-East of Nigeria, but ultimately the economic stability and social fabric of
the whole country, with spillover impact in the region.

As the Government of Nigeria makes progress in securing significant parts of the North-East, much of
the region remains fragile. The North-East Nigeria Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA) was
conducted by the Government of Nigeria, with the support of the European Union (EU), the United
Nations (UN) and the World Bank (WB) within the framework of the 2008 Joint EU-UN-WB Declara-
tion on Post Crisis Assessments and Recovery Planning.

The assessment report provides a shared understanding between the Government of Nigeria and its local
and international partners on the peace building and recovery needs of the North-East. The report also
sets a framework that could bridge the operational gap that can exist between humanitarian relief and
recovery programmes, further encouraging a holistic approach to stabilisation efforts in the North-East.
The Government will use the RPBA to help improve, expand and refine its overall strategic framework
for recovery and reconstruction of the North-East. Findings and recommendations provide an empirical
evidence base and reliable data for informed decision-making. The result of these efforts will hopefully
help prioritise development programmes, the implementation of which will bring about reconciliation
in the region and lead to overall violence prevention in the future. The partners are committed to help-
ing the region not only recover from this crisis but also develop programmes to build a prosperous and
peaceful Nigeria for future generations.

of the potential unfolding of these scenarios towards the implementation of
the recovery strategies and interventions proposed under the RPBA. This
context analysis has guided the development of the framework of strategic
outcomes and priorities for recovery which are in turn based on the need
to start to address the structural drivers of crisis identified in the context
analysis. This has been a governing consideration behind the formulation
of sector recovery strategies and needs analysis, and has also provided the
means for the prioritisation and sequencing of the needs identified in the

Government and/or State level negotiations/peace talks with Boko

economic factors of the Boko Haram conflict, the government is able
to limit the frequency, intensity and scope of attacks in the North-
East. Such improved military and political performance on the part
of the government would promote trust in the eyes of communities,

Boko Haram. The level of success of this enterprise will determine
the geographical areas in which return and resettlement, recovery and
peace building efforts can be pursued in a sustained way. This could
result in large parts of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa being accessible for

88             VOLUME I : SYNTHESIS REPORT                  RECOVERY AND PEACE BUILDING ASSESSMENT
The North-East has suffered tremendously in the past six years. We have all been witness
to the destruction of infrastructure, farmlands, businesses and trades, of schools and
the loss of school years. Rebuilding, restoring and rehabilitating what has been lost or
damaged will cost money and time.

...the tasks before us are many and profound but paramount: to fix brick and mortar
and to mend hearts and minds damaged by senseless, murderous violence.



− His Excellency, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, the Honorable Vice President of
  the Federal Republic of Nigeria



            About the Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA):

On 21 August 2015, the Government of Nigeria requested assistance in assessing the needs associated
with peace building and crisis recovery. Support has been provided in accordance with the 2008 Joint
European Union (EU) – United Nations (UN) – World Bank (WB) Declaration on crisis assessment
and recovery planning. A Recovery and Peace Building Assessment was initiated and findings are
presented in this report.

The Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA) informs a collective vision and strategy on peace
building and recovery, and provides a framework for coordinated and coherent support to assist con-
flict-affected people in the North-East. The assessment covers the six States of Borno, Yobe, Adamawa,
Gombe, Taraba, and Bauchi, and provides an overarching framework for stability, peace building, and
recovery.

The RPBA is founded on the recognition that a durable resolution to the conflict in the North-East
requires addressing the structural and underlying drivers of violent conflict. This understanding has
also underpinned the identification and prioritisation of needs presented in this report.
