iii    PhilippineS ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2017
Part I:

Recent Economic and Policy Developments
The Philippine economy continues to perform well relative to its regional peers. Following strong growth in the
immediate two quarters after the new administration took over in July 2016, the economy had a slower start
in the first half of 2017. Capital formation growth eased to 9.7 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017,
compared to its rally of 30.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 when rapid economic expansion
was spurred by a stimulus from election-related spending and investment. Positive consumer sentiment,
coupled with robust remittance growth, boosted domestic consumption. A favorable external environment
pushed export growth from 10.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 20.0 percent, year-on-year,
in the first half of 2017. The services sector remained the principal engine of growth, and the agriculture
sector recovered strongly as farm output benefitted from favorable weather conditions. Fiscal and monetary
policies remained supportive of growth. The government executed its programmed budget in the first half of
2017 despite lower revenues, and the central bank kept its policy rate steady despite climbing inflation. The
Philippine peso continued to weaken in the first half of 2017, impacted by the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes. The
balance of payments turned into deficit in the first half of 2017, driven by higher capital outflows. Sustained
economic growth increases the likelihood that poverty reduction has continued.

 Box 1	 The global economic recovery solidified in the first half of 2017

  Global activity is firming broadly as international trade is picking up. Global economic growth
  firmed in the first six months of 2017 and contributed to an improvement in confidence
  worldwide, and industrial activities recovered, as global trade picked up after two years of slow
  growth. Output gaps are narrowing and inflation rates are converging with central bank targets,
  as the modest recovery in major advanced economies continues. The demand for imports has
  also strengthened, further contributing to the recovery in global trade. Meanwhile, obstacles
  to growth among commodity exporters in emerging-market and developing economies are
  gradually diminishing, while activity in commodity importers remains generally robust. Given
  the improved confidence and less policy tightening in some commodity-exporting countries,
  domestic demand is leading the global economic upturn.

  Advanced economies experienced solid economic performance in the beginning of 2017,
  with investments and exports regaining momentum after subdued growth in 2016. Private
  consumption decelerated somewhat in early 2017 despite improvements in labor markets. In
  the United States, a deceleration in consumer spending temporarily held back market activity,
  but it was partly offset by an increase in private investment. In the Euro Area, manufacturing
  activity and the exports of goods have been lifted by strengthening global trade and investment
  at a time when the unemployment rate fell to 9.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017, about 2.5
  percentage points below its peak in 2013. Economic growth also accelerated in Japan, supported
  by an increase in exports, investments, and capital spending.

  As international conditions improved, growth in emerging markets and developing economies
  accelerated in 2017 after reaching a post-crisis low of 3.5 percent in 2016. Following years of
  near stagnating growth, a gradual recovery in commodity-exporting countries is supported by
  firming commodity prices, recovering industrial activity, stabilizing investments, and improving
  confidence. This recovery is broad-based, impacting nearly 70 percent of commodity exporters
  in 2017. For commodity importers, economic growth continues to be robust, supported by
  accommodative policies aimed at increasing domestic demand and a recovery in global trade
  which is bolstering export growth.

  Returns on assets in emerging markets and developing economies posted solid gains
  throughout the first half of 2017 but started to fall in July. Global financing conditions continue
  to be primarily driven by shifting expectations about monetary policy in the United States
  and the Euro Area. U.S. long-term yields decreased throughout much of the second quarter
  of 2017, reflecting disappointing inflation outcomes and diminished expectations of substantial
  fiscal stimulus. However, yields shifted upward in June 2017, reflecting the renewed pace of
  monetary policy normalization. As a result, capital flows and bond funds in emerging markets
  and developing economies registered net outflows in July – the first time in 2017. Moreover,
  currencies have suffered from tightening, especially for higher-risk and commodity exporters.

I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments

     Box 2	 Confidence in the Philippine economy

        Even though the confidence of the Philippine business community improved as the economy
        grew over recent years, consumer optimism has been lagging. The government’s commitment
        to macroeconomic stability and good governance helped accelerate economic growth and
        earned the country international recognition.5 For the private sector, this prolonged period of
        improved macroeconomic management has translated into a persistent trend of positive business
        sentiments6 since 2007.7 However, there has been a long-term negative trend in the Bangko
        Sentral ng Pilipinas’ overall consumer confidence index since the consumer expectations survey
        launched in 2007. The fact that past high economic growth rates did not quickly translate into
        more inclusive growth might have contributed to a delay in improving consumer confidence.8

        Consumer confidence surveys registered a positive value for the first time in the third quarter
        of 2016 but has since weakened. Even though consumer sentiments reached record highs in
        the first half of 2017, they have recently moderated but remain above 2016 levels.9 The gradual
        improvement in consumer sentiments was based on perceived positive prospects for the
        economy, improvements in household incomes due to a healthy job market, and government
        social protection programs (Figure 5).10 In particular, perceived improvements in peace and order
        fueled higher consumer confidence among Filipinos.11,12 However, recent data from the third
        quarter 2017 Consumer Expectations Survey show that consumer confidence is demonstrating
        signs of renewed weakness, similar to that of recent business confidence indicators. The overall

         Business confidence is measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ overall business confidence index. The index is calculated as the percentage
         of firms that answered in the affirmative minus the percentage of firms that answered in the negative in a given indicator. A positive confidence index
         indicates a favorable view. For more information, see: http://www.bsp.gov.ph/publications/regular_business.asp.

         By the second quarter of 2017, the overall consumer confidence index reached 13.1, a record high for the Philippines, and was the fourth consecutive
         quarter wherein the overall consumer outlook was positive.
10
    	    Record high levels of consumer confidence were also observed in the three component indicators of consumer confidence in the second quarter of
         2017: i) confidence in the country’s economic condition, ii) confidence in the family’s financial situation, and iii) confidence in family income.
11
    	    The survey covering the second quarter of 2017 was conducted from April 1 to 12, 2017, which was before the Marawi events and the declaration of
         Martial Law in Mindanao. However, the recent conflict in Marawi City was among the factors cited in both the consumer and business expectations
         surveys as among the reasons for the weakening in overall confidence.
12
    	    These were consistently the main reasons for overall positive consumer sentiment based on the Consumer Expectations Survey from the third
         quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017.

          consumer confidence index fell slightly from 13.1 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 10.2
          percent in the third quarter of 2017 due to concerns over higher inflation and unemployment and
          limited increases in income. Concerns over the conflict in Mindanao have likely also dampened
          overall consumer sentiment.

          There has been a recent weakening of business confidence (Figure 6). Based on the third quarter
          2017 results of the business expectations survey, overall business confidence declined from 37.9
          percent in the third quarter to 43.0 percent in Figure 6: Recent weakening in business confidence

6        Philippines ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2017
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments

     Box 3	 Regulation and investments in the mining industry

      The Philippines is the fifth most mineral-rich country in the world for gold, nickel, copper, and
      chromite. It has an estimated US$840.0 billion worth of untapped mineral resources, and about
      9 million hectares of land have a high mineral potential. The metal and non-metal deposits in the
      Philippines are estimated at 21.5 billion and 19.3 billion metric tons, respectively.18

      In recent years, changes in government regulations and policy uncertainties have limited foreign
      investment in the mining industry. Despite the 1995 Philippine Mining Act, which opened up
      the country’s mining sector to 100 percent foreign ownership, foreign direct investment in the
      mining industry remain subdued (Figure 8). As a result, growth in the sector has been uneven
      with occasional periods of contraction (Figure 7). Government efforts to improve the mining
      industry face the difficult task of attracting new investments while protecting the environment
      and communities. In 2012, Executive Order no. 79 was enacted to reform the Mining Act by
      establishing mineral reservations19, expanding areas closed to mining operations, creating a
      Mining Industry Coordinating Council to help enforce mining laws, and imposing a moratorium
      on new mineral permits until legislation can be enacted to rationalize existing revenue sharing
      schemes. However, legislation has yet to be introduced in Congress, and the moratorium is still
      in place five years later.

      Mining is increasingly financed by domestic sources. Domestic corporate lending in the industry
      increased steadily since June 2014, and it surpasses foreign direct investment by a wide margin
      (Figure 9). Outstanding domestic credit grew on average 31.3 percent annually between June
      2010 and June 2017. Based on data from five major mining companies, capital expenditures and
      debt refinancing constitute the bulk of outstanding credit for major industry players in the long
      term, while short-term debt for working capital requirements makes up a smaller portion.20

      There is uncertainty in the policy environment surrounding the mining industry. In the first
      half of 2017, the former environment secretary ordered the closure of 23 of the Philippines’
      41 mines, the cancellation of 75 mining contracts in watershed areas, and banned prospective
      open-pit mines. In addition, the 2012 moratorium on new mining permits under the Executive

      Growth in the construction sector dropped from 13.8 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 7.4 percent in the first half of 2017.
      Its contribution to growth in the industry sector declined from 29 to 20 percent during the same period.

           Order no. 79 has yet to be lifted, and mining firms that were suspended still await the review of
           their appeals. This uncertainty is a challenge for investors who seek policy consistency and make
           business decisions based on an analysis of risks and potential returns. There are discussions in
           Congress about new legislation dealing with responsible mining practices, mining taxation, and
           revenue-sharing schemes. The push towards responsible mining should address concerns over
           the environmental and social impacts of mining. The most cited negative environmental impacts
           involve land and water contamination, such as the 1996 contamination of the Boac river from
           a tailing dam failure, and destruction of forest, farmlands, corals reefs, and deep rifts due to
           mining pollution. Social impact concerns include the relinquishment of ancestral domains of
           indigenous people and reports of intimidation.



    1.2 The Exchange Rate and The External Sector: Weakening Balance of Payments

    While the Philippines’ current account deficit remained stable, the peso was impacted by the Federal
    Reserve’s rate hikes and continued to weaken, and the country’s balance of payments turned into
    deficit because of increasing capital outflows.

     Box 4	 Opportunities and challenges of a weaker currency

      In line with other regional currencies, the Philippine peso has steadily weakened since January
      2013. The Philippine peso slid in nominal terms from Php40.00 per USD in 2013 to Php50.58
      per USD in July 2017. Its performance in the past four years is comparable with other regional
      currencies and performed slightly better than the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah
      (Figure 11). However, the peso was the weakest performer in the region during the first six
      months of 2017, and it dropped to a fresh 11-year low in August at a time when other regional
      currencies had gained strength.

      The depreciation of the country’s real effective exchange rate creates a relative price advantage
      that the Philippines can explore. The real effective peso exchange rate depreciated at a
      moderate pace of 3.1 percent, year-on-year, in first half of 2017, which made it the worst regional
      performer with the exception of China’s yuan (Figure 12). The depreciation of the peso has made
      it relatively cheaper to produce and export Philippine goods, improving the country’s export
      competitiveness in the region. This could help explain the country’s strong export performance
      over the past six months, as firms with established export products and sufficient production
      capacity to increase output in the short term were in a position to immediately take advantage
      of the price advantage. However, initial investments might be required for companies to take
      advantage of opportunities in more competitive markets.

      Global developments, such as the ongoing U.S. policy rate normalization and Brexit, have
      contributed to the depreciation of the peso. The anticipation of U.S. Federal Reserve rate
      increases and uncertainty surrounding Brexit caused capital outflows from emerging markets
      in the Asia-Pacific region, as investors moved funds to safer markets and U.S. assets regained
      attractiveness. In the Philippines, the stock exchange endured stock sell-offs in the last quarter of
      2016 (US$357.0 million in September and US$383.0 million in November 2016) and in February
      2017 that brought volatility in the foreign-exchange market and the continued deterioration of
      the peso. Since then, stocks in the Philippines have rebounded in line with top performing major
      stock indices in the region, and the country’s stock market reached a record-high of 8,321 in
      September 2017. However, the peso exchange rate has remained at relative low levels, with the
      market expecting further depreciation.

           Preserving confidence in the economy will be important, as widening current- and fiscal-account
           deficits and the continuing depreciation of the peso weigh heavily on investor sentiments.
           There are concerns over the anticipated current account deficit in 2017, the first in 14 years,
           and the ambitious public infrastructure investment plan that is expected to lead to a budget
           deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP over the next five years. There is a risk of overheating the economy
           if investments in new production capacity do not keep pace with demand, which could result in
           a higher inflation rate and a further weakening of the peso. Although the public infrastructure
           investment plan is consistent with the country’s development needs and will require greater
           capital formation and capital imports for some time, it will also need to be carefully managed to
           mitigate risks.

10        Philippines ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2017
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments

 Box 5	 The trade balance in the Philippines

      The Philippines’ trade balance has been in deficit for the past five years (Figure 14). Between
      2011 and 2016, goods exports grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent while merchandise imports
      grew at the faster annual rate of 5.7 percent. On average, the trade deficit was around 7.9 percent
      of GDP in 2011-2016 but rose to 8.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2017.

      Exports rebounded in early 2017 after two consecutive years of weak growth. Goods exports
      expanded by 14.6 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017, compared to a 6.3
      percent, year-on-year, contraction in the same period in 2016. Leading the rebound was the
      exports of electronic products, including semiconductors and electronic data processing
      machines, which accounted for more than two-fifths of the growth, followed by the exports of
      forest, mineral, and petroleum products which constituted about a quarter of the growth. The
      exports of agriculture-based products and other manufactured goods also increased compared
      to last year’s contractions, in part due to the general improvement in the external environment.
      Yet given the slower growth of exports compared to imports, the continued adoption of policies
      to further improve the country’s export competitiveness remains important.

      Even though the recent rise in imports exacerbated the trade deficit, a sizable share of the
      imports was capital goods. Capital goods, which used to constitute about a quarter of the total
      import bill during 2011-2015, have made up about a third of total imports since 2016 (Figure 15).
      Imports of capital goods grew at an average annual rate of 12.4 percent in 2011-2016. In the first
      half of 2017, they grew by 5.5 percent, year-on-year, driven by the imports of power generating and
      specialized machines, telecommunication equipment, and office and electronic data processing
      machines. Since capital goods are necessary inputs to build production capacity, their import
      growth is a welcome development to secure the country’s potential and future growth.

      The imports of raw materials and intermediate goods have increased as they are key inputs in the
      production of Philippine exports. In 2011-2016, the imports of raw materials and intermediate
      goods grew at an annual rate of 4.6 percent. Moreover, they grew from 8.8 percent, year-on-
      year, in the first half of 2016 to 9.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017. Materials
      for the manufacturing of electronic equipment constitute a key share among intermediate
      goods (23.1 percent) and are important for the country’s main exports of semiconductors and
      electronic products.

             Consumer goods imports rose alongside increasing domestic incomes. As income levels rise in
             line with rising GDP levels, the propensity to consume imported goods is likely to continue to be
             strong. In 2011-2016, the imports of consumer goods grew at an annual rate of 15.5 percent, and
             they grew by 6.5 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017, largely as a result of an
             increase in imports of both non-durable goods, such as food items, and durable goods, such as
             passenger cars and home appliances. In the first half of 2017, 16.8 percent of total imports were
             consumer goods while about 38.6 percent were raw materials and intermediate goods.


          Box 6	 Recent trends in remittances

             Remittances to the Philippines continued to increase in the first six months of 2017, helped
             by the improving global economy and the continued strong deployment of overseas Filipinos.
             Personal remittances sent by overseas Filipinos expanded 5.5 percent, year-on-year, and reached
             US$15.4 billion (10.2 percent of GDP) in the first half of 2017, outpacing the 4.4 percent, year-on-
             year, expansion registered during the same period in the previous year (Figure 16). Meanwhile,
             cash remittances increased by 4.7 percent, year-on-year, over the same period to reach US$13.8
             billion (9.2 percent of GDP), which is in line with the central bank’s projection of US$28.0 billion
             for 2017. Preliminary data from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration reveal
             that a total of 1.1 million Filipinos were deployed overseas, on track to surpass the 2.1 million
             overseas Filipinos recorded in 2016.

             The source of remittances in the first half of 2017 broadly reflected the Filipino diaspora. Cash
             remittances from North and South America accounted for the largest share of remittance inflows
             (Figure 17), comprising 36.6 percent of total remittances, 90 percent of which were from the
             United States. The Middle East remained the second largest source of remittances, with a 28.3
             percent share in the first half of 2017, followed by Asia (18.3 percent) and Europe (13.8 percent).
             These trends mirrored the distribution of around 9.2 million overseas Filipinos in 2016,
             with the United States accounting for the largest share of Filipino migrants at 39.5 percent
             (land-based), followed by the Middle East (24.8 percent), Asia and the Pacific (21.6 percent),
             and Europe (7.2 percent).24

  / The term “Net unclassified items” is a balancing figure. There are two methods of computing the BOP position: the first approach
    uses the change in net international reserves due to transactions, while the second approach computes the sum balances of the
    current account, capital account less financial account. The two measures do not necessarily tally. The BSP uses the first approach to
    determine the overall BOP position.

           Timely rice imports and responsive rice stock management are critical to smoothing rice prices.
           Rice imports are largely controlled by the National Food Authority (NFA) which is mandated to
           maintain a 30-day stock during lean season and a 15-day stock at any given time.30 However,
           restrictions on rice imports in recent years left the rice supply inadequate at times, and the
           mistiming of imports has caused a number of price hikes. For instance, domestic rice prices
           increased in 2014 because of importation lags, even as world rice prices fell.31 There have been
           improvements in rice stock management since 2015, in part through higher and timelier imports.
           Total imports reached 1.5 million tons in 2015 which supplemented local supply and managed to
           keep the rice price inflation at a low single digit.

           The NFA’s level of rice stocks has raised concerns over potential shortages and price hikes during
           the lean July-September season. The NFA is currently expediting its stock replenishment. In
           May, it shifted its import scheme from government-to-government procurement to government-
           to-private procurement32, allowing private foreign firms to participate in the bidding process,
           a move seen as more competitive and transparent. The bids for 250,000 metric tons of rice
           were awarded in July and will be delivered on a staggered basis from August to September.
           Meanwhile, the government has also approved private sector imports of 805,200 metric tons of
           rice in an auction that is expected to take place during the last quarter of 2017.

           The Philippine government recently extended the quantitative restriction (QR) for rice imports
           for three more years until June 30, 2020. QRs on rice imports violate the agreement with
           the World Trade Organization that the government signed on January 1, 1995. However, as a
           transition rule, the World Trade Organization allowed the Philippines to impose a 10-year rice
           import QR system in 1995, which was extended four times in 2004, 2012, 2014, and 2017. The
           new administration’s economic team actively promotes the lifting of rice import restrictions

            Private sector traders could apply for import permits and allowed to import rice, but they would be constrained by a collective limit of 805,000 metric
            tons per year and levied with 35 percent tariff rates.

      to attract more private sector participation. The Department of Agriculture, however, supports
      an extended grace period before the restrictions are removed to give farmers more time to
      adjust. The Philippines plans to offer trade concessions for several products for three more years
      in exchange for an extension of the QRs on rice imports.33 Meanwhile, a bill has been filed in the
      Senate for the tariffication34 of rice imports and the creation of a competitive enhancement fund
      that will benefit rice farmers.

      In the long term, effective rice import and stock management needs to be complemented with
      improvements in agricultural productivity and logistics. Liberalizing rice imports and improving
      rice stock management are not the only tools for managing domestic rice prices. Only 6 to 7
      percent of total global rice production is traded internationally.35 As a result, the Philippines is
      likely to remain vulnerable to covariate shocks in regional exporting countries, such as Vietnam
      and Thailand. In the Philippines, the rice supply chain has high milling, drying, storage, and
      transportation costs, reflecting insufficient investments in roads and postharvest facilities as
      well as policy distortions. Increasing productivity and rice yields, including lowering the cost
      of transportation, would contribute to an improvement in the management of the country’s
      rice prices. Key to improving agricultural productivity is addressing the binding constraints to
      Mindanao’s agricultural sector, which contributes the largest share to the country’s agricultural
      output. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to Part III: Unlocking Mindanao’s Potential.



1.4 Fiscal Policy: Staying on an Expansionary Path

In the first half of 2017, the government’s pursuit of an expansionary fiscal policy led to significantly
higher levels of public expenditures while revenues fell short of their targets. As a result, the fiscal
deficit increased to 2.1 percent of GDP.

20    Philippines ECONOMIC UPDATE • October 2017
I. Recent Economic and Policy Developments

     Box 8	 The proposed 2018 national budget

      The 2018 national budget builds on the new administration’s development agenda as embodied
      in the 0-10 Point Socioeconomic Agenda, the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022, and the
      AmBisyon Natin 2040. The proposed 2018 national budget of PhP3.77 trillion represents a 12.4
      percent increase over the previous year’s PhP3.35 trillion budget and aims to reduce poverty
      and boost shared prosperity. Funding to social services, which would receive the largest share of
      the budget, is set to increase by 7.3 percent, year-on-year, to Php1.45 trillion, as the government
      continues to prioritize the development of the country’s human resources through increased
      investments in education, health, and service delivery. Meanwhile, the proposed budget for the
      economic services sector is planned to expand by 25.0 percent to reach PhP1.2 trillion, anchored
      on the country’s continued push for strategic infrastructure development.

      The proposed 2018 national budget prioritizes investment in both human and physical capital,
      maintaining the government’s key policy priorities from the previous year’s national budget
      (Figure 24). With a proposed allocation of Php691.1 billion, funding to the education sector
      would increase by 6.4 percent compared to

      Despite the expansionary nature of the new budget, the government remains committed to
      maintaining fiscal discipline. The recent transformation from a fiscal program under constant
      threat to one that is resilient underpins the country’s robust economic growth performance.
      Cognizant of the importance of prudent fiscal policy, the government has maintained a deficit
      target for the next five years but raised it from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2017 to 3.0 percent of GDP
      in 2018. Central to the government’s efforts to maintain fiscal discipline is its objective to improve
      the country’s tax policy and tax administration.44 The government expects the implementation
      of the first package of tax reforms to begin in 2018, which is expected to boost tax revenue
      by Php133.8 billion in its first year of implementation, increasing the government’s projected
      revenue effort from an estimated 15.2 percent of GDP in 2017 to 16.3 percent of GDP in 2018.

     1.5 Employment and Poverty: Progress but with New Challenges

     Unemployment levels increased in the first half of 2017, as many temporary jobs created during
     last year’s election-related stimulus disappeared. Longer-term growth in wage jobs, particularly for
     households in the bottom 40 percent, and the shift of employment out of agriculture continue to drive
     the observed decline in poverty.

     from a decade ago.

     have started to affect the hiring decisions of firms particularly in the services sector.

     The boost in senior high school enrollment may have resulted from the senior high school voucher program, where almost half (about 0.7 million

     Two laws on the public sector salary standardization were implemented in the last 10 years. The first was Joint Resolution No. 4 by the Fourteenth
     Congress that authorized former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to modify the compensation package for government, military, and uniformed
     personnel. The revised compensation took effect a year after it was signed in July 2008 for employees in national government offices and after
     eighteen months for employees in local government. The salary increase was implemented in equal tranches over four years. Another round of
     salary standardization through Executive Order No. 201 took effect in July 2016. This legislation ensured comparability of wages in government
     particularly management level positions with prevailing rates in the private sector. This new adjustment in wages will take effect in stages through
     2019. Another important wage legislation is the Domestic Workers Act or Kasambahay Law, which regulates wages given to household employees
     and enforces the provision of social and other benefits. Wages of those working in private households have grown on average by 4.2 percent annually
     since the law was passed in January 2013.

        half of the country’s total workforce. In the first half of 2017, 57.1 percent of both public and

Part II:

Outlook and Risks
The Philippine economy is projected to expand by 6.6 percent, year-on-year, in 2017, before growing by
6.7 percent, year-on-year, in 2018 and 2019. Investment growth has been moderating partly because of a
slower than envisioned implementation of the government’s infrastructure program, softening the growth
prospects for 2017. However, the medium-term growth outlook remains positive, as stronger expected
growth in the Philippines’ main trading partners would lead to higher external demand. Imports are expected
to remain elevated due to a high demand of intermediate and capital goods. As the public infrastructure
program gains traction, capital outlays and construction activities are expected to rise. Consumption growth
is expected to remain firm, contingent on sustained remittances and expanding credit to households. The
local elections in 2019 will likely boost domestic activities as early as the second half of 2018. The rate of
Filipinos living on less than US$3.20-a-day is projected to decline to 22.9 percent in 2018. The pace of
poverty reduction may drop slightly in the face of lower overall economic growth, but the poverty rate is
expected to continue to fall as the economy continues its structural transformation. Short-term risks to
the country outlook include increased trade protectionism, the possibility of financial market disruptions,
and elevated economic policy uncertainty. Weaker potential growth remains the main long-term risk to
the Philippines. An expansionary fiscal policy could help support growth in the short term as long as it is
consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability.

     2.1 Growth Outlook

     The economy is projected to grow at a slower pace in 2017 compared to 2016. Fiscal and monetary
     policies are likely to remain accommodative to growing the economy, and recovering exports and
     strong consumption growth are expected to boost economic growth. Higher investment growth could
     push the country’s growth rate towards the upper end of the government’s target of 6.5 to 7.5 percent
     of GDP, but this is contingent on whether or not the public infrastructure program gains full traction.

     Box 10	 The global economic outlook

       Despite substantial policy uncertainty, global growth is projected to accelerate in 2017-2019.
       The rate of global economic growth is projected to increase from a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent,
       year-on-year, in 2016 to 2.7 and 2.9 percent, year-on-year, in 2017 and 2018-19, respectively
       (Table 4). The short-term outlook for advanced economies has generally improved due to firming
       business and investment activities despite elevated policy uncertainty in the United States and
       the Euro Area. In 2017, advanced economies are projected to grow by 1.9 percent, year-on-
       year, before moderating to 1.8 and 1.7 percent, year-on-year, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In
       emerging-market and developing economies, annual growth is predicted to reach an average of
       4.1 percent in 2017 and 4.6 percent in 2018-19 (Figure 33). Obstacles to growth for commodity
       exporters have diminished while activity in commodity importers continue to be robust.

       Global trade growth is expected to recover at a robust pace in 2017. It is expected to rebound
       from 2.5 percent, year-on-year, in 2016 to 4.0 percent, year-on-year, in 2017, its fastest pace
       since 2010 (Figure 34). This growth is aligned with the global recovery in manufacturing activity
       and coincided with the bottoming out of global investments. It is supported by stronger import
       demand from major advanced economies, increased trade flows to and from China, and a
       diminished drag from weak import demand from commodity-exporting emerging-market
       and developing economies. Policy-induced infrastructure spending, specifically in China, will
       continue to support demand for industrial commodities, benefiting countries that export raw
       materials. The services trade will remain resilient and play a stabilizing role since it is less
       volatile and pro-cyclical than the goods trade. Nevertheless, trade growth will continue to be
       held back by structural impediments, such as maturing global value chains and a slower pace
       of trade liberalization.

         Collectively, advanced economies in the Euro Area are expected to grow by 1.7 percent in 2017, while Japan is projected to grow by 1.5 percent in
         2017, 0.2 and 0.6 percentage points higher than their respective forecasts from the January round of the 2017 Global Economic Prospects.

                                                                                                                         II. Outlook and Risks


       There are downside risks to the global economic outlook. Risks such as trade protectionism
       and potential financial market disruptions dominate the outlook despite the possibility of more
       expansionary fiscal policies in advanced economies. A number of factors weigh on the long-term
       growth prospects of emerging-market and developing economies, including structural headwinds
       to global trade, worsening demographics, slowing productivity growth, and governance and
       institutional challenges. Moreover, even if the expected modest rebound in investment across
       emerging-market and developing economies materializes, slowing capital accumulation in recent
       years may already have reduced potential growth.

       Over the long term, structural policies that support investment and trade are critical to boost
       productivity and potential growth. Emerging-market and developing economies will need to
       continue to pursue structural reforms to improve their long-term growth prospects, diversify their
       economies, and develop domestic as well as foreign markets. These include policies to improve
       the business climate, support investment in human and physical capital, and enhance regional
       and global trade integration. Central banks in advanced economies will gradually normalize
       monetary policy as inflation increases and economic slack diminishes. While the U.S. tightening
       cycle is well ahead of other major advanced economies, it is proceeding at a substantially slower
       pace than in the past.

     Box 11	 The Marawi city crisis

      Marawi City, a relatively small city in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM),
      is an important economic and cultural hub in the region. Although Mindanao is an important
      part of the Philippine economy, Marawi City and the province of Lanao del Sur make up a
      relatively small share of Mindanao’s formal economy. The ARMM region, which Lanao del Sur
      is a part of, constitutes only 0.7 percent of the Philippines’ GDP and 4.8 percent of Mindanao’s
      GDP. Meanwhile, Marawi City is the least economically vibrant city in Mindanao.70 It ranks last
      in terms of taxes on business income among the 33 cities in Mindanao, as taxes on business
      revenue amounted to only Php0.5 million or 0.01 percent of business tax revenue among cities in
      Mindanao. Given the limited scope of Marawi City’s economy, it has a small direct impact on the
      Philippines’ formal economy. However, the city still plays an important role in the region as the
      economic hub of Lanao del Sur and as a cultural hub in Mindanao. It is strategically located in the
      region due to its proximity to Lake Lanao, as a center of trade and commercial activities to nearby
      towns and municipalities, and hosts the Agus 1 and Agus 2 hydro-power plants. Marawi City and
      Lanao del Sur are also important gateways to the provinces and cities of the Northern Mindanao
      region, providing an important link to the transport and flow of goods throughout Mindanao.

      Although the direct impact of this conflict on the country’s formal economy may be limited,
      the social development impact on the citizens of Marawi and nearby areas is more severe.
      Mindanao has some of the highest poverty rates in the entire Philippines, especially in conflict-
      affected areas, and the province of Lanao del Sur had the highest poverty incidence among
      provinces in the Philippines at 71.9 percent in 2015. Marawi City itself had a poverty incidence
      of around 60 percent in 2012. The ongoing conflict has resulted in the displacement of nearly
      400,000 citizens from Marawi71 and caused significant damage to local infrastructure, agricultural

      continued timely response by the government is needed to ensure that those displaced receive
      appropriate humanitarian assistance, as internally displaced persons are vulnerable to various
      health risks. Over the medium term, careful coordination among various government agencies
      is required to ensure the rehabilitation of Marawi City is successful once the conflict is resolved.

      In addition, the Marawi conflict brings uncertainty to the completion of the peace process
      that is expected to end the almost five-decade violent conflict which large parts of Mindanao
      has suffered. The region’s history of widespread conflict has led to weak economic growth, low job
      creation, anemic poverty reduction, and a massive displacement of the population. But the Marawi
      City crisis has different characteristics than the previous conflict. First, it points to a convergence
      of different terrorist groups. Second, the scale of the disruption is different, with armed terrorist
      forces occupying an entire city which led to a complete evacuation. Finally, it has potential spillover
      effects into neighboring areas and brings uncertainty to the completion of the Mindanao peace
      process, which is likely to adversely affect national consumer and business sentiments.

Economic progress in the Philippines will depend on the success of economic development in Mindanao, as it
is hard to see how the country can achieve sustained and inclusive growth without progress in this region. Like
the rest of the Philippines, the central policy challenge for Mindanao is how to accelerate inclusive growth—
the type that creates more and better jobs and reduces poverty. But this is more difficult in Mindanao than
in Luzon or the Visayas because of longstanding armed conflict in the region. Although progress has been
made in making growth more inclusive, Mindanao still trails the rest of the Philippines in terms of shared
prosperity. This is compounded by the weakness of the Mindanao economy, resulting from decades of not
only armed conflict but also a narrow growth strategy. This special focus note, which is based on the main
findings of the World Bank’s Philippines Mindanao Jobs Report, proposes a comprehensive strategy for
unlocking Mindanao’s potential, including interventions in the region that will support sustainable peace
and development and job creation. The strategy is built on three main components that aim to (1) raise
agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2) boost human development; and (3)
address drivers of conflict and fragility and strengthen institutions in ARMM and conflict-affected areas.

      Based on the 2012 FIES. In 2012, the average annual per capita food poverty line in Mindanao was Php13,453 and the poverty line was Php19,291,
      both slightly higher (1.4 percent) than that of Luzon despite Mindanao being less developed. People falling below the provincial per capita food
      thresholds are considered food-poor, while those with per capita income equal to or above the provincial per capita food thresholds but below the
      provincial per capita poverty thresholds are considered poor. Those with per capita income equal to or above the per capita poverty thresholds but
      below the 50th population percentile (agricultural workers tend to have lower income) are considered near-poor.

      For instance, in a Mindanao town, the datu (local chieftain) can control local politics, own the only rural bank, and have a monopoly of security

     The Philippines Mindanao Jobs Report discusses the domestic and foreign markets for Mindanao’s agricultural products. In particular, unlocking the
     agricultural sector in Mindanao and addressing logistics and connectivity issues will strengthen the contribution of Mindanao’s agricultural output
     to the nation’s food security, particularly increasing rice and maize supply to the other island regions. In addition, there opportunity to expand the
     production of exportable agriculture products: aquatic, coffee, and coconut products. Here the challenge will be mainly to more closely link farmers

  Box 12	 The market potential of agriculture in Mindanao

      Mindanao is considered the agricultural basket of the Philippines, producing a diverse set of
      crops and serving both local and international markets. Of the three island regions, it accounts
      for the largest share of agricultural production and contributes significantly to national food
      security. For example, it produces about 50 percent of national corn production. Also, it produces
      most of the country’s high-value crops: about 80 percent of bananas and coffee and over 60
      percent of coconuts. In addition, Mindanao contributes a significant share of the country’s key
      commodity contributions to total world export volume. Its bananas, pineapples, and coconuts
      comprise about a third of world export volumes.115 However, Mindanao’s agricultural sector has
      not realized its potential.

      A number of Mindanao’s agricultural products could extend their shares in both domestic
      and international markets. An analysis of about two dozen value chains in Mindanao reveals
      that some products, such as coffee, aquatic products, seaweed, and coconut, appear to have
      considerable market potential, either for more effectively serving nearby urban centers or for
      expanding in markets abroad.

      Ramping up coffee production in Mindanao could also address the demand for domestic
      consumption of currently imported coffee products. In recent years, domestic coffee
      consumption rose significantly to about 130,000 metric tons of coffee in 2015—more than
      double the consumption in 2007. Until the 1990s, the Philippines was a major exporter of coffee
      beans, but domestic production steadily fell following a sharp decline in prices. Today, green
      coffee is among the country’s top 10 agricultural imports. For Mindanao, where about two-thirds
      of national coffee production takes place, there is a potential to expand to coffee processing,
      such as the production of instant coffee, given that 95 percent of all domestically consumed
      instant coffee is imported.

      Aquatic products like milkfish, tilapia, and seaweed could serve wider domestic and
      international markets. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Philippines ranks
      among the top 20 global producers of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, accounting for about
      1 percent of total global production; Mindanao contributes already nearly half of total domestic
      production. Domestically, milkfish and tilapia are central items in the Filipino diet, yet Mindanao’s
      contribution to milkfish and tilapia production is about 15 and 7 percent, respectively.

           In terms of the aquatic export markets, seaweed has the most market potential for Mindanao.
           The Philippines ranked 3rd globally in production of aquatic plants, with 5.7 percent of total
           world production in 2014. Mindanao accounts for more than half of total Filipino production
           and most of it takes place in the ARMM. Moreover, seaweed, as an aquatic export, is second
           only to tuna in terms of value, accounting for US$202 million—about 20 percent of total export
           earnings for fisheries in 2015. There is heavy demand from international markets for seaweed,
           from which carrageenan is extracted for use as an additive, binder, and emulsifier in the food,
           pharmaceutical, beverage, and cosmetic industries.

           The coconut industry represents a growth opportunity for Mindanao and a chance for its
           poorest farmers to establish linkages with enterprises. The Philippines is the second largest
           producer of coconuts in the world. In 2015, coconuts accounted for about 40 percent of total
           export earnings and over 60 percent of those coconuts came from Mindanao. In recent years,
           international demand has outstripped supply because of the proliferation of coconut byproducts,
           such as virgin coconut oil, coco sugar, and copra. As a result, there is an opportunity to expand
           Mindanao’s coconut-related agribusiness for both domestic and export markets.
