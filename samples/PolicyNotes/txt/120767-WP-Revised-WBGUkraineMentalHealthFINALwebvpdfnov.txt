I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Introduction
Ukraine is undergoing important reforms in the health system, and there is an increasing
interest among national as well as international actors in improving mental health
services. Ukraine has a centralized mental health care system with services provided
mainly through psychiatric clinics and 90% of funding contributed to psychiatric hospitals.
There is a lack of community level mental health care, and limited provision of mental
health care and support by nonspecialized staff such as general doctors and family
physicians. National level discussions of plans to improve mental health care include
provision of community-based care to support persons with mental health problems,
including the integration of mental health into primary health care. In large part due
to the conflict in the East which has lasted for over three years, there has been increased
efforts among civil society organizations and international actors to address mental
health needs, especially among conflict affected populations including IDPs and veterans.
However, to date there has been no systematic assessment focusing on mental health as
part of the health system and through community level organizations, which also explore
help seeking and barriers to care. The aim of this assessment is to provide recommen-
dations to inform policy and operational guidance for strengthening integration
of mental health into primary health care and community-based service platforms
in Ukraine under the reform program.


Methods
This assessment provides an overview and analysis of available mental health services
and supports, as well as of community perceptions and ways of help seeking. The
assessment focuses on 3 pilot regions (Lviv, Poltava, Zaporizhia) and on common men-
tal disorders (CMDs) including depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
and as well as alcohol use disorder (AUD). Methods used include Desk Top Review (e.g.,
Ukraine national policies and plans pertaining to mental health, peer-reviewed publications,
and reports on mental health), Stakeholder Interviews at national and regional levels,
and qualitative interviews to assess formal and informal mental health services and
supports (provided by mental health specialists and nonspecialists as part of the health care
system as well as through community mental health service platforms) and to assess com-
munity demand for services, help seeking, coping, and barriers to mental health care.
Results
Health and mental health are closely related. Over 90% of deaths are caused by non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) in Ukraine, with harmful alcohol use as a major risk factor.
Research suggests that about 30% of people in Ukraine will experience a mental disorder
in their lifetime. Alcohol use disorder is more common among men, while anxiety and
depression are more common among women. In comparison to other countries, Ukraine
has especially high rates of depression. Poor mental health in Ukraine is tightly inter-
connected with poverty, unemployment, and feelings of insecurity, compounded
by the effects of the conflict. IDPs, older persons and those living in the East are especially
vulnerable. Research and our data show that CMDs and AUD have wide ranging impacts
and consequences including poor health; excess deaths; impaired functioning and resulting
financial, social and family problems; as well as stigma and discrimination.

The Ukraine health system and mental health services are in need of reform. Only 2.5%
of the total health budget is dedicated to mental health, and the majority (89%) of
funding goes toward inpatient mental health care. Due to insufficient government
financing of the health system, the population is required to pay for outpatient and
inpatient pharmaceuticals (which are often expensive), as well as provide unofficial
remuneration to medical personnel. The mental health system is centralized, with
most staff and services concentrated in psychiatric and narcological hospitals and inpatient
units. Available interventions by specialized mental health care providers and in-state
facilities are often not evidence based. Some private practitioners and private rehabilitation
centers offer such interventions, but others offer interventions that may be ineffective or
harmful. Although protocols exist, primary health care providers are often reluctant
to address CMDs or AUD due to lack of skills and limited time. Informal community
providers such as clergy can be an important source of mental health support.

There has been a proliferation of civil society organizations and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) providing mental health interventions, but efforts are not always
coordinated and in line with best practices; they may be focused on specific populations
only (e.g., IDPs and veterans), and sustainability remains a challenge.

Overall, the mental health system is lacking continuity of care as a result of limited
communication between providers from different professions or between different agencies
and organizations. There is also confusion and mistrust among the general public
about what information about their mental health status is shared, leading to
persons not seeking help or spending more money and resources to seek help (e.g.,
longer distance, private services).

Among human resources for mental health, there is a high number of psychiatrists in
the system, with lower numbers of psychologists, psychotherapists, and social workers.
Educational and training opportunities at state universities do not offer foundations and
skills-based training in evidence-based treatment for CMDs and AUD. Many private




10 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
institutions offer training for psychotherapists, which is not always based on evidence.
Psychologists and psychotherapists can often not afford training opportunities to acquire
needed skills. At the same time, psychologists and psychotherapists practice without
licensing and oversight. International actors have initiated programs to build capacity
in mental health, but efforts are not always coordinated or do not make use of lessons
learned and global guidelines.

Studies suggest that most people (up to 75%) with CMDs and AUD in Ukraine do not access
care. Barriers to care include stigma and shame, fear of psychiatry and lack of trust in the
health system, lack of information and awareness, high cost of treatment, fear of having a
public record as being diagnosed with mental illness, and geographical distance.

Using secondary data from the OneHealth tool, the health impact and cost of intervention
scale-up was pre-modeled over the period of 2017 to 2030. Treatment costs for addressing
selected priority mental health conditions (depression, anxiety disorders, AUD, bipolar
and psychotic disorders) included medication, outpatient and primary care, inpatient
care, and program resources (e.g., training). The model shows that with scale-up of
treatment for selected mental disorders in Ukraine, over 4.7 million years of healthy
lives can be restored by the year 2030, with AUD accounting for most cases reached
and years restored. The total cost per head of population would increase, from US$2.80
to US$10.90. It can be estimated that the economic value of restored productivity with
treatment of common mental disorders over this period amounts to more than $800
million for depression and $350 million for anxiety disorders. This means that for every $1
invested in scaled-up treatment of common mental disorders in Ukraine, there will
be $2 in restored productivity and added economic value.


Conclusions and Recommendations
This assessment has several limitations, including being limited to specific mental disorders
only (CMDs and AUD), being limited geographically (to three pilot oblasts), using desktop
review and qualitative methods only, and focusing on mental health within the health
system and community level platforms and not on social and educational sectors.

Recommendations should be prioritized to initially focus on strengthening coordination
and leadership for mental health and to build on past experiences and global guidance
in expanding and initiating key pilot projects focusing on regions with high need
and successful collaboration with regional actors. Overall recommendations from this
assessment include strengthening coordination, communication, and information
sharing. This pertains to improving communication and coordination among donors and
implementing partners for supporting mental health programming and reform in Ukraine.
There is also a need to strengthen referral pathways among different formal and informal
service providers in the health and social systems and to foster communication, information
sharing, and multidisciplinary teamwork while protecting patient confidentiality. Because
the organization of mental health services is still centralized and focused on psychiatry,


                                                                         Executive Summary | 11
mental health services must be decentralized from hospital-based care toward outpatient
care and community-based services, including integration with primary health care. At
the same time, financing for mental health must be strengthened with increased
budget allocations as well as coverage of treatment (including psychotropic medications)
for persons with CMDs and AUD. Public health initiatives (e.g., taxing alcoholic beverages),
as well as comprehensive and evidence-based treatment options must be available for
persons with AUD. Given the interconnectedness of mental health with NCDs as well as
infectious diseases, physical and mental health care must be integrated and provided
collaboratively. Although there has been a strong focus on trauma and PTSD in the
context of the conflict in the East, it is important to take a public health approach and
consider the much higher burden of depression and AUD at the country level. While it is
important to tailor mental health services to different groups (e.g., older persons, veterans) it
is also crucial that services must be accessible to all segments of the population. There is a
significant need to build the capacity of human resources in Ukraine, including offering
educational programs that provide needed qualifications in evidence-based psychological
interventions; providing official licensing, certification and oversight for practicing
psychologists and psychotherapists; building the capacity for identification, management,
and referral of persons with CMDs and AUD among primary health care providers, as well
as strengthening the role of social workers and various nonspecialized and community
providers. Lastly, it is important to raise awareness and provide information to the
general public about mental health problems and how to choose qualified providers
of mental health services. There is also a need and opportunity to support and create
consumer-led mental health advocacy groups and strengthen engagement of persons
recovering from mental illness and their family members.

We hope that findings and recommendations from this assessment will be useful in informing
concrete steps for addressing mental health as part of the health reform and in informing
mental health programming supported by various national level and global actors.

II. ASSESSMENT GOALS
AND METHODS

1. Focus and Goals
This assessment provides an overview and analysis of available mental health services and
supports, as well as community perceptions and ways of help seeking. The assessment
focuses on 3 pilot regions (Lviv, Poltava, Zaporizhia) and on depression, anxiety, PTSD,
and alcohol use disorders and covers the following elements:

   •	 Desktop review (e.g., Ukraine national policies and plans pertaining to mental
      health, peer-reviewed publications and reports on mental health)
   •	 Stakeholder interviews at national and regional levels
   •	 Assessment of formal and informal mental health services and supports provided by:
      {{   Mental health specialists and nonspecialists as part of the health care system
      {{   Community mental health service platforms (e.g., NGOs, clergy)
   •	 Assessment of community demand for services, help seeking, coping, and barriers
      to mental health care
   •	 Analysis of secondary data to estimate cost of intervention scale-up and return on
      investment

The aim of this assessment is to provide information and recommendations that help inform
policy and operational guidance for strengthening integration of mental health into
primary health care and community-based service platforms in Ukraine under the reform
program. It is our hope that results and recommendations will be discussed by key stake-
holders in Ukraine to guide the development of the national mental health policy and plan,
and to inform funding, concrete actions, and program priorities over the coming years.


2. Methods
The assessment was carried out over a 5.5 month period by an International Medical Corps

*Response rate: While the vast majority of respondents we approached were willing and often glad to participate in
interviews and discussions to share their experience, several family doctors/GPs declined participation. This included
8 in Lviv, 3 in Poltava, and 5 in Zaporizhia resulting in a response rate of 71% for this group. Reasons given for
not participating were lack of time (e.g., patients were usually waiting) and being tired after a long day (e.g., when
approached during afternoons or evenings with less patients present).


Assessment tools were adapted from the WHO (2017 draft) mhGAP Situation Analysis
Tool-Framework and included national, district, and facility level questions. Assessment
tools were also adapted from the WHO/UNHCR (2012) MHPSS Assessment Toolkit for
Humanitarian Crises and included the following: “Checklist for integrating mental health
in PHC in humanitarian settings,” “Template for desk review of preexisting information,”
“Participatory Assessment I: Free listing and ranking of problems with further assessment
on daily functioning and coping,” and “Participatory Assessment II: Example Questions for
Key Informant Interviews on Distress and Supports in Different Population Subgroups.”

Assessment tools were piloted during the assessment and were further refined and
simplified with the goal of ensuring that questions were tailored to the context,and were
practical and relevant.


2.3. Analysis of Secondary Data: Mental Health Impact, Investment,
and Return on Investment Analysis
Analyses of mental health impact, intervention scale-up, and return on investment were
performed with support from WHO using existing data from the OneHealth tool. Detailed
methods and results are presented in Chapter 7.

1. Background and Context

1.1. Sociopolitical Context
Located in Eastern Europe, Ukraine is the second largest country in the European region
and is bordered by the Black Sea, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, Belarus,
and Russia. The majority of the population in Ukraine is concentrated in and around major
urban areas of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Odessa.2

Ukraine became an independent state in 1991 following the dissolution of the
Soviet Union. In the late 18th century, the territories that make up contemporary Ukraine
were split between the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian Empires. During the period of
Soviet rule (1920 until 1991), Ukraine experienced a number of crises, including two large-
scale famines, Stalinist purges, and a nuclear accident in Chernobyl in April 1986. After it
gained independence, Ukraine has gone through a number of political transitions, most
notably the “Orange Revolution” in 2004, prompted by a rigged presidential election, and
most recently, large protests in 2014’s “Revolution of Dignity,” which led to occupation of
Kyiv’s central square (Maidan) and a change in the presidential administration. In 2014,
the Russian military occupied Crimea and supported separatists in taking over portions
of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in the East. The conflict in the East, referred to as an
Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) by the Ukrainian government, has led to continuous fighting
and loss of lives, both military personnel and civilians. The conflict has taken the lives of
2,000 soldiers and 8,000 civilians, and wounded 20,000 people. Approximately 3.8 million
people remain in need of humanitarian assistance, and about 1.5 million people are
internally displaced.1 Internally displaced persons (IDPs) have settled throughout Ukraine,
searching for security, affordable housing, and livelihoods, with the majority of them (over
half ) staying in Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Donbas near the conflict zone.3
Since the Revolution of Dignity, and in large part due to the annexation of Crimea and
conflict in the East, the country has seen a dramatic drop in GDP and purchasing power
with a substantial number of Ukrainians finding employment abroad, mostly in the EU
and Russia.4

Ukraine has one of the worst health profiles in the European region, characterized by
high mortality, morbidity, and disability rates (see Table 1.2). General health in Ukraine
declined after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, with a documented decrease
in life expectancy and standard of living, while rates of mortality increased, especially from
cardiovascular disease, accidents, and causes related to alcohol.12 Self-rated physical health
of Ukrainians is lower than in Russia and other parts of Europe.13 Life expectancy in

Ukraine has shown a gradual increase of about 3 years between 2000 and 2012 but is still
low compared to other European countries.14 An estimated 90% of deaths in Ukraine are
caused by noncommunicable diseases.15 Risk factors such as smoking, excess drinking,
unhealthy diets, lack of physical exercise, and pollution align with the leading causes of
death in Ukraine.16

Infectious Diseases
With one of the fastest growing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics in the
world, Ukraine continues to have thousands of new infections each year. The epidemic
has a particularly negative impact on a number of vulnerable populations in Ukraine,
including those affected by conflict, people who inject drugs, sex workers and their partners,
men who have sex with men, and incarcerated individuals. It is estimated that nearly half
of the HIV-infected persons in Ukraine may not know they are infected, and many of the
new infections are estimated to be in conflict-affected areas.18 The Tuberculosis (TB)
epidemic in Ukraine is characterized by widespread multidrug resistant tuberculosis, as
well as relatively high mortality from untreated or inappropriately treated TB, and increasing
TB/HIV coinfection rates.19 Comorbidity between HIV/AIDS and TB is high. An assessment
in 2016 showed that 19.8% of all persons with TB were HIV infected in Ukraine. In
2015, TB caused an estimated 65% of all reported deaths among persons living with HIV.
Comorbid cases of HIV/TB are a major cause of mortality, with causes of death linked to
late presentation, delayed initiation of ART, and a high prevalence of MDR-TB. It has been
recommended to reduce fragmentation in services in Ukraine, make testing for HIV more
readily available, integrate HIV and TB services at the primary care level, and increase
collaboration and linkage between NGOs and community-based services.20

Social Determinants of Health
Other key factors such as the poor economic performance of the country and defi-
ciencies accumulated in the health system have impacted broad social determinants
of health (poverty, housing, employment, etc.).16 Widespread job loss due to disruptions
in industry, transport, and enterprise activity along with declining exports and imports as
a consequence of hostilities with Russia has deteriorated economic activity for Ukraine.3
Indeed, low socioeconomic factors (material situation), female gender, geographical
region (living in villages rather than cities), and psychosocial factors (low control over life)
have been identified as determinants of health, while good family relationships emerged
as a protective factor in research studies.13

2.1. Prevalence
It is estimated that globally, one in four people will experience a mental disorder during
their lifetime.21 The prevalence of mental health problems is often even higher in countries
affected by socioeconomic problems such as poverty, and by violence and conflict.

Estimates for Ukraine: Epidemiological statistics and sound research on the prevalence of
mental disorders in Ukraine is a relatively new field,22 with few reliable statistics and epidemio-
logical studies.23 The first national psychiatric epidemiological study was completed in 2002.12
Detailed estimates of prevalence from different studies are presented in Table 2.3. It should be
noted that different methods and study samples as well as methodological limitations result
in varied estimates. It is difficult, for example, to distinguish between mental disorders and
normal stress reactions among conflict affected populations by using surveys. Therefore,
studies may overestimate prevalence rates in conflict affected populations.

It has been estimated that close to one-third of the population in Ukraine experienced
at least one mental disorder in their lifetime. Gender differences exist with PTSD and
alcohol use disorders more common among men, while depression and anxiety disorders
are more common among women (see Figure 2.1).12

   Trends across Countries in the Region
   Prevalence of depressive disorders is especially high in Ukraine compared to other
   countries, while alcohol use disorder is also high compared to most other countries
   (except for Lithuania and the Russian Federation). Anxiety disorders, on the other hand,
   are most prevalent in EU countries (see Figures 2.2–2.5).

   2.2. Risk Factors and Social Determinants
   Social determinants of health include daily living conditions (e.g., healthy physical
   environments), fair employment and decent work, social protection across the lifespan,
   and access to health care. Social determinants of health are also related to distribution
   of power, money, and resources, including equity in health programs, public financing,
   economic inequalities, resource depletion, healthy working conditions, gender equity, and
   political empowerment.28 Social determinants have also shown strong links to mental health.29

     Research on risk factors and social determinants in Ukraine
     Geographical differences: Research has shown that the prevalence of mental disorders
     and risk factors vary between different regions in Ukraine,12, 30, 31 as does the availability
     of trained mental health professionals.32 The eastern region of Ukraine has been linked to
     higher rates of suicide33, 34 and the Kyiv and eastern regions of Ukraine have been linked to a
     higher prevalence of mental disorders, specifically mood, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders.12

     Recent studies attribute at least some differences in mental disorders to increased conflict
     and violence that have recently disproportionally impacted the eastern region.35, 36, 37 Host
     populations in conflict affected areas and displaced persons experience various stressors
     such as exposure to violence, loss (e.g., homes, family members, communities), unemploy-
     ment, decreasing incomes, increasing costs of utilities, and difficulties with housing, and
     accessing basic needs and services.36, 38 Resulting social problems include family conflicts and
     isolation39 while feelings of distrust and political divisions negatively affect social cohesion.40

     Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs): Studies suggest a high prevalence of common
     mental health problems among IDPs (see Table 2.3). A recent report of IDPs in
     Zaporizhia found that the common stressors among this population included difficulty
     finding employment and financial challenges, not feeling accepted by the host community,
     conflicts in the family, damaged psyche, alcohol abuse, fear of the future, loneliness/lack
     of communication, and feelings of loss,41,42 which can all increase the risk for developing
     mental health problems. Indeed, one recent study found that mental disorders in IDPs
     were significantly associated with cumulative trauma exposure, more recent displacement,
     and poor economic situations.41

* Defined as consumption of at least 60 grams or more of pure alcohol on at least one occasion in the past 30 days.
** Heavy alcohol use in men defined as consuming >80 g of ethanol in a typical drinking day, or consuming either >to 60 g 3–4 days/week or >40 g
nearly every day. Heavy alcohol use in women defined as at least monthly consumption of >60 g of ethanol in a typical drinking day or consuming either
>45 g 3–4 days/week or >30 g nearly every day.50 For example, 14 g of ethanol would be roughly equivalent to 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits, one glass of
wine, or 1 beer (12 ounces). Based on these calculations, 80 g of pure ethanol is roughly equivalent to 8.55 ounces of distilled spirits, 6 glasses of wine, and 6
twelve ounce beers. Sixty grams of ethanol is roughly equivalent to 6.4 ounces of distilled spirits, 4 glasses of wine, and 4 twelve ounce beers.
***A cross-sectional study conducted in 2008 using data from 2001 examined the epidemiology of heavy alcohol drinking in eight former Soviet
Union countries including Ukraine. Heavy drinking was defined as the consumption of at least 21 beers (80+ pure alcohol), 750 g wine (90+ g pure
alcohol), or 200 g strong spirits (86+ g of pure alcohol). The reported typical amounts of alcohol consumed were converted from liters into grams of
alcohol per week assuming one beer contained 40 g of pure alcohol, a 750 g bottle of wine contained 90 g of pure alcohol, and a bottle of 500 ml of
vodka or other strong spirits contained 215 g of pure alcohol. High weekly alcohol intake was defined as >210 g in males and >140 g in females. Fifteen
percent of males reported heavy alcohol drinking/week (>210 g of pure alcohol), while 2% of females reported heavy alcohol drinking/week.51
IDPs and veterans: Practitioners and studies have noted a high burden of mental health
problems among military personnel and internally displaced persons.35, 43, 44 A report of
veterans in Zaporizhia found that the most common stressors included feeling unsup-
ported and betrayed by the government, having difficulty finding employment, poor
health care, and problems with alcohol.42 One study in Kyiv and Zaporizhia found that
both IDPs and veterans often experienced continued stress related to exposure to traumatic
events and feelings of social isolation and hopelessness. Difficulties with adaptation and
reintegration into society were also noted, with over half experiencing mental health
problems such as PTSD (see Table 2.3).41 It is also important to note research suggesting
that substance use including alcohol use disorder is more prevalent among conflict
affected populations and veterans. PTSD is also a risk factor for substance abuse.45

Risk factors for mental disorders: Factors that have been associated with a higher
risk for mental disorders in Ukraine include older age (except alcohol use in younger
women), gender (female gender for depression and anxiety disorders and male gender for
alcohol use disorder), lower education, unemployment, living in the eastern region of
Ukraine, as well as no longer being married and experiencing life stressors12 (see Table
2.3 for details). These risk factors were similar for IDPs and the general population. In
older adults, depression is also associated with experiencing chronic health problems.




Assessment Findings on Social Determinants and Risk Factors
The factors found in the literature are similar to the factors key informants described as
contributing to mental health problems in Ukraine (see Table 2.4). This includes poverty,
unemployment, conflict in the East, and resulting displacement, as well as stressful life
events. Key informants also mentioned anxiety about the conflict in the East and access
to medical services as a stressor.

These assessment findings are consistent with global research from various countries
which have shown consistent relationships between social inequalities, poverty, and
mental health problems.53 It is likely that poverty affects mental health via factors such as
the experience of insecurity and hopelessness, as well as increased risks for poor physical
health and being exposed to violence.53 On the other hand, mental health problems can
also contribute to lower educational achievements, unemployment, and increased
poverty, setting up a vicious cycle.

However, it is also important to note that while these factors increase risk, they are not
determinative of mental illness. The complex interplay of bio-psychosocial factors under-
lying the development of mental illness continues to be investigated. Furthermore, it is
also important to consider not only risk but also protective factors such as social support54
and the accumulation of positive and negative effects over the lifespan.55

            It appears that poor mental health in Ukraine is tightly interconnected with poverty,
            unemployment, and feelings of insecurity, compounded by the effects of the conflict.
            Persons who are IDPS, older people, and living in the East seem to be especially
            vulnerable.


            2.3. Impact and Burden
            Untreated mental health problems do not only affect individuals and their ability to
            function, earn an income, and raise children, but they also impact whole families and
            communities. This high cost of untreated mental health problems is especially significant
            in Ukraine, which is trying to advance economic, political, and health care reforms in the
            context of dealing with ongoing political instability, high rates of unemployment, and
            current armed conflict and displacement.

            Global studies have found differences in life expectancy, showing that people with severe
            mental disorders die on average 10–20 years earlier than the general population.56, 57 There
            is growing evidence linking mental disorders (including dementia, schizophrenia, alcohol
            and drug use disorders) to a higher mortality compared with the general population.58
            Differences in mortality result from both attributable deaths (i.e., deaths directly caused
            by alcohol use, for example) as well as excess deaths (e.g., higher risk of death from
            cardiovascular disease among people with depression).

Health Impact: Deaths Directly Attributable to Mental Disorders
Alcohol Consumption and AUD
Alcohol patterns in Ukraine are similar to those in Russia, have common cultural and
historical roots, and are exacerbated by conditions and alcohol policies during the Soviet
period.59 In Ukraine, home distillation from sugar (samogon) is deeply rooted in tradition.
Prior to the dissolution of the USSR, Ukraine was a leading producer of sugar. Following
Ukrainian independence sugar production decreased, but home distillation remains
common (especially in rural areas), and the illegal market for alcohol is large. Therefore, it
is estimated that unrecorded consumption makes up almost two-thirds of all alcohol
consumption.59 Alcohol use starts in adolescence. One study in Kharkiv demonstrated
that 76% of adolescents between the ages of 15–18 had used alcohol over the past year.60
It has been suggested that the social construction and normality of the drinking culture
in Ukraine does not encourage healthy lifestyles.59

Excessive alcohol consumption has directly been linked to deaths. The top causes of alcohol
attributable deaths among men in Ukraine include homicide, septicemia (blood
poisoning), influenza and pneumonia, undetermined injury, accidental drowning,
and suicide.59

Deaths related to excessive use of alcohol largely occur among working-age males. It is
estimated that 40% of deaths among working-age males and 22% of deaths among
working-age females between the ages of 20 and 64 are attributable to the effects of
alcohol in Ukraine.59 Alcohol attributable deaths for males and females in 2007 were very
similar to the rates in 1980.59 Ukrainians whose deaths were due to excessive use of alcohol
lost an average of about 33 years of life.59

Comparison with countries in the region: The risk of dying of an alcohol attributable
cause is 7 times higher in people from the eastern part of Europe compared to the Mediter-
ranean region.61 Deaths attributable to AUD are lower in Ukraine than in some of the other
eastern European countries (except Georgia) but still higher than in the European Union
(see Figure2.6 and Table 2.5).

                Suicide
                Suicide as a cause of death is also closely linked with common mental disorders and alcohol
                use. Ukraine has one of the ten highest suicide rates in the world (ranging from 24–32
                per 100,00012) and suicide falls under the category for the 3rd highest ranking cause of
                death in Ukraine. Globally and in Europe, suicide is ranked the second leading cause of
                death among young adults aged 15–29.62


                Health Impact: Years of Life Lost (excess deaths)
                Mental health problems also indirectly contribute to excess deaths by increasing
                the risk for developing physical health conditions, suffering injuries, engaging in
                unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity, obesity), not seeking or
                being able to access health care, and not complying with medical regimens.

                Globally, mental disorders have been linked to higher rates of death due to coronary
                heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, respiratory diseases, and some cancers.58 Indeed, it is
                estimated that about 80% of premature deaths in people with mental, neurological, and
                substance use disorders are due to physical illnesses, particularly cardiovascular disease,
                including stroke and cancer.58

                Research has shown that:
                      •	 Major depression is a risk factor for ischaemic heart disease.
                      •	 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with increased deaths
                         caused by ischaemic heart disease (IHD), neoplasms, and intentional and uninten-
                         tional injuries.58
                      •	 Alcohol use has been connected to tuberculosis, lower respiratory infections, multiple
                         cancers, cardiovascular and circulatory diseases, cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis,
                         epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, injuries, and interpersonal violence.

                Regional and global trends: Regionally, the Russian Federation ranks by far the highest in
                terms of years of life lost (YLL) due to alcohol use, followed by Lithuania, Ukraine, and Poland,

Note: The YLL (years of life lost) correspond to the number of deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age at which death
occurs. The basic formula for YLL is the following for a given cause, age, and sex: YLL = N x L, where N = number of deaths and L = standard
life expectancy at age of death in years.64



Although there is no country level data available for YLL due to CMDs, natural history models
of depression suggest there were more than 2.2 million excess deaths globally in persons
with major depressive disorders, with a particularly high rate of death in older persons.58 To
date there is insufficient information about excess death associated with anxiety disorders.


Impact on Disability
Mental health problems affect a person’s ability to function, such as carrying out day-
to-day tasks, performing at work, and/or establishing or maintaining relationships with
others. Good mental health and psychosocial well-being are essential for adapting to new
situations and challenges, as well as for coping with crises.

Mental illness is one of the great invisible burdens on all societies, accounting for 4 of
the 10 leading causes of disability worldwide.65 By 2030, depression alone will be the
third highest cause of disease burden in low-income countries and the second highest in
middle-income countries.66

In Ukraine, mental neurological and substance use disorders are the second leading
cause of disability burden in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs).

Note: One DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Year) can be thought of as one lost year of “healthy” life. DALYs for a disease or
health condition are calculated as the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and
the Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) for people living with the health condition or its consequences: DALY =Y LL + YLD.70

                     Among all mental, neurological, and substance use disorders, the disability burden
                     in Ukraine is by far the highest for depressive disorders, followed by drug use disorders,
                     alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia (see Table 2.8 with associated
                     Figures 2.8 and 2.9).

                     Regional country comparisons: In comparison with other countries in the region,
                     Ukraine has a high disability burden for depressive disorders and alcohol use disorders (with
                     a higher burden in Russia and Lithuania) while European Union countries on average
                     have a higher burden of anxiety disorders compared to Eastern Europe (See Figure 2.10).

                     Years lost to disability are also by far the highest for depression in Ukraine, followed by
                     alcohol use disorders and anxiety disorders (see Table 2.9).

      = number of incident cases, DW = disability weight, and L = average duration of the case until remission or death (years).70

      Other Impacts
      Mental health problems also have a significant economic impact due to lost productivity
      and labor participation, which is discussed in Chapter 7. Several other impacts of mental
      illness which should be taken into consideration (despite the absence for population-­
      based data for Ukraine) also include family impacts such as:

         •	 Caregiving time and resources invested by family members to support persons
              with mental health problems (e.g., taking time off work, financial impact, stress,
              burnout, and health problems among caregivers).
         •	 Secondary impact on child health and development, including the impact of
              alcohol consumption during pregnancy, maternal depression, anxiety disorders
              among parents affecting children, and violence in the family. Mental disorders



      32 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
      among parents and caregivers have been found to be predictive of poor child
      development and growth, mental health problems among children, and lower
      educational achievements in school.


Perceived Impact of mental health problems
The IMC assessment asked key informants about the impact of mental health problems
among persons in Ukraine. They named a wide range of impacts, consistent with prior
research and population data, including poor health behaviors, impairment in day-
to-day functioning, and financial problems. Important aspects also include negative
effects on relationships (e.g., deteriorating relationships and social isolation) and secondary
impacts on family members. Negative responses from the family or community such
as feeling stigmatized, excluded, and discriminated against were also listed.

                  3.1. Mental Health Financing and Legislation

                  Mental Health Expenditure
                  Ukraine allocates about 2.5% of total health care expenditure to mental health (about
                  $5 per capita, see Table 3.1). This amount is slightly higher than other upper-middle-in-
                  come countries who spend on average about US$2 per head of population on mental
                  health, but is still low compared with high-income countries who spend an average of
                  $58.71 This allocation is still not proportionate to the public health and economic burden
                  these disorders cause. Furthermore, 89% of the mental health budget in Ukraine is
                  allocated to inpatient psychiatric care, which is higher than in other countries (see
                  Table 3.1) and leaves little funding for accessible community-based services.

 psychiatric care

*The primary source of mental health financing is social insurance. The national health insurance system allocates a set amount of
money per inhabitant for primary mental health care. After active lobbying, the amount of money allocated per inhabitant for municipal
mental health rose from the equivalent of $0.7 in 1997 to $2.8 in 1999. Of the insurance funds, 49%, 37%, and 14% are directed toward
inpatient services, psychotropic drugs, and outpatient services, respectively.82
Mechanisms for Overall Health Services Financing
Sources of health financing: Most health financing comes from general government
revenues raised through taxation (VAT, business income taxes, international trade, and
excise taxes). Personal income tax is not a significant contributor to total revenues. There
are no taxes specifically earmarked for health financing. However, the progressivity of the
taxation system in Ukraine is undermined by the scale of the shadow economy (up to
40% of GDP), and wealthier citizens who evade taxes pay proportionately less.83

Regional budgets and decision making: Budgetary funds are pooled at the national
and local levels, as local governments retain a proportion of the taxes raised in their
territory. Additional inter-budgetary transfers also support poorer local authorities who
cannot raise as much revenue. Regional administrations and local governments have
the right to determine the structure of their expenditure and decide how to use the
transferred resources (e.g., for the health or education system).

Budget allocations: Allocations and payments are generally related to the capacity and
staffing levels of individual facilities (e.g., number of beds) rather than to the volume or
quality of services provided.

Budget flexibility: The possibility of transferring funds between budgets at different levels
of the system is limited, leading to a fragmented system of service delivery and duplication
of services while creating barriers to the optimal use of hospital infrastructure. This
approach has been cited as one of the main sources of inefficiency in the Ukrainian
health system.32


Health Expenditure
Of the Total Health Expenditure (THE) in Ukraine, 54.9% was from prepaid government
sources in 2012, which is low in international comparison (see Table 3.2), and private
spending on health (45.1% of THE in 2012) is dominated by out-of-pocket payments.32

The bulk of government expenditure (52% in 2012) pays for inpatient medical services,
with only a relatively small proportion (4.3%) going to outpatient services and public
health.32 The share of public spending on medicines and medicinal devices is very low
at only 1% (in 2012) and has decreased over time, as most pharmaceutical costs for both
outpatients and inpatients are born by patients.32 Private expenditure primarily consists
of out-of-pocket payments, which are high due to the high cost of pharmaceuticals,
which are generally purchased at full cost price by patients.32 Since the beginning of the
global financial crisis in 2008, pharmaceutical prices have increased considerably (by
40–70%), largely as a result of currency devaluation.90 There are some voluntary health
insurance schemes; their impact is marginal, contributing less than 1% to THE. Over the
past 10 years, the private insurance business sector for health has continued to develop,
although no mental health services are covered by insurance.

                          Covered Health Services
                          In the former Soviet Union, entitlement to health services was a universal right, embodied
                          in the constitution. Thus, despite that many former Soviet countries shifted from state-
                          funded health services to social health insurance during the 1990s, most were required
                          to maintain provision of services for everyone regardless of how much they could con-
                          tribute.91 Officially, Ukraine has a comprehensive guaranteed package of health care
                          services provided free of charge at the point of use as a constitutional right.32 There is a
                          defined list of health care services to be provided by publicly owned health care facilities
                          for free, as well as standard volumes of care (e.g., emergency care, outpatient polyclinic
                          care).92 However, the costs for these services are not backed by meaningful funding,
                          and it is left up to the individual health facilities to decide which services will be provided
                          free of charge and which ones require payment. This is problematic given already high
                          hospitalization rates and length of stay, and has led to a lack of transparency and expansion
                          of informal payments in the system.32

                          People with mental disorders have the right to receive free medical care in inpatient
                          facilities (e.g., psychiatric hospital, a psychoneurological dispensary or hospital) and can
                          receive free or discounted medical products.93 However, once a person is discharged
                          from the hospital and goes to the outpatient phase, the medication has to be paid by
                          the patient.

                          In practice however, psychiatric patients also frequently need to contribute to pharma-
                          ceutical costs as inpatients.32, 94 Household surveys showed that 90.7% of inpatients had


                                                                          Mental Health Policy, Legislative Framework and Leadership | 37
to pay for their pharmaceuticals themselves. One study has shown that 92% of the
population claim they are afraid of financial hardship in case of serious illness.95


Benefits for People with Disabilities Including Mental Illness
Certain categories of people are entitled to benefits (e.g., outpatient medicines) including
patients with very serious diseases, war and labour veterans, and some people with specific
disabilities, which can also include severe mental illness, (i.e., severe depression or anxiety
disorders subdivided into three disability categories according to severity, with Group I the
most severe and Group III the least limiting). Persons with disabling mental disorders (Group
I or II) and low income can also receive monthly cash benefits and may be entitled to a
pension.96 Ukraine also provides monetary assistance for persons who provide constant
care to persons classified in the disabled Group I or II as a result of a mental disorder.97


Informal Payments and Bribes
The volume of informal payments is almost equal to the volume of formal payments
for services (8–10% of THE and 22% of household expenditure).32 Patients are willing to
make out-of-pocket payments as a way of trying to ensure better quality or more
                                   attentive care.32 Survey data from 2011 found that 57%
 “All narcologists want

  money (informal

  payments), because
  that’s the only way              for roughly 20% of the total salary funds. This perceived
  for them to earn a               need to pay, whether or not it is entirely accurate, acts as a
  living”                          significant barrier to care.32
     Narcologist in Poltava
   — 
                                   Due to insufficient government financing of the health
care system, the population is required to pay for outpatient and inpatient pharmaceuticals
(which are often expensive) as well as provide unofficial remuneration to medical personnel.


Psychiatric Hospital Admission and Consent
In Ukraine, a person can be hospitalized in a psychiatric institution voluntarily at their
request or with their informed consent.93 Until the age of 14, children can be admitted
to a psychiatric institution upon request or with the consent of their parents or another
legal representative. A person who is considered to be disabled under the law can be
admitted to a psychiatric institution with the consent of their guardian. According to the
law (Law of Ukraine “On Psychiatric Care,” Article 14), admission to a psychiatric institution
without their own or their legal representatives informed consent is possible if their
examination or treatment is only possible in inpatient settings and the person has been
diagnosed with a severe mental disorder as a result of which they pose a direct danger to
themselves or others, or are not able to independently meet their basic vital needs at the
level that ensures livelihood. In June of 2016 the Constitutional Court added amendments
to Article 13 which requires a court decision for Involuntary admission.93

3.2. Health and Mental Health Policies, Framework,
and Reform

Health Reform
Several changes in the health sector have been initiated and realized since independence.
Three phases of the reforms were to be implemented over a four-year period (2010–2014),
and started with changes to health financing to reduce fragmentation and prioritize
primary care. In 2016, the government adopted a health reform package that includes:
(i) transforming health care financing, including the creation of a national purchasing
entity, the Ukraine National Health Services (UNHS); (ii) modernizing primary health care;
(iii) improving access to pharmaceuticals; (iv) addressing noncommunicable diseases; and
(v) creating an integrated National Public Health Institute for disease control and prevention.
The package of reforms was approved in October 2016, and the current leadership of the
Ministry of Health is taking active steps toward implementing the reform measures.98

Ukraine now also has to fulfill a number of obligations in the public health sector under
the framework of the EU Association Agreement. In February 2017, the Ministry of
Health unveiled its three-year health care reform plan that would bring Ukraine’s health
care system more closely in line with European practices by transferring most patient
care from hospital treatment to primary care and prevention, increasing the efficiency
of health care spending, stimulating better practices among doctors and hospitals, and
ensuring citizens’ access to a package of primary health care services free of charge.

Specific reform plans starting in 2017 include:

   •	 Establishing contracting mechanisms for primary care in line with the principle
      “money follows the person,” and turning away from the current inefficient funding
      mechanism based on the number of hospital beds.99
   •	 All public health care services will be administered by one institution, the Public
      Health Center (Order No. 604 of 18.09.2015 Creation of the Centre for Public Health
      of Ukraine),100 which will develop health care contracts with hospitals for budget-­
      funded health care services.
   •	 In line with the decentralization reform being pursued by the current government,
      regions and hospitals will begin to exercise greater local control over the health care
      systems servicing their communities.
   •	 Priority will be given to disease prevention, which is reflected in the primary
      health care reform, financing of this sector in general, and the creation of the Public
      Health Center.98, 101

Mental Health Leadership and Reform
There is no separate mental health department at the Ministry of Health (MoH) but
the possibility of creating a National Centre for Mental Health is under consideration.
There are several specialists who are tasked with aspects of mental health at MoH
including: Two Mental Health Advisors to the Acting Minister of Health; a Mental Health
Consultant to the MoH who is an associate professor and tasked with leading on the 2017
Concept of Mental Health, as well as advising on psychotherapy, psychological rehabili-
tation, and rehabilitation of ATO veterans; a director of the Ukrainian Research Institute of
Social and Forensic Psychiatry and Narcology of the MoH who has been leading key ini-
tiatives in psychiatry; and a Deputy Director of the Ukrainian Research Institute for Social
and Forensic Psychiatry at the MoH who leads initiatives on forensic psychiatry and issues
of children with autism.

Mental health reform is included in the overall health care system reform in
Ukraine. Plans to improve mental health care include the integration of mental health
care in primary health care, provision of services through multidisciplinary teams, and
provision of community-based care to support persons with mental health problems to
live in the community.102 Several efforts have taken place over the past few years to support
the development of national mental health policy and concept notes as outlined below.

   •	 Substance Abuse Policy formulated in 199776
   •	 Mental Health Policy formulated in 1988.103 Components included prevention,
      treatment, and rehabilitation.76
   •	 The Concept of the State Special-Purpose Comprehensive Program for Mental
      Health Development in Ukraine for 2006–2010104 which outlined the issues and
      challenges of mental health, including the economic burden of mental disorders,
      the reasons behind the inefficiency of psychiatric care, and the need for both medical
      and social problems of the society to be solved. The concept outlines ways to solve
      challenges, including protecting persons with mental health problems from
      stigmatization; development and implementation of protocols and standards; effective
      communication between primary and secondary medical care; development of
      regulatory documents; and mental health care training for medical care staff.
   •	 The Plan for the Development of Mental Health Services to the Year 2020
      covered a range of measures to overcome the trend for institutionalization of people
      with mental disorders, including creation of an integrated system of psychiatric care
      facilities, specialized services, and primary care services.105
   •	 The Reform of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services was formulated in
      2013, as part of wider health care reforms in Ukraine by the Ministry of Health, the
      Association of Psychiatrists, and mental health service user groups and endorsed
      by UNICEF.16 The concept outlined various needed changes including: moving
      psychiatric services closer to where the young people live; the separation of adult
      and child psychiatric services; access to evidence-based medicines for children



40 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
     with psychiatric illness; and providing services in outpatient facilities or existing
     multi-profile children’s hospitals.32
  •	 The Concept of the State Program for Mental Health Development in Ukraine
     up to 2020106 outlines an analysis of the origin of the problems behind the
     inefficiency of psychiatric care and ways to solve challenges, including standards
     for diagnostics and treatment, creation of a national database, reforming the educa-
     tional system, and enhancing research. More ways to solve challenges may include
     developing partner relationships, engaging patients and relatives, supporting the
     role of primary health care in overcoming stigmatization of mental health and using
     prevention measures, early detection, timely referral to a psychiatrist, and supervision
     under the guidance of a psychiatrist, transition to providing community-based mental
     health care and medical and social support by a multidisciplinary team consisting of
     a psychiatrist, psychiatric nurse, psychologist or therapist, and social worker.
  •	 The Concept of the National Mental Health Program in Ukraine for the period
     until 2025107 defines the problems and challenges, analyses reasons behind those
     problems, and sets the goal of the program to create a holistic, efficient mental
     health care system that operates in a unified interagency space and safeguards
     human rights and freedoms.

The Concept Note of the State Targeted Mental Health Program in Ukraine Lasting
Till 2030 (2017) has been developed under leadership of the MoH and is the third Mental
Health Concept Note, but it is the first which was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
This Concept Note was developed over several stages, which included a National
Consultation in April 2017, followed by public discussion and review of the Concept Note,
which allowed experts from all regions of Ukraine and representatives from governmental
institution medical facilities, NGO, and International Nongovernmental Organizations
(INGOs) to comment on the document. The Concept Note takes into account several
aspects, including the problems that exist now and ways to solve them by: raising
awareness about mental health and mental illness, decreasing discrimination and
human rights violations, mental health promotion and prevention (including suicide
prevention), regulation of professional activity (e.g., psychologists, psychotherapists)
in line with international standards, supporting professional competence in mental
health among specialists and generalists, bringing educational standards for mental
health in line with international standards, monitoring standards and quality of care in
line with international protocols. Some problems may be solved by improving accessibility
of mental health services through decentralization, outpatient assistance, crisis services,
provision of mental health at the primary health care level, development of multi-
disciplinary teams and referral pathways, tailoring approaches to the needs of certain
groups (e.g., IDPs, ATO veterans, mothers and children, older persons), and improving the
effectiveness of funding for mental health.

Overall, many different efforts have taken place over the years to improve mental
health in Ukraine, with common themes including decentralization and the need for

community care. Although key stakeholders have noted that it is unlikely that mental
health will receive more funding and resources, it is still hoped that a reform of the system,
re-allocation of resources and more efficient financing mechanisms will lead to sustainable
changes in mental health systems and services. Many stakeholders also feel significant
momentum for mental health reforms driven by Ministry of Health leadership and increased
donor interest. The next steps under the leadership of the Ministry of Health include
formulating a mental health policy and plan, which is based on the 2030 Concept note.

4. ORGANIZATION OF
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

4.1. Overview and Structure of the General Health
and Mental Health System
The national Ministry of Health coordinates and governs the core statutory health system,
while parallel systems are governed through their respective ministries. The regional
health authorities are accountable to the MoH for the implementation of national health
policies within their territory. They are responsible for the regional health care facilities,
which primarily provide specialized and highly specialized services, as well as emergency
care services. Most medical services are provided to the population in facilities that are
under local governments at the regional, district, or municipal levels.32 In Ukraine, a highly
centralized model of decision making in the health system inherited from the Soviet era
has gradually been replaced by a system in which authority has been passed to local
administrations and self-governing bodies. The health system is a complex, multilayered,
sometimes parallel system in which responsibilities in the health care sector are frag-
mented among central government (the Ministry of Health and many other ministries
and public authorities), as well as 27 regional administrations and numerous administrative
bodies at regional, municipal, district, and community levels. Geographic gaps in available
health services exist. A survey showed that 7% of households in urban areas and 30% of
households in rural areas lack available primary care centers, health centers, dispensaries, and
pharmacies.108 The private sector in the Ukrainian health system is small and consists mostly
of pharmacies, diagnostic facilities (inpatient and outpatient), and privately practicing
physicians. These are financed mostly through direct payments from the population.32


Organization of Mental Health Services
Based on WHO’s recommendations, mental health service organizations should follow
a pyramid structure (see Figure 4.1), involving different types of services and including
informal community care as well as formal and specialized services. Self-care and informal
community care should be utilized most frequently (bottom of the pyramid), followed by
primary care services for mental health. If the lower levels of services on the pyramid
are available and accessible, the more specialized and expensive mental health services
should be utilized less frequently.109

As with general health care, the contemporary Ukrainian system of mental health has
largely inherited the organizational structure, strategies, and practices from the Soviet
system.110 Currently, the mental health care system in Ukraine is centralized and is
comprised of psychiatric and narcological hospitals, outpatient clinics, psychiatric depart-
ments in hospitals, psychiatric agencies working under other governmental ministries,
polyclinics which may have psychiatrists or even psychologists on staff, as well as a small
number of private health care facilities. Community-based mental health care options,
including mental health provided at the primary health care level by trained and super-
vised general health care providers, are currently limited or absent in the mental health
system.32, 110, 111, 112 Psychosocial support at the community level and crisis psychological
support, as well as self-care and mental health promotion are also insufficiently developed.110

Table 4.1 shows the different levels of mental health and general health facilities, including
psychiatric beds, where applicable.

The health system in Ukraine largely focuses on capacity for inpatient psychiatric treat-
ment with 90% of funding allocated to inpatient psychiatric care at hospitals. There
are 89 psychiatric and narcological hospitals in Ukraine (2015)32 which have a total
of 44,224 beds (98 beds per 100,000 population).32 This is comparable to the Russian
Federation (109 beds per 100,000), Lithuania (106), but much higher than countries who
already have more decentralized care such as Poland (39) and Georgia (28).115

Note: A narcological hospital/dispensary treats addiction and substance-abuse related disorders (the focus of narcology) whereas a
psycho-neurological hospital/dispensary treats psychiatric disorders. The difference between a hospital and a dispensary is that a hospital
can (but doesn’t always) treat a wide range of diseases (e.g., Central Raion Hospital, whereas a dispensary focuses on a specific sphere, i.e.,
narcology, psycho-neurology, and tuberculosis, etc. In practice, the two can be similar in terms of services provided.

In 2008, Ukraine started to focus on integrating mental health treatment into outpatient
care and reduced the number of beds (e.g., Lviv Oblast Clinical Psychiatric Hospital has
reduced 250 beds since 2008). From 2013–2015 the number of psychiatric beds for
adults in Ukraine was reduced significantly, although changes were not seen equally in
all oblasts, with Lviv having the highest number of beds relative to the population (see
Figure 4.2).46 Bed occupancy is high (e.g., 96% in Lviv oblast).

Psychiatric services in general hospitals are mostly focused on outpatient services (only
.65 beds per 100,000).116

The cost and length of stay in psychiatric hospitals is high. The cost per bed per
day includes medication (e.g., $5–8 per day in Lviv), although patients are often asked
to purchase their own medication. In 2012, the average length of stay in a psychiatric
hospital was 53.5 days for adults.117 This is also high compared to other countries such
as Lithuania (20.8 days) and Poland (29.3 days).118


4.2. Available Mental Health Services and Interventions

Treatment Protocols and Prescription Authority
There are considerable deficiencies in the system of developing and supporting pro-
fessional competencies among mental health practitioners and related specialties,110
and the lack of evidence-based practices in Ukraine is seen as a real challenge.119 Most
recently, an association of specialists has been created under the MoH, which is tasked


  “I’ve been working here for 37 years. I can tell what a person is suffering from
   intuitively. I don’t even have to talk to the patient.”

46 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
with the development and implementation of guidelines and protocols for the treatment
of mental disorders, and protocols for depression and PTSD have recently been created.110

Each medical institution within the health system has internal protocols for the
identification, assessment, treatment, referral, and follow-up of different mental disorders
including CMDs and AUD, which are based on protocols approved by the Ministry of
Health of Ukraine.107,120 In April 2017, the Minister of Health updated the law to allow
Ukrainian doctors to use European treatment protocols.107 However, contemporary
evidence-based protocols on mental health services delivery are still used unsystem-
atically in Ukraine.104

The newly developed government protocols for PTSD121 and depression122 also outline
the role of primary health care doctors. According to these protocols, doctors should
identify PTSD and depression (using specified screening instruments such as the PHQ-9),
provide psycho-education and basic psychological interventions (depending on their
competency), and can also prescribe some psychotropic medications including antide-
pressants (e.g., for sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, PTSD) and benzodiazepines (e.g.,
for short-term management of anxiety). According to the law,123 psychotropic medications
can only be prescribed by medical institutions and doctors who have a license.124


Interventions Provided by Mental Health Specialists
Based on our assessment, the most common interventions used by specialized pro-
fessionals for patients with CMD and AUD are summarized in Table 4.3. Evidence-based
psychological interventions for depression, anxiety, and PTSD (e.g., CBT, CBT-TF, EMDR)
or for AUD (e.g., motivational interviewing, peer support, 12 step model) were mostly not
provided by mental health professionals at state facilities. Such interventions were
at times offered by professionals in private practice, working at private universities (e.g.,
UCU) working or at private rehabilitation centers. On the other hand, the professionals in
private practice offered a range of interventions with some being evidence based and
some being outdated or even potentially harmful.

Similarly, private rehabilitation centers (for drug and alcohol use disorders) were
described as being of varying quality. Several key informants (service providers and
mental health (MH) service users) expressed concern about the “Closed type” rehabilitation
centers which provide medication only and keep clients locked up with little information
regarding available services. Many of these centers are not licensed and there is no strict
legal regulation of such centers.


Coordination of Care
We also found that outpatient care was fragmented with mental health care professionals
providing different interventions with little communication between each other and
limited roles. Psychologists and psychotherapists, for example, stated they could not diagnose

                                          care, and not receiving needed care is often the
result. The lack of coordination between the two disciplines has also been pointed out
as problematic by numerous health care and rehabilitation professional key informants
during this assessment.

Many psychologists, psychotherapists, and social workers in government clinics reported
having multiple jobs and roles, including having their private practice in addition to their
work in state-run institutions or NGOs. At times, they reported asking patients coming to
see them in public health facilities to come to their private practice instead. One psy-
chotherapist in a government polyclinic reported referring patients who were feeling
depressed or anxious to her own private homeopathy practice. This is problematic and
calls into question ethical concerns as homeopathy is not regulated or recommended
for people experiencing mental health problems.

At times however, having multiple roles also led to more integrated systems and service
provision. In Poltava, for example, a social worker works part-time at a narcological
dispensary and part-time at an NGO (“Prostir Nadii,” Space of Hope), which supports people
with alcohol and substance use disorder using the AA model. She helps patients connect
to the NGO and attend groups after they leave inpatient treatment at the narcological
dispensary. These multiple roles are more likely in areas with a higher density of public
and NGO services and initiatives.

        50 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
protocols have been developed for the identification (e.g., specific questions to ask),
management (including prescription of selected psychotropic medications), and referral
(in the case of no improvement) for persons with mild to moderate depression and
PTSD at the PHC level. However, our assessment showed that few providers are
reporting that they identify, provide interventions, refer or follow up with persons
experiencing mental illness (see Table 4.4. for details). Similarly, feldshers, who work at
the community level, reported that their role in supporting persons with mental disorders
was very limited. They described that they could only refer patients to the Central Rayon
Clinic or call an ambulance in case of violent outbursts due to psychotic episodes.


Informal Community Care
Clergy and Faith-Based Groups
Our assessment showed that clergy are often an important source of emotional support,
especially in Western Ukraine. Key informants described that many people trusted clergy
more than mental health professionals and that clergy were easily accessible and free of
charge. They also noted that mostly older or very young people turned to them (less
people between the ages 30–55). Clergy (in Lviv and Poltava) described doing the following
when persons appear depressed, anxious, or are struggling with alcohol use:

  •	   Talking and discussing problems
  •	   Helping people identify their strengths and weaknesses as a part of healing
  •	   Fostering insight and acceptance
  •	   Encouraging people to turn for help (e.g., to others who can help, to God)
  •	   Praying
  •	   Suggesting meditation
  •	   Listening to their confession
  •	   “Healing with words”

Clergy and mental health professionals organize social activities: Several mental
health service providers also reported working together with clergy to organize events
and refer patients or colead support groups together. One priest described working with
mental health professionals such as psychologists and narcologists to organize weekend
trips out of the city for persons with psychological problems. They enjoy nature and go to
a monastery with the aim of promoting mental health and supporting persons affected
by mental health problems (including CMDs and AUD). He noted that, “It is easier to
open up while taking a walk in the forest.”

Training in mental health: Clergy described having received some training in mental
health during their time in the seminary, as well as through additional courses and training
opportunities. This included seminars on mental health at Ukrainian Catholic University
(UCU, Lviv) as well as an educational program lead by the Dragomanova National

Pedagogical University and Christian Educational and Research Centre, on “Psychological
Counselling and Chaplaincy” in Poltava. Clergy (in Lviv) also described referring people to
mental health services at UCU.


Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
AA is a faith-based group for addicted and co-addicted persons, and AA chapters exist
throughout Ukraine in most major cities. AA follows the 12 Step Program, which has been
found effective for persons struggling with drug and alcohol addictions. AA also uses a
peer support model, with persons who have been successful in recovery assisting others
who are still struggling to stay alcohol or drug free. Our assessment found that AA groups
in Ukraine include groups for those recovering from drug and alcohol use, mixed gender
groups, female only groups, as well as separate groups for family members. Several key
informants who were recovering from alcohol use described AA as being helpful in
their recovery (also see Chapter 6).


Folk and Alternative Medicine
Many people who feel that the available health care system is not meeting their needs
and they do not trust doctors and the health care system, turn to folk and alternative
medicines for support.32 There are about 4,000 registered alternative medicine practi-
tioners in the country, but informants suggest a number at least 10 times higher. They
have minimal connection with mainstream health care. A small proportion of these
practitioners are medical professionals specializing, in folk and alternative medicine. Most
do not possess any medical training, and up to 70% of these alternative healers have
no accredited professional training or certification.32 About 5.5 million people
receive services from these alternative healers.32 Most live in rural areas, but a number
of richer urban residents consult with such healers.126 The government has made several
attempts to regulate this field,127 and such practitioners are forbidden to assess psycho-
logical health and to treat various disorders including drug addiction and mental disorders
that require immediate hospitalization. According to several key informants, healers are
frequently accessed by persons with CMDs. We also spoke to one person practicing
homeopathy who admitted she could not diagnose or treat mental disorders but would still
counsel persons experiencing feelings of anxiety and depression and would recommend
herbal remedies for them.


Self-Care, MH Promotion and Awareness Raising Programs
It has been widely noted that there is insufficient awareness about mental health in the
Ukraine, which results in stigmatization and not seeking professional help. There are also
no significant efforts for the promotion of mental health and prevention of mental
disorders in line with global guidelines and research.104 Indeed, our assessment showed
there were no programs to promote mental health at the national level or the target oblasts.

                                                which focused on negative

                                                centers (drug and alcohol use)



                  Almost all key informants (e.g., doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists) talked about the necessity
                  of providing at least information and psycho-education about CMDs and AUD.

                  We found that information provided at health facilities was minimal and focused on
                  negative consequences (e.g., of alcohol use). NGOs often had extensive mental health
                  promotion materials and community activities, but these tended to focus on specific
                  target groups (e.g., IDPs, veterans, and their families) and not the general population and
                  were not widely available (see Table 4.5.).

                  Some organizations even actively discourage against accessing mental health services.
                  A recent exhibition “Psychiatry—industry of death” was held in Odessa (2016) and Kyiv
                  (June 2017) and organized by the church of Scientology. It featured people in white
                  coats with fake blood trying to encourage those experiencing mental health problems
                  to join Scientology instead of seeking mental health care (see http://cchr.org.ua/category/

                  4.3. Mental Health Rights and Advocacy
                  There is limited participation and engagement of individuals with mental disorders
                  and their family members in planning, implementing, and evaluating mental health ser-
                  vices, and also some resistance from the established mental health workers to change the sys-
                  tem.104 Our assessment found a limited number of existing organizations that mainly focus
                  on severe mental disorders, intellectual disability, and patient rights, while there appears to
                  be less of a focus on advocacy for the needs of persons with CMDs and AUD (see Table 4.6).

                             and has seen a need to focus on patient rights. The organization will organize groups
                             for families and family members of hospitalized patients to inform them about their
                             rights, advocate their interests and connect them to relevant services and supports
                             (e.g., lawyers or NGOs). They also plan psycho-education and awareness raising
                             activities to reduce stigma.




4.4. Availability and Cost of Psychotropic Medicines
The availability and cost of psychotropic medications that arose as a key challenge from
the literature, as well as key informant interviews and findings, are summarized below:


Cost
   •	 The costs of psychiatric medication emerged as a major barrier and key chal-
     lenge in this assessment based on key informant interviews, as well as the literature
     review.128
   •	 Psychiatric patients have to purchase their own medications in an outpatient setting,
     but also frequently need to contribute to pharmaceutical costs as inpatients.32
     {{   Sometimes there are delays in the procurement process, and hospitals cannot
          provide the patients with medications in time.
   •	 The list of free-of-charge medications approved by the Cabinet of Ministers does
     not include any psychotropic medications.
   •	 There is an absence of insurance to cover psychiatric medications.
   •	 Psychotropic medications are available for free or at reduced costs for specific
     groups (people belonging to disadvantaged or vulnerable populations, and people
     with socially significant or especially serious illnesses). However, in practice they
     often still need to pay out of pocket for medications they are prescribed.32




54 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Prices in Target Oblasts
  •	 Our assessment (see Table 4.7) shows that
    {{   The price of generic antidepressants, which are part of the WHO essential drug list, varies
         between different pharmacies and locations between $1.17 to $1.94 per month for the same
         medication.
    {{   The price of other antidepressants ranges between $2>27 to $29.88 per month.
    {{   The price of antianxiety medication (national list only) ranges from $11.79 to $21.42 per
         month.
    {{   The price of mood stabilizers is $0.95 to $8.55 per month.
    {{   Other medication (reportedly often recommended by service providers interviewed although not
         part of clinical guidelines for anxiety and depression) includes nootropil ($0.02 per month)
  •	 With an average monthly wage of $200 (slightly lower in Poltava and Lviv) costs are 0.6% to 0.9%
    of the monthly wage for generic antidepressants to 15% of the monthly wage for more expen-
    sive anti-depressants.



                  Availability
                    •	 In addition to the high cost of medicine, there is no national system for ensuring
                       supply of psychotropic medication outside of major cities.32


                  Prescribing Patterns
                    •	 Pharmaceutical companies have a significant influence on prescribing patterns;
                       they have aggressive marketing practices, advertise pharmaceuticals in the mass media,
                       hold free seminars for medical generalists and specialists (including family doctors, GPs,
                       and psychiatrists), and reward doctors who prescribe their products.32
                    •	 There is a high level of overprescription among physicians, who often prescribe
                       expensive brand-name pharmaceuticals instead of less expensive generics, and at
                       times disregard rational prescribing policies in favor of more tailored approaches.129
                    •	 However, psychiatrists in our assessment also noted that they recommend medi-
                       cines based on the financial status of a patient. If the patient is able to pay, they
                       prescribe more modern medications.


                  Consumer Demand
                    •	 There is a demand for newer and more expensive medications. There are generic
                       antidepressant medications which are purchased with government budget costs
                       and often prescribed to patients at a low cost (amitriptyline, fluoxetine, diazepam).130
                       However, practitioners have noted that patients often complain about the side effects
                       and quality of medications, and want to obtain a more expensive new generation of
                       medications that have less side effects and are perceived to be more effective.

                                                                          Organization of Mental Health Services | 55
Pharmacy Practices
   •	 Pharmacists may offer substitutes for indicated medications without consulting the
     prescribing physician, and some will reward physicians who advise their patients to
     choose a particular medication.131


Cost Regulation
   •	 The government adopted a number of potential solutions to curb rising pharma-
     ceutical prices, including expanding the list of pharmaceuticals subject to state
     price regulation to cover almost the entire Essential Medicines List (903 generic
     drugs or 85% of all registered drugs in Ukraine), but psychotropic medications
     are not included.132

In sum, although generic psychotropic medications are relatively low in cost, they are not
covered by the government, there is no regulation in prices and patients may be directed
towards more expensive medications by their doctor or pharmacist or may prefer such
medication believing it to be of better quality. Not being able to access needed psychiatric
medication creates a heavy burden for the patients’ families, reduces access to treatment,
hampers compliance, and decreases its efficacy.32


4.5. Available Mental Health Services Supported
by NGOs and Civil Society Organizations
The recent conflict and high numbers of IDPs and persons suffering from distress have
led to a proliferation of volunteer and civil society organizations aiming to address
mental health problems and provide psychosocial support. Several international agencies
have also started to implement mental health and psychosocial support programming or
to work with local partners. Despite the increased attention to mental health, strengthening
of international cooperation,135 and increased civil engagement around these issues, several
challenges have been noted by key informants:

   •	 Insufficient coordination among agencies, state bodies, and NGOs when providing
     support to people with mental health problems.104
   •	 Lack of coordination between NGOs also remains a challenge at the regional oblast
     level, and there is not a systemic approach to joint planning and implementation.104
   •	 No accountability and no mechanism to ensure quality care leading to concerns
     regarding quality, ethics, and security.104
   •	 International NGOs and agencies often engage local partners in short-term training
     (e.g., one week), simply translating western approaches with no continued
     follow-up, supervision, or mentoring.

      (e.g., trauma, PTSD) without taking a broader approach.
   •	 There is insufficient state financing for local NGOs, which is significant, as private
      or INGO financing is unstable, unsustainable and grant based.
   •	 While many volunteers (including psychologists and psychotherapists) have been
      offering their services for free to civil society organizations, the numbers of volunteers
      continue to decline due to ‘volunteer fatigue’ and the pressure of finding stable work.


Volunteers
There has also been a proliferation of volunteers in recent years, who offer their services to
different organizations or travel to conflict affected areas independently. The following
challenges were reported by key informants:

   •	 Volunteer psychologists often try to help without the needed skills and qualifications.
   •	 There are doubts about the professional level of psychologists and other specialists who
      are working now with veterans and IDPs without relevant skills and knowledge
      of mental disorders.
   •	 There is often no formal training or preparation for volunteer psychologists.
   •	 Volunteer psychologists can experience burnout, and may not consider if they are
      healthy enough themselves to provide services.
   •	 There is high inconsistency in terms of practices and skills among professionals
      and volunteers.
   •	 Sustainability is a challenge given that providers are often operating outside of an
      established system or formalized structure that can support continued efforts, pay
      a regular salary, and enforce quality assurance control. Volunteer psychologists may
      not work for a sustained period of time because they are not paid.
   •	 As a result the affected population is not receiving appropriate psychosocial care
      and support.

A mapping of community organizations in target oblasts (see Figure 5.1) showed that:

   •	 Community organizations are most heavily active in areas with large concentrations
      of IDPs such as Zaporizhia, while Poltava has the least number of community
      organizations.
   •	 Community organizations often specifically and exclusively target IDPs, veterans,
      and family members of veterans, while services may not be available to the
      general population or may only be available at cost.
   •	 Most organizations offered general recreational and social activities as well as psy-
      chosocial support, while few offered psychological interventions for CMDs and
      AUD. Even fewer offered evidence-based interventions.

4.6. Continuum of Care: Identification, Referral,
Follow-up, and Information Sharing

Identification Referral and Follow-up
Effective case identification, referral and follow-up emerged as one of the key challenges
in this assessment from the literature/reports as well as key informant interviews:

   •	 Although protocols and screening instruments exist, assessment and identification
        of persons with CMDs and AUD at the general health care level are still very limited.
   •	 Referrals for CMD and AUD between providers are rare.
   •	 Doctors tend to refer to a psychiatric clinic only if inpatient treatment is necessary
        (e.g., in case of suicidal tendencies).
   •	 Referrals and follow-up occurs mostly informally based on personal relationships.
   •	 There is a lack of coordination for mental health referrals and follow-up
        communication between NGOs and government services.
   •	 Referral pathways from NGOs to specialized mental health care remain weak,
        with many local NGOs lacking knowledge or being unable to make such referrals.136

As a result, clients themselves often have to make decisions about where to seek
help and whether or not they will seek help from a psychologist or psychiatrist.




60 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Multidisciplinary Teamwork and Communication
Based on our assessment including key informant interviews and the literature, there is
a lack of a multidisciplinary approach (e.g., cooperation between various actors, and
between doctors and psychologists).

  •	 There is often no or limited communication or coordination to meet the needs
     of people with CMDs and AUD (e.g., between narcological and alcohol dispensaries
     and village clinical points).
  •	 Communication between various stages of patient care (e.g., referral, follow-up)
     occurs mostly through informal channels.
  •	 There is a lack of integration and communication between different levels of
     health care (e.g., family doctors and GPs have a medical card for each patient with
     a disease history and diagnoses. If a patient is referred and receives care from a
     psychiatrist or psychologist, their diagnosis is kept confidential and not shared with
     the PHC provider).
  •	 Lack of communication between different providers and levels leads to fragmented
     care (e.g., a patient with a prescription for medication from a psychiatrist follows
     up with the local Rayon level neurologist who changes the prescription, with no
     information exchanged between providers).
  •	 Many providers stated that confidentiality and existing laws prevented them
     from sharing information with other providers.
  •	 Many key informants noted strong needs for strengthening multidisciplinary
     teamwork and implementation of models of community care.137


        In 1999, mental health professionals from Ukraine and Kazakhstan pro-
        vided recommendations based on a study tour in the United States.
        Part of the recommendations included training family physicians,
        nurses, psychologists, and social workers to diagnose and treat
        those with mental health or substance abuse problems, refer patients
        with more complex disorders to specialists, and develop an approach
        based on joint family practitioner–mental health professional case
        management. Based on a collaborative model of care, the researchers
        highlighted the importance of early detection and management of
        mental disorders which requires training of service providers at the
        primary practice level.138




                                                      Organization of Mental Health Services | 61
In sum, the system is lacking continuity of care and a multilayered comprehensive
mental health system. Persons with CMDs and AUD are often not referred; there is limited
communication between providers from different professions (e.g., GPs, psychologists, psy-
chiatrists) or between different agencies and organizations (e.g., government and NGO).104


4.7. Mental Health Information Systems
and Confidentiality
Health Information System
There is a unified electronic health information system for specific reporting from the
regional level upward, but at the municipal and community levels, reporting is done on
paper using standardized forms.32 A large number of medical facilities still do not have a
computerized system. Therefore, doctors or nurses manually record patients and share
this information with the statistics department.

Mental health information collected includes the number of outpatients and inpatients
seen by the providers, number of outpatient/inpatient departments in the region, number
of beds (for adults and children), and number of doctors. For patients receiving inpatient
care, facilities collect information about the types of disorders. Quarterly, statistical
information is sent from the health facility statistics department to the statistics department
in Kyiv. However, this data is not officially available or analyzed for planning of mental
health services.139

Psychiatric Reviews Required for Employment
Persons applying for certain jobs have to undergo mandatory initial and periodic psychiatric
reviews.140, 141 Applicants have to submit a clearance certificate from both narcological and
psychiatric dispensaries that confirms the applicant has no contraindications including:

   •	 Psychiatric contraindications include “chronic disorders (diseases) that are
      accompanied by clouding of consciousness, perceptions and thought process
      disorders, disorder of will, emotions, intellect or memory, which destroys or substantially
      limits the person’s ability to adequately perceive the reality, their psychological
      condition and behavior.” 142 If a person suffered a severe mental disorder not earlier
      than 5 years ago, this person has to undergo an additional psychiatric outpatient or
      inpatient examination.
   •	 Narcological contraindications include “alcohol, drug, and chemical abuse.”143
Jobs affected by this regulation include: underground and surface mining and oper-
ational divisions of gas extraction, production, and transportation; those who have to keep or
bear arms or explosives when on duty; police; firefighters; mine rescuers; gas rescue teams;
emergency medical service personnel and public health personnel; employees of the nuclear
industry; drivers of vehicles; workers of railway transport and metro; aircraft staff, workers of
food industry, medical, and educational facilities (who have direct contact with people).

Jobs also include (for narcological contraindications): workers exposed to certain raw
materials and substances, including alcohol; workers exposed to high voltage, explosive
materials, firearms; firefighters; transportation workers, aviation, and marine personnel;
and public-sector applicants.144

Although an employer can ask for the narcological and psychiatric examination to be
conducted at their cost and ask the potential employee to present a certificate on
contraindications, it is important to note that (according to Article 6 of the Law of Ukraine
“On Psychiatric Care”) only the person or person’s legal representative has the right
                                            to get access to and use confidential data on

inpatient units) report into. However, this does not include persons with common mental
disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression).




Concerns about Confidentiality and Information Sharing among
Key Informants
   •	 Many people believe that a registry of persons with mental illness bans those
      registered from occupying numerous positions;
   •	 Persons worry that seeking care for CMDs and AUD will be recorded as part of
      their record with consequences such as not getting employment. Even some
      family doctors noted “If I write down this person has depression they will not get
      employed;”
   •	 A diagnosis of mental disorder may not be legally discriminatory, but it is in the
      minds of doctors and law enforcement, leading to discrimination in practice;
   •	 There is a low level of trust among the public in the confidentiality of their
      information if they receive mental health care;
   •	 Persons with AUD are indeed registered but it is possible to avoid registration
      by paying a bribe, however many cannot afford this and therefore do not seek
      treatment; and
   •	 As a result, persons reported not seeking care, seeking anonymous treatment
      (e.g., private provider) or treatment outside of their oblast (also see Section 6.3
      on barriers to care).

Perceptions and Concerns about Information Sharing
and Confidentiality
Our assessment showed that there was confusion about what information can legally
be shared, with whom, and how information can be used as summarized on the
previous page.

In sum, there are legal limitations for the exchange of information about patients with
mental disorders at different levels of the health system and outside the system to protect
patient confidentiality. However, there is confusion and mistrust among the general
public about what information is shared, leading to not seeking help or spending
more money and resources to seek help (e.g., longer distance, private services).

                      TRAINING FOR MENTAL
                      HEALTH

                      5.1. Number and Distribution of Human Resources
                      The mental health workforce under the Ministry of Health is shown below. According to
                      staffing standards, every psychiatric hospital department and every mental health clinic is
                      required to have at least one psychologist. In reality, the numbers are much lower.32 Com-
                      pared to other countries and the WHO EURO region, the number of psychiatrists is high
                      in Ukraine (11.6 per 100,000) but the number of psychologists per 100,000 is lower (1.3 in
                      Ukraine vs. 2.7 In EURO region; see Table 5.1). Indeed, it has been pointed out that there is
                      insufficient use of psychologists and psychotherapists in the Ukraine health system.32

Oblast Level Number and Distribution of Human Resources
Current practices of human resources planning and management of the state-run health
system do not follow a coherent model, and the availability of psychiatrists and trained
mental health providers varies greatly between regions.32 There are comparatively few
psychotherapists available in Zaporizhia and fewer psychiatric nurses in Poltava compared to
other regions for example (see Table 5.2). The shortage of mental health care professionals
has been exacerbated in conflict affected areas, where facilities have been reduced and
services are often not available.148 Professionals in Ukraine have noted the challenge of
low salaries for health care providers, including mental health professionals.47, 149 There
are also differences in salaries with those working in rural areas being paid less and some
leaving for work in Poland or the EU.

5.2. Professional Education and Training

University Education
An overview of academic qualifications in mental health–related fields is shown in Table 5.3.
It is important to note that providers are only allowed to work in medical institutions
(e.g., psychiatric hospitals, polyclinics) if they have a degree/diploma from a medical
university (e.g., certified medical psychologist or psychotherapist). Key informants also
noted the following about university level education in mental health–related fields:

   •	 Psychologists and psychotherapists who have received masters degrees from public
     universities have none or very limited practical training, receive no clinical supervi-
     sion, and have no formal training on addressing CMD and
     AUD in line with global guidelines.                               "Everything I learned at my own
                                                                        expense and state gave me noth-
   •	 The situation is similar for social workers who have              ing. I earn $50 month for work-
     limited practical training experience and knowledge of             ing part time at the polyclinic, but
     evidence-based psychosocial support approaches.                    summer school costs $153 per
   •	 Less than half of the psychologist and psychotherapist            week and I have to take time off
     graduates actually practice due to low salary.                     work. The state does not invest
                                                                        in our education, I can diagnose
   •	 Many psychologists and psychotherapists work in govern-           a patient and do not know what
     mental clinics and also have private practices.                    do do later, this is the worst and
   •	 Additional training to become ‘psychotherapists’ in               the saddest."
                                                                       —Psychotherapist, Lviv
     specific psychological interventions from private train-
     ing institutions is available at cost and with a limited
     evidence base and oversight and often not in line with evidence-based inter-
     ventions (e.g., some estimate that the vast majority of psychologist/psychotherapist
     study Gestalt-therapy in Zaporizhia).


5.3. Continued Education and In-service Training

Mandated Continued Education
Professionals have government mandated continued education requirements as outlined
below. The requirements can be fulfilled with oblast-level public universities and academies
of postgraduate studies. They also have to take regular certification exams to verify
professional competency.

             Specialized and general service providers noted that many continued education oppor-
             tunities were available but that higher quality training courses also came at a higher cost.
             Many expressed the desire to learn more about mental health if courses were available
             (see Table 5.4 for details).


             5.4. Capacity Building in Mental Health Supported
             by International Actors
             There are many international organizations working in the Ukrainian health sector, but
             their activities have mostly focused quite narrowly on specific areas such as sexual health,
             HIV/AIDS and TB in the past.32 However, donor interest in mental health has increased
            since the conflict in the East and several international NGOs and agencies have supported

capacity building in mental health for Ukrainian professionals. Our assessment identified
several key initiatives (listed in Table 5.5) and found that:

   •	 There are several promising capacity building efforts which are based on global
      guidelines and best practices (e.g., WHO mhGAP Intervention Guidelines, WHO
      PM+) and which could be scaled up and used by other international organizations
      and national actors
   •	 Links to other countries (e.g., Lithuania) have already been made (e.g., study
      visits, professional exchange, see section below for details)
   •	 Different materials, protocols, and approaches are used by different actors and
      are not always consistent with national or global (WHO) protocols and guidelines
   •	 Some capacity building efforts are only short-term trainings which are missing
      important components of continued follow-up and supervision
   •	 Trainees are not always receptive to new approaches in line with evidence-based
      guidelines if they have spent many years practicing different models
   •	 Many capacity building efforts target only staff serving conflict-affected popula-
      tions including IDPs, as well as veterans driven by international donor interest.


74 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Professional Knowledge Exchange and Experience of other Eastern
European Countries
Other post-Soviet countries have been facing similar challenges related to the overwhelming
reliance on institutionalization and high levels of stigma associated with mental disorders.
Several of these countries have taken steps toward mental health reform, which can help
provide insight into the need for change and possible best practices.

Lithuania, another post-Soviet country that is now part of the EU, had started to reform
their mental health system in line with a community-based approach and empowerment of
consumers. There has been a move away from inpatient care toward community-based
mental health centers with multidisciplinary teams (e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists,
social workers, mental health nurses). Although efforts have somewhat stagnated due to
economic difficulties, there are many lessons learned which have been published and are rele-
vant to Ukraine.150 Furthermore, there has been continued professional exchange and support
from Lithuania to establish community-based mental health care in Ukraine (see Table 5.5).

Another example is Georgia, which began to prioritize mental health reform in the
1990s through long-term commitment and strategies. A recent case study identified the
following areas as essential to reform:151 developing a clear Mental Health Plan (with
a focus on recognizing and addressing differences in need based on geography, actions
to link existing services and addressing financial and geographical barriers to care,
                      based services and integration of mental health into primary
creation of community-­
care); improving research capacity to use evidence for informing policy and practices;
Integrating existing services and developing care for vulnerable groups (i.e., the need for
psychosocial rehabilitation and creating space for input from service users); and over-
coming stigma and resistance to reform. The case study highlights the importance of
relying on NGOs to creatively implement small-scale interventions that could later
be scaled up to national level strategies after their effectiveness was shown, the need
for translation of mental health publications into the local language, the reliance on NGOs
and other entities with lobbying power to use data and programming to influence policy
makers to adopt legislation, and the need for the government to increase funding to
support improvement of existing mental health services. In addition, the adoption of
laws and strategies to protect patient rights was noted as a milestone in Georgia’s mental
health reform, as was the actual deinstitutionalization of large psychiatric hospitals closing
and relocating beds into existing hospitals. However, according to one key informant
with extensive experience working in Georgia, it is also important to note that Georgia
experienced problems due to privatization of some mental hospitals, which were not
profitable and not sufficiently resourced with beds and services.

There are also other examples of cooperation and information exchange for improving
mental health services between Ukraine and other Eastern European countries (e.g.,
Poland) and other European countries (e.g., France, Germany). However, it has also been
noted that these efforts are not always known by different donors or by organizations
implementing projects, which results in not making use of lessons learned.

5.5. Professional Associations Licensing
and Accreditation

Professional Associations
Since Ukrainian independence, various professional associations have been created,
including those for mental health professionals (Table 5.6 summarizes information from
our assessment).110 There are also other professional associations such as the Ukrainian
Association of Psychotherapists, which offers educational programs (e.g., group psycho-
therapy, family system therapy) and the Ukrainian Association of CBT (with 200 members,
30 out of them have been accredited with European certificates.)

Licensing and Accreditation
The Ministry of Health develops and approves state quality standards and clinical proto-
cols, and is responsible for the organization and implementation of mandatory accredi-
tation of health care facilities and the issuing of licenses to legal entities and individuals
involved in medical services or the production and sale of pharmaceuticals and medical
equipment.156 Key informants and the 2017 Ukraine MH concept note have noted the
absence of systemic implementation of professional standards and of quality control of
mental health services delivery. There is a clear need for 5.7 licensing bodies with support
from professional associations. Main concerns are summarized in Table above.

             6.1. Attitudes toward People with Mental Illness
             Attitudes toward people with mental illness can often be negative and can further
             discourage people from disclosing mental health problems to others and from seeking
             help. Key informants described various negative attitudes common in the community,
             which put blame on the person suffering from common mental disorders or alcohol
             use (see Table 6.1).

             Coping
             Key informants recovering from mental health problems were asked about ways in
             which they had tried to cope in the past (see Table 6.2). Most people had tried to find out
             more on their own by reading and researching the Internet; several had found self-help
             books, some of which were based on best practices, while others had more questionable
             content (e.g., authors making promises not consistent with scientific literature). Most also
             described engaging in relaxing activities and reaching out to friends. Many negative coping
             strategies also emerged such as self-medication and using drugs and alcohol to cope.

Sources of Information about Where to Find Help
Most key informants reported researching the Internet or relying on friends and family
for suggestions on where to find support for mental health problems. Fewer reported
receiving information and referrals from health and social service providers (see Table 6.3).
This seems consistent with the literature reporting that most persons in Ukraine rely on
personal recommendations and informal networks when making decisions about
accessing health services.157,158

Help Seeking from Formal and Informal Service Providers
Globally, data show that the vast majority of people who need help for mental health
problems are not receiving it, with WHO estimating an overall 20.4% prevalence of mental
disorders with only 4.9% receiving treatment.159 A 2005 survey in Ukraine indicated that
75% of respondents with major depressive disorders and suicidal ideations never sought
professional help.12 Similarly, a recent (2016) cross-sectional survey of IDPs in Ukraine with
common mental health problems (depression, anxiety, PTSD) showed that only a minority
of them (180 of 703) had sought care, indicating a treatment gap of 75%.47

Mental health service utilization data from Ukraine also suggest that few people are utilizing
mental health outpatient services when considering the likely prevalence of common
mental disorders and other mental health problems (see Table 6.4).

Heals of population of Ukraine 2013–2015).



In our assessment, we have limited information about this treatment gap because we
only spoke to people with CMDs and AUD who had actually received mental health care.
However, most key informants in our assessment reported seeking help from various
formal and informal providers before receiving the support they needed (Table 6.5). Persons
with CMDs reported seeking help from government psychiatrists as well as private or
NGO psychologists. Some also sought help from social services and clergy. Those with
AUD often spent time in an inpatient narcological dispensary as the first step for seeking
help, and used private rehabilitation centers at a later time if their families could afford it.

These findings are in contrast to the 2016 study of help seeking among IDPs with common
mental disorders (N = 180). When they did seek care, they approached neurologists
(84 persons), pharmacists (82 persons), psychologists in the community (74 persons),
therapist/neurologists in the hospital (73 persons), NGO or volunteer at a center for
mental health or psychosocial support (72 persons), or family doctors (67 persons).47

A 2002 National Mental Health Survey in Ukraine found few people sought care for
mental health problems. When they did seek care, respondents went to a general
health provider or folk healer.12,111 Other literature similarly suggests that those
Ukrainians seeking care are more likely to seek care through a general medical provider
than a specialized mental health professional.12

However, one survey (2010) of community members (Vinnitsa and Kyiv) found that family
doctors and GPs were not preferred as the first contact for mental health and psychosocial
problems. Only 32% of participants reported that a woman aged 35 with psychosocial
problems related to work would see a family doctor/GP, 7% said a man with a suicidal
inclination would see a family doctor/GP, and 35% said that a man aged 52 with an alcohol
addiction problem would see a family doctor/GP.125

Overall, some studies suggest that family doctors/GPs are a common first point of
contact for persons with common mental disorders and alcohol use problems, while others
suggest clergy, traditional healers, pharmacists, and specialized mental health
professionals are also common. The data collection methods, geographical regions, and
participants vary between studies, and data from self-reports are less reliable than actual
service utilization data. Regardless, many studies have shown that persons with CMDs
often seek care from a GP for mental health related symptoms (e.g., problems sleeping,
fatigue, loss of energy), and that therefore primary health care presents an important
first entry point and opportunity for identification. Still, all potential first points of contact
need to be considered in order to ensure timely case identification and support.

Positive and Negative Experiences When Seeking Help
Our assessment also asked mental health service users about their positive and negative
experiences when seeking help from friends, peers, and formal and informal service
providers (see Table 6.6). They described positive coping strategies and receiving support
from family and friends, as well as evidence-based psychological interventions (e.g., CBT,
mindfulness based interventions) as helpful. People with AUD had positive experiences
with private rehabilitation centers and AA groups.

Key informants also described negative experiences, such as lack of understanding and
support from friends and family, receiving only medication (e.g., from psychiatrists,
narcologists), which was not enough to help them, and seeing psychologists or psycho-
therapists for interventions that did not help or made them feel worse. Persons with AUD
also described negative experiences at government narcological inpatient units and
locked private rehabilitation centers, where there was only medication support and no
attention to their psychological well-being and no support for recovery.


6.3. Barriers to Care
Several barriers to receiving mental health care have emerged in the literature, as well as
in our assessment, and include historical roots of mental health care, barriers in the health
system, and lack of knowledge or stigma (see Table 6.7).

These barriers include the following:

Psychiatry as punishment: During the later years of Soviet rule in the 1960s–1970s, when
the regime became reluctant to convict people of anti-Soviet action directly, psychiatry
emerged as a key instrument of political repression. Political and religious dissidents
were diagnosed with types of schizophrenia and subjected to abuse and torture in psy-
chiatric institutions. Although this practice was discontinued following independence,
psychiatry’s troubled past as a mechanism of repression hangs heavy over mental health
care today.129 Indeed, key informants described that psychiatry is seen as a punitive system
and a recommendation for psychiatric help is seen as a punishment by some, including
veterans.

Stigma and shame: Given the history of the Soviet Union’s punitive use of mental health
treatment, continued stigma related to inpatient care has been reported in the literature
and affects willingness among Ukrainians to seek mental health treatment.12 Stigma and
shame also emerged as barriers in our assessments with several key informants stating
they would be ashamed to seek care and would prefer to seek help anonymously.

Fear of having a public record: Many key informants also stated that they would be
concerned about having a ‘public record’ stating that they are mentally ill, have a substance
use disorder or are seeking mental health treatment. They were worried about having
employment restrictions and suffering discrimination as a result. Persons with AUD were

concerned about being registered as alcohol dependent when seeking free treatment
at a state narcological dispensary, and to lose their driver’s license and be subject to other
employment limitations as a result. They stated that it is possible to get treatment (e.g.,
doctor in the government narcology dispensary and psychiatry hospital) without getting
on the record if paying a bribe. However, this is difficult to afford and anonymous treatment
is also expensive.

Lack of understanding and awareness: Consistent with the literature, our assessment
also found that there is a lack of understanding and awareness about mental disorders and
ways to seek help. The general community often does not know the difference between
psychology and psychiatry in terms of treatment methods and approaches. Psychosocial
support is a relatively new concept and often not well understood.160 There is also no
differentiation between serious and common mental disorders among the population,
and many assume that hospitalization is always required.

Lack of trust and negative experiences with providers: There is a lack of trust toward
the health care system in Ukraine in general. Previous studies and assessments have found
that community members often did not have positive experiences seeking care from the
only available specialists (psychiatrists).161 One study found that IDPs and veterans in Zapor-
izhia stated that they would seek out mental health services if they felt professionals were
competent and could be trusted.161 Similarly, our assessment found that people do not
trust the public health care system and the qualifications of mental health professionals.
Several key informants described having heard about others having negative experiences
with providers, or having such experiences themselves.

High cost of treatment: As discussed in the previous section on psychotropic medication,
the high cost of medication prescribed can often be a barrier. Although generic antide-
pressants on the WHO essential drug list (fluoxetine and amitriptyline) may be relatively
affordable, many patients receive prescriptions or suggestions (e.g., from friends) for more
expensive medications. Similarly, treatment by private practitioners or in private rehabilitation
centers can come at a high cost. In the 2016 study of adult IDPs with CMDs in Ukraine,
the average cost for respondents that had paid for care was $107 over the previous
12 months, while the average cost for medicines over the previous 12 months
was $109.43 To put this in context, the average wage per month in Ukraine during that
12-month period was $193.43

Limited geographical access. Geographical access emerged as a challenge, especially
in rural areas where mental health professionals are lacking.

In general, our findings are also consistent with the study of IDPs with CMDs which showed
that the most common reasons for not seeking care included: believing they could get
better using their own medications, the high cost of health services and medication,
not being aware of where they could find help, lack of understanding by health care
providers, poor quality of services, and stigma/embarrassment.43




86 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Overall, our key informant interviews with persons recovering from CMDs and AUD
showed that those who were most successful in receiving effective treatment had
supportive family or friends who encouraged them to get treatment, lived in major
cities where they could access high quality programs or met criteria to access NGO
supported programs for free (e.g., IDPs, veterans), and had an interest and ability to
find information about mental disorders and AUD (e.g., Internet access). It is likely that
many people without these opportunities remain without access to treatment.


Differences in Help-Seeking Patterns
It has been noted that there is insufficient attention to providing tailored mental health
services in a way that considers the specific needs of different segments of the population.104

Regions: Research in Ukraine suggests that differences in mental health needs and help
seeking depend on a number of factors, including location (e.g., living in the East).12, 50 It
may be the case that availability of resources, cultural differences, or closeness to other
parts of Europe, etc., may impact differences.

Age: Several key informants including service providers noted that younger people
were seeking mental health services more readily than older persons. This may in part
be explained by the history of psychiatry in Ukraine as oppressive, which is remembered more
clearly by the older generation. It is also possible that younger persons can more readily
access information about mental health and available services (e.g., on the Internet,
social media). Data from International Medical Corps (IMCs) project with a radio station in
Ukraine, which features mental health topics, suggests that older persons are more likely
to listen to the radio, while younger persons are more likely to listen to radio programs
and podcasts online.

Rural areas: It has also been suggested by key informants that persons in rural areas are
more likely to trust and confide in people within their communities and may not always
access services in bigger cities or respond well to mobile teams of outsiders. This offers
a potential avenue for persons living or working at the village level, such as clergy and
social workers, to be important first contacts for basic support and linkage to more
specialized services as needed.

Veterans and military: Our assessment results corroborated with several studies that
noted low service utilization, particularly among men and the military. Soldiers and vet-
erans do not want to be seen as weak by accessing services and talking to therapists.
At the same time, veterans reported that mental health services were not available or
they did not trust the quality of services offered by military psychologists. Key informants
also reported that veterans felt that psychologists who had never joined the military
would not understand them. Indeed, in a summary report of the socio-economic impact
of internal displacement and veteran return, it was found that nearly one-fourth of
all veterans sought some form of psychosocial counseling, but most found the

support inappropriate and sub-par. The survey also noted several reasons preventing
veterans from getting psychosocial support, which included a lack of professional psy-
chologists (47% of all veterans interviewed), dissatisfaction with the quality of work from
psychologists, and not having access to the type of counseling approach they were seek-
ing (i.e., problem solving, family, partner, and parenting counseling). Stigma preventing
access to psychosocial services accounted for around 29% of veterans surveyed.162 Our
assessment findings showed families of veterans were often the ones trying to convince
them to seek services for mental health or alcohol use problems. When veterans were
asked what kind of mental health support they would prefer, they stated being more
comfortable sharing problems with peers who were also in the military, accessing
service points that provide multiple services (e.g., education, information, legal, and not
only mental health), and talking with mental health providers who were competent,
professional and would respect confidentiality. Our assessment also found that programs
that build trust and relationships with veterans through community, family, and social
activities and excursions are more successful in engaging veterans in seeking more
specialized help.

7. ADDRESSING COMMON
MENTAL DISORDERS AND
ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS IN
UKRAINE: IMPACT, COST OF
SCALE-UP AND RETURN ON
INVESTMENT

7.1. Introduction and Methods
The health and economic costs of CMDS and AUD are considerable (also see Chapter 2).
From a public health perspective, it is useful to estimate the impact as well as the
benefits and costs of scaled-up treatment, which can provide relevant information in
support of greater investment in the future. This assessment therefore includes an analysis
using secondary data and the OneHealth tool to estimate impact, cost of scale-up, and
return on investment for the treatment of CMDs and AUD. These results together with the
other assessment findings help inform recommendations, including prioritization and
allocation of resources for mental health.

The economic and social benefits of better mental health include intrinsic value
(improved well-being) and also instrumental value, in terms of being able to form and
maintain relationships, to study, work, or pursue leisure interests, and to make decisions
in everyday life. Therefore, possible benefits include (a) the health impact referring to
improvement in the health and/or functional status of the target population, (b) the
social impact, given improvements in social functioning or participation, and (c) the
financial impact, given that interventions may lead to being able to go back to work,
work more productively, or improve their financial situation.

Assessment of these benefits—and relating them back to investment costs to establish
the rate of return—can be achieved by estimating current and future levels of mental ill-
health as well as effective intervention coverage in a population, and then determining
the economic impacts of improved mental health outcomes, particularly rates of labour
participation and productivity.163
A return on investment analysis comprises two components: the cost of program
implementation and the monetary value of subsequent benefits. These cost and economic
benefits are used to calculate the return on investment (ROI) through the following formula:

Return on Investment = (Improved Productivity + Well-being + Income Generation) –
Investment Costs/Intervention Costs


7.2 Health Impact Assessment

Methods and Tools Used
The recently developed mental health module of the inter-UN OneHealth tool (OHT)
was used to generate estimated numbers of persons with mental disorders residing in
Ukraine. The OneHealth software tool has been developed by WHO and other UN agencies
to strengthen health system analysis, costing, and financing scenarios at the country
level (http://www.who.int/choice/onehealthtool). OHT has been used in earlier ROI studies,
notably the global ROI analysis carried out by Chisholm et al. (2013) for depression and
anxiety disorders.163 Estimates are based on UN population projections and the latest
Global Burden of Disease prevalence estimates. We also used OHT to calculate expected
numbers of cases for the next 13 years until 2030, which is in line with the time frame of
the Ukraine national mental health Concept Note.


Modeled Interventions
Analysis of interventions was largely restricted to treatment since the evidence on pre-
vention of mental disorders was comparatively weak and currently of low generalizability
to low- and middle-income country settings. In line with WHO’s mhGAP Intervention
Guide,125 modeled interventions included basic psychosocial treatment for mild cases,
                                                                                      –
and either basic or more intensive psychosocial treatment plus medication for moderate­
severe cases. Moderate–severe cases of depression were split into first-episode and
recurrent episode cases. Staff providing interventions include both nonspecialized and
specialized staff (e.g., PHC doctors, nurses, CHWs, psychologists, social workers, etc.).


Health Impact of Treatment
The health impact of treatment of CMDs was expressed primarily in terms of a propor-
tionate improvement in the rate of remission—equivalent to a shortening of the duration
of an episode of illness—and the average level of disability or functioning:

   •	 Anxiety disorders: the rate of remission following treatment improved by 60% (from
      7.5% to 12% of cases) and disability level improved by 12–17%
   •	 Depression: the rate of remission increased by 25–35% (depending on the intensity
      of intervention), and disability level improved by 6.5–14%



90 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
For more severe mental disorders, the health impact of interventions was modeled
through the average level of disability or functioning (22–38% improvement before
adjustment for non-adherence). These effect size estimates were adjusted (downward)
by 30% to account for expected levels of non-adherence in treated populations. Thus, for
example, basic treatment of mild cases of depression raised the remission rate by 25%, or
18% after allowing for non-adherence; this is equivalent to reducing the average length
of an episode from 7 months to 6 months. Intervention effects were restricted to the year
in which they were obtained; that is, treatment did not dynamically change disease rate
estimates for future years. In the case of maintenance treatment of recurrent depression,
however, a 40% reduction in the rate of recurrence was also modeled.

For all interventions, the summary measures of health gain in the population were
cases averted and healthy life years gained. Healthy life years are computed with ref-
erence to country-specific life tables that are already built into the OHT model, and reflect the
time spent by the population in a particular state of health with a known degree of disability.

For alcohol use disorders, which includes all individuals who consume hazardous and
harmful levels of alcohol (not just those with alcohol dependence), brief psychosocial
intervention was included, plus the following population-based strategies:

   •	 an increase in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages;
   •	 enforcement of bans or comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising, promo-
      tion, and sponsorship;
   •	 enforcement of restrictions on the physical availability of retailed alcohol; and
   •	 enforcement of drunk driving laws and blood alcohol concentration limits, for
      persons with hazardous and harmful alcohol use.

Alcohol use is a risk factor for many diseases and injuries. Sex-specific relative risks for each
disease and injury category were multiplied by the prevalence of hazardous and harmful
alcohol use to form population attributable fractions (PAFs).


Modeling Intervention Scale-up
Modeling of the health impact and cost of intervention scale-up uses a 13-year scale-up
period, in line with the newly proposed Mental Health Plan in Ukraine, and assumes a linear
increase in service coverage for a range of common and more severe mental disorders.
Baseline and target levels of coverage for the years 2017 and 2030 are shown in Table 7.1.


7.3 Cost Assessment
Treatment costs relied on previous cost-effectiveness studies and resource need profiles
garnered from existing treatment guidelines and costing tools. Key categories of resource
use included medication, outpatient and primary care, inpatient care, and also program

levels. The estimated unit cost of an outpatient visit in Ukraine (for the year 2013) was
US$7.23, and the unit cost of an inpatient day was US$41.05. Anti-depressant drug costs
were based on the median price for generically produced fluoxetine published in the
International Drug Price Indicator Guide, adjusted upward for the cost of transport and
distribution. Total costs in a given year for a country are arrived at by multiplying resource

use needs by their respective unit costs to give a cost per case, which is then multiplied
by the total number of cases expected to receive a particular intervention (given by
prevalence multiplied by the population in need multiplied by coverage).


7.4. Results

Number of Persons with Mental Disorder Reached
Scaling up mental health services from current to target levels of coverage over the
period 2017–2030 is expected to result in a three-fold increase in numbers of persons
in need with severe and common mental disorders who are reached (from an esti-
mated 345,000 cases to 941,000 cases). In addition, scaling up of brief interventions for
persons with hazardous and harmful alcohol use to 50% of those in need would
mean that nearly five million of these people would be reached by 2030. Data for
CMDs and AUD only is shown in Table 7.2.

Health Impacts: Healthy Life Years Gained
Total population health gain over the period 2017–2030 is shown in Figure 7.2. Health
impacts of scale up for mental disorders are modest at first, reflecting the marginal
increase in coverage, but increasing over time to the point that 90,000 years of healthy
life will be restored in the year 2030. Given the high prevalence of hazardous and harmful
alcohol use, the health impacts of scaled up alcohol control strategies are substan-
tially greater, amounting to a little over 500,000 healthy life years gained by 2030. For the
period as a whole, the cumulative number of healthy life years gained through scale-up
of all modelled interventions is 4.7 million.


Costs of Scale-up
The total cost of scale-up (in US$) is shown in Figures 7.3 and 7.4, both by disease and
by category of cost; the total cost associated with estimated baseline coverage levels in
2017 is $123 million (approximately one-half of which is inpatient care) rising to over $400
million in 2030. The largest disease contributor to overall cost is bipolar disorder, driven
by the relatively higher cost of mood-stabilizing medications (e.g., lithium, valproate)
compared to generic antidepressant and antipsychotic medication, as well as substantial
expected inpatient care costs. Scaling up brief interventions for alcohol use disorders is
also a major contributor on account of the large target population in need. Inpatient care

    represents the largest contributor to overall costs. The cost per head of population shows
    a corresponding increase, from US$2.80 to US$10.90.

    Given that total health spending in Ukraine amounts to just over 7% of GDP (equivalent
    to US$203 per capita in 2014), and out of that amount 2.5% is estimated to be spent on
    mental health care, approximately US$5 per capita. Close to a 100% increase in government
    mental health care expenditure would therefore be required if target levels of coverage
    are to be reached, particularly if persons with mental disorder are to be protected from
    the potentially impoverishing cost of out-of-pocket payments of medication, tests, and
    private consultations.


    94 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
7.5 Return on Investment Analysis
Persons with common mental disorders and AUD experience functional impairment and
symptoms (e.g., fatigue, being jumpy, being intoxicated from alcohol) which makes it
more difficult for them to function optimally at work, to seek out employment opportunities,
or to maintain employment. Indeed, research has shown that mental illness does not only
impact the health and well-being of affected persons and their families; it also has sig-
nificant economic consequences for employers and governments, as a result of diminished
productivity at work, reduced rates of labour participation, foregone tax receipts, and
increased welfare payments.163

In 2010, worldwide, an estimated US$2.5–8.5 trillion in lost output was attributed to
mental, neurological, and substance use disorders, depending on the method of assess-
ment used. This sum is expected to nearly double by 2030 without significant investment
in treating mental disorders.163

The benefits of mental health interventions and relating them back to investment costs
to establish the rate of return, can be achieved by estimating current and future levels
of mental ill-health as well as effective intervention coverage in a population, and then
determining the economic impacts of improved mental health outcomes, particularly
rates of labour participation and productivity. Using established methods, it is also possible
to monetize the intrinsic value of improved mental health, although these benefits fall
outside the realm of the real (measured) economy. Based on the methods and findings of
a recent global ROI analysis of 36 large countries from around the world,163 it is possible
to identify for Ukraine both the economic impact of lost productivity due to common
mental disorders (depression and anxiety disorders), and also the monetary value and
internal rate of return of investing in its more appropriate treatment. Data are not cur-
rently available to assess these impacts for severe mental disorders or for alcohol use disorders.

Productivity losses can be assessed both with respect to whole days out of role/off work
(absenteeism) and also partial days of impaired activity while an individual is at work.
Based on findings from the World Mental Health Survey, it is estimated that compared to
adults without CMDs, persons with depression and anxiety disorder had 23–30 more
days out of role per year.164 Allowing for the rate of labour participation, it is estimated that
over the period 2017–2030 the economic value of lost days of production amounts to
an average of $850 million per year for anxiety disorders, and $425 million per year
for depression. The combined economic value of this lost productivity (US$1.275 billion)
greatly exceeds the estimated cost of current mental health expenditure or projected
service scale-up.104

In terms of the impact of effective treatment of depression and anxiety on productivity,
there are very few studies showing the extent to which effective treatment can get people
back into work, and where measured, estimates are subject to local factors such as
prevailing levels of unemployment. Based on the few studies available internationally,

we conservatively estimate that 5% of those who are of labour force age and are treated
for depression or anxiety are able to return to work, and that for those who are already
working, there is an increase in productive working time equivalent to about 20 days or
one working month per year. These returns to productivity were subsequently mapped
to the prevailing rates of labour participation and GDP per worker in Ukraine, based
on available data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) (2013). The difference
in GDP between a status quo scenario versus one representing scaled up treatment
and consequently enhanced productivity provides our summary measure of economic
benefit. It is estimated that the economic value of restored productivity over the period
2017–2030 amounts to more than $800 million for depression and $350 millions for anxiety
disorders (Table 7.3) (in each case more than twice the cumulative cost of scale-up).
Accordingly, it is possible to conclude that for every $1 invested in scaled up treatment
of common mental disorders in Ukraine, there will be $2 in restored productivity
and added economic value.

In addition, it is possible to place a monetary estimate on the intrinsic value of better
health. This can be done by associating each year of healthy life gained through interven-
tion by a multiple of GDP. In the Lancet’s Commission on Investing in Health, Jamison et
al. (2013) determined that the value of a one-year increase in life expectancy in low- and
middle-income countries is 2.3 times per capita income, and for the world as a whole, 1.6
times per capita income (using a discount rate of 3%). Stenberg et al. (2013) attributed
two-thirds of that derived value to the instrumental component (which is measured
directly via the labour force outcomes described above), leaving the remaining one-third
for the intrinsic benefits of health (equivalent to 0.5 times per capita income). A total of
542,000 healthy life years are estimated to result from scaled up treatment of CMDs
over the period 2017–2030; valued at $1,811 each (GDP * 0.5), this results in an economic
value of over $1 billion, or an average of $75 million per year of scale-up. When these
intrinsic benefits of better health are added to the instrumental benefits of restored produc-
tion, the ROI evidently improves, to 4.7 for depression and 2.7 for anxiety disorders.

IV. DISCUSSION AND
RECOMMENDATIONS

Assessment Limitations
This assessment had several limitations which affect recommendations and conclusions
that can be drawn from this assessment. First, the focus of this assessment was limited
to common mental disorders and alcohol use disorder only. There are several other
priority mental health conditions which are important from a public health perspective.
This includes severe and chronic conditions such as psychotic disorders and bipolar
disorder, which cause significant disability, impact family members, and are associated
with higher rates of hospitalization. It will be important to include addressing these
disorders in the mental health policy and plan and Ukraine health reform. Suicide was
not investigated in depth but is high in Ukraine and connected to AUD as well as CMDs.
Mental health problems among children, such as developmental disorders, or intellectual
disabilities among adults and children were also not considered despite the importance
of these conditions in the Ukrainian context. Further attention by the Ministry of Health and
its partners are needed to address the needs of persons affected by those disorders as well.

Second, the focus on three oblasts specifically means that this assessment has geographical
limitations, although efforts were made to include information about Ukraine more
broadly, such as capacity building efforts. Yet, there are considerable differences between
oblasts, including cultural and socio-demographic aspects, as well as access to and quality
of mental health services and programming. Key informants involved in mental health
programming have also stated that it has been easier to involve some oblasts in
pilot programs than others. Odessa for example, which has been a pilot site for some
promising new community mental health approaches, was not included in this assessment.

Third, the assessment methods used included desktop reviews and collection of
mostly qualitative data, although we have presented quantitative data in this report as
part of the literature review. The data we collected were limited since they did not include
representative samples and all different types of possible respondents. Furthermore,
qualitative data analysis do not allow for presenting firm estimates of the scope or scale
of certain problems including descriptive data or comparative analyses.

Fourth, we were only able to include those respondents who were willing and able to
talk with us, and we did not talk to all different types of key informants. We were
not able to talk with persons with mental health problems who had never accessed
mental health services, for example. We also only talked with service providers who had
interest and time in discussing mental health issues (e.g., response rate from GPs/family
doctors was 71%). Furthermore, although nurses were present during some of the
interviews with doctors, they generally deferred to doctors and we did not speak with them
separately. Therefore, our findings are not fully representative of all types of informants
and service providers.

Fifth, this assessment focused on mental health as part of the health system and
community based services, although it is also important to consider more specialized
mental health services, including care through institutions as well as services provided
under different ministries. A recent report on social care homes that serve as a permanent
residence for persons with severe and disabling mental and neurological disorders, for
example, highlights challenges and provides key recommendations. Global guidance
(WHO Quality Rights) on supporting individuals in institutions exists as well and should
be considered when reforming the health system. Furthermore, different ministries in
addition to MoH are also relevant for meeting the needs of persons with CMD and AUD.
Social services under the Ministry of Social Policy for example, include the Centers of Social
Heath for Family, Children, and Young People, which has staff stationed in smaller towns
all over the regions. Staff includes qualified lawyers, psychologists, and social workers,
who are important target groups for further assessment and capacity building. The
school system under the Ministry of Education is also important to engage, given that
many psychologists work within the school setting. Some efforts have been under way with
support from international donors to provide psychosocial support training to school
psychologists, and this is an important area for additional exploration and programming.

Regardless, we hope that findings and recommendations from this assessment will be
useful in informing and prioritizing concrete steps for addressing mental health as part
of health reform and in informing mental health programming supported by various
national level and global actors.


Recommendations
The aim of this assessment was to provide information and recommendations that help
inform policy and operational guidance for strengthening integration of mental health
into primary health care and community-based service platforms in Ukraine under the
reform program. This assessment synthesizes key findings and presents recommendations
to inform the mental health policy and plan, donor funded projects, and prioritization of
specific areas for intervention.

Recommendations are based on the assessment findings within the context of global
guidance for strengthening and organizing mental health services by WHO, evidence-based
practices, and national level priorities expressed in the mental health Concept Note and
by key stakeholders.165



98 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
A broad range of recommendations is outlined below, which will take concerted efforts
of various stakeholders, including government actors, international donors, service
providers, INGOs, and community-based organizations (CBOs) as well as mental health
service users. Recommended considerations for prioritizing specific actions for
improving mental health services include feasibility (i.e., technical, administrative, and
legal), financial and resource availability, long-term sustainability, acceptability, potential
secondary or indirect consequences, equity, and potential for transition from pilot project
to full implementation.165

Discussions with key national stakeholders to determine strategies and prioritization of
actions will be needed to decide on the way forward. The following outlines some overall
considerations:

   •	 Initial focus on strengthening coordination and leadership for mental health
      (e.g., among government actors, donors, INGOs, CBOs), in line with global guidelines,
      can contribute to more effective use of resources, information sharing, and
      coordinated efforts.
   •	 Mental health services should be strengthened as a whole (e.g., community
      services need to be available before scaling down inpatient care, and specialized
      providers need to be available to train and support nonspecialist workers).
   •	 Interventions that have the potential to reach large numbers of people in need and
      are expected to have considerable impact and/or return on investment could be
      considered for prioritization. This includes increasing consumer awareness (e.g.,
      positive coping, where to seek care, avoiding ineffective and expensive services,
      medications), self help and addressing conditions such as depression, suicides,
      and AUD.
   •	 Although building capacity at the primary health care level remains important,
      significant efforts are also needed to build the skills of practicing specialists (e.g.,
      psychologists) and to improve availability of existing specialized professionals at
      general health facilities and more remote geographic regions. These specialists are
      also needed for linking to and supporting primary health care providers.
   •	 Continuation or initiation of key pilot projects focusing on regions or cities with
      high need, available resources, and successful collaboration with regional actors can
      build momentum and serve as a proof of concept for later scale-up.




                                                             Discussion and Recommendations | 99
1. Coordination, Communication, and Information
Sharing

1.1 Improve communication and coordination among donors and
implementing partners in support of the Ukrainian government’s
efforts to reform its mental health system
International cooperation and support for mental health has increased, especially in light
of the current conflict in the East. Important capacity building efforts and opportunities
for training and professional exchange have been initiated or are being planned. However,
many key informants have also noted that these efforts are often not coordinated among
donors or implementing partners. As a result, these efforts may not make use of lessons
learned; use different methods, approaches, and protocols (some of which may not be
evidence-based or in line with global or national guidelines); or lack sustainability.

Recommendations
Increase coordination among donors, government actors, and international orga-
nizations by creating a broader task force (e.g., under MoH), holding regular national level
coordination meetings (e.g., facilitated by MoH, INGOs with coordination experience), and
continuing to organize key meetings for information exchange and joint planning in line
with global best practices, national level priorities, and mental health reform efforts.

Use coordination mechanisms and events to plan joint efforts and pilot projects that
build on what has already been done and emphasizes sustainability and potential for
scale-up. Involve regional level actors from other countries and access global platforms
to share information and learn from others.


1.2 Strengthen referral pathways among different formal and
informal service providers in the health and social systems
Our assessment showed that persons with mental health problems access various different
points in the health system and the community including nonspecialists (e.g., family
doctors) and informal or community service providers (e.g., clergy, NGOs). Yet, they are
often not identified or referred to needed services. Reasons for this include not knowing
where or how to refer, being reluctant to mention mental health, or not having a personal
connection to a mental health service provider. The national mental health Concept Note
also points to the need for developing common referral systems and mechanisms across
different services (e.g., health system, social services) and different organizations (e.g.,
government, NGOs) with clear roles and responsibilities.104 There is a need for different
formal and informal service providers to identify persons who may potentially have
mental health problems and to make appropriate referrals, share relevant information,
and follow up. Service users also shared concerns about the confidentiality of their
information, so referrals need to be transparent and made with consent.


100 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Recommendations
   •	 Map available mental health services provided by health and social services or
      NGOs at the oblast level and make this information available to formal and informal
      providers. IMC has provided a mapping tool and directory in Zaporizhia, and such
      mapping could be scaled up by INGOs or CBOs.
   •	 Conduct mental health referral workshops involving different types of professionals
      from different organizations and agencies so they can share information about the
      services they provide and get to know each other. Given that most referrals are
      provided ‘informally’ (through personal contact), getting to know other providers
      can facilitate connections. Such workshops have been organized by INGOs such as
      IMC and could be continued and also taken up by regional level health authorities
      or CBOs.
   •	 Develop common referral mechanisms and forms which can be used by
      different providers. Such forms should document the consent to referral and
      information sharing by the person referred, with the same copy given to the referring
      provider, patient, and referral point. Global IASC referral guidance and sample forms
      are available, have been adapted and translated (by IMC), and could be further
      developed and disseminated as part of referral workshops and endorsed by national
      and regional level health authorities.


1.3 Strengthen communication, information sharing,
and multidisciplinary teamwork
Mental health care provision is often fragmented with different providers offering different
types of interventions to the same person, with little coordination or communication
(e.g., a narcologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists, GPs/family doctors,
social workers). This is also relevant given that many people with CMDs and AUD have
multiple needs in addition to mental health (e.g., employment, financial assistance,
housing, violence and protection issues) which require different providers and the
coordination of different sectors including health, social, and other services. Our assessment
and previous research also show the relevance of such diverse services and supports
given social determinants of mental health and that poverty and other life stressors
increase the risk for CMDs and AUD and vice versa. The mental health Concept Note
expresses the need for strengthening effective communication between providers and
creating an e-health system which helps manage the different needs for services of the
population and can be used to exchange information. Various key informants have high-
lighted the need for cooperation and continuity between various aspects of treatment
(e.g., pharmacological and psychotherapeutic) and various actors (psychologists, doctors,
social workers). It is also important to note that persons seeking mental health care are
confused about what information is shared with whom and are concerned about
confidentiality and discrimination if is it known they received treatment.




                                                           Discussion and Recommendations | 101
Recommendations
   •	 Recognize the value and importance of different interventions and professionals
      (e.g., psychologists, psychotherapists, social workers, doctors and nurses) from
      health and social sectors in addressing mental health as well as other needs (e.g.,
      employment, housing).
   •	 Develop common systems and procedures for information sharing, including
      common databases and forms as well as information exchange between providers
      (e.g., different levels of health care, health and social services).
   •	 Introduce multidisciplinary teamwork involving different professionals who
      share information and coordinate care to effectively meet multiple needs. Models of
      multidisciplinary teams have already been pilot tested in Ukraine (e.g., WHO mobile
      team project, Lithuanian support project) and could be further expanded.
   •	 Develop clear care pathways for different types of nonspecialized and specialized
      professionals which include assessment, identification, treatment, referral, and
      follow-up.
   •	 Clearly communicate to patients what information is shared with whom and for
      what purpose and ensure obtaining and documenting consent. This includes
      developing or updating relevant national level protocols by MoH as well as using
      appropriate processes among specialized and nonspecialized service providers.
   •	 Review current systems of information sharing and registration of persons with
      mental disorders to ensure persons can seek care without fear of discrimination
      and negative repercussions (e.g., employment restrictions). Such review would have
      to be undertaken under the leadership of MoH with implementation and dissemination
      of clear information at the regional level and by health professionals.


2. Organization of Mental Health Services

2.1 Decentralize mental health services from hospital-based care
toward outpatient care and community-based services
The mental health system in Ukraine continues to provide services primarily through
inpatient institutions, with an estimated 89% of all mental health resources allocated
to inpatient facilities and long inpatient stays (average of 53.5 days). These numbers are
especially high compared to other countries in the region. The current model of health
care in Ukraine also incentivizes inpatient stays by covering psychotropic medications for
inpatients only and making budget allocations based on available beds. This type of care
is associated with higher cost of treatment, segregation of people with mental health
problems, and less accessible services. Furthermore, psychiatrists and psychologists
are heavily concentrated in hospitals and in big cities. It is also recognized in the 2017
Ukraine MH Concept Note that the existing focus on provision of mainly psychiatric care




102 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
in inpatient specialized institutions leads to ineffective care and high expenses. From the
mental health service user perspective, inpatient services are more stigmatized and
less accessible, while evidence-based interventions in outpatient and community settings
provide support for multiple needs (e.g., employment) and have been described as
successful. As shown in the ROI analysis, the majority of CMDs and AUD in Ukraine can be
addressed through community based-care rather than inpatient care in the longer term.
At the same time, all levels of mental health care (including inpatient care and self care)
need to be strengthened for a well functioning mental health system.

WHO recommends a pyramid model of organizing mental health services (see
Chapter 4) which can reduce the cost of mental health treatment, while stigma and the
shortage of mental health professionals can be addressed, and early detection of mental
disorders is more likely.165 The Ukraine 2017 MH Concept Note104 states that improved
access to mental health will be achieved through decentralization, which includes
development of outpatient care and outreach (e.g., in-home support, outpatient mental
health centers, mobile teams, etc.), providing mental health at the primary care level,
reorganization of resources from the tertiary to secondary level, and developing referral
and communication mechanisms between providers and level of care. Consistent with
this, five principles for successful deinstitutionalization have been identified by global
experts: community-based services must be in place (e.g., outpatient MH services,
evidence-based care, social services for housing, employment, etc.); the health work force
(including professional associations) must be committed to change; political support at
the highest and broadest levels is crucial; timing is key (e.g., emergency situations and crises
can serve as opportunities for change);166 and additional financial resources are needed.167
The recommendations outlined below are especially relevant for MoH and policy makers
tasked with the health reform and with organizing mental health services. They are also rele-
vant for donors and implementing organizations seeking to support national level efforts.

Recommendations
   •	 Support national and regional level leaders in mental health who can reach key
      decision makers, engage a broad range of stakeholders, and mobilize political will
      for change. This also includes involving skilled and motivated young people.
   •	 Strengthen mental health service provision (including identification, assessment,
      evidence-based treatment, support, referral, and follow-up) at all levels of the
      pyramid through capacity building, development of protocols and task shifting (also
      see recommendation Section 3 on education and training of human resources):
      {{   Expand the number of psychiatric inpatient units in general hospitals to reduce
           reliance on centralized tertiary institutions;
      {{   Allocate specialized mental health professionals (e.g., through restructuring,
           incentives) to ensure that psychiatrists and trained psychologists and psycho-
           therapists are available at a broad range of health facilities (e.g., Raion hospitals,
           polyclinics), which increases geographical coverage;



                                                                 Discussion and Recommendations | 103
     {{   Conduct community outreach of multidisciplinary teams which include specialized
          mental health professionals to local village levels for people with severe mental
          disorders (e.g., psychotic disorders) as piloted in the WHO supported model;
     {{   Address mental disorders at the primary care level through timely identification,
          management (pharmacological and psychosocial) and referral to mental health
          specialists when needed (e.g., severe and complex cases); and
     {{   Create and strengthen community level entry points for identification and
          referral of persons with mental disorders (e.g., by feldshers, clergy, CBOs).
   •	 Strengthen social and community services for persons with mental illness (e.g.,
     help with accessing benefits, housing, employment) in order to meet multiple
     needs that also impact mental health.
   •	 Ensure adequate salaries for health and mental health professionals, including
     those working in rural areas
   •	 Include metrics such as interventions provided, patient improvement, and patient
     satisfaction in monitoring and evaluating health services and contributing to
     accountability.
   •	 Use lessons learned for the provision of mental health care from other countries in
     the region (e.g., Lithuania, Georgia).


2.2 Strengthen mental health coverage and financing
The budget allocated to mental health in Ukraine is still comparatively low (compared
to other countries) and still not proportionate to the public health and economic
burden of mental disorders. Due to insufficient government financing of the health
system, the population is required to pay for outpatient and inpatient pharmaceuticals
(which are often expensive) as well as provide unofficial remuneration to medical personnel.
Persons with CMDs and AUD also incur significant costs by accessing different service
providers including psychologists in private practice or purchasing expensive medications.
The 2017 Ukraine MH Concept Note describes that effectiveness of mental health funding
will be improved as part of the general health reform and will include expanding mental
health service provision, and developing and implementing mechanisms of intersectoral
financing, as well as searching for non-state sources of funding. Although many stake-
holders felt that it would be unlikely for the mental health budget to increase, our analysis
examining cost of scale-up suggests that per capita spending for mental health would
need to be doubled (from about $5 to $10) to achieve significantly increased coverage of
key priority mental health conditions. Investing in mental health, however, appears to make
sense from an economic perspective, given the impairment in functioning and reduced
ability to work among those with mental disorders. Our return on investment analysis
suggests that every $1 spent on scaling up treatment for common mental disorders
will result in $2 of economic return. The following recommendations would require
continued advocacy by various stakeholders as well as leadership from MoH.



104 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Recommendations
  •	 Consider increasing spending on mental health to scale up coverage and
     evidence-based interventions across specialized, nonspecialized, and community
     settings.
  •	 Ensure that treatment (inpatient and outpatient, including evidence-based inter-
     ventions and psychotropic medications) for priority mental health conditions
     (including CMDs and AUD) is available free of charge and included in the basic
     package of health services (the ‘service basket’).
  •	 Include psychotropic medications in the list of medicines subject to cost regulations
     and price caps.
  •	 Include generic psychotropic medications (on the WHO essential drug list) in the
     national list of medicines which should be provided free of charge
  •	 Consider coverage of accredited providers offering evidence-based interventions
     for the treatment of mental illness. This should include accredited private providers,
     especially in areas lacking adequate mental health services and given the current
     shortage of providers offering such interventions.
  •	 Shift financing from being dependent on inpatient bed capacity to being based
     on actual mental health services and needs (“money follows the patient”). This would
     be consistent with the changes already planned under the broader health reform.


2.3 Establish public health initiatives and strengthen services
available for people with alcohol use disorders
Alcohol use in Ukraine has strong cultural traditions. The prevalence and burden of AUD
is significant in Ukraine and contributes to increased mortality and poor health, especially
among working age males. This assessment also showed that persons with AUD often
do not have access to appropriate and effective interventions and are concerned about
being registered and restricted from employment opportunities. Research has shown
that unemployment and alcohol use can reinforce each other and that finding gainful
employment and new meaningful activities is an important part of recovery from AUD.
Global guidelines outline that priority actions for controlling excessive alcohol consumption
and contributing to the reduction and prevention of AUD need to target both supply
and demand.

Recommendations
  •	 Provide evidence-based psychosocial interventions for AUD (e.g., motivational
     interviewing, 12 step program, positive coping) at state run narcological facilities
     by hiring and/or training qualified staff (e.g., psychologists, psychotherapists, and
     social workers) who are working as part of a multidisciplinary team. This would
     require training and capacity building of staff, as well as updated regulations and
     guidance for hiring managers at health care facilities about needed professional



                                                          Discussion and Recommendations | 105
     qualifications and skills of providers. Oversight, quality control, and supervision
     mechanisms would also need to be in place at facilities to ensure provision of
     adequate care and accountability.
   •	 Provide outpatient psychosocial interventions (e.g., continued provider-led
     support groups) and follow-up for patients discharged from narcological inpatient
     units. Staff at inpatient facilities and community level CBOs and support groups (e.g.,
     AA) need to collaborate in linking patients to needed services and following up.
   •	 Build capacity of primary health care providers in identifying persons with
     hazardous alcohol use and utilizing appropriate interventions, which can also
     improve overall health and reduce NCD risk (also see Subsection 2.4).
   •	 Support persons recovering from AUD in accessing educational and employment
     opportunities. This also includes advocating for the rights of persons with AUD
     and working with educational institutions and employers to identify suitable oppor-
     tunities. Collaboration between health and social sectors as well as civil society
     organizations is needed in this regard.
   •	 Ensure that persons identified with AUD or with hazardous and harmful alcohol use
     in conflict with the law have access to appropriate treatment and community
     support.
   •	 Establish mandatory licensing and accreditation for rehabilitation centers (for
     drug and alcohol use). Centers which continue to not meet accreditation standards
     and represent safety concerns should not be allowed to operate. This requires firm
     leadership from MoH as well as the support and strengthening of professional
     associations.
   •	 The following recommendations which address the supply side of hazardous alco-
     hol consumption require advocacy and political leadership across different sectors
     (e.g., health, social, and judicial systems):
     {{   Consider an increase in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages. Resulting funds can
          also be directed toward addressing AUD;
     {{   Enforce bans or comprehensive restrictions on alcohol advertising, promotion,
          and sponsorship;
     {{   Enforce restrictions on the physical availability of retailed alcohol;
     {{   Enforce drunk driving laws and blood alcohol concentration limits for persons with
          hazardous and harmful alcohol use.


2.4 Provision of integrated physical and mental health care
Mental and physical health are closely interconnected. Mental health problems and
alcohol use are likely to contribute to physical health problems. NCDs are the main
cause of mortality in Ukraine with contributing factors such as alcohol use and unhealthy
lifestyles. Research shows that persons with mental health problems often engage in poor
health behaviors (e.g., overeating, poor nutrition, smoking, lack of exercise), which


106 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
contribute to NCDs. Furthermore, persons with mental health problems are less likely
to seek needed health care and are less compliant with medical regimens. This is again
especially relevant in Ukraine, where medical compliance is important not only for NCDs
but also for infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and TB, which have a high degree
of comorbidity with mental health problems and a high burden in Ukraine.168 Research
shows that the life expectancy of people experiencing mental health problems is shorter,
which can largely be attributed to physical health problems.

On the other hand, physical health problems can contribute to poor mental health
as well. Persons living with HIV are more likely than the general population to experience
mental disorders, such as depression, anxiety, suicide, and substance misuse.169, 170 Chronic
and life threatening diseases such as cancer (which ranks among the top causes of death
in Ukraine) can also significantly impact mental health and well-being.

Collaborative care and linkages between different types of health services such as NCDs
and infectious diseases with mental health have been recommended. There is some
evidence that excess mortality among people with mental disorders can be reduced
through evidence-based treatments and improved screening and treatment provided by
community-based collaborative care teams.

Recommendations
  •	 Train and work with health staff who are involved in treating common con-
     sequences of alcohol use (e.g., cardiologists) to provide basic interventions and
     referral for patients with problematic alcohol use and AUD.
  •	 Provide collaborative care for persons with CMDs and AUD, ensuring that physical
     health problems are addressed as well. This requires links and communication
     between different types of health and mental health professionals.
  •	 Ensure timely identification intervention for mental health problems among
     people suffering from physical health problems such as NCDs and infectious
     diseases. Considerable funding continues to be allocated by international actors
     to combat HIV/AIDS and TB in Ukraine. Addressing mental health through capacity
     building of staff and referral links should be a key part of such programs.
  •	 Provide community-based interventions which promote a healthy lifestyle and
     can be helpful for mental health as well as physical health problems (e.g., physical
     exercise has been shown to help people with depression, activities such as healthy
     cooking classes or nature walks promote physical health as well as social support).
     Such interventions can be suggested by health care staff and implemented by
     community level organizations and providers (e.g., CBOs, Clergy).




                                                          Discussion and Recommendations | 107
2.5 Ensure focus on priority mental health conditions with high
public health impact and/or return on investment such as depression,
suicide, and alcohol use
The prevalence and burden of depression and AUD is higher than other countries in the
region, except for Russia and Lithuania. Ukraine also has one of top 10 suicide rates in the
world, and suicide is associated with both depression and alcohol use disorder. At
the same time, basic public health measures and mental health interventions have a high
return on investment for these disorders. Due to the fluid political situation in Ukraine, the
fighting in the East, and resulting higher levels of psychological stress, there has been an
increased focus among donors and NGOs on treating PTSD. Some civil society organiza-
tions and NGOs, for example, have focused exclusively on PTSD treatment and training
or suggested stand-alone centers or services for trauma and PTSD. Furthermore, gov-
ernment statistics track the number of persons with PTSD and AUD but not those with
depression accessing services. While trauma and PTSD are important issues to address,
it is also critical to consider that depression is much more prevalent when considering
Ukraine as a whole. Economic hardship and conflict related stress can also increase the
risk for depression (and not only PTSD). Furthermore, this assessment has shown that
interventions to address depression have a high economic return on investment,
which is about twice that of anxiety disorders (see Chapter 7). Different mental health and
social problems often co-occur (e.g., PTSD together with substance use), which calls for
a more comprehensive approach. It should also be noted that global guidelines do not
recommend a stand-alone focus on specific disorders such as PTSD/trauma for mental
health services but rather a comprehensive approach addressing different mental health
priority conditions.

Recommendations
   •	 Do not focus capacity building efforts or stand-alone services on only trauma
      and PTSD. This recommendation is specifically relevant for international organizations
      and professionals offering their help. The coordination mechanisms outlined in
      the first set of recommendations can also serve as a platform for discussions about
      designing programs in line with global guidelines and national efforts.
   •	 Consider focusing on multiple priority mental health problems with public health
      significance including (but not necessarily limited to) depression, suicide, and
      AUD. This recommendation is relevant for developing training curricula and protocols
      for health and mental health professionals by MoH and academic institutions but also
      for international actors planning to implement or support mental health programs.
   •	 Include depression (and not only PTSD and AUD) in government statistics of persons
      accessing services.
   •	 Invest in suicide prevention and intervention strategies (e.g., promoting responsible
      media reporting, including the issue of suicide in capacity building of health and
      mental health professionals, raising awareness about suicide via the media, and
      community discussions).171, 172


108 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
2.6 Ensure that mental health services and outreach are accessible to
everyone, while being tailored for reaching different population groups
Our assessment and other studies show that different population groups have different
ways of accessing services as well as different preferences and concerns about receiving
mental health care. Given that most people (about 75%) with mental health problems
do not access care in Ukraine, there is a strong need to increase help-seeking behaviors.
Those less likely to access mental health services and more difficult to reach include men,
veterans, and older persons. At the same time, data from previous research and this current
assessment suggest ways to reach those populations. The 2017 MH Concept Note also
explains that mental health services must be sensitive to the needs of specific target
groups (e.g., children and youth, mothers, veterans, IDPs, persons with disabilities and
chronic physical health conditions, older persons). It is also important to note that some
mental health programs are focused exclusively on specific populations (e.g., veterans,
IDPs), providing free and accessible services to those groups but not to other vulnerable
persons in the population (e.g., persons affected by economic hardship) or to people with
mental illness in general. Providing mental health services to specific populations such as
IDPs only, can increase tensions with host communities. Global guidelines recommend
that mental health services should be accessible to all.

Recommendations
  •	 Ensure considerations to reach different target groups with mental health services
     through different entry points and outreach including veterans (e.g., peer-to-peer
     support workers supervised by psychologists as a first intervention, engagement in
     social and structured activities, involvement of families), persons in rural areas and
     older persons (e.g., engaging community members such as clergy who often come
     into contact with older persons, engaging families), hard to reach family members
     who are reluctant to access treatment (e.g., through family engagement and family
     therapy), and young people (e.g., through the Internet, social media). Making efforts
     to reach different target groups is an important part of providing mental health
     services through government or CBO providers.
  •	 Do not provide mental health services free of charge to specific groups only
     (e.g., IDPs, veterans) but ensure all segments of the population can afford and access
     services. This recommendation is especially relevant for donors, INGOs, and CBOs.


3. Education and Training of Human Resources
Education and training of human resources is one of the key mechanisms to make evidence-­
based interventions for CMDs and AUD widely available and accessible. There are currently
not enough mental health professionals trained in such interventions in Ukraine to meet
the needs of the population. It has also been noted (in the 2017 Ukraine MH Concept Note)
that educational standards in mental health need to be brought in line with relevant
international standards, and that professional competencies need to be built and regulated.


                                                          Discussion and Recommendations | 109
There is a significant need to develop and implement protocols and monitor quality
of services. This includes accessible and evidence-based guidelines and protocols for
specialists and nonspecialists, covering pharmacological interventions, psychotherapeutic
methods, and other psychosocial interventions. Although some protocols already exist
and providers are now allowed to use international protocols as well, there is still a need
for training and capacity building in using these protocols.

It is also important to note that capacity building should involve all levels of different
formal and informal service providers, including specialized staff (e.g., psychologists,
psychotherapists), general health care providers (e.g., doctors nurses), social service
providers (e.g., social workers) and community level workers and supports (e.g., clergy).
Each of them has an important role to play in supporting persons with mental illness and
working as part of a well functioning and connected pyramid of mental health services.


3.1 Offer educational programs that provide needed qualifications in
evidence-based psychological interventions and psychotherapy
There are currently no public academic programs available for training professionals (e.g.,
psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers) in evidence-based interventions to treat CMDs
and AUD (e.g., CBT). Professionals wishing to obtain such qualifications generally have
to pay to attend private universities and training courses, which are also not always
evidence based. As a result, the quality of services provided by professionals such as
psychologists and psychotherapists for mental health problems varies widely, with some
approaches being not effective or even harmful. This also further undermines the trust of
the general public in mental health services and discourages people from seeking treatment.
Professionals with evidence-based skills are likely to be in private practice or private
rehabilitation centers (for AUD) rather than public health and social services, which makes
such interventions inaccessible to large parts of the population. Furthermore, key
informant service providers have emphasized the need for appropriate training, often
not knowing which training approach to choose and not being able to financially afford
existing training opportunities. Some training opportunities supported by international
organizations in most recent years have often been short term (e.g., a few days) and do
not offer the needed continued follow-up and on the job supervision to practice skills.
Other programs with international support have already started developing and adapting
evidence-based manuals and materials that can be used (e.g., WHO PM+, SH+). A
considerable number of psychologists and psychotherapists in Ukraine practice in various
settings (e.g., government, private, NGO, volunteers), but they often have a limited scope of
work (e.g., assessment and referral only) and limited skills and are therefore underutilized.




110 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
Recommendations
   •	 Provide in-service training and continued follow-up and on the job supervision
      on evidence-based approaches for CMDs and AUD (e.g., CBT, CBT-TF, motivational
      interviewing and peer support for AUD) to currently practicing professionals such as
      psychologists, psychotherapists, and social workers. This training can be offered or
      expanded as part of existing and new initiatives of capacity building supported by
      international actors and agencies.
   •	 Ensure that capacity building programs offered by INGOs are evidence based and
      provide longer-term follow-up and on the job supervision. This can be promoted by
      engaging INGOs in coordination structures (see Section 1 of the recommendations ).
   •	 Integrate evidence-based interventions into curricula at public universities
      including undergraduate and post-graduate levels. This could be supported by
      academic partnerships and professional exchange with universities in other countries.
   •	 Engage in partnerships with professionals and exchange programs with
      universities from other countries to build qualifications of Ukrainian professionals
      and build on experiences of organizations with a history of assisting countries in the
      region, such as GIP. One major university (JHU) is already discussing the integration
      of one evidence-based approach for CMDs with the National University of Kyiv-­
      Mohyla Academy.
   •	 Update current curricula and training materials in line with global guidelines
      and best practices in mental health. This also includes continued translation of
      relevant text building on efforts of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association supported
      by GIP. Such guidelines and materials can be used and integrated by the leadership
      and professors at academic institutions.
   •	 Make use of evidence-based manuals and materials covering interventions for
      CMDs and AUD which have already been developed, adapted, and translated
      with international support, and which can be used and scaled up among psychologists
      and other professionals (e.g., WHO PM+, WHO SH+, JHU CETA). This is especially
      relevant for international organizations and teams who want to build the capacity
      of Ukrainian professionals.


3.2 Provide official licensing, certification, and oversight for
practicing psychologists and psychotherapists
Currently there is no licensing or oversight of practicing psychologists and psychotherapists.
As a result, consumers are unsure which professionals to choose, and some professionals
practice without needed qualifications and training, which can be ineffective or even
harmful for persons with mental illness. Furthermore, there is no accountability or
complaints mechanism, which contributes to the lack of trust and confidence among the
public. The need for licensing of professionals was also expressed by several key stakeholders,
as well as in the 2017 MH Concept Note.



                                                             Discussion and Recommendations | 111
Recommendations
   •	 Regulate professional practice of psychologists and psychotherapists by requiring
      certification and licensing supported by professional associations and in line
      with European standards. Leadership for this would be needed by MoH to ensure
      that laws and regulations are in place, while professional associations need to be
      supported and strengthened to provide needed certification and oversight and
      promote accountability.
   •	 Support oversight and accountability through professional ethics boards and
      complaints mechanisms for mental health service users. Professional associations
      need to be supported to establish such mechanisms with the active participation
      and engagement of mental health service users.


3.3 Build the capacity for identification, management, and referral
of persons with CMDs and AUD among primary health care providers
Globally, the integration of mental health into primary health care has been recognized
and recommended as one of the key ways to make mental health services available and
accessible to large parts of the population. In Ukraine, the integration of mental health
inducing identification, basic management, and referral of CMDs and AUD has been
recommended by professionals and by officials on the policy level (including the 2017
MH Concept Note), and requires capacity building of general health professionals.128
Clinical protocols to address common mental health problems, such as PTSD and depression
at the PHC level already exist, but our assessment showed that providers often do not
feel that they have the needed skills and knowledge to apply them. Promising pilot
initiatives supported by international actors have already started to include PHC providers
in capacity building for mental health, and to link them with teams of more specialized
mental health providers for continued supervision, oversight, and referral. In addition,
mandated continued education requirements already exist which can also be used for
capacity building in mental health.

Recommendations
   •	 Continue developing and updating clinical protocols to provide interventions
      for persons presenting with CMDS, AUD (and other priority mental health conditions)
      at the PHC level, in line with international guidelines such as the WHO mhGAP-­
      Intervention Guidelines.173 Curricula and protocols should cover identification
      (e.g., questions to ask), basic management (e.g., psycho-education, basic psycho-
      social interventions, and for doctors-rational prescription of generic antidepressant
      medication and avoiding expensive medications or herbal supplements as a
      first-line treatment) and referral as well as follow-up (including communication
      with more specialized providers). Key professionals at the MoH already engaged in
      mental health protocol development can play a leadership role with support from
      international actors.


112 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
   •	 Provide in-service training and continued on-the-job supervision and mentorship
      to PHC providers (including family doctors/GPs, nurses, felshers) according to their
      specific roles. Ensure to involve specialized mental health professionals (e.g.,
      psychiatrists, narcologist) in the provision of training and supervision as well as in
      the planning for continued referral and consultation. Efforts in capacity building by
      international agencies in this regard can be continued and expanded while longer
      term scale-up needs to be planned by MoH.
   •	 Ensure that protocols and practical aspects of training are included in the academic
      training curricula for health care providers. Universities who are training doctors,
      nurses, and other health care professionals play a key role and can be supported by
      international actors.
   •	 Include mental health training and refresher training in mandated continued
      education requirements for health professionals and in other training opportunities
      (e.g., seminars, conferences) at the national ad oblast level.


3.4 Build capacity for basic psychosocial support and linking with services
among various nonspecialized informal and community providers
Mental health service users in this assessment reported reaching out to many different
mental health professionals as well as nonprofessionals and community members. They
can serve as an important first entry point, provide basic psychosocial support, and link
people to services. Furthermore, persons with CMDs and AUD often do not seek mental
health services at all, but may approach other providers with different needs (e.g., social
services). Persons with mental health problems also reported that community inclusion
and support have played a significant role in their recovery. In short and in line with
global guidelines, supporting people with mental health problems can not only be the
task of mental health professionals but needs to be taken up by different sectors (e.g.,
health, social, education), service providers and community members (e.g., clergy, NGOs).
Our assessment showed that community level providers such as clergy are already often
providing basic mental health support, while civil society and community groups and
volunteers are engaged in providing psychosocial support and at times referral. They can
also play an important role in promoting positive attitudes toward people with mental
illness in their communities and can ensure to include those affected and their families in
community activities and events.

Recommendations
   •	 Provide workshops about mental health, basic psychosocial support and referral
      to nonspecialized and community workers. Several local and international NGOs
      already have developed, adapted, and translated psychosocial materials that can
      be used (e.g., WHO Psychological First Aid Guidelines). This can be taken on by civil




                                                            Discussion and Recommendations | 113
      society organizations with relevant expertise or international support, as well as
      through regional initiatives by mental health service providers.
   •	 Strengthen connections and referral links between nonspecialized and com-
      munity providers and mental health professionals (e.g., through referral workshops
      described in Section 1 of the recommendations)


3.5 Consider strengthening the role of social workers within the
mental health system
Although this assessment did not specifically focus on the social service system, we learned
that social workers are widely available for Ukrainians living outside of major metropolitan
areas, particularly in smaller cities. Social workers are also often working in health facilities
with NGOs, and they conduct outreach. Given the high co-occurrence of mental health
and social problems (e.g., financial hardship) it is also likely that they encounter individuals
and families affected by CMDs and AUD. Building capacity of social workers in identifying
persons who need help, providing basic evidence-based psychosocial support, and
linking to other professionals as needed, would be another sustainable way to improve
accessibility of care. Kyiv-Mohyla National University, for example, is developing an
additional training module for social workers which helps them support persons experiencing
psychological distress.

Recommendations
   •	 Provide classroom-based and practical training for social workers as part of their
      university curriculum, as well as in-service training (for those already working) in the
      identification of persons with mental health problems, basic psychosocial support,
      and referral. Academic and INGO partnerships can help support and establish such
      training.
   •	 Include social workers in multidisciplinary teams as part of a comprehensive
      service model.


4. Mental Health Knowledge, Awareness,
and Self-Help

4.1 Raise awareness and provide information to the general public
about mental health promotion, mental illness, and on how to choose
qualified providers of mental health services
Different studies and this assessment suggest that most people rely on family and friends
or search for information (e.g., online) when looking for a mental health care provider.
Those affected by CMD and AUD often delay seeking help due to lack of information and
spend considerable amounts of time and money on treatment that may be ineffective,



114 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
unnecessary, or even harmful (e.g., self-medication, expensive psychotropic medication,
folk healers, unqualified providers). At the same time, most people affected may not seek
help at all due to lack of trust in the system, and stigma.

Our assessment also showed that there is a lack of awareness and knowledge about
mental disorders with many community members stigmatizing and blaming those
affected. Some key informants recovering from CMDs and AUD also described that they
felt unsupported by family and friends who did not know how to respond or excluded
them from social activities. On the other hand, family members can play an instrumental
role in encouraging people with mental illness to seek help. Social support is also an
important factor in helping people recover from mental illness, as supported by the
literature and several key informants in our assessment.

The 2017 Mental Health Concept Note also described the need to increase awareness
about mental health and overcoming stigma through the media, community discussions,
educational resources and programs, and also involving persons with mental disorders
and their families, as well as professional associations.104

Recommendations
   •	 Develop a directory of certified mental health service providers including
      government and community-based organizations, as well as rehabilitation centers
      (for alcohol and drug use) that offer evidence-based psychological treatment
      approaches for CMDs and AUD (e.g., CBT), which is accessible to the general public
      (e.g., Internet, information booklets at health and social services) at the oblast level.
      Similar directories for other types of professionals such as lawyers already exist, and
      such a registry of providers and facilities is also mentioned in the 2017 National
      Mental Health Concept Note. This directory could be developed building on the
      mapping and coordination efforts mentioned in Section 1 of the recommendations.
   •	 Provide information to the public (e.g., public nationwide awareness campaigns,
      information leaflets, Internet, media, community discussions) explaining the types
      of mental health professionals (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists)
      and services, correcting common misconceptions (e.g., about inpatient treatment,
      confidentiality) outlining different types of mental health problems, describing
      positive coping methods (e.g., relaxation, social activities, physical exercise), warning
      against negative ways of coping (e.g., smoking, alcohol and drug use), and providing
      guidance on how to choose an appropriate provider and what to avoid (e.g.,
      self-medication). Various actors can be engaged in implementing different activities
      including government, civil society, NGOs, media (e.g., radio, TV, newspaper repre-
      sentatives) and service users. Those with experiences in using mental health services
      should be actively engaged and can help with appropriate messaging.
   •	 Provide information to the community, family, and friends of those affected
      by mental disorders on how they can be supportive. This includes developing and
      providing information leaflets for friends and family members of those affected on


                                                               Discussion and Recommendations | 115
      how they can help (many examples exist from higher income countries) at several
      access points (e.g., general health facilities such as polyclinics, social and community
      services).
   •	 Involve communities, family, and friends in discussion events and information
      sessions on mental health promotion and how to be supportive to persons
      experiencing mental health problems.
   •	 Engage people recovering from mental illness and their families in sharing
      their experiences (positive and negative) with others, including how they were
      able to find help and what helped them in their recovery (e.g., community discussions,
      radio or video clips). Create programming that engages persons recovering from
      CMDs and AUD and highlights key positive messages (e.g., anyone can develop MH
      problems and this is not a character flaw, where to find more information, how
      to cope or help others cope, treatment can be effective and recovery is possible).
      Engage young people and activists who are motivated to get involved.
   •	 Train service providers as well as service users in media communication, how
      to speak to the media, and how to communicate stories and messages (e.g., via
      social media, websites).
   •	 Work with media representatives on how to responsibly and accurately report
      about persons with mental health problems (e.g., respecting confidentiality, not
      portraying them as violent and flawed) and about suicide.
   •	 Establish a national hotline to provide basic support and information about available
      services for persons experiencing CMDs, suicidal ideas, and AUD. Those staffing
      the hotline need training and supervision in basic psychosocial support and crisis
      management, as well as risk assessment, management and support of persons with
      suicidal ideas, and linking callers with appropriate services.


4.2 Support and create consumer-led mental health advocacy
groups and engage persons recovering from mental illness and family
members in higher level discussions and decision making
Our assessment found that existing advocacy organizations mainly focus on more severe
mental disorders, intellectual disability, and patient rights while there is less of a focus
on advocacy for the needs of persons with CMDs and AUD. There is also little positive
visibility of persons recovering from CMDs and AUD in the general public. Some local
efforts by individuals have started (e.g., in Zaporizhia) but need wider level engagement and
support. Persons recovering from CMDs and AUD have also been absent from national
level discussions and conferences about mental health, although they would offer a valuable
perspective as they are ‘experts by experience’. Furthermore, visibly engaging people with
mental disorders sends a strong signal that they are a valued part of the community
and persons with important skills and abilities. Research on stigma and mental health has
shown that it is often not enough to simply provide information to the population but



116 | MENTAL HEALTH IN TRANSITION
that having “positive contact” with persons recovering from mental illness is key in changing
attitudes. This means that visibly engaging people with mental illness and their family
members in discussions, sharing their experiences, using their abilities, and taking on
leadership roles does not only provide important input for decision making about mental
health services but is also instrumental in fighting stigma.

Recommendations
   •	 Support or create consumer-led mental health advocacy groups at national and
      oblast levels. Make use of the experiences of existing consumer-led organizations
      and identify and support persons recovering from mental health problems who are
      willing, able, and motivated to take on leadership roles.
   •	 Promote networks and information sharing among existing groups and newly
      created groups and initiatives.
   •	 Engage persons recovering from CMDs and AUD in sharing their experiences and
      highlighting positive contributions to their communities (e.g., as part of commu-
      nication campaigns and events mentioned in Subsection 4.2). This also includes
      engaging public and respected figures who have recovered from mental health
      problems in sharing their experiences.


4.3 Consider making information and self-help interventions for
CMDs and AUD available online (e-mental health)
It has been estimated that most people (up to 75%) suffering from CMDs and AUD in
Ukraine do not seek help for reasons such as lacking information, stigma attached to
mental illness and the mental health field, and not having trust in providers. However, the
vast majority of key informants reported seeking information online and finding self-help
websites and books helpful. Many also stated that they would prefer to seek help for
mental health problems anonymously (even if this meant travel to another oblast or
additional payment to see a private provider). As of 2013, it is estimated that 41.8% of the
population in Ukraine has access to the Internet, and use of Internet and social media
is most common among young persons.174 Although this is relatively low for countries in
the region and much less than EU countries (75.5% in 2013), this still represents a large
part of the population that can be reached, especially younger persons. Research from
higher income countries has shown that e-mental health interventions offered online can
be effective for treating depression and anxiety disorders.175 WHO is currently testing such
an intervention in a lower middle-income country (Lebanon). WHO is also developing
a printed Self-Help Plus manual (for CMDs) which is currently being piloted in different
countries including Ukraine (by IMC). Furthermore, WHO has tested an alcohol and health
web-based self-help intervention tool in four pilot countries (Belarus, Brazil, India, and
Mexico).176 Although those interventions require resources to develop, especially at the
beginning, the public health impact can be considerate given the wide reach and the
cost-effective model of self-help.



                                                               Discussion and Recommendations | 117
Recommendations
   •	 Develop and pilot e-mental health interventions for priority mental health
     conditions (e.g., depression and AUD which have an especially high public health
     and economic impact in Ukraine). International partner organizations and donors
     may be able to provide technical and financial support for such projects.
   •	 Link general (e.g., family doctors, GPs) and specialized providers with available
     e-mental health interventions, so they can offer them to patients and continue to
     follow up (some research suggests follow-up by a provider makes these interventions
     more effective).
   •	 Consider developing self-help materials using different platforms (e.g., as booklets
     or recordings using WHO Self-Help+ manual). Such materials could also be integrated
     with current or planned programs offering mental health support by civil society
     and international actors. In the longer term, these materials could also be integrated
     with the provision of government health services (e.g., by psychologists, general
     health care providers).
