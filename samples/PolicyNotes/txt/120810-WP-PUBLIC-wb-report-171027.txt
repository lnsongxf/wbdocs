Reflecting the growing momentum for carbon pricing worldwide, the 2017 edition of the State
and Trends of Carbon Pricing targets the wide audience of public and private stakeholders
engaged in carbon pricing design and implementation. This report also provides critical input for
negotiators involved in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, particularly for the meeting
of the Conference of the Parties (COP) 23 to be held in Bonn in November 2017.


As in the previous editions, the report provides an up-to-date overview of existing and emerging
carbon pricing initiatives around the world, including national and subnational initiatives.
Furthermore, it gives an overview of current corporate carbon pricing initiatives.


Another key focus of the report is on the importance of an integrated approach to climate finance
and climate markets, together with domestic policies. The analysis shows how such an integrated
approach can be used to mobilize the scale of low-carbon investments needed to achieve the
below 2°C temperature target and outlines a transition scenario and the possible role of results-
based climate financing to catalyze climate markets.


In May 2017, the World Bank launched the Carbon Pricing Dashboard website, adding an
interactive dimension to the annual State and Trends of Carbon Pricing reports. This resource
provides an up-to-date overview of carbon pricing initiatives and allows users to navigate through
the visuals and data of the report. Please visit: http://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/.


The task team responsible for this report intends to select new relevant topics to be explored
in future editions or as part of the World Bank’s expanded Carbon Pricing Intelligence program.
For example, work is currently underway on an analysis of the interaction of carbon taxes and
fiscal policy.


The report benefited greatly from the valuable contributions and perspectives of our colleagues
in the climate and carbon finance community, ensuring the quality and clarity of this report:

on carbon pricing initiatives around the world and Klaus Oppermann for Section 3 on climate
finance and climate markets, and by Richard Zechter and Céline Ramstein for the whole report.

          Note: Only the introduction or removal of an ETS or carbon tax is shown. Emissions are presented as a share of global GHG emissions in 2012. Annual changes in global, regional,
          national, and subnational GHG emissions are not shown in the graph. Due to the dynamic approach to continuously improve data quality using official government sources,
          the carbon pricing initiatives in Liechtenstein and Ukraine were added, the city-level Kyoto ETS was removed, and the start date of the Latvia carbon tax was corrected. The
          information on the Chinese national ETS represents early unofficial estimates based on the Chinese President’s announcement in September 2015. The National Treasury of
          South Africa will submit a revised carbon tax bill to Parliament later this year and the new implementation date of the carbon tax will be determined by the Minister of Finance.

    upon ratification of the Paris Agreement, unless the Party decides to revise it. As of September 1, 2017, five Parties which have ratified the Paris Agreement
    indicated that they do not want their INDC to become their NDC and still have to submit their first NDC.
12	 The other two Parties, the United States (US) and the EU, did not state the use of carbon pricing in their NDCs, despite carbon pricing initiatives already

21	 The total value of ETS markets was estimated by multiplying each ETS’ annual allowance or credit volume for 2017, or the most recent yearly volume data,
    with the price of the emission unit on April 1, 2017. The total value for carbon taxes was derived from official government budgets for 2017. Where the
    allowance or credit volume (for an ETS) or budget information (for a carbon tax) was unavailable, the value of the carbon pricing initiative was calculated by
    multiplying the GHG emissions covered with the nominal carbon price on April 1, 2017. No information was available on the amount of emission reduction
    credits which could be generated by facilities under the Washington State Clean Air Rule or offsets under the Australian safeguard mechanism. Also, the
    Chinese national ETS is yet to be implemented. Therefore, these were not included in the value calculation: The values presented in the Carbon Pricing
    Watch 2017 were not updated to August 1, 2017, because no other new carbon pricing initiatives were implemented nor have any changes occurred in the
    existing initiatives since the release of that brief in May 2017. Moreover, daily changes in prices and exchange rates over a 5-month period cannot be used
    as an indicator of the evolution of global carbon pricing initiatives.

23	 The Commission recognizes that the target carbon price may differ across countries. It considers that achieving the Paris objectives will require all
    countries to implement climate policy packages. These policy packages include complementary policies to carbon pricing to tackle other market failures
    beyond the GHG externality that take into account: knowledge spillovers (and research & development), network effects, imperfect capital markets and
    unpriced co-benefits such as reduced pollution.

   The circles represent subnational jurisdictions: subnational regions are shown in large circles and cities are shown in small circles. The circles are not representative of the size of
   the carbon pricing initiative.
   Note: RGGI = Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Carbon pricing initiatives care considered “scheduled for implementation” once they have been formally adopted through
   legislation and have an official, planned start date. Carbon pricing initiatives are considered “under consideration” if the government has announced its intention to work towards the
   implementation of a carbon pricing initiative and this has been formally confirmed by official government sources. The carbon pricing initiatives have been classified in ETSs and carbon
   taxes according to how they operate technically. ETS does not only refer to cap-and-trade systems, but also baseline-and-credit systems such as in British Columbia and baseline-and-
   offset systems such as in Australia. The authors recognize that other classifications are possible. Due to the dynamic approach to continuously improve data quality, changes to the
   map do not only reﬂect new developments, but also corrections following new information from official government sources, resulting in changes for Liechtenstein, Ukraine and Kyoto.
   Initiatives implemented or scheduled for implementation: National ETSs: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
   Italy, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain. National carbon taxes: Chile, Colombia, Japan,
   Mexico, South Africa, and Ukraine. Both national ETSs and carbon taxes: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia,
   Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Subnational ETSs: Beijing, California, Chongqing, Connecticut, Delaware, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
   Hampshire, New York, Ontario, Québec, Rhode Island, Saitama, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Tokyo, Vermont, and Washington State. Both subnational ETSs and carbon taxes: Alberta
   and British Columbia. Initiatives under consideration: National ETS or carbon tax: Brazil, Canada, Chile (ETS), China, Colombia (ETS), Japan (ETS), Mexico (ETS), Singapore, Thailand,
   Turkey, Ukraine (ETS), and Vietnam. Subnational ETS or carbon tax: Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Oregon, Prince Edward
   Island, Rio de Janeiro, São Paolo, Taiwan, China, and Virginia.

          Note: Only the introduction or removal of an ETS or carbon tax is shown. Emissions are presented as a share of global GHG emissions in 2012. Annual changes in global, regional,
          national, and subnational GHG emissions are not shown in the graph. Due to the dynamic approach to continuously improve data quality using official government sources,
          the carbon pricing initiatives in Liechtenstein and Ukraine were added, the city-level Kyoto ETS was removed, and the start date of the Latvia carbon tax was corrected. The
          information on the Chinese national ETS represents early unofficial estimates based on the Chinese President’s announcement in September 2015. The National Treasury of
          South Africa will submit a revised carbon tax bill to Parliament later this year and the new implementation date of the carbon tax will be determined by the Minister of Finance.

    initiatives that had prices below this level. For initiatives implemented in 2017, the estimated revenues under carbon prices in 2017 were used for the
    extrapolation. US$40/tCO2e is the lower range of the carbon prices for 2020 as recommended by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices to be
    consistent with achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. The estimation assumes that the proportion of free allocation and carbon tax
    exemptions remain unchanged.

    Note: Status as of September 1, 2017. 5 Parties which ratified the Paris Agreement indicated that they do not want their INDC to be their NDC, in
    accordance with Decision 1/CP.21. These Parties are still subject to the requirement of the Agreement under Articles 3 and 4 to communicate an
    NDC. Revised NDCs from these Parties are expected in the coming months. As the modalities and procedures for the NDC registry are not yet in
    place, there is currently no basis to enforce a timeline on the submission of NDCs. The EU, a Party to the UNFCCC and included as a separate Party
    in the tally above, submitted one INDC for all 28 EU Member States. Each Member State is also a Party to the UNFCCC and all Member States have
    signed the Paris Agreement, which explains how 162 INDC submissions have come from 190 Parties. Out of the EU Member States, only the Czech
    Republic has not yet ratified the Paris Agreement and is therefore not counted in the 155 Parties that have collectively submitted 128 NDCs.

      Note: The size of the circles reflects the volume of GHG emissions in each jurisdiction. Symbols show the sectors and/or fuels covered under the r      ­ espective carbon
      pricing initiatives. The largest circle (EU) is equivalent to 4.7 GtCO2e and the smallest circle (Switzerland) to 0.05 GtCO2e. The carbon pricing initiatives have been
      classified in ETSs and carbon taxes according to how they operate technically. ETS does not only refer to cap-and-trade systems, but also baseline-and-credit
      systems such as British Columbia and baseline-and-offset systems such as in Australia. Carbon pricing has evolved over the years and they do not necessarily follow
      the two categories in a strict sense. The authors recognize that other classifications are possible.
  * Also includes Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Carbon tax emissions are the emissions covered under various national carbon taxes; the scope varies per tax.
 ** ETS emissions are the emissions covered under the Tokyo CaT and Saitama ETS.

             (pilot ETS).
             Initiatives implemented in 2017: Alberta (carbon tax), Chile (carbon tax), Colombia (carbon tax), Ontario
             (ETS) and Washington State (CAR).
             New initiatives scheduled for implementation in 2018: Massachusetts (US).
             New initiatives under consideration: New Brunswick (Canada), Northwest Territories (Canada), Nova Scotia

             Initiatives under consideration with new developments: Canada, China, Manitoba (Canada), Mexico,
             Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada), Thailand, Turkey and Oregon (US).


             Scope expansion:
             2016/2017: Beijing ETS expanded to cover the transport sector, as well as some power and cement companies;
             Guangdong ETS included domestic aviation sector and paper making; Hubei ETS lowered the inclusion
             threshold for the power sector and several large industrial; Shanghai ETS expanded to cover the shipping
             sector; Norway introduced a new carbon tax rate for natural gas from petroleum activities where emissions
             are released directly into the atmosphere.
             Future developments: British Columbia is planning to include fugitive emissions and intends to include
             emissions from the burning of forestry residues.


             Price rate changes (carbon tax only):
             2016/2017: Norway carbon tax increased to NOK450/tCO2e (US$60/tCO2e) in 2017 for mineral oils, petrol,
             diesel, hydrofluorocarbon and perfluorocarbon emissions; Latvia carbon tax increased from €3.5/tCO2
             (US$4/tCO2) in 2016 to €4.5/tCO2(US$5/tCO2) in 2017.
             Future developments: British Columbia is planning to increase the rate of its carbon tax—which currently stands
             at CAN$30/tCO2e (US$24/tCO2e)—by CAN$5/tCO2e (US$4/tCO2e) per year from April 1, 2018; Iceland carbon
             tax rate, currently at about ISK1190/tCO2 (US$12/tCO2), will double at the beginning of 2018; Switzerland
             carbon tax will increase on January 1, 2018 from CHF84/tCO2e (US$87/tCO2e) to CHF96/tCO2e (US$99/tCO2e).

             Price/market stabilization mechanisms (ETS only):
             2016/2017: Fujian ETS included a market stability mechanism with the launch of its pilot ETS; Republic of Korea
             undertook several measures to deal with the market imbalance in its ETS.

             Offsets:
             2016/2017: Colombia allows emitters to achieve carbon neutrality through the use of offset credits, and from
             2018, these credits have to come from domestic projects; Fujian ETS allows entities to use offsets generated in
             Fujian to meet up to 10 percent of their compliance obligation; Shanghai, Hubei, and Guangdong made the use
             of CCER stricter; the Chinese NDRC temporarily suspended the approval of CCER projects and issuance of CCERs.
             Future developments: The Republic of Korea will authorize certain international credits for compliance from
             2018; a review of Australia’s climate change policies includes investigating the potential use of international
             credits to meet its emission reduction targets.


             Linking and/or cooperation:
             2016/2017: New Zealand and China signed a bilateral climate change action plan to cooperate on carbon
             markets; New Zealand started discussions with Korea on developing carbon markets in the Asia-Pacific
             region; China, Japan and the Republic of Korea held the first annual conference on the exchange of carbon
             pricing experiences.
             Future developments: the EU has started the legislative process to link the EU ETS with the Switzerland ETS, which
             is not expected to be completed before 2019; California adopted amendments confirming their 2018 link with
             Ontario and introducing new forms of linking.


             Initiatives under review
             2016/2017: the EU ETS review for post-2020 is reaching its conclusion; California extended its ETS to 2030,
             updated certain allocation provisions for 2018–2020 and adopted amendments to its design for post-2020;
             an agreement on the proposed changes to RGGI for the period after 2020 was reached; the NZ ETS was under
             review in 2016–2017, resulting various measures to strengthen its ETS.

      Box 3 / Use of internal carbon pricing by multilateral banks in project evaluations




             Financial institutions increasingly use internal carbon pricing as a tool to evaluate their investments by
             including the cost of carbon in economic analyses of new projects. Examples of these financial institutions
             include multilateral development banks: the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the World Bank Group.


             The EIB was the first international financial institution to systematically integrate the negative externality
             of CO2 emissions into its project appraisal, as part of its commitment to support low-carbon solutions
             through its lending portfolio. In 1997, it started valuing the avoided cost of environmental externalities,
             including CO2 emissions and local air pollutants. The costs of environmental externalities were progressively
             incorporated into the economic analyses of energy and transport projects, and these costs are now applied
             across all sectors financed by the EIB.205 The EIB currently uses a shadow price of GHG emissions and other
             externalities to assess the costs or benefits to society from a particular project. The shadow price of carbon
             is determined by a literature review on the social cost of carbon and the marginal cost of reaching climate
             targets, including a target that is in line with keeping the global temperature rise below 2°C. Project appraisal
             results are usually presented using the carbon price from the reference scenario, with low and high price
             scenarios used for sensitivity testing. In 2017, these are €37/tCO2e (US$44/tCO2e), €16/tCO2e (US$19/tCO2e),
             and €62/tCO2e (US$73/tCO2e), respectively.206 These price levels increase over time to reflect the increased
             marginal damage of GHG emissions in the future, and are regularly reviewed to stay aligned with climate
             modelling literature.


             The World Bank Group started including a carbon price in its economic analyses of new projects in the 2015
             fiscal year to better understand and measure its carbon footprint. It bases its assessment on an estimate of
             the social cost of carbon, beginning at US$30/tCO2e in 2015 and increasing to US$80/tCO2e by 2050. Internal
             carbon pricing forms part of the World Bank Group’s strategy to promote sustainability and manage risks
             and volatility in a globally interconnected world.207

     (such as gas) and a lower carbon price on a more emission intensive fuel (such as coal), there may be an incentive to switch towards the more emission
     intensive energy source.

213	 Simply financing infrastructure under business-as-usual will present a significant challenge for many developing countries; our analysis, however, focuses
     on the additional effort required to provide low-carbon infrastructure investment.
214	 This discussion focuses on concessional finance provided by public institutions in developed countries. Concessional climate finance may also be provided
     by public institutions from developing countries, philanthropies and, sometimes, the private sector. In other contexts, private sector investment on
     commercial terms in both developed and developing countries is also termed as climate finance. This analysis proceeds with the narrower definition
     outlined above without prejudice to any discussions of this term within the context of the international negotiations. This chapter aligns with concurrent
     work within the World Bank Group on a “Concessional Finance Strategy for Climate Change”. This will produce a framework to target concessionality and
     maximize its impact, which is expected to be available to the public in early 2018.

215	 This chapter focuses on climate markets (and climate finance) for mitigation. While climate finance clearly targets adaptation as well, there are currently
     no examples of markets for transferrable adaptation outcomes. More research, which goes beyond the scope of this chapter, would be needed to explore
     the potential for market solutions in this area. However, all mitigation outcomes should be resilient to climate change and disaster risks, or else these
     risks reduce an action’s mitigation value (for example, hydropower and afforestation projects may fail without accounting for future changes in rainfall
     patterns). As such, adaptation outcomes can be considered as integral to mitigation outcomes.

      Box 5 / The maturing of technology markets enables a shift to market-based finance




             The development of domestic climate policies on renewable energy shows how the relationship between
             concessional finance and market-based mechanisms can evolve.


             Initially, many countries supported renewable energy through direct public investment, including support
             for research and development (R&D). For instance, the early development of Germany’s wind power industry
             relied heavily on government R&D support—between 1977 and 1989, about 40 R&D projects were granted
             to businesses and research institutes to develop or test wind turbines. This was followed by a period of
             market development and concentration supported by feed-in tariffs through the 1991 Electricity Feed-In
             Act and the 2000 Renewable Energy Sources Act, combined with concessional finance where the degree of
             concessionality decreased over time.234


             In the last decade, as technology costs declined, there has been a shift toward more market-based
             approaches in many countries.235 This has occurred in two ways:
             −− Greater use of markets for incentivizing renewable energy capacity expansions. In particular, competitive
                 auctions have been used to incentivize renewable energy capacity expansions, taking into account
                 declining technology costs. For instance, in April 2017, an auction for offshore wind farms in Germany
                 settled with the required premium above the competitive wholesale market prices for electricity of just
                 €4.4 (US$5.2) per megawatt hour.236
             −− In many countries where the need for additional financial support for renewable energy remains, this
                 support has been provided through domestic climate markets in the form of tradable green certificates.
                 This provides financial support for the underlying climate output/outcomes—renewable energy—and
                 creates an independent market for these outputs, separate from the market for electricity. For instance,
                 renewable energy obligations backed by green certificates are in operation in Australia, Mexico, Norway,
                 and the Republic of Korea.237


             Moving forward, in many parts of the world, the transition to fully market-based mechanisms to deliver
             renewable energy is likely to arrive quickly. For example, an auction for electricity capacity in Chile in August
             2016 saw renewables outcompete fossil fuels, with renewable energy developers winning more than half of
             the contracts.238

235	 There are a range of mechanisms to support renewables that differ in the degree of market discipline imposed on investors. For instance, both feed-in
     tariffs and auctions can support the deployment of renewable generation, but feed-in tariffs remove the price risk borne by investor and imply very little
     competition between generators. By contrast, the use of auctions creates a market to determine the necessary level of subsidy for renewable energy
     deployment, imposing more market discipline. Both mechanisms can be contrasted with, for example, an ETS which does not subsidise investment in
     particular forms of abatement, but rather penalises emissions and therefore encourages competition across all abatement options that are relevant to
     covered emissions.

             An RBCF program could be designed to reduce GHG emissions by installing household solar power systems.
             RBCF recipients could pursue a range of projects including awareness-raising, installation and other related
             services. Once these projects have been implemented, a certain number of systems will have been installed

      Box 7 / RBCF to support the development of regional climate markets




             The flexibility of RBCF means that it can adapt to local circumstances and play a powerful role in developing
             regional climate markets. Given this flexibility, there are a wide range of options available to support the
             transition away from coal and the development of climate markets.


             Domestic resources might be used to develop an RBCF mechanism as part of an integrated policy approach
             to support the deployment of renewable electricity generation, thereby reducing demand for coal (other
             things being equal). RBCF could be used to pay for the delivery of power from renewable sources to the grid,
             thereby providing a flow of revenue to cover the cost of financing and future investments. As the market
             matures and expands, the need for concessional finance and RBCF will decline. These mechanisms may be
             replaced by climate markets, which could take the form of carbon markets or tradable renewable energy
             certificates that are tied to portfolio standards for renewable electricity generation. Applying the elements of
             an integrated approach might see direct concessional finance supporting investments in electricity networks,
             which is needed to support distributed renewable generation.


             At the same time, international resources might be used to develop an RBCF mechanism focused on policy
             crediting—the crediting of the emission reductions resulting from the implementation of a policy action
             or components of it—as a stepping stone to regional carbon markets.260 For instance, RBCF might provide
             financial incentives to support energy market reform as a first step to building the capacity of firms to operate
             in climate markets. The movement from regulated energy prices to energy prices determined by market
             forces would enable the incentives from climate markets to flow through the economy, helping to identify
             low-cost mitigation options and improving overall efficiency. This could simplify the transition to domestic
             carbon markets by developing firm capacity and an ecosystem of firms supporting them. Simultaneously, RBCF
             could alert policymakers to the idea that policy action that supports emission reductions could be driven by
             international incentives and be subjected to independent verification of the resulting emission reductions.
             This could facilitate trade in mitigation outcomes delivered by domestic policy action. In this case, RBCF could
             be provided alongside technical assistance to support the development of market infrastructure such as
             registries and formalized accounting, which are needed to track the trade and use of mitigation outcomes.


             One modality for delivering RBCF could be TCAF. TCAF aims to help developing countries cut emissions
             by creating new classes of carbon assets associated with emission reductions, including those achieved
             through policy actions. Over time, these assets could be credited as mitigation outcomes with potential to
             be transferred internationally.




      Beyond RBCF, climate finance delivered through risk                              open new sources of commercial climate finance
      reduction and risk-sharing instruments may be used                               by supporting the introduction of new products
      where barriers to finance stifle investments. These                              and increasing the capacity of local financiers. For

      While climate finance has a role to play, over time,                            the energy transition. The recent expansion of

                Annex II
                Analysis of NDCs




                Table 5 shows the main unconditional and conditional targets in the NDC of each Party, whether
                the NDC states that the Party is planning or considering the use of carbon pricing, and whether
                carbon pricing will be a domestic or international initiative. Only NDCs that have been uploaded
                to the UNFCCC interim NDC Registry265 are listed below. For the purpose of this report, carbon
                pricing includes ETSs, carbon taxes and other market mechanisms. The targets are based on the
                UNFCCC interim NDC Registry and the World Bank Group NDC Platform.266 The authors recognize
                that the text in NDCs can be interpreted in different ways and other assessments of the targets
                and the mention of carbon pricing/market mechanisms are possible, because this information is
                not always presented in a clear and consistent manner in NDCs. The mention of carbon pricing in
                a domestic context may not necessarily mean that a domestic carbon pricing initiative is formally
                under consideration. Also, not all Parties that already have a carbon pricing initiative implemented,
                scheduled or under consideration have reported this in their NDC. The number of Parties planning
                or considering the use of carbon pricing in their NDC is therefore not comparable with the
                jurisdictions with carbon pricing initiatives implemented, scheduled or under consideration.

              Table 6 shows a summary of the UNFCCC Parties’ views where there is a general consensus or
              divergence on the operationalization of Articles 6.2 and 6.4 of the Paris Agreement. The summary
              is based on the authors’ interpretation of the SBSTA 46 submissions by the Parties and the authors
              recognize that different interpretations are possible. Note that consensus on a topic does not
              necessarily mean that all Parties have agreed, as Parties can change their views throughout the
              negotiations of the guidelines to operationalize Articles 6.2 and 6.4. The topics are listed in order
              of frequency of mention, with the topics listed first mentioned in most of the submissions and the
              bottom ones in about three quarter of the submissions.

Concepts

This section explains three key concepts regarding the flows of finance required to support the
transition to low-carbon economies, and the costs of climate impacts:


−− Incremental investment required: the additional capital expenditure required in the
   transition to a low-carbon economy compared to the investment needed in a higher-carbon,
   business-as-usual scenario. For example, this measure balances the additional upfront costs
   of building new renewable generation assets in a low-carbon economy, against the reduction
   in investment associated with fossil fuel exploration and production. Most of these estimates
   focus on the energy sector.


−− Gross investment required: the total capital expenditure that needs to be mobilized within
   key sectors in the transition to a low carbon economy. This includes investments in mitigation
   activities, technologies and assets, for example, the upfront cost of building new renewable
   generation assets. Most of these estimates also focus on the energy sector.


−− The economic costs of climate change impacts: a measure of the impacts of climate
   change on global welfare over time. In practice, this is assessed as the expected change in
   the value of traded goods and services resulting from climate change, and may also include
   some consideration of society’s valuation of non-traded goods and services (such as direct
   impacts on the environment and human health) and how these are affected by climate change.
   This is typically expressed as the discounted value of future climate costs, or sometimes as a
   percentage of income or consumption in the year in which these costs arise.


Incremental investment required

A key measure of the resource mobilization challenge is the incremental investments required.
This measure reveals the additional investments that need to be mobilized in the transition to
a low-carbon economy, after reallocating capital that would otherwise be used for high-carbon
investments, such as much fossil fuel extraction, which will no longer be required in a low-carbon
world. It provides an indication of the scale of additional finance needed for investments only, it
does not consider the societal benefits and costs of different investment mixes.

           The IEA estimates that the incremental investment needs consistent with a 2°C trajectory in the
           energy sector reaches about US$670 billion per year between 2016 and 2050.268 This is heavily
           focused on demand-side technologies, with analysis suggesting that the annual incremental
           investment needs would ramp up steadily over the period. This is in line with the World Economic
           Forum’s estimate that annual incremental investment needs of about US$710 billion would be
           required over the period 2010–2030, of which half is estimated to be spent in the building and
           industrial sectors.269 Other estimates of incremental investments provide similar findings, for
           instance, McCollum et al. find that incremental investments of about US$590 billion per year is
           required over 2010–2050.270 Drawing on these studies suggests incremental investment needs
           of US$700 billion per year. As these studies concern different timeframes and utilize different
           assumptions, this represents an indicative estimate only.


           In addition to the studies above, the Global Commission on the Economy and Environment report
           finds that moving from a business-as-usual scenario to a 2°C pathway would require increasing
           incremental investments across all infrastructure by about US$300 billion per year from 2015 to
           2030. However, this also includes differences in adaptation costs between the 2°C pathway and
           the business-as-usual pathway, which are not captured in the other estimates above.271


           Gross investment required

           While significant, the incremental investments associated with the transition to a low-carbon
           energy system are modest compared to the total magnitude of energy sector investments. Gross
           investment reveals the total investment needed in key sectors in the transition to a low-carbon
           economy. The estimates below focus on the energy sector, broadly defined to include energy
           extraction, electricity generation, buildings, industry, and transport.


           Gross investment of US$2.4–3.8 trillion per year by 2030 is likely to be required to finance the
           energy transition needed to limit global warming to less than 2°C, with a mean across different
           estimates of US$3.3 trillion.272 The IEA estimates that US$123 trillion in investments is needed
           between 2016 and 2050, of which more than half (US$65 trillion) will be used to reduce energy
           demand, with the remainder (US$57 trillion) used to change sources of energy supply.273 McCollum
           et al. (2013) disaggregate the required investments by region, and using the midpoint of their
           reported range suggest that about two-thirds of this investment is required in the developing
           world.274 China is due to be the largest destination for investment, requiring about US$480 billion

      These significant gross investment needs outstrip current low-carbon investments. As of 2014,
      about US$361 billion was invested globally in mitigation activities across private and public
      sources—in comparison to the required US$2.4–3.8 trillion.275 However, some important gaps
      remain in the tracking of low-carbon mitigation investments, especially regarding investments in
      energy efficiency.


      With incremental investments required on the order of US$700 billion by 2030, and gross
      investment required of US$3.3 trillion, much of the US$2.6 trillion planned annual investment
      would have to be reallocated from planned high-carbon investments to low-carbon alternatives
      to achieve the 2°C temperature target.


      The economic cost of climate change impacts

      Mobilizing these significant flows of funds is motivated by the large costs associated with
      unmitigated climate change. One of the most well-known estimates of the economic costs of
      climate change is presented in The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change.276 This states
      that the impact of unmitigated climate change, resulting in a temperature rise of 7.4°C, could be
      equivalent to a 5.3–11.3 percent reduction in GDP per capita by 2200. Costs from climate change
      are lower for lower temperature increases; a review of 18 studies suggests damages equivalent
      to 0–4.8 percent of GDP for temperature increases in the range of 2.5–3°C over different
      timeframes.277


      The complexity of the impacts of climate change means that the models typically used to estimate
      the costs of climate change are substantially simplified. Recent studies indicate that taking into
      account a wider array of potential costs, such as the potential impact of climate change on
      economic growth, and deploying more sophisticated techniques to address uncertainty, generate
      much higher costs.278 An alternative approach to estimating costs, using statistical methods to
      estimate the costs associated with temperature changes in the past, suggests that compared with
      a world without climate change, a high-emission scenario could lead to global GDP being reduced
      by 23 percent by 2100.279


      These global outcomes mask regional variations, with developing countries facing disproportionate
      costs from climate impacts. One study using worldwide data for 1950–2003 found that a 1°C
      increase in temperature in a given year was associated with a reduction of annual economic growth
      for lower-income countries of 1.3 percentage points; however, temperature shocks of this size had
      no discernible effect on growth in higher-income countries.280

             Additionality     A project activity is additional if anthropogenic GHG emissions are lower than those
                               that would have occurred in the absence of the project activity.


          Annex I (Parties)    The industrialized countries listed in Annex I to the UNFCCC committed to return
                               their GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. They currently include Australia, Austria,
                               Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia,

                               well as the European Union.


            Article 6 of the   Article 6 recognizes that Parties can voluntarily cooperate in the implementation of
          Paris Agreement      their NDCs to allow for higher ambition in mitigation and adaptation actions.


      Article 6.2-6.3 of the   Articles 6.2–6.3 cover cooperative approaches where Parties could opt to meet their
         Paris Agreement       NDCs by using ITMOs. ITMOs aim to provide a basis for facilitating international
                               recognition of cross-border applications of subnational, national, regional and
                               international carbon pricing initiatives.


          Article 6.4 of the   Articles 6.4 establishes a mechanism for countries to contribute to GHG emissions
          Paris Agreement      mitigation and sustainable development. This mechanism is under the authority and
                               guidance of the CMA. It is open to all countries and the emission reductions can be
                               used to meet the NDC of either the host country or another country.


     Banking or Carry-over     The carry-over of compliance units under the various schemes to manage GHG
                               emissions from one commitment or compliance period to the next. Banking may
                               encourage early action by mandated entities depending on their current situation
                               and their anticipations of future carbon constraints. In addition, banking brings
                               market continuity.

                Baseline    A system where baseline emissions levels are defined for individual installations and
                            credits are issued to installations that have reduced their emissions below this level;
                            these credits can be sold to other installations exceeding their baseline emission levels.


    Baseline-and-credit     A system where baseline emissions levels are defined for individual installations and
                            credits are issued to installations that have reduced their emissions below this level;
                            these credits can be sold to other installations exceeding their baseline emission levels.


    Baseline-and-offset     A system where targets or baseline emission levels are defined for individual emitters
                            or groups of emitters and emitters that exceed their baseline emissions can purchase
                            oﬀsets to meet their compliance obligations. In contrast to a baseline-and-credit
                            system, emitters do not automatically receive credits for the emissions they have
                            reduced below their baseline level.


         Benchmarking       Benchmarking is used to compare operations of a company with those of others, to
                            industry average, or to best practice, to determine whether they have opportunities
                            to improve energy efficiency or reduce GHG emissions. In the EU ETS, for example,
                            free allocation is carried out on the basis of ambitious benchmarks of GHG emissions
                            performance. These benchmarks reward best practice in low-emission production.


          Cap-and-trade     Cap-and-trade schemes set a desired maximum ceiling for emissions (or cap) and
                            let the market determine the price for keeping emissions within that cap. To comply
                            with their emission targets at least cost, regulated entities can either opt for internal
                            abatement measures or acquire allowances or emission reductions in the carbon
                            market, depending on the relative costs of these options.


        Carbon capture      The class of technologies and processes that capture carbon dioxide and stores it over
       and storage (CCS)    the long-term, to isolate it from the atmosphere and negate its impacts on the climate.


         Carbon Dioxide     The universal unit of measurement used to indicate the global warming potential of
       Equivalent (CO2e)    each of the six GHG regulated under the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon dioxide—a naturally
                            occurring gas that is a by-product of burning fossil fuels and biomass, land-use
                            changes, and other industrial processes—is the reference gas against which the other
                            GHG are measured, using their global warming potential.


        Carbon Leakage      Shift in CO2 emissions due to GHG mitigation policies from countries taking stringent
                            actions to countries taking less stringent mitigation actions.

Carbon Pricing Initiative   An initiative that explicitly puts a price on a unit of CO2e, including ETSs—both cap-and-
                            trade and baseline-and-credit systems, carbon taxes, offset mechanisms and RBCF.


Carbon Pricing Revenue      The revenue governments raise from carbon pricing initiatives, through the auctioning
                            of allowances and taxation. The carbon pricing revenues are determined from auction
                            revenue reports of the different ETSs and the annual budget of governments with
                            carbon taxes in place.

       Carbon Pricing Value    The value of emission units in an ETS and emissions that are subject to a carbon
                               tax. The total carbon pricing value of ETS markets is estimated by multiplying each
                               ETS’s annual allowance volume for the most recent year with the allowance price.
                               The total value for carbon taxes is derived from official government budgets. Where
                               the emission unit volume (for an ETS) or budget information (for a carbon tax) was
                               unavailable, the value of the carbon pricing initiative was calculated by multiplying the
                               GHG emissions covered with the nominal carbon price.


                Carbon Tax     A tax that explicitly states a price on carbon or that uses a metric directly based on
                               carbon (that is, price per tCO2e).


         Certified Emission    A unit of GHG emission reductions issued pursuant to the Clean Development
           Reduction (CER)     Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol and measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide
                               equivalent. One CER represents a reduction in GHG emissions of one metric ton of
                               carbon dioxide equivalent.


          Chinese Certified    Voluntary emission reduction credits from projects based in China. The NDRC issued

                    (CCER)     tCO2e, and include CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6.


        Clean Development      The mechanism provided by Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, designed to assist
         Mechanism (CDM)       developing countries in achieving sustainable development by allowing entities from
                               Annex I Parties to participate in low-carbon projects and obtain CERs in return.


     Clean Power Plan (CPP)    A set of standards set out by the US Environmental Protection Agency aimed at

           Climate finance     Public and private sources of finance with varying degrees of concessionality (measured
                               by grant element or subsidy) which is contributed to investments intended to advance
                               low-carbon, climate-resilient development.


           Climate markets     Markets established by policies that generate tradable units representing quantified
                               climate outputs or outcomes, often for the purpose of meeting compliance obligations
                               established in a jurisdiction.


      Compatibility (policy)   Refers to ensuring that policies and mechanisms that target similar outcomes measure
                               these outcomes in a consistent way.


            Concessionality    Refers to the discount compared to normal market rates provided by sources of
                               climate finance. Higher levels of concessionality provide a greater benefit to the
                               borrower compared to a loan at market rate.

          Implied (implicit)   A measure of the value of subsidies or the additional costs imposed by policies
              carbon price     indirectly putting a price on carbon, expressed per ton of CO2e.


Incremental investment         The additional capital expenditure required to invest in mitigation activities,
                               technologies and assets, compared with business-as-usual investments.


       Intended Nationally     The COP, by its decisions 1/CP.19 and 1/CP.20, invited all Parties to communicate to
              Determined       the UNFCCC secretariat their INDCs in advance of COP 21 as part of the groundwork
       Contribution (INDC)     for the adoption of the Paris Agreement. An INDC set the climate actions (mitigation
                               and/or adaptation) that a country intended to take under the international agreement
                               under the UNFCCC that was to be agreed in Paris in December 2015. For Parties
                               ratifying the Agreement that have already submitted an INDC, their INDC will be
                               considered their first NDC, unless the Party decides to revise it.


     Intergovernmental         The intergovernmental body established by the World Meteorological Organization
Panel on Climate Change        and the United Nations Environment Program to prepare, based on available scientific
                  (IPCC)       information, assessments on all aspects of climate change and its impacts, with a view
                               of formulating realistic response strategies.


      Internal carbon price    A price on GHG emissions that an organization uses internally to guide its decision-
                               making process.


            Internationally    Parties to the Paris Agreement can use ITMOs, established by Article 6.2 of the Paris
     Transferred Mitigation    Agreement, to achieve NDCs. ITMOs aim to provide a basis for facilitating international
         Outcomes (ITMOs)      recognition of cross-border applications of subnational, national, regional and
                               international carbon pricing initiatives. However, the precise nature of ITMOs has
                               not yet been defined. ITMOs might cover outcomes from various existing and future
                               approaches.


Joint Implementation (JI)      Mechanism provided by Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol whereby entities from Annex I
                               Parties may participate in low-carbon projects hosted in Annex I countries and obtain
                               Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) in return.


               Kyoto GHGs      The Kyoto Protocol regulates six GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
                               nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur
                               hexafluoride (SF6).


        Kyoto Mechanisms       The three flexibility mechanisms that may be used by Annex I Parties to the Kyoto
                               Protocol to fulfil their commitments. These are the Joint Implementation (JI, Article 6),
                               Clean Development Mechanism (CDM, Article 12), and International Emissions Trading
                               (Article 17).


            Kyoto Protocol     Adopted at the third Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC held in Kyoto, Japan,
                               in December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol commits industrialized country signatories to
                               collectively reduce their GHG emissions by at least 5.2% below 1990 levels on average
                               over 2008–2012 while developing countries can take no-regret actions and participate
                               voluntarily in emission reductions and removal activities through the CDM. The Kyoto
                               Protocol entered into force in February 2005.

 Macroeconomic costs     A measure of the impact that action to address climate change has on consumer
  of mitigation action   welfare. Generally calculated using macroeconomic models to estimate the reduction
                         in consumption that would result from the implementation of a global carbon price to
                         meet a particular emissions constraint.


            Marginal     The additional costs incurred in reducing a defined increment of emission reduction
      abatement cost     from a particular source.

and verification (MRV)   report and verify the accuracy of results, usually relating to emissions of GHGs.


Nationally Determined    The contribution that a Party intends to achieve under the Paris Agreement, covering
   Contribution (NDC)    mitigation and adaptation. Each Party shall communicate an NDC every five years. For
                         Parties ratifying the Agreement that have already submitted an INDC, their INDC will
                         be considered their first NDC, unless the Party decides to revise it. NDCs are governed
                         by Article 4 of the Agreement. Each Party to the UNFCCC that wishes to become a
                         Party to the Agreement will have an obligation to communicate an NDC. The level of
                         prescription attached to these will be determined by the negotiations on the operative
                         elements of Article 4, which mainly take place under the Ad Hoc Working Group on the
                         Paris Agreement (APA).


               Offset    An offset designates the emission reductions from project-based activities that can be
                         used to meet compliance or corporate citizenship objectives vis-à-vis GHG mitigation.


     Paris Agreement     The Paris Agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the
                         UNFCCC held in Paris, France, in December 2015. The Paris Agreement brings all
                         nations together for the first time to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate
                         change and adapt to its effects. Its central aim is to “strengthen the global response
                         to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well
                         below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the
                         temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement
                         aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.
                         The Paris Agreement requires all Parties to put forward their best efforts through NDCs
                         and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. This includes requirements that all
                         Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts.”


    REDD Plus (REDD+)    All activities that reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and
                         contribute to conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of
                         forest carbon stocks.


          Registration   The formal acceptance by the CDM Executive Board of a validated project as a CDM
                         project activity.


Results-Based Climate    Funding approach where payments are made after pre-defined outputs or outcomes
       Finance (RBCF)    related to managing climate change, such as emission reductions, are delivered and
                         verified.

   Second Commitment       The eight-year period, from 2013 to 2020, in which Annex I Parties to the Kyoto
 Period under the Kyoto    Protocol committed to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18% percent below 1990
          Protocol (CP2)   levels. The composition of Parties in the second commitment period is different from
                           that in the first.


      Secondary Market     A market where the seller of the asset is not the original owner (or issuer).


        United Nations     The international legal framework adopted in June 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit to
 Framework Convention      address climate change. It commits the Parties to the UNFCCC to stabilize human-
     on Climate Change     induced GHG emissions at levels that would prevent dangerous manmade interference
              (UNFCCC)     with the climate system, following “common but differentiated responsibilities” based
                           on “respective capabilities”.


             Validation    The process of independent evaluation of a project activity by a Designated
                           Operational Entity against the requirements of the CDM. The CDM requirements
                           include the CDM modalities and procedures, subsequent decisions by the CMP and
                           documents released by the CDM Executive Board.


            Verification   Verification is the review and ex-post determination by an independent third party of
                           the monitored results, typically referring to reductions in emissions generated by a
                           registered CDM project or a determined JI project (or a project approved under another
                           standard) during the verification period in this report.


      Voluntary Carbon     The voluntary carbon market caters to the needs of those entities that voluntarily
                Market     decide to reduce their carbon footprint using offsets.
