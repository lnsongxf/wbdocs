About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      Agency : Private Building Inspection Agency

      The company must select an independent building inspector and sign a
      service contract with this inspector. The inspector must check and approve
      all the project’s plans before they are submitted to the municipality. The list
      of project plans is extensive and includes the architectural design of the
      building done by design consultants; the reinforced concrete and insulation
      project plans prepared by a civil engineer; the re safety project plans
      prepared jointly by an architect and the mechanical engineer for utilities; the
      project plans and documents for hot water, and those of central heating
      facilities prepared by a mechanical engineer; the electrical wiring project
      plans prepared by an electrical engineer; the telecommunications system
      project plans prepared by an electrical engineer; and the landscape project
      plans prepared by a landscape engineer.

      Selecting an independent building consultant takes only a day. However,
      practitioners agree that it takes at least 3 days for the building inspector to
      review and approve all the documents before they are submitted to the
      municipality. Hence, for the case considered here, it is assumed that 4 days
      are needed to complete this procedure.


      The building inspector charges a fee representing a percentage of the total
      cost of construction, according to the amendment of Article 5 of the Law on
      Building Inspection No. 4708 of August 17, 2011. This fee is paid in six
      installments.


      The inspector receives the following payments at the following stages:
      • 20% when the building permit is obtained
      • 40% when the foundation is completed
      • 20% when the shell & core structure is initiated
      • 15% when the installation is initiated

       to the Turkish Electricity Distribution Corporation (TEDAS), for the electricity
       project plans; and to the telephone company, for the telecommunication
       project plans. Fire-electricity and re-mechanical project plans must be
       approved by the Fire Department.


       The cost estimated for this procedure ranges from TRY 3,000.00 to TRY
       3,500.00. The fees found on one district municipality’s Web site show the cost
       breakdown to include fees for examination, approval, and various other

       whether land is on main arterial road or not)

       The customer needs to obtain an excavation permit from Istanbul
       Municipality in order to carry out the works. The permit can be applied for
       after the electricity project has been approved. The customer needs to
       submit the approved electricity project, the occupancy permit, and state
       their address (no o cial document is needed).

       Following the wiring and completion of implementation, the client is required
       to submit a post-implementation electricity project called “Electricity
       Structural Project.”

       This is followed by CLK Boğaziçi Elektrik Perakende Satış A.Ş. inspection of the
       internal wiring. Connection is made by the utility following its checking of the
       wiring (no inspection of entire internal wiring is done during the process, just
       of the interface).

       The compatibility of the metering devices and the circuits of the client are
       tested, and the relevant parts of the meters and measurement circuits are
       sealed and rst index read on the meter. Connection to the system is then
       recorded by the distribution licensee.

      Although not mandated by law, non-encumbrance checks are essential
      procedures. Without them, buyers do not proceed with the transfer process.
      The buyer almost always checks whether or not the property is free of liens
      and encumbrances. For this, the seller would need to obtain the document
      showing that the property is free of disputes.
      By law, title deeds are open to anyone who legitimizes their interest.
      However, in practice the records are not accessible to the public: the buyer
      can obtain this document only with a power attorney of the seller. Therefore,
      this document is typically obtained by the seller who is often accompanied
      by the buyer. For transactions that are undertaken by lawyers, this
      procedure is conducted by lawyers (who have the power of attorney from
      the seller and have a legal right to search titles).
      The seller or the interested party takes an appointment on the general IT
      (TAKBIS) system to be present at the Land Registry o ce at the given time.
      The information at the Land Registry is computerized; so the search takes
      minutes. Conducting a non-encumbrance check is free of charge for the real
      person owner or for those who hold a right on the relevant property (or
      their representatives). The check can be conducted online via e-government
      passwords. However, e-government passwords are granted to individuals
      only and this procedure cannot be conducted online by the representatives
      of a company. Thus, representatives are required to visit the Land Registry
      O ce for a non-encumbrance check.
      If the buyer or seller wish to obtain a copy of the records displaying the
      status of the property, a fee applies (TL 8.20 per page + a xed fee of TL 18.25
      that only applies if it is not the owner of the property who is requesting a
      copy of the records). If the application is made in a land registry o ce other
      than the land registry o ce which the property is registered at, then the
      applicant is required to pay an additional xed fee of TL 36.50.

  2   Managers obtain an authorization certi cate of their authority to                   1 day               TL 38.5
      conduct transactions on companies’ behalf
      Agency : Company Registrar

      If the sale transaction will be made in person by the company signatories,
      the managers should obtain a separate document from the trade registry,
      showing that they have the authority to conduct transactions before the
      land registry o ce on their companies’ behalf. According to the General
      Communiqué of Act of Fees No. 78, the cost for obtaining an authorization
      certi cate for company managers is TL 38.50. However, the registration and
      announcement of the authorization of a company's manager in the Trade
      Registry Gazette costs TL 367.50.
      If the sale transaction will be conduct by a proxy issued by the company
      signatories, the representatives should be provided with special proxies,
      which will be drawn by the notary and bear the photograph and the
      statement of the authorized manager. The notary would require the
      manager to provide it with the above mentioned authorization document
      which should be obtained from the trade registry and the signature circular
      of the company setting out the authorized signatories of the company and
      the way in which they are authorized to represent the company.
      The notary will charge a fee of approximately TL 200 for issuing the power of
      attorney. The validity period of this authorization certi cate is one year as of                                         Page 33

   3   Obtain an earthquake insurance policy, or amend the existing one                      1 day   no cost (unless a

                                                                                                     needed)
       In practice, it is usually required to obtain an earthquake insurance policy (if
       it has not been already issued for the building) when selling the building or
       asking for a loan on it. Even though commercial properties are excluded
       from the scope of the compulsory earthquake insurance policy, it is
       generally recommended to obtain one before transferring the property. The
       cost of this insurance policy depends on the features such as the area of the
       building and the place thereof, and the insurance brokers automatically
       calculate it. If there is an existing "compulsory earthquake insurance policy"
       which is still valid at the date of the sale (i.e. if the term of the insurance
       policy has not yet expired), then there is no need to issue another one just
       as a result of the change of ownership. However, the new owner of the
       property shall have the insurance policy amended to indicate his own name
       under the policy, which will be arranged between the insurance company
       and the new owner.
       While it is possible to conduct online insurance transactions with insurance
       companies this is not an established practice in Istanbul. In practice, it is still
       common to obtain or amend this insurance policy physically at the o ces of
       the insurance company.

   4   Obtain the real estate value statement from the Municipality                          1 day   no cost
       Agency : Municipality

       The parties need to obtain a document showing the current value of the
       property from the local municipality. This value statement is used by the
       land registry o cer to determine the mortar dues.
       The parties could obtain this document either from o ces of the relevant
       municipality or online. The online service can be accessed through
       www.turkiye.gov.tr, this service is free of charge. However, obtaining this
       document online is still not a common practice in Istanbul. Therefore, the
       seller obtains the value statement in person from the municipality where the
       real estate is situated.

   5   Parties apply for registration and obtain tax payment assessment                 1 day   no cost

       It is possible for parties to make an online appointment from the general IT
       system of the Land Registry in order to pick a date/time when to submit an
       application to the registration. The seller and the purchaser (or their
       representatives) meet at the registry o ce and ll in an application form.
       Once the required documents are presented, the parties declare the

       According to the Circular No. 2014/8 dated 17 October 2014 issued by the
       General Directorate of the Land Registry and Cadaster Department of Land
       Registry, it is possible to conduct title deed transactions for properties

       completed by the Land Registry o cers.

       deposited is a bank designated by the Land title registry. In other words, the
       parties should deposit the concerned amounts to the bank account of Land
       Registry at a bank determined by the Registry itself.
       Mortar dues as well as the circulating capital fee can be paid online. In the
       text message received from the IT system, there are some links to pay online
       with the use of the application number given by the Land Registry o ce for
       the transaction. However, the most common method of payment is still
       going physically to the bank o ce to pay.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                      Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest       registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population       secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                    In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the

Cost required to enforce a contract through the               - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                           and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

                                                              - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                       - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                      - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          liquidation          The most common and practical way for the hotel to proceed was the postponement of
                    (after an            bankruptcy procedure. Article 377 of Turkish Commercial Code and Article 179 of the Turkish
                    attempt at           Enforcement and Bankruptcy Code regulate this procedure. The debtor must propose a
                    reorganization)      rehabilitation plan. The court may decide to grant up to one year for the debtor to attempt
                                         rehabilitation based on the proposed plan. This period can be extended up to 4 years in
                                         total. Upon the decision on postponement of bankruptcy, no legal proceeding (including the
                                         proceedings for the collection of the public receivables) can be initiated against the debtor
                                         and the pending proceedings will be deferred. If the court agrees to postpone the
                                         bankruptcy, it will also appoint an administrator in the same decision. The maximum
                                         postponement period is one year (it can be extended up to 4 years) during which time the
                                         administrator will supervise the business. In most cases, similar to the case study, the
                                         debtor does not achieve the projections of the rehabilitation plan and the court will
                                         commence liquidation proceedings. However, the postponement of bankruptcy procedures
                                         are temporarily suspended by the Statutory Decrees until the end of state of emergency.

Outcome             piecemeal sale       If the debtor fails to achieve its goals shown in the rehabilitation report, then the court will
                                         rule for opening its bankruptcy. Therefore in that case it would not be possible for the
                                         debtor to continue operating as a going concern.

Time (in years)     5.0                  After several months of procedural matters and hearings, the court will grant a one-year
                                         postponement of bankruptcy period to Mirage. This period can be extended up to 5 years
                                         depending on the achievement of the rehabilitation plan. In the case of Mirage, the
                                         postponement period will last 3 years in total. After the third year, Mirage can request an
                                         extension of the postponement period (another year), however, the court will likely deny this
                                         this request, because Mirage is not likely to comply with the financial projections of the
                                         proposed rehabilitation plan. The court will declare Mirage bankrupt and notify the
                                         bankruptcy office. Bankruptcy administrators will be appointed and will carry out the
                                         liquidation procedure. Bankruptcy administrators will examine the inventory and financials

                                         and facilitate the sale of the hotel's assets. The bankruptcy procedure will last 18 months.
                                         Given the recent restructuring of its commercial courts, pending cases are experiencing
                                         significant delays while case files are being reassigned to new courts. It is however expected
                                         that this reform will speed up proceedings in the longer term.

Cost (% of          14.5                 The largest part of the expenses is government levies (4.55% for bankruptcy) and other case-
estate)                                  related costs (court fees, publication costs, stamp duty, etc.). Attorney fees comprise about
                                         5% of the total expenses, as per the fee schedule for Monetary Claims and related
                                         proceedings before Execution and Bankruptcy Offices. Fees of administrators, auctioneers,
                                         accountants and other professionals involved in the insolvency proceedings make up the
                                         rest of the expenses.
