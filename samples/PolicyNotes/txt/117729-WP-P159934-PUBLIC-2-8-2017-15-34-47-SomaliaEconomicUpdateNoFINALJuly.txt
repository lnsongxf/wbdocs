It is my pleasure to present the second edition of the Somalia Economic Update. These reports are prepared
 in close partnership with Somali stakeholders and aim to contribute to government policy-making and to
a national conversation on the economy. We are particularly grateful to our colleagues at the Ministry of
Finance who have contributed and provided guidance throughout the process.

This report coincides with the worst drought Somalia has faced since 2011 which has plunged over half the
population into extreme need. The drought reflects Somalia’s continued exposure to the impacts of climate-
related shocks, including rising levels of displacement-led urbanization.

Resilience to future shocks – which are likely to increase in the coming years – requires considerable and
longer-term investments in rural and urban livelihoods, services and infrastructure. More broadly, macro-
economic stability, predictable and effective policies and functioning institutions will also be critical enablers
for public and private investments.

In that context, I am therefore pleased that this second edition of the Somalia Economic Update is
focused on domestic revenue mobilization, analyzing historical and current trends and advancing concrete
recommendations for government and its partners to consider. We hope all stakeholders find it a useful
contribution and we look forward to engaging more fully in this critical endeavour.

  Agriculture and livestock impact data heavily relied on expert judgment and data from FAO FSNAU database (2011-2017), UNFPA 2014 population

Source: Drought has triggered significant price increase on agricultural products in many regions.
Note:
•	 Decline in prices (green bars) reflect the effects of relief food which makes prices to decrease.
•	 Food deficit regions have higher price levels and lower price changes while regions where agricultural activities take place, grains tend to have
   lower price levels but higher price changes.
•	 The price of livestock has plummeted and as a result milk prices have gone.

Special Focus: Mobilizing Domestic Revenue in Somalia



  This special focus assesses the prospects for domestic revenue mobilization in the face of the many
  challenges Somalia faces. It identifies the priority needs for improving revenue mobilization and provides
  a timetable for actions and reforms. It assesses current tax laws and policies and identifies opportunities
  for broadening the tax base by introducing new taxes and fees and improving tax administration.

  The first section provides the environment in which revenue is being mobilized. The second section outlines
  the historical context of tax mobilization. The third section presents the legal framework for tax collection.
  The fourth section describes revenue performance since 2012. The fifth section reviews the constraints
  on revenue mobilization (the narrow base, inadequate tax policy, and weak tax administration). The
  sixth section outlines the reforms that could be implemented in the short medium and long term. The
  seventh section presents the results of an assessment of domestic revenue performance. It uses scenario
  analysis to show how Somalia could move toward fiscal sustainability in the short, medium, and long
  run. The final section examines challenges facing reform.

     Box 3.2: Turning revenues around: Lessons from Afghanistan

  After growing rapidly after 2001 and peaking at 11.6 percent of GDP in 2011/12, total budgetary revenue in
  Afghanistan fell to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2013 and 8.7 percent in 2014. These developments precipitated a fiscal
  crisis toward the end of 2014, with a large estimated year-end budgetary shortfall, accumulation of arrears, and
  “emergency” requests for aid. Sharply lower GDP growth also constrained revenue potential.

  Revenue mobilization efforts weakened as well, reflecting the lack of high-level government focus on and
  prioritization of revenue collection. The long, drawn-out election process may have led to revenue leakages to fund
  political activities. The short time horizons for government officials may also have played a significant role: Thinking
  they might be replaced after the election, some officials may have tried to increase their incomes through corrupt
  activities. Mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement in the Ministry of Finance may have been weakened.

  The recovery of revenue from the 2014 nadir gained momentum during 2015. For the year as a whole, revenue
  reached Af 121.8 billion, an increase of close to 22 percent. As a share of GDP, revenue recovered to 10.3 percent in
  2015. The increase was the result of the tax measures introduced in 2015, which had a positive impact on revenue
  (23.5 percent of the total increase in revenue). These measures included doubling the business receipts tax, from 2
  percent to 4 percent; increasing levies on imported fuel and gas; imposing a 10 percent tax on mobile phone top-
  ups; and increasing the overflight fee for commercial airliners. Some of these measures were unpopular; political
  will and outreach on the part of the government were required to get Parliament to pass them.

  Afghanistan’s impressive revenue turnaround predominantly reflected better collection efforts as well as new tax
  measures rather than revenue inflation attributable to currency depreciation or other macroeconomic trends. It was
  engineered by the Ministry of Finance, a relatively well-established agency with low staff turnover and considerable
  capacity. In this largely stable institutional context, the most salient factors behind the substantial progress achieved
  in 2015 included the following:
  •	 Strong leadership, focused attention, and follow-up from the top level of government and in the Ministry of Finance
     itself were key. Provincial governors and other subnational officials were ordered to support revenue collection,
     and the minister of finance personally followed revenue developments closely.
  •	 The unprecedented firing of 40 corrupt or inefficient senior staff, including 10 customs and revenue directors and
     30 managers, sent a powerful signal to improve tax collection efforts and discouraged corrupt behavior among
     other staff.
  •	 Tight monitoring of revenue collection by Ministry of Finance leadership created pressure to improve performance.
  •	 The end of uncertainty over the election and the formation of the national unity government, however protracted
     and imperfect, put an end to some major sources of distraction and politicization.
  •	 Adroit political outreach to the legislature and other stakeholders enabled Parliament to enact significant new
     revenue measures, albeit with some delay; consistent engagement with Parliament also helped minimize political
     blowback from the large-scale firing of senior Ministry of Finance staff.
  •	 Building on a sound base, the Ministry of Finance’s technical systems and processes continued to be reformed
     and improved, and its human capital remained relatively strong among Afghan ministries.

  This experience demonstrates that targeted progress can be achieved, even in a challenging political and security
  environment. Focused leadership and prioritization make a major difference when complemented by solid
  implementation capacity and processes. The pursuit of institutional strengthening and capacity development in the
  Ministry of Finance for well over a decade paid off when combined with the other elements required to address
  revenue issues. Political management and outreach clearly are important as well. They are possible even in a
  fractured political context.

                                •	Increase the customs surcharge to at least 10 percent.
 Export taxes                   •	Impose an export tax as a temporary measure. As capacity is being built to
                                  introduce a broader income tax on exporters, consider imposing a 5 percent
                                  export tax on livestock, which constitute 80 percent of exports and production;
                                  hides and skins; frozen meat; fish; and fruit and vegetables.
 Sales tax on domestic          •	Consider levying a 5 percent tax on the sales of goods and services identified in
 production of goods              the Appropriation Act to include among others these categories: Petroleum and
 and services                     Its Products, Hotels, Mineral Water, Textiles and Clothing, Electronic Materials, and
                                  Household Materials.
                                •	Withhold the bulk of the sales tax at customs.
 Excise taxes                   •	Introduce excise tax on petroleum products, khat, tobacco, and motor vehicles.
                                  Items that have harmful effects on health or the environment (khat, cigarettes,
                                  gasoline, diesel fuel, motor vehicles) could be taxed at higher rates (10–50
                                  percent). Rates should be low enough that they do not induce smuggling or
                                  bribing of customs officials to undervalue the goods.
 Income tax                     •	Widen the tax base to include wages and business income. Increase coverage of
                                  direct taxes to cover wages and business income for all employees (public and
                                  private) and business income to lay the foundation for a transition to greater
                                  reliance on these sources in later years. A flat withholding tax on wages is
                                  relatively easy to administer in a formal workforce dominated by civil servants,
                                  international organizations, and telecommunication workers.
                                •	Create a special unit for large taxpayers, in order to concentrate on the small
                                  number of taxpayers likely to have the largest tax bills. Allocate resources where
                                  the risks to revenue are greatest by tailoring intervention and services to the
                                  challenges posed by different groups, starting with a large taxpayer office.
 Telecommunications             •	Impose a 5–10 percent tax on the value of airtime sold by cellphone companies,
 taxes                            and impose charges on landlines and revenue received by telephone companies
                                  for handling incoming international calls. Currently, no taxes are currently
                                  collected from the telecommunications sector, although companies voluntarily
                                  pay a negotiated lump sum of about US$4.8 million (as presumptive tax) a year
                                  to the Treasury.
 Tax on remittances             •	Levy a tax of 0.5–1.0 percent on the value of remittances made through money
                                  exchange companies. For amounts above US$1,000, the rate could be cut in
                                  half. Annual turnover of money transfer companies is estimated at more than
                                  US$2 billion. A presumptive tax of US$13 million a year is thus recommended.
 Airport fees and visas         •	Increase the airport usage fee to US$40 a passenger on all passengers, including
                                  diplomats and UN staff. Such a levy could contribute about US$10 million year.
                                •	Consider doubling visa fees to US$100.

                          Mobilizing Domestic Revenue
                               to Rebuild Somalia
The recent drought has led to large-scale food insecurity in Somalia. Following four consecutive seasons
of poor rainfall and low river water levels in large swaths of the country, a severe food crisis hit Somalia
in 2017. The drought has led to near total crop failures and reduced rural employment opportunities,
widespread shortage of water and pasture, and consequent increases in livestock deaths, which have
in turn stretched the country’s coping mechanisms to the brink. Food access diminished rapidly among
poor households as staple food prices rose sharply and livestock prices dropped signiﬁcantly as people
engaged in forced sales to cope with the eﬀects of the drought. The drought conditions left millions of
Somalis facing severe food and water shortages. The new Somali leadership highlighted the drought
situation as a top priority with about 6.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.

As the drought begins to subside and the agriculture sector begins to recover, the FGS focus will be on
implementing policies to ensure stability as well as address weaknesses in the provision of
infrastructure, security, and the regulatory and institutional environment. First, macroeconomic
policies that continue to stabilize the economy are necessary (but not suﬃcient) to support recovery
and economic diversiﬁcation. Second, beyond stability, signiﬁcant investments will be needed to close
the country’s huge capital and infrastructure gap, improve resilience, and improve the business
environment over the medium term. Finally, reforms in public ﬁnancial management (including
strengthened domestic revenue mobilization), and strengthened governance are needed to raise more
resources for development and ensure that the increased resources are utilized eﬃciently.

Sustainable and reliable domestic revenue is critical if Somalia is to implement its development agenda
including state-building, sustained rapid economic growth, and poverty reduction. To support
sustainable expenditures, drive development, and reduce reliance on external sources, the FGS will
need to ﬁnd ways to increase domestic revenue in a way that doesn’t disincentivize the private
sector—a sector that has been an engine of Somalia’s development in the past two and half decades.
Enhanced domestic revenue mobilization–in particular a scenario where domestic revenue could
increase more rapidly than administrative expenditures oﬀers Somalia a promising and sustainable
source of home-grown development ﬁnance.
