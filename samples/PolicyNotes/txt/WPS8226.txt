1 Introduction
There are many beneﬁts associated with investments in transport infrastructure which can
stimulate growth through trade, structural transformation, agglomeration and productivity
(see Redding and Turner, 2015, and Berg el al., 2017 for surveys). The impacts can be large:
Calderón, Moral-Benito and Servén (2009) estimate that a 10 percent improvement in the stock
of infrastructure (including transport infrastructure) increases per capita gdp by 0.7 to 1 per-
cent. In Latin America, in particular, the potential to stimulate growth through transport
investments could be especially signiﬁcant given the large infrastructure gap in most Latin
American countries (see Fay and Morrison, 2007; Gonzalez, Guasch and Serebrisky, 2007).
Perrotti and Sánchez (2011) estimate that ’closing the infrastructure gap’ in Latin American
countries would require investments in the amount of up to 6.2 percent of annual GDP for
the period 2012- 2020. In theory, beneﬁts could then materialize in the form of a reduction in
transportation costs (or travel time), more intense competition, and deeper economic integra-
tion. Locations where access to markets is improved would become more attractive for ﬁrms,
potentially triggering a process of concentration and specialization of local economic activity
whereby innovation, the sharing of input markets, and improved matching on the labor market
would increase productivity, and in turn lead to local economic development and an increase
in living standards.
    In this paper, we focus on the ﬁrst steps in this potential chain of events, in the case of Mex-
ico, a country which experienced relatively large investments in roads over the past decades
and from which lessons could be derived for the rest of the continent. In Mexico, road trans-
port accounts for 57% of freight transport and remains a vital component of the economy.
The Mexican road network links the country from north to south and between its two oceanic
coastlines; and some of the most important road connections link the capital city with border
crossings to the US. We investigate the extent to which these road improvements increased
access to markets and, in turn, affected the location of economic activities.
    Our paper contributes to a growing literature that looks at the effect of transport infrastruc-
ture on local economic development outcomes (Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2015; Duranton and
Turner, 2012; Michaels, 2008; Baum-Snow, 2007; Baum-Snow et al., 2017; Jedwab and Storey-
gard, 2016; Alder, 2016; Alder, Robert and Tewari, 2017; Straub and Bird, 2015, Ghani et al.,
2015; Faber, 2014; Rothenberg, 2015, Fyre, 2015; Galasso and Oettl, 2017). In view of this lit-
erature, our paper looks at the effects of roads on the geographical concentration of economic
activities and the specialization of localities.
    There are two challenges to estimate the causal impact of roads on local economic out-
comes: the non-random placement of roads, and the recursion problem inherent in regression
of economic outcomes on market access measures. To address these two problems, we adopt
three separate identiﬁcation strategies. First, we use the so-called ’doughnut’ strategy, which


                                                 1
allow to instrument access to markets excluding zones that are more likely to be prone to an
endogeneity bias due to non-random road placement. Second, in order to avoid the recursion
problem, we substitute market access indicators with measures of access to infrastructure that
do not involve population or income. These measures include the number of roads intersecting
a circle of a given radius around the centroid of each locality, or the number of kilometers of
roads within a given distance to that centroid. Third, we use these access to infrastructure
variables as instruments for market access indicators.
    Our paper makes three principal contributions. First, we construct a new panel of geo-
referenced roads data in Mexico over three decades (for the period 1986-2014). Second, we also
take advantage of the panel nature of our data to estimate time-varying measures of market
access for more than 2,000 localities (whereas previous studies, either just used a few dates or
had a sample with a limited number of observations). Third, to the best of our knowledge, our
paper is the ﬁrst to study the effect of market access on specialization.
    Our key ﬁndings are that transportation improvements over the last three decades increased
access to markets in Mexico—which we measure in concurrent ways—and that these improve-
ments in accessibility had a positive impact on local employment and economic specialization.
The effects are large and heterogeneous across sectors. A 10 percent increase in market access
results in a 1.6 to 2.1 percent increase in employment and a large increase in locality specializa-
tion. The effect of our market potential measure is slightly larger. A 10 percent increase results
in a 2.9 to 6.5 percent increase in employment, and a 13.0 percent increase in output special-
ization. We also ﬁnd heterogeneous effects across sectors with employment in commerce and
services beneﬁting more than manufacturing from road improvements.
    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the Mexican context.
Section 3 describes the data used, explains the construction of our market access and market
potential measures, and provides information on the trends in industrial concentration and
specialization in Mexico. Section 4 presents our empirical methodology and discusses iden-
tiﬁcation strategies. Section 5 discusses our empirical results regarding the effects of market
access and market potential on employment and specialization, and Section 6 concludes.


2 The Mexican context: Lessons from the literature
2.1   The concentration of industries and specialization of localities
Economic activity in Mexico is highly concentrated in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area,
which in 2010, contributed to a quarter of the national Gross Value Added even though it cov-
ers less than 0.3 percent of the national territory. In the wake of Michael Porter’s work (Porter,
1998), there has been increasing policy interest in Mexico to facilitate the industrial concen-
tration and specialization of localities and the development of industries, so as to ultimately

                                                2
achieve higher economic growth. However, economic studies that shed light on these issues
are scarce and only a few case studies focus on industrial concentration and specialization.
    A ﬁrst set of such studies measures the level of concentration of various industries and its
increase over time (Unger, 2003) and tries to identify the determinants of industrial clustering,
concluding that, in Mexico, labor force skill play a very important role to attract clusters, much
more than wage differentials (Unger and Chico, 2004). Complementing these observations,
several authors identify the locations that have become more specialized over time, focusing
on different spatial scales. Pérez and Palacio (2009) ﬁnd that specialization increased during the
1994-2004 period. Focusing on Mexican cities, Kim and Zangerling (2016) ﬁnd that, between
1990 and 2010, specialization only increased in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, but did not
in other cities which remained very much diversiﬁed.
    A second set of case studies points at the potential beneﬁts of clustering in Mexico. Monge
(2012) suggests that clustering of the tequila industry in the state of Jalisco (in Western Mexico)
reduced transaction costs and that entrepreneurs in that sector beneﬁted from labor special-
ization. Dávila (2008), who studied the economic performance and the commercial integration
with Texas of industrial clusters in northeastern Mexico1 during the 1993-2003 period, suggests
that economic clusters played a role to foster productive innovations and stimulate bilateral
trade.


2.2        Road investments: A historical perspective
In Mexico, large investments in roads started during the Spanish Colony (1521-1810), but these
roads were mainly focused on connecting natural resources (especially silver and gold) with
the port of Veracruz, to ship them to Spain.
   During the presidency of Porﬁrio Días (between 1884 and 1911), while railways ﬂourished
throughout Mexico, the road network, which essentially dated back to the colonial period,
received little ﬁnancial support from the government and consequently deteriorated (Bess,
2016b). The Mexican Revolution, between 1910 and 1920, did not improve the situation. In
1918, municipal surveyors in Mexico City evaluated that the conﬂict had damaged around
4,000 km of roads serving the federal capital (Bess, 2016b). In the 1920s and 1930s, during the
presidency of Alvaro Obregon and Plutarco Elias Calles, national and state political leaders
engaged in the reconstruction and enlargement of the road network, mobilizing, to this aim,
the private sector, public school teachers and rural communities all over the country (Bess,
2016a). Thousands of kilometers of highways were constructed.
   The 1940s and 1950s were characterized by a great hope in the promises of industrialization
and a generalized drive toward economic modernization. Road construction was perceived as
necessary to allow market growth and improve the accessibility of regions (Bess, 2014). This

                                                      3
conception led to the building of hundreds of kilometers of new roads in Mexico by state
road-building agencies, mobilizing large public spending and private domestic investments as
well as foreign ones. The U.S. invested millions of dollars of direct investments in Mexican
transportation industry and infrastructure.
    During President Miguel Aleman’s term (1946-1952), the ﬁrst freeway (from Mexico City to
Acapulco) was opened and became a model for the construction of future freeways. During
this period, road building played a key role in the modernization of the Mexican economy and
the development of major commercial industries (Bess, 2014).
    In the 1960s, roads were built to respond to the needs of private ﬁrms and also to serve the
national and state governments’ objective to build strategic relationships with rural commu-
nities. Under President Adolfo Lopez Mateos (in ofﬁce between 1958 and 1964), an unprece-
dented amount of 300 million pesos was raised in bonds for the building of new highways
(Bess, 2017). In addition, a government owned company was founded to build more than a
thousand kilometers of toll roads in the center of Mexico.
    The presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-1994) constituted a signiﬁcant milestone
in the history of road construction in Mexico with the launch of a very ambitious program, the
Programa Nacional de Solidaridad, which led to the construction of 5,800 kilometers of privately
ﬁnanced highways at a cost of $15 billion (Foote, 1997). At the same time, cutting its own
spending on road infrastructure, the government privatized toll road operations, a lucrative
business for road-building ﬁrms. This allowed Mexico to build, in just six years, ’what had
taken two decades to achieve in western European countries’ (Foote, 1997). However, the
extremely high tolls ended up deterring trucks from using these new roads. In response, the
federal government announced, in January 1997, the mobilization of $3.3 billion over 30 years
to restructure the highway network. This outlay was added to a $ 1.7 billion toll-road rescue
plan to help the state-owned Mexican banks that had ﬁnanced road building on non-market
terms (Foote 1997).
    After 2000, the opposition party, the Partido de Acción Nacional, eventually gained power.
Road building policies were nevertheless pursued in continuity with past policies, which con-
sidered the construction of roads as a symbol of modernization. President Vicente Fox (in of-
ﬁce between 2000 and 2006) mobilized hundreds of millions of pesos for road building through
a program for basic infrastructure, and his successor, President Felipe Calderón (in ofﬁce be-
tween 2006 and 2012), constructed and renovated more than 23,000 km of roads as part of a pro-
gram to address rural poverty. Eventually, in April 29, 2014, the federal government launched
the National Infrastructure Program2 2014-2018 (nip), projecting a substantial increase in in-
vestment compared to the last twenty years (Pérez-Cervantes and Sandoval-Hernández, 2015).
The most ambitious part of this new program focuses on the south of the country, while no
large project is planned in the north and while the center of Mexico, more populated and richer,

receives smaller projects.


2.3   Roads and economic activities
To our knowledge, the impact of roads on the location of economic activities in Mexico has not
been studied yet. A set of studies, however, have investigated the link between infrastructure
and productivity. For instance, Becerril-Torres et al. (2010) study the effect of total infrastruc-
ture (measured with an index that includes roads, ports, airports, and telecommunications)
on the convergence across states in technical efﬁciency. They ﬁnd that their infrastructure
index was associated with greater regional productivity, but mainly during the Import Sub-
stitution Industrialization (isi) period (1970-1985), before Mexico entered the North American
Free Trade Agreement (nafta) in 1994. Similarly, Brock and German-Soto (2013) ﬁnd that
lower levels of infrastructure investments had a lower effect on regional productivity during
the nafta period, and conclude that continued investment in transportation will be necessary
to boost industrial sector growth. Focusing speciﬁcally on the effect of road infrastructure
on productivity growth in the manufacturing sector in Mexico, Duran-Fernandez and Santos
(2014a and 2014b) conclude that road infrastructure had positive effects on productivity and
on the average product of labor.


3 Data and descriptives statistics
3.1   Firms and employment
We use panel data for employment and ﬁrm locations from two different sources published by
the Mexican National Institute of Statistics (inegi).3 The ﬁrst source is the Economic Census for
the years 1986, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014, which provides employment ﬁgures and
breakdown by broad sector of activity, as well as total income at the level of municipalities and
for formal businesses. The second source of data is the Directory of Economic Units (denue)4
for the years 2004, 2009 and 2014. It is an exhaustive dataset which contains detailed micro-
geographic information on all formal establishments, including the 6-digit naics classiﬁcation,
the number of employees of the establishment, turnover, the municipality identiﬁer, and exact
geographic coordinates. For the year 2014, the database contains information on approximately
3,000,000 establishments throughout the country. Note that although the denue database has
ﬁner geographic identiﬁers than the Economic Census (actual coordinates vs. municipality of
location) and a ﬁner industry identiﬁer (6-digit naisc vs. broad sectors of activity), it covers
less years than the Economic Census. In the analysis, we use either one, as appropriate.

   Table 1 presents changes in the distribution of formal jobs in Mexico between 1999 and 2014
according to Economic Censuses. As can be seen, the bulk of jobs are in services, commerce and
manufacturing. Although employment has increased in all sectors over the period, the greatest
increases have occurred for commerce and services jobs, which relative shares have gone up
while the relative shares of all the other sectors have gone down. The decrease in the relative
share of manufacturing employment from 30 t0 24 percent is particularly noticeable. In 2014,
more people were actually employed in the commerce sector than in manufacturing, showing
that Mexico is following a trend of tertiarization similar to that of developed economies in
previous decades.

    Figure 1 plots the location of establishments in the denue database in 2004 and 2014 for
all ﬁrms (top panel) and for manufacturing ﬁrms (bottom panel) respectively.5 It reveals a
high concentration of economic activity in the center of the country and in the surroundings
of Mexico City, with a greater concentration of manufacturing ﬁrms than for the other sectors,
but no visually noticeable change over the past decade.


3.2       Roads
In this paper, we focus on the later waves of road construction and improvement that oc-
curred since the mid-eighties. To have a consistent measure of road extent and road types
over time, we constructed a geo-referenced database for the period 1985-2016. This was done
by importing historical road type and road extent information from the American Automobile
Association (aaa) paper maps into the 2014 road geometry published by DeLorme. Because
the DeLorme road geometry is network-enabled and topologically correct, it allows for clean
travel time computations needed to measure access to markets (see below). Using this ﬁxed
geometry, we then imported information on road type and extent for the reference years or
   5 OnFigure 1, establishment locations are overlayed on roads. See the following subsection for details regarding
the roads data construction.

Censuses (1986, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2014), leaving us with a road panel for the years
1985, 1993, 1999, 2004, 2008 and 2016.6 We grouped the aaa road classes into four categories,
which we label ‘Multilane divided’, ‘Two lanes or Divided’, ‘Pavement’, and ‘Gravel and Earth
Road’.
   Figure 2 represents the evolution of the road network for the years 1985, 1999, 2008, and
2016. As can be seen, major road improvements took place in the middle of the studied period,
between 1999 and 2008. This is conﬁrmed by table 13 in Appendix A, which provides road
length by road category for all six years during the 1985-2016 period.7
      6 We   use the roads information for 2016 as the aaa map for recent years before or in 2015 were not available to
us.
      7 Observe   that ofﬁcial statistics provided by inegi for Mexico provide signiﬁcantly greater total road lengths

geometry derived from DeLorme (2014) and updated by the authors using road category information

3.3    Geographic unit of analysis
Because our focus is on accessibility and the location of economic activities, the natural geo-
graphic unit of analysis is the urban or metropolitan area. However, because the data we use
is produced at at a ﬁner geographic scale—the municipality level—it is necessary to merge
some municipalities into metropolitan areas. As inegi provides data for 2,377 municipalities8
and identiﬁes 316 metropolitan areas—either as isolated municipalities or as groups of two
municipalities—we are able to reconstruct a sample of 2,094 localities along a mixed classiﬁ-
cation that consists of the 316 metropolitan areas identiﬁed by inegi and the remaining 1,778
isolated municipalities that are not classiﬁed by inegi as metropolitan areas.9 In what follows,
we use the term locality to refer to either an isolated municipality or a metropolitan area in our

than what can be inferred from the aaa maps. This is because inegi data accounts for all types of roads, including
minor segments, whereas the aaa maps focus on the main roads, which are likely to be more relevant for trading.
    8 Since the 1989 census, new municipalities have been created by splitting some of the old municipalities. In

order to work with a deﬁnition of localities that is stable across time, we merged these new municipalities back
to their 1988 boundaries using the list provided by inegi (2006).
    9 We consider here the 1990 deﬁnition of metropolitan areas.

municipalities and metropolitan areas are also run on the sample of 2,377 municipalities.


3.4       Measures of accessibility
Market access

    Each locality is characterized by its accessibility to markets and we resort to several acces-
sibility measures. The ﬁrst measure of accessibility for a locality i, which we refer to as market
access (ma), is given by the following formula:

                                            M Ai,t =   ∑ Pj ,tτij
                                                               −θ
                                                                  ,t                                       (1)
                                                       j =i

    where Pj ,t is the population of locality j at time t (which proxies for the size of the local
market in j ), τij ,t is the time required to travel between locality i and j given the state of the
road network at time t, and θ is a measure of trade elasticity.
    From formula (1), it is easy to see that the market access indicator is the discounted sum
of the populations of all the localities j that surround locality i, where the discount factor is
inversely related to travel time. Travel times τij ,t are calculated on the reconstructed country-
wide road network assuming that speed is a function of road type.10 As for the trade elasticity
parameter, in the absence of a speciﬁc study for Mexico, we use the same value suggested
by Donaldson (2016) in the case of India (θ = 3.8).11 Market access, which reﬂects the size of
domestic markets accessible from location i, is frequently used in the literature in the absence
of information on local incomes.

   Market potential

   The second measure of accessibility for a locality i, which we refer to as market potential
(mp), is given by the following formula:

                                                              Yj , t
                                            M Pi,t =   ∑ T C σ −1                                          (2)
                                                       j =i     ij ,t

  10 We   use the following speed assumptions: Multilane divided: 90 km/h; Two lanes or Divided: 80 km/h;
Pavement: 70km/h; Gravel or Earth Road: 40 km/h; and unknown category (i.e., not shown on aaa paper maps
but present in the 2014 DeLorme geometry): 5 km/h. These speed assumptions are consistent with the travel
times published by inegi for their own road geometry.
   11 In the regressions presented in the next section, we also perform robustness checks by using alternative

values of the market access indicator constructed with other values for θ, the maximum value encountered in the
literature being θ = 8.2 (see Pérez Cervantes and Sandoval Hernández, 2015)



                                                       9
    where Yj ,t is locality j ’s total income (in real terms)12 at time t, T Cij ,t is a transport cost
function between localities i and j , and σ is an elasticity term. Since the market poten-
tial formula has already been calibrated for Mexico, we use the same iceberg transport cost
speciﬁcation as the one estimated by Pérez Cervantes and Sandoval Hernández (2015), with
T C ij ,t = e(.0557+.0024τij ,t ) for j = i and σ = 9. Similarly to formula (1), formula (2) measures the
potential demand for goods traded from location i but in terms of income.
    Observe that in both formulas (1) and (2), we exclude ’own locality’ to reduce endogeneity
concerns.13
    Table 2 below details the mean of the market access and market potential indicators at the
locality level over the study period. As one can see, there were large increases in both market
access and market potential over the studied period.

             median market access and market potential values are calculated over the
             sample of localities in Mexico.

   On Figure 3, we represent market access and market potential at the locality level (over-
layed on the road network) in 1986 and 2016. For comparison purposes, on both maps, the
four categories correspond to the 1986 municipality quartiles of market access or market po-
tential respectively. Although both maps show improvements along our two indicators, the
contrast is starker with the market potential measure. This is understandably due to larger
increases in real per capita income than in population.

  12 We use the real gross production provided by the economic census at the municipality level to proxy for local
income.
  13 Also note that to increase accuracy of our measures, for metropolitan areas, we calculate market access and

market potential by ﬁrst calculating municipality level formulas (1) and (2) excluding all localities j that belong
to the same metropolitan area as municipality i. We then compute a metropolitan area weighted average of these
municipality indexes using municipality area as the weight.

   Counts of road intersections and efﬁcient road length

    In addition to market access and market potential measures, we also construct local in-
dicators of road availability that do not depend on population or income but only on the
characteristics of the roads network. We do this in two ways as in Baum-Snow et al. (2017).
The ﬁrst measure is the number of roads intersecting a circle of a given radius centered on a
locality’s centroid. Another measure is the weighted length of roads within a circle—where
the length of each road type is weighted by the corresponding speed—but excluding the roads
in the locality itself.14 Table 12 in Appendix A shows the mean and median average efﬁcient
  14 The   reason for this exclusion parallels the ’own locality’ exclusion in the market access and market potential

kilometers of roads within a circle of 200 km radius across localities for the 1986-2014 period. It
can be seen that accessibility according to this variable has increased on average by 19.1 percent.

   Access to external markets

    Finally, to account for access to external markets, we also construct the minimum travel time
and minimum travel cost (using the Pérez Cervantes and Sandoval Hernández, 2015 formula)
to one among six major Mexican ports (documented by inegi) and to one among forty-four
entry ports to the u.s. (documented by the u.s Department of Transportation, see us dot, 2014).
Table 12 in Appendix A provides the mean and median minimum travel time and minimum
travel cost to these ports and u.s. border entry ports. Over the 1986-2014 period, access to
international markets slighlty improved on average as we measure a decrease in the average
minimum travel time (by 8 percent) and in the average minimum travel cost (by 3 percent) to
a u.s. border entry port. The same is true for the average minimum travel time and travel cost
to a major port (which respectively decreased by 6.1 and 1 percent).


3.5     Trends in industrial concentration and specialization
3.5.1   Trends in industrial concentration: 2004 – 2014

We examine how industrial concentration evolved between 2004 and 2014. Although several
measures are available in the literature, we resort to the Ellison and Glaeser concentration
index (see Ellison and Glaeser, 1997), henceforth denoted eg. Using locality-level plant data
and both the 4-digit and 6-digit naics industrial classiﬁcations, we calculate eg indexes for all
industries and for manufacturing only, for the years 2004, 2009, and 2014 (see Appendix B for
the formula and details).
    Table 3 reports our results, which leads to the three following comments. First, industries
have become more geographically concentrated over the 2004-2014 period. This can be seen
in the observed increase in the mean value of the eg index from 0.381 in 2004 to 0.430 in 2014
(a 10.3 percent increase). Second, manufacturing industries are on average more concentrated
than overall industries in Mexico. The mean value of the manufacturing eg index is on average
12 to 15 percent higher than the mean value of the eg index calculated for all industries taken
together. Third, applying commonly agreed upon thresholds in the literature, about 98-100
percent of industries (for overall industries and for manufacturing) can be said to be concen-
trated. The fraction of concentrated manufacturing industries (98 percent) is greater than the
one reported for Canada (75 percent) in Behrens and Bougna (2015) and is roughly similar
to the one reported for the u.s. (97 percent), France (95 percent), and the u.k. (94 percent)
formulas and is made to reduce endogeneity issues (see the econometrics section below).

in Ellison and Glaeser (1997), Maurel and Sédillot (1999), and Duranton and Overman (2005)
respectively. Fourth, the average level of concentration increases as one moves from the 4 to
the 6-digit industry classiﬁcation (concentration is relatively more intense among more speciﬁc
industry segments). This result is consistent with Rosenthal and Strange (2003) for the u.s. case
and with Behrens and Bougna (2015) in the case of Canada.

   Figure 4 plots the distributions of the eg indices for the 6-digit industries in 2004, 2009,
and 2014, for all industries (left panel) and for manufacturing only (right panel). As can be
seen, these distributions are skewed towards 0.05, which shows that many industries are highly
agglomerated, whereas only few of them are weakly agglomerated (the eg index is positive but
smaller than 0.05).

3.5.2   Trends in specialization : 2004 – 2014

We now examine how specialization evolved between 2004 and 2014. For each localilty and for
the years 2009 and 2014, we calculate the Krugman specialization index (henceforth denoted

formula and details). As standard in the literature, we consider as highly specialized localities
for which the specialization index is greater than 0.75 and as not specialized, localities for
which the specialization index is below 0.35. Our results, shown in Table 4, can be summarized
as follows. First, localities are more specialized in terms of output than in terms of employment.
The average output specialization index is on average 10 to 12 percent higher than the average
employment specialization index. Second, there is an increasing trend toward specialization
over the period, both in terms of output and employment specialization.

4 Econometric speciﬁcation and identiﬁcation issues
4.1     Econometric speciﬁcation
We take advantage of the panel nature of our data to estimate the effects of road improvements
on the localization of economic activities and on the specialization of localities in Mexico. Our
main empirical speciﬁcation is the following ’market access’ model:

                                         int
                       Ym,t = βM Mm,t + βC   Mm,t Im,t + βC Cm,t + αt + µm +    m,t                    (3)

                                                    15
  Figure 5: Maps of employment and output locality specialization in Mexico (2004 – 2014)




Sources: denue (inegi). Note: Employment specialization in 2004 (top left) and 2014 (top right). Output
specialization in 2004 (bottom left) and 2014 (bottom right).

    where Y m, t is the dependent variable (employment or specialization index) for locality
m, Mm,t is the market access or market potential of the same locality, Cm,t is a vector of
time-varying locality characteristics (education, population, oil-reserves, and pre/post nafta
period), Im,t is an interaction term (education and population, oil-reserves, pre/post nafta
period, and capital city dummy, αt is a time dummy and µm is the location ﬁxed effect, which
absorbs time-invariant location characteristics. m,t is the error term. The coefﬁcients of inter-
est are βM and βC int , which account for the effect of domestic accessibility and of its interaction

with controls. Note that because education (share of population with college, undergraduate,
or graduate degree) and population size could be endogenous controls and interaction terms,
we use instead dummy variables for localities that are above the initial median education and
median population levels.



                                                   16
    Speciﬁcally, we regress the log value of employment and/or of the specialization index of
locality m and year t on the log of the market access (ma) or of the market potential (mp), so
that our coefﬁcients estimates can be interpreted as elasticities. Standard errors are clustered
at the locality level to adjust for heteroskedasticity and within-locality correlation over time.
The regression sample is a balanced panel of 2,094 localities with employment data for the
years 1986, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014. The specialization and concentration indices are
calculated at the establishment and locality levels. Since the latter micro-geographic data only
span the 2004-2014 period, we will therefore restrict our analysis on specialization to this time
period.
    In addition to the ’market access’ speciﬁcation, we also estimate an ’infrastructure model’
where we substitute market access with our measure of efﬁcient roads within a ﬁxed radius
surrounding a locality’s centroid. In that model, we also incluse a measure of access to inter-
national markets (measured by the minimum time or travel cost to a port or port of entry into
the u.s.).15
    Table 5 presents the summary statistics for the key variables of our analysis and the overall,
between and within standard deviations.16


4.2       Identiﬁcation issues
The panel structure of the data allows us to control for location-speciﬁc time-invariant fac-
tors and general macroeconomic trends. However, we need to account for the three following
problems: (i) omitted variables bias, (ii) the non-random road placement of roads, and (iii) the
structural recursion problem with the use of market access regressors.

    Omitted variables bias. In our framework, the problem of omitted variables is mitigated by
the panel structure of the data. We include locality ﬁxed effects in the panel estimation, which
absorb all time-invariant local characteristics such as initial wealth. Therefore, the estimated
effects of market access and market potential cannot be attributed to time-invariant locality dif-
ferences. This is an advantage over a cross-sectional framework, where unobservable location
characteristics that explain outcomes could be correlated both with surrounding population or
income and transport infrastructure that enter into the calculation of MA and MP indicators.

   Despite the use of panel data and the different controls included, our model is still po-
tentially subject to problems of simultaneity bias or reverse causality. In this respect, the two
main empirical challenges with our model speciﬁcation are the non-random placement of roads
  15 Itis not desirable to introduce our measures of access to external markets in the market access speciﬁcation
because of their potentially high correlation with our market access or market potential indicators.
  16 The latter decomposition conﬁrms the presence of time variation in our data (although most of the variation

remains cross-sectional).

and a recursion problem inherent with regressions of local employment or income variables
on market access or market potential measures. We discuss below how we address these issues.

    Non-random road placement and the construction of the ‘doughnut’ IV. The expansion
of the road network surrounding a locality can be endogenous and this may create a correla-
tion between increases in local market access or local market potential and our left-hand side
variable, for instance employment. This may occur if road construction occurs in localities that
would otherwise have experienced relative increases or decreases in average employment (our
review of road investments in Mexico suggests that roads may have been built to increase acces-
sibility in lagging regions during the studied period). To deal with that problem, we adopt the
so-called ’doughnut’ instrumentation strategy as proposed by Jedwab and Storeygard (2017).
The basic idea behind this approach is to instrument the market access or market potential
with similar measures excluding surrounding areas within a ﬁxed radius (in addition to ‘own
locality’ exclusion). Variations in this instrument are more likely to be exogenous. Following
the identiﬁcation strategy of Jedwab and Storeygard (2016) also implemented by Blankespoor
et al. (2017), we construct the counterfactual measures of market access and market potential

                                                   18
excluding all localities j located within a 25, 50 or 75 km radius of locality i, hence the reference
to a ‘doughnut’.17

    The ’recursion problem’ or the structural endogeneity of market access and market po-
tential. When considering an explained variable which is correlated with other variables that
enter the calculation of the accessibility regressor in formulas (1) or (2)—for instance when
regressing total employment on market access in Equation (3)—a recursion problem is bound
to emerge, even when excluding ‘own locality’ from the measure of accessibility. To see this,
notice that locality i’s market access is a function of locality j ’s population, which in turn is
correlated with locality j ’s employment, which is a function of locality j ’s market access, and
thus of locality i’s population. Locality i’s employment is then structurally correlated with its
own market access in the absence of any causal effect of market access on employment. Fol-
lowing Baum-Snow et al. (2017), we address this problem by calculating either counts of road
intersections or a ‘doughnut’ of efﬁcient road lengths in a given radius (in a similar way to
the market access and market potential ‘doughnuts’).18 We then use the road count or efﬁcient
road variable instead of the market access or market potential indicator, or use it to instrument
market access or market potential. Sources of variations in ‘accessibility’ are then only due to
variations in roads, thus avoiding the recursion problem.

    The validity of our three instruments (both for market access and market potential) is tested
by means of the Kleibergen-Paap statistics, which is robust in the presence of heteroskedas-
ticity. After performing this test, we reject the hypothesis of weak instruments as the rule of
thumb suggested by Staiger and Stock (1997) that the statistic must be larger than 10 is satis-
ﬁed. As for the exogeneity of the instruments, we rely on the Hansen-J statistics and strongly
accept the hypothesis of exogenous instruments.19 The coefﬁcients on market access and mar-
ket potential are positive and statistically signiﬁcant in all second stage regressions.

    To differentiate the role of access to domestic and external markets, we also estimate the
infrastructure model as previously discussed. In this model, domestic market access is proxied
  17 Because   of the mixed nature of our sample, for metropolitan areas, we ﬁrst compute these counterfactual
measures at the municipality level, excluding both municipalities within a same metropolitan area and munici-
palities within our distance threshold. We then deﬁne the metropolitan area ‘doughnut’ as the weighted average
of these municipality indices, using municipality area as weights.
  18 In this ‘doughnut’, the exclusion of surrounding areas addresses endogeneity of road placement.
  19 See Baum et al. (2017) for a detailed explanation of test implementation in stata and for references. It is

worthwhile noticing that, besides being efﬁcient, our estimation results are also consistent with respect to the
absence of heteroskedasticity or autocorrelation because of the Stock-Yogo weak identiﬁcation employed for the
estimation. In all our iv regressions, the ﬁrst stage f-statistic is large, suggesting that the instrument is strong
(Stock and Yogo, 2005).

by efﬁcient road length20 and access to external markets by the minimum travel cost or travel
time to a major port and to the u.s. border. One key advantage of this approach is that
the infrastructure measure (efﬁcient road length) does not have a structural dependence on
population (like the market access) or on income (like the market potential). However, this
infrastructure measure may still suffer from non-random placement. To deal with this problem,
we use as an instrument the ‘doughnut’ road efﬁcient length. As a robustness check, we
also report the results from cross-section regressions where the efﬁcient road length of the
corresponding year is instrumented with the 1949 efﬁcient road length.21


5 Estimation Results
We exploit changes in the transportation network over the 1986 – 2014 period to estimate the
effect of market access and market potential on localities employment and specialization in
Mexico.


5.1    The effect of market access and market potential on employment
Table 6 reports estimates from the regression of employment on market access, in which our
market access measure is instrumented in three ways: using the doughnut market access, the
road count within a 10 km circle, and the efﬁcient road length within a 100km radius. The
ﬁrst column (ma only) reports our basic estimates without any controls. The second column
reports the ols estimates of the full model, and the last three columns report result of the
instrumented regression with each one of our three instruments. As can be seen from the in-
strumented regressions, there is a positive and signiﬁcant causal effect (iv) of market access on
employment. Note that ﬁrst stage coefﬁcients (not shown) are positive and signiﬁcant, which
means that each market access measure is predicted by the appropriate instrument.22 Results
indicate that between 1986 and 2014, a 10 percent increase in market access resulted in a 1.6 to
2.1 percent increase in employment.

    Note that we use as interaction terms, population and education variables (dummies equal
to one if the locality has population or education above the median of the initial 1986 levels
for the market access regression or above the median of the initial 1994 levels for the market
potential regression). Also note that more urbanized locations beneﬁted more from an increase

maps. This historic measure can be argued be exogenous to economic outcomes observed more than 40 years
later.

in market access, while areas with a more educated population beneﬁted less from an increase
in market potential. This suggests a stronger impact of accessibility in larger places with lower
skilled workers.

    The estimates also provide evidence that the positive impact of improved domestic market
access on employment was partially attenuated after nafta came into effect (the net impact
is still positive though). One explanation of this result could be that under nafta, access to
international markets started playing a relatively more important role, especially the northern
localities given their proximity to the u.s.. Therefore, our result may point towards a substi-
tution effect of international market access to domestic market access, an issue we explore in
further detail below, in the section describing the infrastructure regressions. Finally, it is also
noticeable that improvements in market access had large beneﬁcial and statistically signiﬁcant
effects on localities with oil reserves (mostly located in the South).

shows a positive and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coefﬁcient: a larger market potential is
associated with greater employment. Instrumentation shows that the effect remains large: A
10 percent increase in market potential is associated with a 2.9 to 6.5 percent increase in total
employment. Interestingly, more urbanized locations beneﬁted less from increases in market
potential, whereas areas with more educated population beneﬁted more. These results are at
odds with what we found in the market access regression. This indicates that market access
and market potential are not completely substitutable. One potential channel to explain the
positive market potential impact on employement growth in more skilled localities may be that
greater market potential (which is a function of surrounding incomes) increases the demand
for goods which have stronger skill contents.

5.2   Spatial and sectoral heterogeneous effects
Market access and market potential have heterogeneous effects on employment in different
sectors and different economic regions. We report the estimated results for the three main
sectors, namely services, manufacturing, and commerce. The results from the iv estimations


                                                                 22
are reported in Table 8. The ﬁrst three columns show the estimated coefﬁcients for market
potential and the last three columns for market access. Compared to other sectors, it is the
services sector that beneﬁts most from an increase in market access or market potential.23 A 10
percent increase in market potential is associated with 1.2 percent, 3.0 percent, and 4.1 percent
increases in employment in the manufacturing, commerce, and services sectors respectively.
Similarly, a 10 percent increase in market access is associated with 1.6 percent, 1.8 percent, and
2.5 percent increases in employment in manufacturing, commerce, and services respectively.
    Results also show that more urbanized or more educated localities beneﬁt more from an
increase in market potential, and less from an increase in market access.24 Finally, localities
seem to beneﬁt less from an increase in domestic market access or domestic market potential
during the nafta period. As mentioned earlier, the net effect is positive, and the result could
be explained by the increasingly important role of international market access at the expense
of domestic market access under trade openness.

   Table 14 and Table 15 in Appendix C show the results for the instrumented regressions of
market access and market potential on total employment for different subsamples stratiﬁed
by region (border, capital, central, North and South). As can be seen, all things else equal,

proved market potential. Interestingly, there is no signiﬁcant effect of an increase in the market
potential in the North, while the effect is important in the South (which is less developed).25
This result thus sheds light on the potential beneﬁt to enhance economic opportunities through
investment in transport infrastructure in lagging regions. It is also in line with the evidence
that Southern Mexico has a greater potential to generate positive spatial spillovers (Deichmann
et al., 2004, Baylis et al., 2012 and Alvarez et al., 2017).


5.3     The effect of market access and market potential on specialization
Table 9 presents the causal effect of market potential and market access on locality specializa-
tion. The ﬁrst four columns present the impact on specialization in terms of output, whereas
the last four columns present the impact on specialization in terms of employment.

   A 10 percent increase in market access causes a 7 percent increase in output specialization
and a 3.4 percent increase in employment specialization. In contrast, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant
impact of market potential on specialization, neither in terms of employment nor in terms of
output. More urbanized locations were not differently affected than less urbanized locations.

5.4   The effect of access to infrastructure on employment and specialization
We now turn to the estimation of the direct impact of local road improvements using measures
of access to infrastructure that do not involve population or income. The focus on infrastruc-
ture only allows us to avoid the structural endogeneity problem of market access and market
potential regressors. In these regressions, we also introduce measures of access to international
markets to contrast the effects of local and international accessibility. Following Baum-Snow
et al. (2017) and Emran and Hou (2013), we regress our dependent variable—employment or
specialization—on both measures of accessibility. For the local access variable, we consider
our measure of road efﬁciency units. For access to external markets, we calculate two comple-
mentary measures: the minimum travel time or the minimum travel cost to a major port and
to the u.s. border.26 To correct for the non-random placement of roads, we also instrument
local accessibility by applying the doughnut approach (i.e., we instrument our road efﬁciency
measure with a doughnut of efﬁcient roads). Finally, we also run a cross-section regression
where our infrastructure metric is instrumented by the 1949 efﬁcient road length.
    As in the previous section, ﬁrst stage estimated coefﬁcients are positive and signiﬁcant,
which means that our efﬁcient road length measure is predicted by the appropriate instru-
ment. Table 10 reports the estimates in the regression of employment on road length efﬁciency,
where efﬁcient road length is instrumented using the doughnut approach. Better local access
to roads has a positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on employment. These effects are
large: a 10 percent increase in efﬁcient road length leads to a 6.7 percent increase in total
employment. There are also heterogeneous effects across sectors: the increase in employment
in the commerce sector (7.1 percent) is greater than in the services sector (6.0 percent) or in
manufacturing (4.3 percent).
As for access to external markets, a decrease in travel costs to the nearest u.s. border is pos-
itively associated with an increase in employment in each sector. We ﬁnd that a 1 percent
reduction in travel costs to the nearest u.s. border leads to a 1.9 percent increase in manufac-
turing employment, a 1.2 percent increase in commerce, and a 0.7 increase in services. These
results are supported by the fact that the United States is, by far, Mexico’s leading partner in
merchandise trade, and most of the Mexico-u.s. trade is through trucking. Note, however,
that the impact of a reduction in travel costs to the nearest port is not positively associated
with an increase in employment but with a decrease (for manufacturing in particular). An
explanation could be that reducing travel costs to the u.s. facilitates exports and attracts em-
ployment, whereas reducing travel costs to ports exposes industries to more competition and
has a depressing impact on employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. Interestingly,
when interacting with the nafta dummy (see Table 16 in Appendix C), we ﬁnd that these two
  26 Minimum   travel cost is calculated using the same calibrated trade cost function as in our market potential
formula.

opposite effects are magniﬁed, consistently with the idea that trade openness results in local
beneﬁts for places that export but negative impacts for places that are exposed to competition
with imported goods.

    Finally, looking at the effects of road infrastructure on specialization, Table 11 shows that
better local accessibility has a positive and statistically signiﬁcant causal effect on specializa-
tion. A 1 percent increase in efﬁcient road length leads to a 5.9 percent increase in the locality’s
output specialization, and a 4.5 percent increase in the locality’s employment specialization.
Interestingly, reducing travel costs to u.s. borders or ports has not signiﬁcant impact on spe-
cialization, neither in terms of output nor in terms of employment.

6 Conclusion
Transport investments have the potential to stimulate growth through trade, structural trans-
formation, agglomeration, and productivity. This paper uses extensive micro-geographic data
and geo-referenced digitized maps of the transport network in Mexico over three decades to
provide empirical evidence of the causal effect of improved access to markets following road
improvements on local employment and specialization. In addition to shedding light on the
effects of transport infrastructure (roads) on local economic development, this paper also pro-
vides evidence of the respective roles of domestic and external market access on the geography
of economic activities.
    To estimate the causal effect of roads on localities’ economic activity and their level of
specialization, this paper addresses two important endogeneity issues, namely the potentially
non-random placement of roads and the structural endogeneity of market access and market
potential regressors, also called the recursion problem. For this, we adopt three separate iden-
tiﬁcation strategies. We ﬁrst use the so-called ’doughnut’ iv strategy to address the common
non-random placement of roads problem, by excluding surrounding localities up to 25 km.
Second, we address the structural endogeneity of market access and market potential by us-
ing two raw measures of access to infrastructure (road count and road efﬁcient length) that
do not involve population or income (either as substitutes for market access indicators or as
instruments).
    Our empirical exercise sheds light on the causal effect of road improvements on the increas-

ing trends in specialization and geographical concentration of employment in Mexico, and
conﬁrms that transport investments can have large effects on local economic activity through
improved accessibility. The quantitative effects are large. A 10 percent increase in market ac-
cess results in a 1.6 to 2.1 percent increase in total employment, a 7 percent increase in output
specialization, and a 3.4 percent increase in employment specialization. In a country where
the share of the manufacturing sector has been declining, we ﬁnd heterogeneity in sectoral
effects, with employment in commerce and services beneﬁting more from road improvements
than employment in manufacturing. We also provide evidence of the potential beneﬁts of the
investments in transport infrastructures in lagging regions. There is no signiﬁcant effect of an
increase in the market potential in the North, while the effect is large and important in the
South. Results also show that localities in the South are the most specialized and the large ef-
fort of the Mexican government to increase accessibility in that region has played an important
role.
    Finally, we show that access to external markets matter but in an heterogeneous way. Re-
ducing travel costs to u.s. borders stimulates employment, whereas reducing travel costs to
ports depresses employment, especially since nafta came into effect. This is consistent with
both theories of exports to the u.s. stimulating local development, and trade openness exposes
localities to competition from imports.
    Further investigation, however, will be needed to understand the possible mechanisms (ter-
tiarisation of the economy, expansion of trade, or foreign direct investment) for the increase in
specialization and employment caused by Mexico’s road improvement. For example, we do
not know whether improved connectivity (through new or better roads) plays a role through
improved accessibility to output markets, to intermediate inputs, to the pool of workers, or
simply through reduction in travel times. We leave these important issues for further research.

Appendix B: Concentration and specialization Indices
Krugman index

The Krugman Specialization index (ksi) is a widely-used specialization measure. It measures
the standard error of industry shares, by computing the share of employment which would
have to be relocated to achieve an industry structure equivalent to the average structure of
the reference group. The Index can take values in between zero (identical territorial struc-
tures) and two (totally different structures). In our case, M = 2,094 localities, i.e., the number
of metropolitan area and standalone municipalities in Mexico (consistent across years). We
measure the locality specialization in terms of output and employment.

                                               I
                                     KSIm =   ∑ |Sm,i − S i |                                  (4)
                                              i=1

    Where Sm,i is the output or employment share of industry i in locality m, S i and is the av-
erage share of industry i in the total output or employment across all localities in Mexico, and
I is the number of industries. If the relative specialization measure is zero, then the economic
structure of a locality is identical to the economic structure of the overall economy. The higher
the index, the more the economic structure of the locality deviates from the overall economy
(reference group) and the more that locality is specialized.




Ellison and Glaeser geographic concentration index

The Ellison-Glaeser index (Ellison and Glaeser, 1997) deﬁnes concentration as agglomeration
above and beyond what we would observe if plants simply chose locations randomly (as op-


                                               36
posed to a uniform spatial distribution). This measure provides an unbiased estimate of ag-
glomerative forces independently of their source. It can be interpreted as the probability that
a ﬁrm choosing its location follows the prior ﬁrm rather than locating randomly. The Ellison-
Glaeser index is given by the following formula:

                                           Gi − (1 − ∑r x2 r )Hi
                                    γi ≡                         ,                          ( 5)
                                           (1 − ∑r xr )(1 − Hi )
                                                    2

where:

   • Gi ≡ ∑r (sri − xr )2 is the spatial Gini coefﬁcient of industry i;

   • xr is the share of total employment in each locality r;

   • sri is the share of employment of locality r in industry i;
              2 is the Herﬁndahl index of the plant size distribution of industry i;
   • Hi ≡ ∑j zji

   • zji represent the employment share of a particular ﬁrm j in industry i.

  Following Ellison and Glaeser (1997), an industry is strongly concentrated if γi > 0.05,
weakly concentrated if γi ∈ (0, 0.05], and not concentrated if γi 0.
