The high incidence of informality in developing countries acts as a drag on economic development due
to the associated efficiency and equity costs and implied weak governance. Policy makers therefore
want to reduce informality. This note presents guidance on policy levers to make formality more
attractive and informality less attractive from the perspective of small, medium and large firms, and
from the perspective of micro-entrepreneurs. It elaborates the challenges for shifting incentives in favor
of being formal and employing workers on formal contracts rather than operating under the regulatory
radar, and presents a range of policy options.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the developing world, most workers and many firms are informal in that they are largely
unregulated. While dominant in developing economies, informality is becoming increasingly prevalent
in advanced economies. The informal economy encompasses many different types of workers and
enterprises engaged in a wide range of activities and in various sectors, reflecting a “complex,
multifaceted phenomenon”.1 These activities may lie outside the scope of regulation, or may be covered
by laws or regulations that are not enforced, whether because it is too costly to do so, or because the
necessary institutional capacity is lacking. The informal economy can therefore include legitimate
activities as well as illegal activities.2 Economic activity can moreover reflect different degrees of
informality.3 In this note, we refer to the informal economy or informal sector as those activities and
incomes that fall outside of government regulation, taxation, social security coverage, or reporting.

Informal activity and informal employment can be sub-optimal with respect to efficiency, equity and
governance, acting as a drag on economic development.4 Informal work tends to be less productive
and rely on less skilled labor inputs with fewer opportunities for skill accumulation or technology
upgrading, constraining the growth rates of highly informal economies due to low added value. This in
turn leads to low income per capita levels that can persist in the future. Low informal earnings –
especially for subsistence farmers and micro-entrepreneurs – limit disposable incomes and thus provide
little support for aggregate demand through households’ consumption of local goods and services. Even
non-subsistence informal workers are likely to make only limited contributions to aggregate demand
given that informal earnings average less than the national minimum wage (Ruppert Bulmer,
forthcoming). Low incomes stifle investment in physical and human capital, and negatively impact firm
growth and aggregate fiscal revenues, with knock-on effects for public services, including those that
enhance human capital and private sector productivity. Efficiency costs also arise from unfair
competition, as informal firms face low tax and compliance costs, creating incentives for evasion that
can undermine regulatory regimes already suffering from weak governance. Although informal
employment may account for most employment in the developing world, the contributions of informal
workers and producers to national output falls in the range of 25-50 percent of GDP.5

For these reasons, policy makers want to reduce informality. This note presents guidance on policy
levers to make formality more attractive and informality less attractive from the perspective of small,
medium and large firms, and from the perspective of micro-entrepreneurs. It elaborates the challenges
for shifting incentives in favor of being formal and employing workers on formal contracts rather than
operating under the regulatory radar, and presents a range of policy options.

  Workers employed in unregistered firms are informal, but so too are undeclared workers employed in formal
firms, or formal employees whose earnings are underreported. Similarly, formal firms may declare only a portion
of their revenues. See Benjamin and Mbaye, 2012, for a discussion on definitions and measurement.

2. INCENTIVIZING FORMALITY
Firms weigh the formality decision through a cost-benefit lens. This is the case at inception – that is,
when firms seek to register with the regulatory and tax authorities. The formality decision arises
throughout the operational stage, and is a question of degree; firms can choose to be in full compliance
with laws and regulations, or can opt for some intermediate status of partial compliance with a subset of
requirements such as income reporting for tax purposes, cost reporting which has implications for labor
tax obligations, and/or non-financial regulations such as labor protections, workplace safety rules,
health regulations, or environmental management requirements. These non-financial regulations
impose a non-trivial cost on firms, and therefore factor into the formality decision.

The decision to be formal may not, in fact, be a true choice, if informality is the result of exclusion.
This is the case when firms operate on the margin between profitability and subsistence; they may not
be able to bear the costs of compliance with legal or regulatory requirements.6 In Paraguay, for
example, where firm census data allow us to compare average firm productivity with average firm
wages for both formal and informal firms, we observe a significant number of firms whose productivity
and wages are below the minimum wage. For these firms, complying with the minimum wage law would
put them out of business.

Many argue that informality is the result of voluntary exit rather than exclusion; informal workers and
firms opt out of the formal sector to avoid taxes and other regulations from which they derive little
value. The empirical literature offers significant evidence that informality can be a voluntary rational
choice.7 Whether driven by exclusion or voluntary exit, the cost burden of complying with laws and
regulations plays a part in the decision to be formal or informal.

3. ADDRESSING LABOR COSTS
Labor costs and the associated labor taxes for formally declared workers represent a substantial cost
for firms. Labor costs comprise net wages paid to workers, the employer’s portion of the labor tax levied
on wages to finance employees’ social insurance, and the indirect cost of labor regulations relating to
worker protections (e.g., limits on work hours, mandated vacation and sick leave, workplace safety
arrangements). The main objective of labor taxation is to finance the provision of social insurance
benefits to contributing workers. Social insurance typically includes unemployment insurance, health
insurance, and old age, disability and survivors’ pensions, and eligibility and benefit level are contingent
on contribution level and therefore reported wage earnings.

High labor taxes reduce formal employment. There is a growing body of empirical evidence on the
negative effects of labor taxes on employment and wages.8 A number of studies find that high labor
taxes have a negative impact on employment, and tend to increase unemployment rates;9 other studies
are less conclusive.10 Several empirical studies identify a positive relationship between the tax wedge on
labor income and unemployment.11 The size of the employment effect due to a change in labor costs
(i.e., the labor demand elasticity) is estimated around -0.30 to -0.50 in industrialized countries (i.e., a 10
percent decrease in the cost of labor would cause employment to rise from between 3 and 5 percent;
see Annex Table 1). In comparison, several studies from developing and transition countries estimate
(long run) labor demand elasticities in the -0.20 to -0.60 range.12

Colombia and the UK provide recent evidence that formal employment increases when labor taxes are
lowered. Under Colombia’s 2012 reform, payroll taxes were reduced by 13.5 percentage points. This
reform was introduced in an environment of very high non-wage labor costs exceeding 60 percent of the
average wage, and very high informality rates ranging from 56 to 67 percent of the total labor force.13, 14
According to a series of studies commissioned by the Inter-American Development Bank, Colombia’s
payroll tax reform increased the number of formal jobs by over 3 percent and increased wages by
between 1.9 and 4.4 percent, with most of the impact among small and medium-sized enterprises.15
Steiner and Forero (2015), Anton (2014), and Hernandez (2012) find that the tax reform increased
formal employment by between 3.4 and 7.4 percent of total employment and reduced informality by
between 1.4 and 4.2 percent. In the UK, the 1999 increase in the National Insurance Contribution (NIC)
of employers and employees by 1 percentage point each is estimated to have slowed nominal wage
growth and shifted the tax burden from low-wage to high-wage earners.16

At least part of employers’ labor taxes is shifted onto employees through lower wages, such that the
intended beneficiaries – formal workers – partially lose out. The resulting ‘pass-through’ effect varies
in magnitude, and can be quite large in middle-income countries.17 Research in Latin America suggests
that 20 to 70 percent of the employer’s social security contributions are passed on to the workers, and
in some cases close to 100 percent.18 This means that a large part of changes in payroll taxes is
transferred to workers through lower wages, but with a marginal effect on employment level. According
to the Melguizo and González-Páramo (2012) meta-analysis of 52 empirical studies, workers within
Continental and Anglo-Saxon economies incur about two-thirds of employers’ labor tax burden in the
long run, compared to around 90 percent for the Nordic economies. High values have also been
estimated by Gruber (1997) in Chile where the pass-through is almost total, and by Cruces et al. (2010)
in Argentina, where the “pass-through” is between 40 and 90 percent.

High labor taxes not only reduce labor demand and wages; they can also contribute to informality.
Mondragón-Vélez et al. (2010) study the effect of non-wage labor costs on the probability of being
informal in Colombia, concluding that an increase of 10 percentage points in non-wage costs is
associated with a 5 to 8 percentage points increase in the probability of being informal. When
comparing countries at similar stages of development and similar per capita income levels, higher labor
tax rates are associated with a larger shadow economy. For example, Davis and Henrekson (2004) find
that for a sample of 14 rich countries in the mid-1990s, a unit standard deviation tax difference of 12.8
percentage points is associated with, among other things, a rise in the shadow economy of 3.8 percent
of GDP, corresponding to a 24 percent increase in the size of the shadow economy evaluated at the
mean.

Achieving the right tax-benefit balance may require tightening the link between employers’ social
security contributions and the benefits that firms derive from these labor tax-financed programs.
Social security contribution rates can be very high, particularly in advanced economies (see Annex Figure
1). This is partly explained by generous social benefits and population dynamics; but employer
contribution rates sometimes incorporate a redistributive component to finance other social objectives,
and may be perceived as a pure tax with no direct benefit to them or their employees. Employers
benefit from unemployment insurance and old age pensions because they replace severance cost
requirements and employer-only financed retirement benefits. Health insurance keeps employees
healthier and more productive at work. Employment injury insurance – typically paid only by firms – can
be cost-effective for spreading employers’ risk across a larger pool of potential beneficiaries while
protecting workers. Employer contributions to social insurance should be limited to financing these
programs.19

Labor tax rates could be structured to accommodate small firms’ limited capacity. In addition to
streamlining social insurance costs and benefits, contribution rates could be tailored to firms’ capacity to
pay. In some countries, social insurance contribution rates are discounted for small enterprises, such as
in France, where companies with less than 20 employees pay a reduced employer contribution
equivalent to a flat-rate of €1.50 per hour to finance general health insurance for employees and for

   Other programs are sometimes financed by mandatory firm contributions, such as in-service training; but when
this is mandatory, all contributing firms should be able to access training support for their own workers. Directly
linking financing and benefits will generate greater buy-in by firms.

accidents at work and occupational illnesses. Smoothing labor tax rates to reduce firms’ effective
marginal tax rate on added labor would improve the incentive to declare employees’ earnings.20

Redistributive components could be shifted from firms (and workers due to pass-through) to different
types of taxation as a means of reducing the labor tax wedge and spurring formal labor demand. For a
given tax revenue, a revenue-neutral partial shift from social contributions to other revenue sources
such as consumption or wealth taxes (e.g., value added taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, etc.) may
improve employment outcomes, including reducing incentives for under-declaring earnings per
employee and thus increasing tax revenues.21 Consumption taxes have a broader tax base than social
contributions, requiring a lower tax rate.22 On the other hand, consumption taxes tend to be regressive.
Bulgaria provides an example of alternative financing for a redistributive policy, namely that the state
budget finances a portion of an employer’s contribution for workers with disabilities. Bulgaria also
shifted to financing active labor market policies from the general budget rather than the contribution-
financed Employment Fund.23 The other main revenue-generating areas for government are taxes on
income and profits (which again risk depressing formal labor supply and labor demand), property taxes
(typically progressive), environmental taxes, and selling government assets (for a temporary wind-fall).
Whereas shifting from labor taxes to consumption taxes may make formal labor inputs less expensive
and increase formal sector output, it can also reduce the demand for formal outputs subject to VAT in
favor of informal goods and services. Leibfritz (2011) points out that the net effect will depend on
specific country circumstances. Evidence from several transition countries (namely Armenia, Bulgaria,
Estonia, Kazakhstan, Slovakia, and Russia) suggest that tax rate cuts were revenue-increasing; the larger
the share of informal business activity before the reform, the higher the revenue growth after.24

Indirect labor costs can be significant, and their size and impact are harder to measure compared to
direct labor costs. Kuddo, Robalino and Weber (2015) address minimum wages, dismissal procedures
and severance pay policies and provide guidance on policy designs that balance the need for labor
market regulation with promoting job creation. For example, making the minimum-wage setting
mechanism more transparent provides potential employers with more visibility on future wage
increases. In addition to minimum wage, dismissal and severance requirements, formal firms may be
required under national labor laws to provide worker protections ranging from caps on work hours and
minimum paid vacation time to paid sick leave, which directly reduce worker output and therefore labor
productivity. Other protections can impose additional indirect costs on firms, such as upgrading facilities
to ensure safe and healthy working conditions, and allowing workers freedom of association, which
enables increased agency. Whereas these core labor standards – protected under ILO conventions – are
essential for safeguarding workers’ basic rights, the associated costs may dissuade compliance by firms.
The degree to which labor conventions are effectively implemented varies widely across countries and
even jurisdictions within countries, and depends on administrative and enforcement capacity (discussed
below).

4. ADDRESSING NON- LABOR COSTS AND
REGULATIONS
Policies to reduce formal firms’ costs can focus on income or profit taxes. Governments can smooth tax
rates on firms through graduated profit taxes, for instance by introducing intermediate rates where
current effective marginal rates spike. Firms with rising profits may forgo expanding their operations or
declaring additional revenue if most added profits are taxed away. As an alternative to taxing on self-
reported profits, some countries impose taxes using administrative criteria, which are more transparent
and verifiable compared to self-assessments by firms, and can implicate a larger tax base. Presumptive
systems may, for instance, calculate taxable income using observable factors associated with income
such as sales, turnover, number of employees, or assets, to capture at least some minimum level of tax
from firms considered to be unreliable sources of information on their own activities.25 Evidence
suggests that providing tax relief targeted to small firms is no more effective at increasing aggregate
employment than general tax relief for businesses, however. In fact, special relief may hurt economic
growth by creating a small-business trap, preventing small firms from growing larger to maintain their
special tax treatment.26

Other costs incurred by formal firms stem from regulations that control the operating environment
such as direct registration fees and business licenses, importing or exporting fees and administrative
procedures, operating permits (e.g., for driving, construction and health regulations, and accreditation),
and the time necessary to meet bureaucratic and tax reporting requirements.27 Operating in the
informal sector can be more efficient from the firm perspective when the regulatory environment is
highly distorted.

A host of complementary factors figure into firms’ calculation of the pros and cons of doing business
formally and in full compliance. In principle, an enabling environment for firms would include a well-
functioning infrastructure network, widely accessible education and health services of high quality,
trade and competition policies that ensure a level playing field while nurturing new players, regulations
that balance firms’ and workers’ rights, and a fair judicial system that can enforce property rights,
contracts and the rule of law in a timely manner. These enabling factors benefit both formal and
informal firms, and even society at large, which can distort the willingness to pay for these services since
informal beneficiaries do not pay taxes. A weak business environment facilitates informality, and
excessive informality undermines a conducive business climate. The resulting vicious cycle can drive
down productivity when, for example, informal or irregular firms cannot attract educated workers or
engage them long-term, ultimately reducing firms’ incentives to invest in training and productivity
upgrades. Similarly, informal firms unable to access credit, larger markets, or sources of innovation may
operate at a suboptimal scale. When formal firms have to compete with non-complying firms, formal

   Jobs created by small firms are also generally of lower quality than jobs created by large firms, with the former
paying lower wages, offering more modest health insurance and pension plans, and providing poorer working
conditions. See Brown et al., 1990; IMF, 2012.
27
   According to World Bank Enterprise Surveys data (http://www.enterprisesurveys.org), senior managers in
manufacturing firms spend on average 10 percent of their time dealing with the requirements of government
regulation, with a higher time burden in LAC (14 percent of senior managers’ time) and a lower burden in East Asia
and the Pacific (6 percent). For details on the business environment in 190 countries see World Bank, 2016.

                                                        11
sector productivity falls, dragging down average productivity.28 On the other hand, in economies where
informal and formal activities have limited overlap, as suggested by La Porta and Shliefer (2014) among
others, this effect may be small. In the context of a weak business climate, it is important to design
additional incentives targeting firms on the margins of formality, typically small firms that can avoid
government scrutiny by operating in the shadows at low scale.

Corruption, or even the perception of official corruption, will discourage formality. In settings of weak
governance, firms may even be required to pay bribes for the privilege of operating formally; this in
itself can be directly linked to the formality decision if inspectors or permit issuers demand bribes.
World Bank enterprise survey data indicates that 18 percent of manufacturing firms globally have
experienced at least one bribe payment request, with regional averages ranging from 30 percent in East
Asa and the Pacific, to a more modest two percent in high income OECD countries.29 Effective policies in
these weak institutional settings need to be simple, transparent, based on readily observable criteria,
and easily enforced.




28
   According to Farrell (2004), informality accounts for around 50 percent of the productivity gap between
countries like Turkey, Portugal, and the United States; and for 30 percent of the productivity gap between Brazil
and the United States.

5. ENFORCEMENT: CARROTS VS. STICKS
Informality due to partial or complete evasion is facilitated by imperfect enforcement. When rules and
regulations are onerous or complex or inconsistent, firms are less likely to comply. Government efforts
to enforce compliance face challenges related to administrative capacity and information gaps, inter
alia. When governments do not know where firms are, their level of output, and who they employ, it is
difficult to extract the appropriate level of profit and labor taxes and business fees, for example. And
when there are minimal negative consequences for evasion or underreporting, firms’ incentive to
comply diminishes further.

One clear example relates to tax enforcement, where weak governance limits effective tax collection,
inducing even more informality. Poor tax enforcement is especially problematic in developing countries
with weak governance. Challenges include “(i) dealing with sectors that are ‘hard-to-tax’ everywhere
(small businesses, including small farmers, professionals, and, in some cases, state-owned enterprises),
especially where administrative capacity and compliance habits are weak; and (ii) weak revenue
administrations, low taxpayer morale, and poor governance.”30 Moreover, a large informal sector leads
to a high tax burden on registered firms because of the narrower tax base, creating negative reinforcing
effects that are more likely to tip the cost-benefit equation in favor of informality.31

The prevalence of small firms in developing economies makes enforcement particularly difficult, given
that tax and social security evasion is more common among smaller firms. Perry et al. (2007) show that
in Bolivia and Mexico, one-third of sales go unreported among microenterprises, compared to 10-15
percent among firms with 100 workers or more. In Panama, Peru, and Uruguay, by contrast, large firms
appear to evade taxes and social security contributions at rates that are comparable to those of smaller
enterprises, which average between 10 and 15 percent in Peru and Uruguay, and above 30 percent in
Panama.32

Costly regulations and taxes drive firms underground; even minimal regulations may dissuade firms
from registering or accurately declaring their income and assets. The first step in promoting
compliance is to make it easier for firms to meet regulatory requirements by reducing their direct and
indirect costs and simplifying the reporting and payment processes. Addressing the compliance
incentives for firms – such as by reducing or smoothing tax rates, eliminating duplicate or contradictory
registration steps, focusing on a small number of fees, cutting minor fees altogether, reducing the time
burden of red tape, and/or raising the perceived value of being formal – will increase firms’ willingness
to pay. High quality public goods and services will increase tax morale – that is, the intrinsic motivation
to pay taxes33 – whereas money lost to poor political decisions and corruption will tend to decrease it.34
Simplifying the tax regime by reducing tax rates and eliminating exemptions is the main way to reduce
corruption in tax administration. Aligning firms’ and tax authorities’ incentives also induces cooperation.
This can be achieved, for example, by: holding firms accountable for the tax compliance of their
subcontractors; encouraging employer and trade union denunciation of unfair competition; and

enforcing employee rights such as protection against unfair dismissal even for undeclared work
relationships.35

Once the basic incentive structure is set, there could be added incentives designed to entice firms at
the margins of formality, whether small firms contemplating complete evasion, or large firms under-
reporting their employees and/or profits. This “carrot” approach can take many forms. For example,
employer contribution ceilings could induce employer participation and avoid encouraging wage
restraint or under-reporting.36 Amnesties on past tax liabilities could bring in firms seeking a fresh start.
Pre-payment discounts could encourage accurate and timely tax payments.37 Providing pre-filled tax
returns based on observable data is likely to increase compliance and revenues, based on a pilot tested
in California for individual income taxes.38 E-reporting and e-tax payments through mobile applications
can reduce administrative capacity and time requirements, ease the burden for small firms in particular,
and reduce opportunities for corruption.39 Positive incentives will be especially important in developing
economies, where informality rates are high and administrative systems and government enforcement
capacity tend to be weak.

Complementary public information campaigns can be effective tools for promoting positive incentives
and disseminating registration and tax rules to firms with weak attachment to official systems. Labor
unions or informal workers’ associations can also play a role in raising awareness of labor rules,
empowering workers to demand compliance by their employers.40

Minimally effective or credible enforcement is a necessary precondition if firms are to comply. There
are two complementary channels for strengthening enforcement: administrative capacity, and
sanctions. Improving administration often includes: a reorganization of agencies involved with
compliance to rationalize responsibilities across agencies; creating consistent systems and direct
coordination links for data-sharing between fiscal authorities, customs agencies, social security agencies
and labor and tax inspectorates on the basis of unique taxpayer ID numbers; and revising staff
responsibilities to reduce discretion and strengthen accountability lines. Perry et al. (2007) propose that
institutional capacity building address three main aspects of tax administration: taxpayer registration,
audit, and collection. Taxpayer registration can be enhanced through better use of third-party
information (for example, cross-references between tax reporting, social security records, and data from
the financial system). Audits can be more effective by adopting modern audit technology. In most
countries, there is scope for reducing administrative and compliance costs and increasing collections
through changes in tax structure, combining reductions in marginal tax rates with the elimination of
exemptions.

These administration-focused reforms can be complemented by stiffer penalties for non-compliance.
More intense auditing by tax and labor agencies and stiffer penalties for violators are major weapons to
combat undeclared economic activity; however, there are limits to what these measures can achieve

   Ceilings on contributions on insurable earnings can be established as a fixed amount (e.g., as in Spain, Cyprus,
Bulgaria), as a multiple of average wages (e.g., in Slovakia, Romania, the Czech Republic) or of the minimum gross
wage (e.g., Romania for sickness and maternity benefit contributions), or using some other benchmark (see EC,
2017).

alone.41 For instance, heavy auditing and excessive sanctions risk driving some firms and entrepreneurs
more deeply into informality or out of operation altogether. To avoid this, the right mix of prevention
and sanctions is needed. Administrative measures can also incorporate better public education and
information to shape the perceptions of firms vis-à-vis the merits of operating in the formal sector and
contributing to the public good by strengthening formal systems.

With respect to labor standards, in most countries labor inspection agencies monitor compliance.
Labor inspection units tend to operate as part of the labor administration.42 But most labor inspection
units have a dual nature that can impede or at least complicate monitoring. On one hand, labor
inspectors enforce legal provisions dealing with labor regulations, occupational health and safety, social
services, migrant workers, vocational training, social security, and other areas where firms are
regulated. On the other hand, labor inspectorates play a collaborative role with firms to provide
information, advice and training. Given that many compliance irregularities occur in small-scale
enterprises or in sectors with high staff turnover, inspection activities tend to focus on such firms, and in
sectors like construction, hotels, garment manufacturing, transport and commerce. The ILO contends
that resources for labor inspection are inadequate in most countries.43

Enforcement strategies require country-specific approaches tailored to the political, historical, and
economic culture of the country.44 But the main instrument available to labor, social security and tax
inspectorates for detecting undeclared work is the unannounced site visit. This instrument is effective
in ensuring that most workers are registered. Some countries carry out joint inspections, such as El
Salvador, which has a special integrated inspection unit, and Belize, where inspections are conducted
jointly between the Social Security Board and the Labor Department.45

   ILO recommendations on the optimal ratio of labor inspectors to workers are: 1/10,00 in industrial market
economies, 1/15,000 in rapidly industrializing economies, 1/20,000 in transition economies, and 1/40,000 in the
least developed economies. Most countries miss these benchmarks, however. The ratio between inspectors and
active population range from one inspector per 5,500 active workers in Malaysia, to one per 8,300 workers in
Latvia, one per 45,000 in Burkina Faso, one per 370,000 in Cambodia and one per 3,200,000 in Bangladesh. See

6. DIFFERENTIATING TAX REGIMES TO
ENTICE MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS INTO
FORMALITY
Like larger firms, micro-entrepreneurs46 must elect whether to register with the relevant authorities,
or operate outside the formal sector. Given that evasion is relatively easier for micro-firms, many of
which operate in private rather than commercial settings, the cost-benefit calculation is different
compared to that for larger firms because the likelihood of detection or sanctions is low. Even for those
registered, the degree of formality is a choice; micro-entrepreneurs may be tempted to under-report
their earnings to reduce their tax burden.

From the perspective of a micro-entrepreneur, being formal brings some benefits but not others. For a
registered entrepreneur, participating in social insurance brings income transfers in the event of
unemployment and old age, health services in the event of illness, and access to employment injury
insurance for oneself and one’s employees. The remaining protections that typically come with being
formal are irrelevant for self-employed micro-entrepreneurs: labor protections such as limits on work
hours or mandatory vacation are decided by the self-employed worker directly through his/her own
labor decisions, as are workplace safety, health and environmental precautions. These additional
protections therefore have zero perceived benefit. The disadvantages of being formal include costly
contributions to social insurance for oneself and any employees, profit taxes, business operating license
fees, administrative processing and reporting requirements, and for entrepreneurs with employees, the
payment of minimum wage and severance, and compliance with dismissal rules.

Recall that when economic agents, whether firms or workers, perceive that the benefits of formality are
outweighed by the costs, they rationally choose to exit formality. The challenge is to provide the
benefits of formality in a format that meets micro-entrepreneurs’ needs at an affordable cost. These
needs, and the types of policies that will be effective in addressing them, depend on the productive
capacity of micro-entrepreneurs. For workers who are self-employed because they have been excluded
from more productive formal sector work, their capacity to develop a business with growth potential
may be limited; this would be the case for so-called ‘subsistence’ entrepreneurs performing low-level
services or small-scale household production as employment of last resort.47 If, on the other hand,
workers voluntarily choose to become entrepreneurs, their capacity to increase productivity and
ultimately expand output and create formal jobs could be harnessed through a range of interventions.

Although the main benefit of being formal is access to social insurance, most existing social insurance
programs are designed to accommodate traditional patterns of formal employment that are ill-suited
to micro-entrepreneurs. For a self-employed entrepreneur, the employer and the employee are the
same person, such that the effective combined contribution rate (i.e., employer plus employee) is
disproportionate to the value of the benefit, and in many cases is unaffordable. Similarly, in a micro-
enterprise employing unpaid family labor, there is no wage, effectively precluding the unpaid family
worker from coverage. To address these coverage gaps, many countries have extended social insurance


46
   Size-definitions of micro-enterprises vary. In this note we consider a microenterprise as an employer with up to 5
employees. The EU definition, by contrast, allows up to 9 employees and with annual turnover below EUR 2
million.

to the self-employed,48 achieved by adjusting contribution levels and methods, reducing the level of
benefits (mostly excluding unemployment insurance and reducing pension benefits), and/or subsidizing
the employer contribution (see Winkler, Ruppert Bulmer and Mote (2017) for a detailed treatment).
Other countries have created separate systems for the self-employed, such as the farmers’ system in
Poland and the lawyers’ system in Romania.49 Separate social insurance schemes are more difficult to
sustain due to inadequate risk pooling, and the potential correlation of risks across similar workers (e.g.,
farmers vulnerable to weather-related shocks).

Reducing labor tax contributions is the most common instrument for attracting the self-employed and
micro-entrepreneurs into formality. These take the form of exemptions from certain payroll
deductions, reduced tax rates, or reduced bases on which these obligations are assessed (for a detailed
discussion see OECD, 2015). In Germany, for example, the self-employed are exempt from mandatory
pension contributions, and can apply to the statutory pension insurance scheme within 5 years of
becoming self-employed. In Argentina, employers with a turnover of less than ARD 48 million and those
who perform industrial, agricultural, livestock or mining activities benefit from a reduced social security
contribution rate of 17 percent, compared to a normal rate of 26 percent. Canada’s Small Business Job
Credit applies to small firms whose Employment Insurance employer premiums were less than or equal
to CAD15,000 in 2015 and 2016. In Poland, self-employed persons pay social security contributions on a
lower base that is not less than 60 percent of the projected average monthly wage.50

Many countries apply both minimum income floors and maximum income ceilings for calculating the
social insurance contribution. The minimum contribution threshold typically coincides with the
minimum qualifying income for the self-employed.51 In most EU countries a minimum income floor is
not applied as a condition, given micro-entrepreneurs’ irregular income structure.52 Because self-
employment income tends to be lumpy and can vary widely from year to year, most EU systems are
structured to accommodate negative or zero net income years through e.g., postponement of the
contribution payment, waiving the contribution payment, or applying a reduced contribution rate,
rather than excluding affiliates from the system.53 In several Central and Eastern European countries,
when income falls below a minimum level, the self-employed drop out of the system; but this is
counteracted by setting the minimum thresholds low so that most low-earning self-employed people
still qualify for coverage. Imposing a maximum contribution ceiling helps attract high-earning self-
employed who may otherwise forgo social insurance.




48
   Bonnet (2015) describes the rapid extension of legal coverage to the self-employed since the 1990s. In 2013, 147
of the 181 countries examined provided pension coverage for the self-employed, twice the proportion in 1990.
Globally, as of 2013, 77 percent of the self-employed were legally covered by some type of pension scheme,
compared with 29 percent in 1990. Over the same period, the covered share increased by a factor of 8 in low-
income countries and by a factor of 4 in middle-income countries.

   EC, 2016.
50
   The minimum amount in 2015 was PLN 2,375 and the limit of the annual basis for pension and disability
contributions was PLN 118,770. Self-employed persons also pay health care contributions against a lower
assessment basis.
51
   The minimum qualifying income for the self-employed is equal to the minimum wage in Bulgaria, Estonia and
Slovenia; the minimum contribution basis in Latvia; 30 percent of the minimum wage in Hungary; three times the
gross average monthly salary in a year in the case of Romania; and specific income levels in the Czech Republic and
the Slovak Republic.

Policies to reduce costs for other business-related regulations include lower profit tax rates for new
firms, with rates increasing over time or in line with profits, thereby smoothing the marginal tax rate.
Both measures keep the initial burden low for start-ups, and thus encourage registering. Setting
business licensing fees and other regulatory payments proportional to the size of the operation also
accommodates micro-entrepreneurs’ low payment capacity. But recent evidence from programs in
Brazil (de Andrade, Bruhn and McKenzie, 2013) and Benin (Benhassine et al., 2016) shows that efforts to
waive registration costs and provide registration information were insufficient to induce firms to
formalize and remain formal.

In light of micro-entrepreneurs’ limited administrative capacity – whether due to time pressures or
capability – efforts to alleviate the compliance burden have been introduced in many country settings.
Compliance can be encouraged through less frequent filing of tax returns, or simplified accounting
methods to determine tax liability. Brazil introduced a single tax for SMEs, the Simples Nacional regime,
which can be paid in place of eight taxes.54 Brazil also introduced a flat tax for self-employed workers
under an income threshold.55 Hungary’s KATA regime is a lump-sum tax for self-employed who are
released from other tax obligations including corporate income tax, personal income tax, a social
contribution tax, and healthcare, pension, employment and vocational training contributions.56 In
countries using a presumptive tax scheme, firms below a small-business threshold are exempt from
regular income tax, and the firm’s tax liability is calculated on the basis of an observable proxy such as
annual revenue or some other measure reflecting firm size. Eligibility is generally determined by an
annual revenue threshold. Some countries also specify a maximum number of employees (e.g., Brazil,
Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia), and in some countries, tax rates vary by type of business activity
(e.g., Brazil and France).




54
   Entities with gross revenues of up to BRL 3.6 million can choose the Simples Nacional regime, subject to
restrictions (Fajnzylber et al, 2011). This scheme replaces several other taxes, including Contribution for the
Financing of the Social Security (COFINS), Social Contribution on Net Profit (CSLL), Tax on the Circulation of Goods
and Transportation and Communication Services (ICMS), Tax on Industrialized Products (IPI), Tax on Services (ISS),
Corporate Income Tax (IRPJ), Social Integration Program or Civil Servants Savings Program Contribution (PIS or
PASEP) and social security contributions (CPP).
55
   Brazil’s Microempreendedor Individual regime applies to self-employed natural persons, with up to one
employee (who is remunerated at the minimum wage). The entity must have an income that is less than BRL 60
million per year. Under the regime, the taxpayer is exempt from federal taxes and pays a fixed monthly amount
toward social security.
56
   Under the KATA regime, full-time entrepreneurs registered as small business taxpayers pay tax of HUF 50 000
per month. Taxpayers may elect to pay HUF 75,000 per month in return for higher social security service eligibility.
Part-time entrepreneurs pay HUF 25,000. The lump sum tax is payable separately for each person registered as a
small business taxpayer, and applies up to a revenue limit of HUF 6 million. Revenues exceeding this amount are
taxed at 40 percent.

7. SUPPORTING MICRO-ENTERPRISES
THROUGH OUTREACH AND INDIRECT
ENTICEMENTS
To increase compliance, tax rules – whether complex or newly simplified – need to be clearly
communicated to taxpayers; this goes for firms, entrepreneurs and workers. Large firms tend to have
accounting staff to keep records of the firms’ accounts and file the necessary tax returns. But small firms
and micro-entrepreneurs are less likely to have a dedicated bookkeeper, and may be ill-equipped to
perform these functions. Moreover, they are less likely to be aware of the latest tax reporting
requirements. Widespread and accessible communication and public information campaigns on tax
rules, and more direct support through e.g., hotlines or community outreach programs will increase
transparency and ease the administrative burden for the self-employed and micro-entrepreneurs in
particular. But as mentioned above, evidence from Benin suggests that information campaigns alone
were insufficient, while adding a personal visit to the micro-enterprise had a significant positive impact,
but at an excessive implementation cost.57

It may be that even when tax rates and other compliance costs are low and tax reporting and
administrative processes are simple, micro-entrepreneurs remain resistant to formalizing. This will be
the case especially for low-income micro-entrepreneurs because they lack the profit margins to be make
formalization a credible option. Additional enticements to formalize may be needed. The most effective
will be those that help reduce the obstacles to higher productivity and expanded output. Instruments
meeting this criterion include: interventions to increase access to credit and financial intermediation;
programs that directly ease credit constraints through matching grants (with mixed evidence on their
effectiveness)58; partly-subsidized training programs to support business skills development and/or
technical knowledge (a cost-sharing component is important for better targeting); mentoring or
partnering programs that connect micro-entrepreneurs with larger firms operating in the same market
or value chain; marketing and export promotion assistance to improve access to larger internal and
external markets. The fiscal cost of these incentives may be offset by the resulting productivity gains
when recipients are entrepreneurial and have growth potential; it is when these incentives go to very
low-productivity subsistence entrepreneurs that the fiscal outlay may not generate positive returns.
Distinct policies that target incentives to micro-entrepreneurs with different levels of productivity may
yield larger positive effects for the entrepreneurs in each category.

8. CONCLUSIONS
High informality rates in developing economies stem from multiple factors. These include burdensome
or distorted regulations and high tax rates that encourage firms to evade or under-report; operating
informally allows employers, paid employees, and micro-entrepreneurs to increase their take-home
earnings or reduce their costs by evading taxation, social security contributions and other costly
workplace protections. The implementation and enforcement capacity of government institutions in
low-income countries tend to be insufficient to foster high rates of compliance. Weak governance,
which is prevalent in many developing economies, engenders informality and reduces fiscal revenues,
undercutting institutional effectiveness and further reducing the returns to being formal. For
entrepreneurs seeking to set up or expand operations, limited access to skills, technology and/or
markets constrain their potential productivity and therefore incomes, relegating producers to low-
productivity activities sometimes at the margins of profitability. And firms facing a difficult business
environment typically incur high operating costs that affect labor and non-labor inputs, and impose
time-consuming administrative requirements. Some of these factors limit firm entry; others constrain
formal labor demand and output growth.

Policy makers worried about the negative implications for productivity, growth and fiscal balances
seek the best policy approaches for reducing the costs and enhancing the benefits for firms to register
and operate formally. This note identifies a range of challenges for inducing firms of all sizes to comply
with legal and regulatory requirements. Large and more productive firms may have the capacity to
comply with fair rules, but micro-enterprises face much higher constraints. Moreover, micro-enterprises
find it easier to evade reporting and sanctions. Careful impact evaluations of policy effectiveness are
relatively scarce. Some policies are shown to be effective, but other evidence is more mixed.

Whereas policy lessons from international experience are insightful, they need to be customized.
Policymakers may consider designing policies to fit their specific country context, and piloting policy
changes on a small scale before rolling out reforms at the national level. This careful approach will
increase the likelihood that the desired policy objectives will be met.

Given the large number and complexity of factors driving informality, a multi-pronged policy approach
is likely to gain the most traction. Policies should address both labor and non-labor factors. Labor taxes
should be limited to financing social insurance, where contributions and benefits are closely linked in a
transparent way, and employers and employees share the contribution burden. Smoothing marginal
effective tax rates – whether for labor or profit taxes – can create positive incentives for job creation
and firm growth. Accommodating the lower administrative and payment capacity of small firms is
important, and could be effected through consolidated processes or graduated regulations, for example.
Moreover, small firms operating at the margins of formality may need additional enticements,
preferably designed to diminish obstacles to raising their productivity. Simplified tax rates and
regulations are easiest to communicate and implement – regardless of firm size – and could be based on
readily observable factors as an alternative to relying on firms to self-report. Government efforts to
enforce compliance complemented by a framework of fair sanctions are essential to effective
implementation, suggesting the need to strengthen institutional capacity and promote inter-agency
information-sharing and coordination. Because the decision to operate formally is taken using a cost-
benefit lens including both the direct and indirect costs facing firms, it will be important to address
business environment considerations that go beyond traditional incentive regimes.

 Antón, 2014               Colombia, tax          code   As a result of a 13.5 percentage point decrease in non-wage
                           reform in 2012                labor costs, total employment would increase by between 0.3
                                                         to 0.5 percent and formal employment by between 3.4 to 3.7
                                                         percent over the pre-reform scenario. Formal wage rates
                                                         would increase by 4.9 percent as a result of the reform.
 Bassanini           and   OECD countries                On average, it is estimated that a 10 percentage point
 Duval, 2006                                             reduction in the tax wedge, a 10 percentage point reduction of
                                                         unemployment benefits and/or a decline in product market
                                                         regulation by two standard deviations would be associated
                                                         with a drop in the unemployment rate by about 2.8, 1.2 and 0.7
                                                         percentage points, respectively.
 Bell et al., 2002         UK, the 1999 reform in        The reform shifted the tax burden from low-wage to high-wage
                           National       Insurance      earners. A 1 percentage point rise in the NICs share is predicted
                           Contributions (NIC)           to reduce nominal pay growth by around 1.4 percentage points
                                                         after a year, while producer prices in the manufacturing sector
                                                         rise by around 1.3 percentage points. Also, it led to a rise in
                                                         employment growth of 0.5 percentage points, but the
                                                         employment effect is statistically insignificant.
 Betcherman          and   Turkey,    reform     in      An across-the-board reduction of 5 percentage points in
 Pagés, 2009               pension contributions         pension contributions paid by employers would bring about a
                                                         0.8 percent increase in employment overall, and would reduce
                                                         the unemployment rate by about 0.2–0.3 percentage points.
 Cruces et al., 2010       Argentina                     Changes in payroll tax rates are only partially shifted onto
                                                         wages, with estimates ranging between 0.4 and 0.9 percent per
                                                         percentage-point reduction in the tax rate, with the absence of
                                                         any significant effect on employment.
