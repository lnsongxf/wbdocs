About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information

                      External works consist of installing a private substation. The MV network is
                      underground; the LV service is overhead.
                      The client can pick any approved private rm. Another option is for the utility
                      to issue a tendering process to pick the rm that will carry out the works.
                      Because a client's picking of a private rm reduces the wait time, this is
                      usually a preferred option. The private rm will then prepare a design of the
                      works and submit it to the utility for approval.
                      The client's contractor will also need to provide the material for the works.

       The client can pick any approved private rm. Another option is for the utility
       to issue a tendering process to pick the rm that will carry out the works.
       Because a client's picking of a private rm reduces the wait time, this is
       usually a preferred option. The private rm will then prepare a design of the
       works and submit it to the utility for approval.
       The client's contractor will also need to provide the material for the works.
       This (namely the transformer) is usually not available in stock, and most
        rms will need to import it, mostly from Morocco. This causes short delays
       to the process.

   2   Submit connection application to EDG                                                 4 calendar days    GNF 0
       Agency : Electricité de Guinée (EDG)

       The client mails an application for a connection to Electricité de Guinée
       (EDG). In the case where the client relies on Electricité de Guinée (EDG) also
       for the external works, the utility will need to inspect the site rst to carry out
       a technical study and prepare an estimate of the connection fees.
       Alternatively, the client can hire a private rm for the external works. This
       same rm can submit the application for a connection on their behalf. It will
       also carry out the technical study to prepare a design of the external
       connection works and an estimate of the costs.

   3   Receive site inspection by EDG                                                       1 calendar day     GNF 18,205,918
       Agency : Electricité de Guinée (EDG)

       The utility will inspect at the end of the external works to check that they
       have been carried out according to the original plans.

   4   Sign subscriber agreement with EDG and obtain meter installation and                 10 calendar days   GNF 0
        nal supply
       Agency : Electricité de Guinée (EDG)

       A subscription deposit is issued by the electricity company to the customer's
       address. This security deposit takes into account the client’s subscribed
       power and their consumption (tari ). This deposit is also considered as a
       supply contract. After the client has paid the deposit, they become
       subscribed with the utility that then installs the meter and turns on nal
       supply.
       The deposit is returned at the end of the contract.

      The parties should register the sale contract with the National Tax
      Authorities and pay their due tax (5% of the value of the property). Article
      559 of the General Tax Code stipulates that when the National Directorate of
      Taxes considers that the sale price is insu cient it may be exercised within
      six months from the date of registration, a right of rst refusal in favor of the
      public treasury.


      The National Directorate of Taxes is thus empowered to substitute by the
      State the purchaser of the property whose values were considered
      insu cient.

       Authorities and pay their due tax (5% of the value of the property). Article
       559 of the General Tax Code stipulates that when the National Directorate of
       Taxes considers that the sale price is insu cient it may be exercised within
       six months from the date of registration, a right of rst refusal in favor of the
       public treasury.


       The National Directorate of Taxes is thus empowered to substitute by the
       State the purchaser of the property whose values were considered
       insu cient.


       The National Directorate of Taxes will increase by a tenth the price reported.

       Conservation Foncière”)                                                                                      value
       Agency : Land Registry (Bureau de la Conservation Foncière)

       The Director of the Land Registry will only ask to see the notarized sale
       agreement and the map stating the boundaries of the property. It is a
       requirement by law that the director e ectively transfers the property to the
       seller after a 10 days maximum since the demand was presented.

                                                         scenarios, case A and case B, are used to determine how a nonpossessory

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                     Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest      registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population      secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                   In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow
  Number of individuals and firms listed in credit       only case A or case B (not both) to apply. Both cases examine the same set
  registry as a percentage of adult population           of legal provisions relating to the use of movable collateral.

                                                         Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                         (BizBank) are used:
                                                         - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                         - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                         - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                         largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                         second largest business city.
                                                         - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.

                                                         The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                         loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                         of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                         to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                         where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                         property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                         a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                         In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating
                                                         charge or any charge that gives BizBank a security interest over ABC’s

     Are secured creditors subject to an automatic stay on enforcement when a debtor enters a court-supervised                           No
     reorganization procedure? Does the law protect secured creditors’ rights by providing clear grounds for relief from the
     stay and/or sets a time limit for it?

     Does the law allow parties to agree on out of court enforcement at the time a security interest is created? Does the law           Yes
     allow the secured creditor to sell the collateral through public auction or private tender, as well as, for the secured
     creditor to keep the asset in satisfaction of the debt?

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding          liquidation          As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets, it will file a
                    (after an            declaration of cessation of payments (article 25 of the Uniform Act Organizing Collective
                    attempt at           Proceedings for Wiping Off Debts). In order to continue operating, Mirage will try to obtain
                    reorganization)      the opening of reorganization proceedings and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a
                                         composition proposal is a proposal lodged no later than 15 days following the declaration of
                                         cessation of payments, specifying the measures and conditions envisaged to redress the
                                         company. According to our information, Mirage will not reach an agreement with its
                                         creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court will convert the
                                         proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of the proposal (article 33 of the
                                         Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that is later converted into liquidation is the most
                                         likely proceeding in Guinea.

Outcome             piecemeal sale       According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the proceedings will
                                         probably be converted to liquidation. The hotel will stop operating and will be dismantled,
                                         and the assets of the debtor will be sold separately.

Time (in years)     3.8                  Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                         reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following the cessation
                                         of payments. The competent court will then declare cessation of payments and open
                                         reorganization proceedings. The composition proposal will fail, so the proceedings will be
                                         converted to liquidation. According to our estimations, the complete process of a
                                         reorganization attempt that is then converted to liquidation takes approximately 45 months.

Cost (% of          8.0                  According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into
estate)                                  liquidation costs approximately GNF 110,000,000 (8% of the value of the estate). Lawyer fees,
                                         fees of expert-rapporteur, bailiffs and assignees and official receiver constitute the main cost
                                         components.

   Labor Market Regulation
Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
