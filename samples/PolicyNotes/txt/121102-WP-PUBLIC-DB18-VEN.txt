About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      development
      Agency : Dirección de Desarrollo Urbano y Catastro del Municipio

      BuildCo must request assignment of the Basic Urban Variables stipulated by
      the Organic Law for Urban Development. Alternatively, a preliminary
      consultation or an architectural draft is prepared in order to assess
      compliance with the Basic Urban Variables for Buildings.




  2   Request and obtain a Soil Test                                                      20 days             USD 700
      Agency : Private Enterprise - Laboratory

      A soil test is listed by "Norma Venezolana COVENIN 1618-98" as a
      requirement to obtain a building permit and other procedures. In practice,
      contractors ask for a soil test to ensure that the foundation of the building is
      solid. The engineer must understand the suitability of the soil for the
      proposed construction work. A soil test is essential to build a solid
      foundation and prevent structures from being damaged, collapsed or
      leaned.

  3   Obtain a topographical map                                                          15 days             USD 1,500
      Agency : Private engineer or quali ed topographer

      A topographic survey is required by Chapter H-15 of "Norma Venezolana
      COVENIN 1618-98". Moreover, in practice, contractors will need a
      topographical survey to draw the site plan.

      BuildCo must also obtain a certi cate stating that the new project is
      compatible with the existing or planned roads from the Zoning and Road
      Construction Division in order to obtain a certi cate of compliance with
      basic urban variables for buildings.

      Agency : Dirección de Desarrollo Urbano y Catastro del Municipio

      The certi cate of compliance with Basic Urban Variables is required to begin
      the construction.

  6   Pay the corresponding fees at the bank                                              1 day               VEF 25,362

  8   Request and receive a re inspection                                             1 day      VEF 1,050
      Agency : Fire Department

      Once construction has started, BuildCo. requests this inspection at the
      municipal re station. The re inspection approval certi cate is delivered by
      the Fire Department the day after the inspection is performed, provided that
      the building complies with the Fire Department Regulations and the
      Commission for Industrial Standards (COVENIN) standards. If the building
      does not comply with these regulations, the Fire Department draws up a
      report stating that the inspection has not been approved and detailing those
      aspects that must be corrected in the building in order to pass the re
      inspection.

  9   Request and connect to water supply and sewage service                          213 days   no charge
      Agency : Hidrocapital

      Water supply is obtained through connection to the sector’s main pipeline,
      following a request to the corresponding company, which, in this case, is
      Hidrocapital. In some cases, buildings have their own groundwater well,
      making it unnecessary to request water supply services from Hidrocapital.


      Connection to the sewage system depends on whether this service exists in
      the sector where the building is located. If there is no sewage system, the
      Zoning and Road Construction Division (Dirección de Desarrollo Urbano y
      Catastro) requires the installation of septic tanks or waste treatment plants
      for wastes to be treated before being discharged into the environment.
      Depending on the size of the building and its intended use, the appropriate
      permits must be requested at the Ministry of People's Power for
      Environment (changed in 2007 from the Ministry of the Environment and
      Natural Resources), because such wastes might have a negative impact on
      the environment. Due to a backlog and a massive number of applications,
      this takes on average 6 months.

      Receive nal inspection and obtain construction completion certi cate            16 days    no charge
 10   Agency : Dirección de Desarrollo Urbano y Catastro del Municipio

      Once the construction has been completed, and installations made, BuildCo.
      can obtain a construction completion certi cate. To obtain the permit, the
      Fire Department certi cate is mandatory, as is compliance with all applicable
      regulations.

      Register the building at the Subordinate Registry (Registro Subalterno)         16 days    VEF 8,300
 11   Agency : Subordinate Registry (Registro Subalterno)

      After the water supply and sewage services are instaleld, BuildCo. can
      register the new warehouse at the Subordinate Registry (Registro
      Subalterno) during or after construction. The title to the land on which the
      building is constructed and building plans must be submitted so Registry
      o cials can calculate the building registration fee.

  1   Hire certi ed electrician to prepare design and submit application to             85 calendar days    VEF 456,987
      Corpoelec
      Agency : Corpoelec

      The application must be submitted with legal property titles, ID of the client
      and a draft design of the connection made by a certi ed electrician
      ("electricista colegiado").

  2   Receive external inspection by Corpoelec                                          1 calendar day      VEF 0
      Agency : Corpoelec

      Corpoelec carries out an external inspection to determine the connections
      works to be carried out and if an expansion or extension of the network is
      needed. It is not compulsory although recommended that the client and/or
      the client's electrician be present during the inspection.

      A cost estimate is then sent to the client. The estimate must be paid at the
      premises of Corpoelec with a check at the headquarters of Corpoelec in San
      Bernardino. A connection of less than 36 KvA does not need a project if the
      distance to the network is less than 12 meters for underground connections
      and 30 meters for overhead.

  3   Obtain excavation permit from municipality                                        90 calendar days    VEF 6,500
      Agency : Municipality

      The client must obtain an excavation permit for the underground
      connection from the Municipality. In other cases, for an overhead
      connection a permit is not necessary but this must be explicitly indicated in
      the design of the connection submitted by the applicant to the utility.

  4   Pay estimate and await completion of external works by electrician                30 calendar days    VEF 13,861,250
      Agency : Electrician

      Once the estimate has been paid, Corpoelec ires a team to carry out the
      external works. As a public enterprise, Corpoelec has to comply with public
      procurement rules when hiring the team, which can take around 8 months.
      Corpoelec o ers the possibility of the "mandato" in which the client can hire
      himself an electrician to carry out the external works.

      Corpoelec appoints an inspector who will watch the progress of the works
      and will sign the certi cate (" niquito de obra") approving that the works
      meet the standards of Corpoelec. Under the "mandato", the client pays the
      market price, thus the cost is higher than when Corpoelec carries out the
      works, but reduces the time to obtain a connection.

  5   Receive nal inspection by Corpoelec                                               1 calendar day      VEF 0
      Agency : Corpoelec

      When the client opts for the "mandato", Corpoelec carries out a nal
      inspection and delivers a certi cate of conformity of the works (" niquito de
      obra").

  6   Sign supply contract with Corpoelec                                               3 calendar days     VEF 0
      Agency : Corpoelec

      The client signs a supply contract with Corpoelec and can be exempted from                                             Page 23

        The client signs a supply contract with Corpoelec and can be exempted from

        registered to cover the monthly bill payment.

        This can be done in any of the commercial o ces of Corpoelec of Caracas.

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      The sale agreement is presented to the local o ce of SAREN (Servicio
      Autónomo de Registros y Notarías) for the calculation of the following
      taxes and fees:
      a) SAREN's fees, which amount to 0.6% of the property value, according
      to the Law of Public Registries and Notaries of 2014 (the fee provisions
      entered into force on May 2015), and must be paid within 60 days of
      assessment.
      b) Municipal tax, which amounts to 5 Tax Units. This means that the
      municipal tax amounts to VEF 1500 given the current value of the unit is
      VEF 300 since February 2017.

      An internal order of SAREN of 2008 established a "Previous Revision"
      procedure at the time of the assessment of the SAREN fees. This
      procedure was established to review the substance of the property
      transaction before the parties paid the applicable taxes and proceeded
      to present all documents for registration. Previous Revision procedures
      can add up to 5 days to the property transfer process, but do not
      guarantee that the registration application will be approved after the
      payment of taxes. Not all SAREN o ces have taken up this procedure,
      since ultimately it is not established by law, and seems to contradict the
      legally established celerity principle that governs registration procedures
      in Venezuela.

       The documentation is reviewed carefully by the Revision Department,
       verifying the identity of the owners, boundaries, the ful llment of judicial
       decisions related to the property, and other information. The date for
       the signature by the registrar is set and parties must come back on that
       day for the nal step. Since 2005, sta at the Registry is inclined to use
       discretion ("jurisprudencia") in dealing with cases and may ask the clients
       two times for extra documents, thus delaying this procedure. The
       documentation shall include copy of RIF ("Registro de Información Fiscal"
       or Fiscal Information Register) of both buyer and seller. If there is any
       authorization by the meetings of the pertinent companies, copies of
       those authorizing the sale of the immovable must be included. If acting
       through an attorney-in-fact, a copy of his/her identity card and a copy of
       the power-of-attorney is required.


       The sale document is signed by the Registrar under the presence of the
       parties and two witnesses.

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

       Protecting Minority Investors
This topic measures the strength of minority shareholder protections against misuse of corporate assets by directors for their
personal gain as well as shareholder rights, governance safeguards and corporate transparency requirements that reduce the risk
of abuse. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more
information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees
                                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                 - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                       movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding         liquidation        Bizbank would initiate a foreclosure procedure. Once the lawsuit filed, there would be
                   (after an          preliminary hearings, which would be followed by the formal declaration of bankruptcy of

                                      among the creditors would be carried out.

Outcome            piecemeal sale     Once the bankruptcy is declared, the administrator / liquidator will administer the debtor's
                                      assets, who must sell Mirage's assets, and distribute the proceeds among the creditors
                                      according to the legal priority order. There is no possibility that the company will continue to
                                      operate once the bankruptcy has been declared.

Time (in years)    4.0                It would take about 4 years for a liquidation proceeding after an attempt at foreclosure
                                      similar to the one described in the case study. The procedure would be initiated by the Bank
                                      filing for foreclosure. The Court will declare the bankruptcy of the debtor converting the
                                      foreclosure procedure into a liquidation proceeding. This stage would take approximately 6
                                      months. Afterwards, a liquidator will be appointed and the list of creditors’ claims will be
                                      issued. This stage will take from 1 to 2 years. The sale of the debtor’s assets would take up to
                                      2 years.

Cost (% of         38.0               The costs would amount to approximately 38% of the value of Mirage’s estate. The main
estate)                               component are the attorney’s fees (20%). The rest will be service fees, and cost associated
                                      with the auction and fees of the liquidator.

Doing Business presents the data for the labor market regulation indicators in an annex. The report does not present rankings of
economies on these indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/labor-market-regulation).

The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
