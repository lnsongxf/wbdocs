density pattern has negative environmental impacts related to high carbon emissions, poses significant
challenges to the provision of high-quality network infrastructure, and hampers the connectivity and
accessibility for UB residents, which is discussed in the following sections.

                   Box 3.1: Observations of Bribery to Gain Access to Schools

“Even if school is school of one’s residential-administrative district, one has to give gifts and
arrange with someone in order to get one’s child study in that school as its capacity is full. Some
schools open donation classes and accept kids. You have to give bribes in order to enter school.
This is done under the guise of donation. It can’t be called bribery as it is called donation.”
                                                        Female, central ger area in Sukhbaatar district

“One of my friends is a widow with 3 children. She is a resident of 14th khoroo and she tried to
enroll her child to school no.35, which refused saying her residency is assigned to school no.49.
She explained that her family lives only 5 streets away from School no.35 and her child would have
to pass over the mountain to get to school 49. However, the school still didn’t accept. Then, she
met with its principal who said that her child would be accepted for enrollment if she gave 50’000
tugrik as a donation to the school. This is very common.”
                                                        Female, fringe ger area in Chingeltei district

“Our residency is assigned to School no.72, which is further away to Belkh so it’s far. School no. 58 is
not assigned to our residency so I enrolled my child giving money for donation, as well. I gave 50’000
tugrik”

“Pre-school education is very problematic. There are only 2 kindergartens in our neighborhood,
which are not sufficient when we think of the number of pre-school age children. My child stayed
3 years at home. Actually children may enroll a kindergarten at age of 2 but they say that no seat
is available and come next year when you try to enroll your child. When you come next year, then
they say again - come next year, we don’t have seats available for your child. People stay in queue
overnight to enroll their children. A high school friend of mine works in the kindergarten, which is
assigned to my residency

     I learned from my other friends that they gave bribe of 100’000 tugrik to her & kindergarten principal
     to enroll their children though that kindergarten is not assigned to their residencies. So I called a TV
     channel and inspectors from Ministry of Education & Municipal Inspectorate. The Inspectors checked
     children’s documents. The class had 45 children, 23 of whom were from non-assigned residencies.
     That’s how I managed to enroll my children without giving any money at the age of 4.”

      Box 3.6: Street Lighting in Ulaanbaatar: The Case of Fragmentation in Service Delivery

  Ulaanbaatar’s street lighting service highlights the challenges of overlapping responsibilities across
  levels of government, and subsequently, fragmented and inadequate service provision. Under the
  legal mandate, both the City and the districts have responsibility over provision and maintenance of
  street lighting. The City contracts UB Netgel to provide the service in the central city area, while each
  district contracts out to a city-owned enterprise to provide coverage in their respective jurisdiction.
  Such overlapping mandates lead the City and district governments to each developing their own
  street lighting investment plans and procurement arrangements. In addition, the khoroo leaders are
  also charged with identifying equipment and maintenance needs, and must submit funding requests
  to the district or the city each year. As a result, the central city area now has seven different entities
  involved in street light provision, and the quality of lighting vary widely across districts. The lack of
  coordination between street light providers, as well as their uneven capacity and contractual agreement
  with the individual districts, reduces the quality of the service and equity in service provision.

  With services that often transcend district jurisdictions, optimal efficiency can be achieved from having
  a regional service provider to oversee the provision, and to ensure quality and adequate, timely and
  cost-effective maintenance. There are five key advantages to this arrangement. First, the installation
  and maintenance of streetlights can be consistently provided by a single entity across the network,
  allowing for potential cross-subsidy across districts. Second, the cost to the provider of a networked
  service in adding and maintaining an additional light declines as the network expands. Third, the needs
  assessment for future demand can be still based on inputs from the individual district governments.
  Fourth, if the service is provided by a single entity or agency, this would allow citizens to easily and
  directly report servicing and maintenance needs as it arises. Last but not least, given the above reasons,
  having one single entity for services like street lighting can enhance centralized performance reporting
  to the city leadership, as well as accountability and quality of services to its citizens.

                  Box 6.1: Building in Citizen Engagement: The Case of Johannesburg

     With a population of 4.9 million, Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and the capital of
     Gauteng, the country’s wealthiest province. Like UB, the city is located hundreds of miles inland,
     and is accessible only through road and rail connections.

     Despite a large population, Johannesburg built a municipal governance structure that emphasizes
     frequent, broad-based stakeholder consultation. The stakeholder engagement in Johannesburg is
     institutionalized and set the frequency of interface with stakeholder groups, from the residents and
     ratepayers at-large, vulnerable populations (such as the elderly, the disabled, youth and women),
     provincial government, neighboring municipalities, NGOs, and academics, business community, the
     media, and investors.

     This process aims to ensure the quality of service provision and timely feedback loops for
     service improvement that ranges from enforcement of law and order, quality of infrastructure
     development, availability of healthcare, and educational services, housing and recreation
     facilities, skills development for youth and caring for the elderly. It also specifies the method of
     engagement, whether it is through cluster community conversations, the establishment of technical
     working groups around a particular development or service challenge, and investor roadshows to
     communicate the city’s plans and crowd-source ideas and solutions from the stakeholders.

                                               Toward Inclusive Urban Service Delivery in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia




      Box 6.2: The Calgary Model for Municipal Services Planning and Citizen Engagement

  Calgary is a landlocked metropolitan city of sparse population of about 1.2 million people. Like
  Ulaanbaatar, Calgary has an oil and mining sector that has traditionally dominated the urban
  economy, contributing to 12 percent of its real GDP. Nonetheless, this ratio is decreasing as
  Calgary diversifies into a range of industries, such as agriculture, light manufacturing and retails,
  transportation, e-commerce, high-tech, and financial services. During times of high oil prices,
  Calgary has invested oil and mineral windfalls into key municipal infrastructure to support a well-
  diversified economy and a growing workforce.

  Further, the City’s model of inclusive planning has helped ensure that municipal services provided
  are aligned with citizens’ needs and priorities. Using a participatory approach, the City provides
  its residents with information about where city funds are used, thus linking service costs to service
  levels and outcomes, and better connecting long-term municipal development goals with short-term
  spending decisions.

  The City’s budgeting and planning process gathers direct inputs from its residents, city employees
  and civil service organizations through face-to-face sessions, workshops, direct online tools and
  social media channels. In 2011, the Annual Report showed that 23,000 people participated in
  the process. While this only represented two percent of the population, it led to the creation of a
  community investment fund to support new municipal projects and upgrade public infrastructure.
  The new investments were based on residents’ demand and therefore received strong constituents’
  support.

  The feedback from the residents also allowed the city government to further identify red tape and
  reduce bureaucratic delays in accessing services. This response was reflected in the 2011 Annual
  Citizen Satisfaction survey, which showed that 92 percent of Calgarians gave the city a positive
  overall performance rating, 80 percent rated “consistently high quality of service;” and 86 percent
  believed it was on the “right track to becoming a better city.”

          Box 6.3: Citizen Report Cards to Evaluate Quality of Services: Bangalore, India

  In 1993 (and later in 1999) with the help of the World Bank, the city of Bangalore developed a set of
  “citizen report cards” through which residents evaluated the quality of public services they received.
  The report cards provided a quantitative basis for assessing resident satisfaction, experiences of
  corruption. The findings also provided policymakers information about the performance of service
  providers in different sectors, which allowed them ore assurance in renewing or discontinuing
  contracts with providers.

  The report cards were developed with the assistance of NGOs and a market research firm. A
  representative sample of city residents were asked to rate their level of satisfaction with different
  municipal services on a seven point scale. Respondents were also asked questions about staff
  behavior, number of visits required and the resolution of problems. The results were presented
  to the providers of key services including the city, the telephone company and power and water
  utility companies. The exercise was repeated five years later and found moderate improvements in
  satisfaction with the service providers.

  The approach also led to substantive changes in service delivery. In part from public visibility and
  pressure from media and civil society organizations, poorly rated providers, such as the Karnataka
  Electricity Board formalized a series of public dialogues with resident associations to improve
  feedback and address grievances. The Bangalore Municipal Corporation partnered with local NGOs
  to develop a strategy to improve waste management. Similar report card approaches have been
  undertaken in other Indian cities as well as in Ukraine, the Philippines and Washington, DC.

        Box 6.4: Deliberative Polling for Investment Planning: The Case of Poznán, Poland

  UB’s recent experience with deliberative polling could provide guidance for mainstreaming this tool
  into planning and decision making as occurred for a city in Poland. Poznán’s approach to public
  investment planning stemmed from an exercise to determine what to do with an outdated sports
  stadium facility in 2009. Citizens were invited to participate in a poll asking them to identify what
  the facility should be used for and an operation and financing model for it.

  Two years later, the city leadership scaled up the consultation process to address the city budget.
  This consisted of three stages, first a series of consultations with city employees and executive
  leadership. Following this, a telephone survey of the perception of 800 residents on key city
  development goals and initiatives provided useful feedback on the extent of interest and support for
  what the leadership had initially proposed. The third phase consisted of in-depth citizen debates with
  participants drawn from the phone survey along with consultations with local NGOs. This approach
  provided two principal benefits; first, it gave policymakers feedback to better structure and sequence
  budget priorities and second it gave the budgeting process legitimacy because the discussions and
  consultations were widely publicized in local media outlets.
