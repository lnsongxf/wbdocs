Abstract

This report provides an overview of the progress made in 2017 in imple-
menting the Africa Climate Business Plan (ACBP), a blueprint for climate
action in Sub-Saharan Africa that the World Bank launched during the 21st
meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Paris in
November 2015.
  Since the launch of the ACBP at COP21in November 2015, significant
progress has been made:
••   The World Bank has worked with client countries, development partners,
     and the private sector to flesh out the ACBP’s program of work.
••   As of June 30, 2017, the number of projects contributing to the ACBP
     reached 204, a net increase of 57 over 2016.
••   The World Bank’s Board had approved $8.8 billion for 107 projects by
     June 30, 2017.
••   The implementation of projects started generating concrete results and
     outcomes.
   This report provides an update on resource mobilization, describes the cli-
mate co-benefits provided by the ACBP portfolio, and details implementation
progress by ACBP cluster and component. In addition, to better measure and
monitor results and inform future project design, it reports on two new pieces
of analysis undertaken this year: a review of the ACBP contribution to imple-
mentation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of Sub-
Sharan Africa’s countries; and a review of the ACBP portfolio from the
perspective of its contribution to resilience building (following the resilience
pathways approach).



Context and Scope of This Update
The Paris Agreement entered into force on November 4, 2016. As of October
31, 2017, 169 parties had ratified it, marking the first time governments agreed
to an overarching framework to combat climate change. Countries and
observers around the world hailed the passage of the accord—the fruit of
more than two decades of often tortuous international negotiations on com-
bating climate change.
   Forty-eight countries in Sub-Saharan Africa communicated their post-
2020 climate commitments and priority areas through their (I)NDCs, demon-
strating their resolve to address climate change. Their commitment is critical,
because resilience to climate variability and change is vital to the region’s abil-
ity to reduce poverty and protect the hard-earned development progress
made in recent decades.

   Indeed, climate drivers are involved in most of the shocks that keep or push
African households into poverty. The funding needed to address climate
change, particularly adaptation, in the region is massive, and it will increase
as climate change unfolds in the coming years. According to the World Bank
Group Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), more than 60 percent of coun-
tries in Africa have estimated and reported adaptation financing—more than
twice the share in other regions—suggesting national policy makers’ recogni-
tion of the urgency of adaptation action.
   The ACBP aims to build a pipeline of innovative and transformational proj-
ects to tackle climate change across sectors and establish a platform to mobi-
lize investments, thereby contributing to filling the climate financing gap in
the region. Including the transport component, which was added after the
Paris launch, the plan’s goal is to raise $19.3 billion by 2020, for investments
that will strengthen, power, and enable resilience in the region.
   The plan focuses on more than a dozen priority areas, clustered in three
groups (Table 1). The first cluster (strengthening resilience) includes selected
initiatives aimed at boosting the resilience of the region’s assets, including its
natural capital (agricultural land, landscapes, forests, inland bodies of water,
and oceans); physical capital (cities, physical assets in coastal areas, and
roads); and human and social capital. The second cluster (powering resil-
ience) relates to opportunities for scaling up low-carbon energy sources in
Sub-Saharan Africa, thereby contributing to increasing access to energy (a
key ingredient for resilience) and mitigating climate change. The third cluster
(enabling resilience) provides data, information, and decision-making tools
for promoting climate-resilient development across sectors, by strengthening
the region’s hydro-meteorological systems at the regional and country levels
and building the capacity to plan and design climate-resilient investments.

Progress in Mobilizing Resources

Significant progress was made in implementing the ACBP in 2017 (Table 2):
••   In the first semester of 2017, the World Bank’s Board approved 54 new
     investment operations contributing to ACBP implementation, with total
     commitments of $4.46 billion. This raised the cumulative number of
     approved operations under the ACBP to 107, totaling $8.8 billion in
     commitments.
••   Considering projects currently in the pipeline, the total number of proj-
     ects contributing to ACBP implementation is now estimated to be 204
     (Figure 1) a net increase of 57 (39 percent) over the figure estimated in
     the 2016 progress report
••   Cumulative commitments of projects contributing to ACBP (including
     projects already approved and pipeline) are now estimated to be $22 bil-
     lion, a 69 percent increase compared to the previous estimate of $13 bil-
     lion contained in the 2016 progress report

                          The World Bank tracks the climate mitigation and adaptation co-benefits of
                       all the projects it finances through the International Development Association
                       (IDA) or International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). It
                       is committed to increasing the share of IDA and IBRD financing with climate
                       co-benefits to 28 percent by 2020.
                          Analysis of the 163 ACBP projects for which data were available shows that
                       financing with climate co-benefits has increased (Table 3). The remaining 41
                       projects out of the 204 ACBP projects could not be assessed, because the early
                       stage nature of project preparation meant that insufficient detail was available
                       on them.
                          Funding with climate co-benefits has already exceeded the ACBP target for
                       FY17 and, at the current pace, the target established in the plan for the end of
                       2018 is also expected to be exceeded (see Box 1 for background information
                       on the ACBP fund raising targets). In particular, the ACBP target for June 30,




   BOX 1  Fundraising Targets of the ACBP
   The ACBP is expected to mobilize $19.25 billion by 2020, including $8.48 billion in World Bank
   funding. According to the results framework included in the original plan, one indicator of the
   plan’s financial performance is the share of resources mobilized at various stages of implemen-
   tation. The targets are for 25 percent of funding to be mobilized by June 2017 (end of the IDA17
   cycle), 50 percent by December 2018 (mid-term of the IDA18 cycle), and 75 percent by June 2020
   (end of IDA18). Applied to the World Bank’s share of the financing plan, these shares yield targets
   of $2.11, $4.22, and $6.33 billion, respectively.

 2017 was to mobilize 25% of the total World Bank contribution to the plan (or
 $2.11 billion). Funding with climate co-benefits for projects approved by that
 date actually reached $2.82 billion. The ACBP target for December 31, 2018 is
 50% of the total World Bank contribution (i.e., $4.22 billion); the amount of
 actual financing with climate co-benefits for that date is predicted to be $5.04
 billion (Figure 2). The target for the end of ACBP resource mobilization time
 horizon (June 30, 2020) is 75% of the total Bank’s contribution to the plan, or
 $6.33 billion. While estimates of funding with climate co-benefits for that date
 are not yet available, it is likely that so long as the current trend continues, the
 target will be met or exceeded.
    The ACBP is also expected to have catalytic and leveraging effect on climate
 finance for Africa beyond the activities included in the plan, which do not
 encompass the universe of development activities with climate co-benefits. In
 particular, the plan could help promote the uptake of initiatives beyond the
 sectors or geographical areas included in the plan, through positive spill-over
 or imitation effects.
    Accordingly, the second indicator of resource mobilization included in the
 original plan is the share of total World Bank financing to Sub-Saharan Africa
 with climate co-benefits (i.e., including all projects, not just those contribut-
 ing to ACBP implementation).
    The target is to increase this share from a baseline of 17 percent (the average
 across all sectors for FY11–FY15) to 22 percent over the period FY16–FY20.
 The share of financing for climate co-benefits for the ACBP projects has been
 growing steadily since 2016 (Figure 3) and reached 32% as of June 2017. The
 ACBP projects account for a large share (about 45%) of the Bank’s overall

financing to Sub-Saharan Africa; this is helping to increase the climate
co-benefits of the whole World Bank portfolio in Sub-Saharan Africa, includ-
ing IBRD and IDA, given also a growth in climate co-benefits associated to
non-ACBP projects. The share of climate co-benefits in cumulative overall
Bank financing to Sub-Saharan Africa over the period January 2016–June
2017 was 18.1%, an improvement over the historical average (FY11–FY15) of
17% and a step forward towards meeting the 22% target envisaged over the
period FY16–FY20. For FY17 alone, the share of climate co-benefits in total
IDA and IBRD lending for Sub-Saharan Africa was 25%.



Progress by Cluster of the ACBP
Since the launch of the ACBP, in December 2015, progress has been made
across all three clusters of the plan (strengthening, powering, and enabling
resilience; Table 4). The bulk of the effort is the strengthening resilience cluster,
in particular projects that help build the resilience of natural and physical cap-
ital. Projects in this cluster contribute more than 70 percent ($3.6 billion out of
$5 billion) of the total climate co-benefits generated by the ACBP portfolio.
   Within the strengthening resilience cluster, the climate-smart agriculture
and transport components account for the bulk of the resources ($1.37 bil-
lion and $1.21 billion, respectively) (Table 5). The shares of projects with cli-
mate co-benefits are largest for the components on building costal resilience
(83 percent), the Niger Basin (82 percent), and climate-resilient landscape
(73 percent).

   The ACBP finances projects in the strengthening resilience cluster in 36
countries. In 24 of them, the plan supports interventions in support of more
than one form of capital (natural, physical, and human/social) (Map 1).
   The powering and enabling resilience clusters are currently being imple-
mented in seventeen countries in the region (Map 2).
   The renewable energy components account for about $3 billion in total
commitments (Table 6). The share of financing with climate co-benefit ratios
is 81 percent for geothermal, 61 percent for solar, and 49 percent for hydro-
power—above the average for the ACBP as a whole.



ACBP Contribution to NDC Implementation
As of October 30, 2017, 169 parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change had ratified the Paris Agreement, thereby
formalizing their commitment to pursue the goal of the agreement through
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In Sub-Sharan Africa, 48

countries have communicated their post-2020 climate commitments and pri-
ority areas through (I)NDCs. As one of the most vulnerable regions to climate
change impacts, Sub-Saharan Africa has shown remarkable ambition in set-
ting up its NDC commitments, particularly in adaptation.
   To assess the extent to which the ACBP provides support to NDC imple-
mentation and to identify opportunities for further assistance, this progress
report reviewed the development objective and components of every ACBP
project; assessed whether they align with one or more NDC sectoral and
sub-sectoral commitment (policies, targets, plans, actions) at the country and
regional level; and determined whether the project directly contributes to
NDC implementation. The analysis covers all 38 countries in which ACBP
projects are being implemented. It does not include Botswana, Eritrea,
Equatorial Guinea, Mauritius, Namibia, Somalia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe,
where no ACBP projects have yet been launched.
   In any given country, ACBP projects are considered to contribute to NDCs if
their development objectives correspond to priority areas identified in that
country’s NDCs. As of October 2017, 163 of 204 ACBP projects (80 percent)
met this criterion. Commitments for these projects totaled $18.3 billion—83

     Figure 5 summaries ACBP project contributions to NDCs in the following
  sectors: agriculture; cross-cutting areas (capacity building and knowledge
  transfer, disaster risk management, and climate services); energy; the envi-
  ronment; land use; land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); social develop-
  ment; transport; urban; and water. It shows that the ACBP portfolio contributes
  to a significant percentage of Sub-Sahara African countries’ NDC implemen-
  tation efforts in the following sectors: transport agriculture, cross-cutting
  areas, energy, social development, LULUCF, and the environment.
     The ACBP portfolio supports NDC commitments in the transport sector in
  90 percent of countries. It supports NDC commitments in agriculture in
  more than 80 percent of countries. It contributes to NDC sectoral commit-
  ments in cross-cutting areas and energy in more than half of the countries in
  which it has projects (57 percent in cross-cutting areas, 53 percent in energy).
     At the subsector level, the ACBP portfolio makes important contributions
  (Figure 6) to NDC implementation and targets related to development of
  infrastructure and roads (ACBP presence in 20 countries, i.e. 91 percent of all
  countries identifying the subsector as an NCD priority), climate-smart agri-
  culture practices (22 countries or 85 percent of all countries), establishment
  of social safety nets (9 countries or 75 percent of the total), enhanced capacity
  building and knowledge transfer (16 countries or 73 percent), sustainable
  land management practices (11 countries or 69 percent of the total ), and
  deployment of solar power initiatives (18 countries or 55 percent).

                                              tation of NDC commitments in Sub-Saharan Africa, and there is significant
                                              potential for enhancing efforts to scale up NDC implementation at both the
                                              country and regional level.
                                                 Current and upcoming ACBP projects will continue to make explicit link-
                                              ages to NDC sectoral/subsectoral priorities at critical stages of the project
                                              planning and design process. New projects will take into consideration coun-
                                              try-specific NDC implementation support needs, including the need to estab-
                                              lish an institutional framework and coordination mechanism; develop
                                              Measuring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) systems; craft NDC imple-
                                              mentation and investment plans; and mobilize climate finance.

implementation.
  The NDCP-SF is financing seven projects (at a total cost of $2.4 million) in
Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe.
Through the Invest4Climate, the World Bank Group will partner with the UN
development system in jointly convening the platform, bringing together key
decision makers in countries and various kinds of financial institutions,
including other multilateral development banks, the Global Climate Fund,
Development Finance Institutions, the private sector, and other relevant stake-
holders to identify and implement potential transformational investments.



Resilience Outcomes: Insights After Two Years
of Implementation
To determine how well the ACBP is contributing to resilience building, this
report examines the integration of resilience considerations in the results
frameworks of its projects. The analysis used the framework developed
through the World Bank Resilience Monitoring & Evaluation (ReM&E) proj-
ect to assess how much projects contribute to developing the following three
types of capacities (Box 3):
••    absorptive capacity: the ability to survive climate shocks;
••    adaptive capacity: the ability to adjust in anticipation of climate shocks,
      without radically changing livelihood systems;
••    transformative capacity: the ability to prevent the impact of climate
      shocks through major transformation of livelihood systems.
   For each ACBP component, the analysis identified and reviewed the Board-
approved projects that provided the top 70 percent of climate change co-ben-
efits. The resulting sample of 27 projects accounts for 44 percent of the ACBP
portfolio’s co-benefits and 13 percent of its total financing.
   The analysis finds that about two-thirds of the results indicators of these
projects are intended to augment resilience to climate and disaster risks. The
remaining third are intended to deliver economic, social, and environmental
benefits that are not directly linked to climate resilience (although they may
contribute to strengthen it indirectly). About half (52 percent) of the

BOX 3  Three Types of Capacity Required for Resilience
Absorptive capacity: The ability of people, assets, and systems to prepare for, mitigate, or prevent
negative impacts of hazards so as to preserve and restore essential basic structures and func-
tions, e.g., strengthening the walls of grain storage sheds, to enable them to withstand inclement
weather, such as high winds and rain.

Adaptive capacity: The ability of people, assets, and systems to adjust, modify or change char-
acteristics and actions to moderate potential future impacts from hazards so as to continue to
function without major qualitative changes e.g., establishing an irrigation system for farmers pre-
viously dependent on invariable rainfall to water their crops.

Transformative capacity: The ability to create a fundamentally new system so as to avoid nega-
tive impacts from hazards e.g., shifting from agriculture to another means of income such as live-
stock herding, given the chronic climate and disaster risk and stress the current system is facing.




               resilience-relevant indicators aim to capture results that build adaptive capac-
               ity, 34 percent capture the building of absorptive capacity, and 14 percent cor-
               respond to building transformative capacity (Figure 7).
                  The fact that developing adaptive capacity accounts for more than half of
               resilient development outcomes suggests that projects are incorporating
               changes in their systems to adjust to, better manage, anticipate, and/or miti-
               gate potential future impacts of climate and disaster risks—through diversifi-
               cation of livelihood opportunities, enhancement of agricultural productivity,
               and increased access to, and sustainable management of, productive resources,
               for example. Box 4 describes how three ACBP projects are increasing the
               stocks of various forms of capital to build resilience to climate change.
                  The ACBP portfolio focuses on building natural capital (44 percent of
               resilience-relevant results indicators) and human and social capital (30

  1. Absorptive Capacity
  Tanzania Strategic Cities Project (additional financing): People with access to improved bus sta-
  tions & terminals

  The Tanzania Strategic Cities AF II-SUF project rehabilitated, upgraded, and constructed roads,
  sidewalks, footbridges, bus/lorry stands/terminals, streetlights, storm water drains, public parks,
  sanitary landfills and other urban infrastructure facilities. The upgraded transport infrastruc-
  ture with climate-resilient design features enhances robustness and absorptive capacity to with-
  stand floods and strengthens infrastructure and physical resilience through asset vulnerability
  reduction.

  3. Transformative Capacity
  Kenya Electricity Expansion Project, additional financing: New slum consumers connected to
  the grid

  The AF Kenya Electricity Expansion Project builds transformative capacity by providing income
  security though first-time electricity access for slum dwellings. Electricity provision diversifies
  their sources of income through postharvest value addition activities and accessing alternative
  livelihood streams in other sectors that contribute to social and financial resilience by developing
  human and social capital.

 percent), which together account for three-fourths of the resilience-relevant
 results indicators in the ACBP portfolio (Figure 8). Activities that build these
 forms of capital contribute to developing adaptive capacity and absorptive
 capacity.
    A mix of all three capacities is often needed to deliver resilient development
 outcomes. The weights in the mix depends on the system’s needs and the cli-
 mate change impact that requires increased resilience. Absorptive capacity
 plays an important role when maintaining current system structures is desir-
 able but those structures need strengthening in order to improve the system’s
 ability to bounce back. Adaptive capacity builds flexibility and enhances the
 system’s ability to change in order to prepare for the future. Transformative
 capacity is often needed when the current situation is untenable and a signif-
 icant shift in the system is required to decrease vulnerability in a lasting
 manner.
    Interventions to increase absorptive and adaptive capacity are often the first
 and quickest way to increase the climate resilience of individuals, communi-
 ties, and countries. Over the longer term, transformative capacity needs to be
 built, in order to ensure lasting resilience to the more frequent or severe cli-
 mate shocks of the future.
    This points to a possible area of focus for the final years of ACBP imple-
 mentation, i.e. a identifying opportunities to build more transformative
 capacity. Future projects may combine support to adaptive and absorptive
 capacity–building activities (through, for example, expansion of alternative
 livelihood opportunities and innovation in climate-resilient tools and tech-
 nologies) with support that helps build transformative capacity (through, for
 example, promotion of system shifts that help increase food security). No

Component            Progress
Strengthening resilience
Natural capital
Climate-smart        •	 In 2017 the Board approved $1.27 billion (including $8 million from the Global
agriculture             Environment Facility) in commitments for 25 projects supporting climate-smart
                        agriculture. These projects aim to improve the livelihoods of about 1.28 million farmers
                        and increase the climate resilience and productivity of about 3.4 million hectares of land.
                     •	 The Bank continued to support advocacy of climate-smart agriculture and to
                        disseminate knowledge and best practices in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the past year, it
                        hosted an event on CSA Success Stories at COP22, supported the development of
                        the initiative “Adaptation of African Agriculture to Climate Change” (AAA), built country
                        capacity to implement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and developed
                        country-led Climate Smart Strategies and Investment Plans (CSIPs). It also made
                        progress in establishing a Climate-Smart Livestock (CSL) Center in Africa, through a
                        joint World Bank Group–German initiative.
Forested             •	 As of September 2017, and as part of the implementation of its Forest Action Plan, the
landscapes              Bank has allocated through the Forest Trust Funds more than $128 million to 15 African
                        countries for upstream technical assistance to forest development efforts and REDD+,
                        including support to relevant aspects of their NDCs.
                     •	 Nine countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are preparing large-scale programs that aim to
                        enhance the contribution of forest landscapes to growth and poverty alleviation. The
                        Forest Trust Funds are providing up to $450 million in results-based payments while
                        leveraging funds from other sources, such as the Global Environment Facility, IDA,
                        governments, and the private sector.
                     •	 As of September 2017, the Bank had allocated more than $200 million from the Central
                        African Forest Initiative (CAFI) to four countries (Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
                        the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo), for the development
                        and implementation of national investment frameworks for REDD+, with the World Bank
                        as an implementing partner.
Climate-resilient    •	 Most of the projects originally identified under this ACBP component are either under
landscapes              implementation or at the advanced preparation stage. Projects are being, or will be
                        implemented in Burundi, Ghana, Madagascar, and Mozambique.
                     •	 New operations are at an early preparation stage in eight countries, with support from
                        the TerrAfrica program.
Niger Basin          •	 The Bank, the riparian countries, and the Niger Basin Authority identified a priority set of
                        123 interventions based on the initial Climate Resilience Investment Plan (CRIP) for the
                        Niger Basin presented at COP21. Of an estimated total cost of the CRIP of $3.1 billion,
                        $1.9 billion is being mobilized to support priority interventions.
                     •	 The World Bank and the African Development Bank are finalizing preparation of
                        investment projects that will support key components of the CRIP.
Lake Victoria        •	 The Nordic Development Fund has provisionally approved a grant for expansion of the
Basin                   Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production program (RECP), a small but very successful
                        component of the Lake Victoria Environment Management Program that has leveraged
                        more than $80 million in private sector investments in improved environmental practices.
                     •	 Protection of ecological infrastructure (forests, riparian buffers, wetlands) under the
                        existing program has generated success stories and local appreciation of the benefits
                        of environmental rehabilitation. Nearly 950 of a target of 1,450 hectares had been
                        rehabilitated for protection by mid-2017.
Climate-smart        •	 The Board approved four projects with regional or national scope in FY17, allocating
ocean economies         funding of more than $67 million. Nine more projects are expected to be approved
                        in FY18 and FY19, for an additional $517 million, including additional support at the
                        regional level and to countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Kenya, and Tanzania.
                     •	 These projects build on technical assistance provided by the Bank to regional
                        commissions in charge of fisheries, to develop regionally coordinated investment plans
                        for climate-resilient fisheries and coastal livelihoods.
                                                                                                table continues next page

Physical capital
Climate-smart        •	 The Bank supported the completion of resilience planning in 20 cities: 11 regional
cities                  capitals of Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Antananarivo, Madagascar; Dakar, Senegal; Dar Es
                        Salaam, Tanzania; Ibadan, Nigeria; Maputo, Mozambique; and cities in the Democratic
                        Republic of Congo, Niger, and Sierra Leone.
                     •	 A total of $1.4 billion investment is expected to be mobilized during FY18/19. Funding
                        includes $560 million to support climate- and disaster-resilient development in 5 large
                        Sub-Saharan African cities and $900 million for 2 large metropolitan areas of the
                        Democratic Republic of Congo Ghana and 117 secondary and tertiary cities in Ethiopia.
Coastal resilience   •	 The Bank is finalizing a $200 million investment project that responds to multisector
(West Africa)           investment plans prepared over the past year in five countries (Benin, Côte d’Ivoire,
                        Mauritania, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Togo) to combat coastal erosion and flooding.
                     •	 The Bank developed a framework for the voluntary relocation of people whose lives and
                        livelihoods are in danger as a result of climate change.
Climate-resilient    •	 The Board approved three projects with total financing of $112 million. Preparation is
transport               under way for additional projects in 11 countries and projects with regional scope.
                     •	 The Bank is scaling up efforts to further define and implement methodologies for
                        integrating climate resilience into transport projects. It published a regional report
                        (Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure: The Road and Bridges
                        Sectors) and mobilized grant funding from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
                        and Recovery (GFDRR) to operationalize the methodology described in the report as a
                        second phase of the Africa Road Resilience Study, which will begin to roll out climate
                        vulnerability assessments at the country level.
Human and social
capital
Social protection    •	 The Board approved or is in the process of approving 16 social protection projects that
                        directly contribute to the ACBP. The value of these projects is about $1.83 billion.
                     •	 Six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa channeled funding from the World Bank’s Crisis
                        Response Window through national safety net programs to respond to the effects of the
                        2015–16 El Niño drought.
Migration drivers    •	 The Bank increased its support to address the impacts of forced displacement and
                        migration. In April 2017, it approved the Development Response to Displacement Impacts
                        Project (DRDIP) for Kenya ($103 million). In July it approved the Great Lakes Region
                        Displaced Persons and Border Communities Project Additional Financing ($3 million).
                     •	 The ongoing efforts on planned voluntary relocation being undertaking in São Tomé
                        and Príncipe are providing critical lessons for other communities and countries. These
                        lessons are informing the development of a framework—being developed as part of the
                        West Africa and Coastal Areas (WACA) Resilience Investment Project—to ensure that
                        voluntary relocation is a pro-poor, people-centered process in which communities drive
                        the decision making.
                                                                                           table continues next page

Component              Progress
Powering resilience
Solar power            •	 As of September 2017, the Bank had approved projects that spur the use of solar power
                          in the region for a total $620 million of IDA resources.
                       •	 The Bank’s engagement includes 10 projects to scale solar energy supply through off-
                          grid and mini-grid solutions in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Niger,
                          Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia; 2 guarantee packages to leverage private investments
                          in solar generation in Mali and Zambia; and investment in utility-scale solar plant and
                          network strengthening in Burkina Faso.
Hydropower             •	 The Bank approved nine projects that help increase the use of hydropower in the region
                          in FY16 and FY17, for a total $776 million of IDA resources.
                       •	 The Bank supported the commissioning of the Lom Pangar dam in Cameroon in mid-
                          2017. It will add 30 MW of power and unlock the hydropower potential of the Sanaga
                          River; the Rusumo Fall hydropower scheme (80 MW), shared by Burundi, Rwanda, and
                          Tanzania; and the Jiji and Mulembwe schemes (48 MW), in Burundi.
Geothermal             •	 The Bank approved $71 million of additional financing to complete the development of
power                     the Olkaria I & IV plants in Kenya, with total capacity of 280 MW.
                       •	 The Bank is providing technical assistance to help develop the geothermal sector in
                          Kenya.
Enabling resilience
Africa Hydromet        •	 The Bank mobilized $17 million in IDA funding in FY17 to support the strengthening
Program                   of hydromet systems in Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, and
                          Niger. The IDA funds will complement $60 million from other sources, including the
                          Green Climate Fund, the Climate Risk Early Warning Systems (CREWS), the Global
                          Environment Facility, and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery
                          (GFDRR).
                       •	 Additional hydromet modernization operations are under preparation in Chad, Ethiopia,
                          and Togo.
Africa Climate         •	 The Bank mobilized €5 million from the Nordic Development Fund as seed funds to
