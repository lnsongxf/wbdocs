About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      requested. The SEA takes about 6 weeks on average for the review. For
      category 3 cases, the SEA might even request to put the plans up for public
      review, meaning the plans must be advertised in the local newspaper. The
      noti cation must be advertised for 3 weeks and then another 3 weeks are

      The Conveyancer conducts a deeds search at the Registrar of Deeds to check
      that there no interdicts or encumbrances on the property, which is part of
      the preparation of the deed of sale. They ask for a deed copy when they do
      the search and which would have been revised to re ect the mortgage.

      This Procedure is related to the municipal land rate that the new owner will
      have to pay annually on his property (property tax). Before transferring the
      land, the buyer needs to have cleared all his property related tax debt with

       The conveyancer normally prepares a power of attorney to act on behalf of
       the companies at this time.

       submitted to the registrar of deeds. The registrar checks the deed several
       times (within one submission) and suggests corrections. The checks are
       done by di erent people. In case the buyer (seller) is a company, then the
       company resolution to buy (sell) must also be presented at the registrar. The
       company resolution is normally drafted by an attorney. The conveyancer
       sends the deed back with the errors corrected. It takes one day to do the
       corrections and once the deed of transfer is submitted again the signing of
       the document is done within 2 days time.

       The deed of transfer is signed in front of the registrar. Normally the
       conveyancer uses power of attorney to sign for the seller. The power of
       attorney is prepared at the same time as the deed of transfer. The
       conveyancer will need to endorse a guarantee which is usually issued with
       the instructions to register a mortgage bond in favour of the bank. This
       endorsement happens once the transfer and bond documents are executed
       before the Registrara of Deeds. The bank will want a mortgage bond
       assigned to the property at the same time. (Although this does not apply to
       our case because there will be no bank loan).



       It used to take a long time for the title deed to be delivered: 3 or 4 weeks.
       However, the deed registry has now greatly improved the time to process
       the registering of the title deed. At the time of the signing the buyer gets a
       “for information only” copy to be able to obtain loans on the property. This
       copy is accepted everywhere. For instance banks accept it for loans. The nal
       title deed must be collected by the conveyancer and signs for it. It is not sent
       by mail. The conveyancer will then give the title deed to the buyer, who will
       usually deposit at the bank for safe-keeping.

       Sales tax on property sale must be paid if the transfer is between companies,
       but no one complies with this rule. The registrar does not check if this tax is
                                                                                                                   Page 27

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                        liquidator who will finalize creditors' claims and execute the liquidation.

Outcome              piecemeal sale     The hotel will stop operating and Mirage's assets will be sold piecemeal after the sheriff
                                        conducts a piecemeal sale of Mirage's assets at a public auction. A company can be saved
                                        only if there is a compromise with the creditors.

Time (in years)      2.0                A foreclosure procedure that is then converted into liquidation will approximately take 2
                                        years in total. Usually, BizBank would initiate foreclosure through filing at the High Court 2
                                        months after Mirage's default on payment. Then it takes at least another 2 months for the
                                        Court to review the application and hold a hearing during which other secured creditors
                                        would file the petition to stay the foreclosure and convert it into the collective liquidation
                                        proceeding. The case will then be converted into liquidation, taking the formal conversion
                                        and the organization and execution of the sale 1.5 additional years. The delay is largely due
                                        to the difficulty to finalize creditors' claims (at least 6 months) and the execution of auction
                                        (at least 6 months),

Cost (% of           14.5               The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 15% of the value of the
estate)                                 debtor's estate. The cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court
                                        fees (1%), attorney fees (around 3%), insolvency representative fees (around 3%), fees of
                                        accountants, assessors, inspectors and other professionals (around 2%), and fees of
                                        auctioneers (around 6%).
