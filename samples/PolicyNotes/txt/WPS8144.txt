 Trade growth has slowed sharply since the global finan-                            Compounding such compositional effects, arm’s-length

 trade—trade between unaffiliated firms—accounts dis-                               real exchange rates. For example, the income elasticity of

1       Introduction1
Global trade volume growth reached a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent in 2016—signiﬁcantly
below the pre-crisis average of 7.6 percent. Cyclical factors, such as weak global demand, low
commodity prices, and slower growth in China have all contributed to the trade deceleration.
In addition, structural factors have lowered trade’s responsiveness to global output expansion
(World Bank 2015a; Constantinescu, Mattoo, and Ruta 2015).

The maturing of global value chains is a key structural factor contributing to the recent
trade slowdown.2 Global value chains often involve numerous cross-border operations, con-
ducted either “intra-ﬁrm,” that is, between ﬁrms related through ownership or control, or
between unaﬃliated ﬁrms at “arm’s-length.” A ﬁrm’s decision between arm’s-length and
intra-ﬁrm transactions has its roots in the underlying motivation for vertical integration (or
lack thereof) and foreign direct investment. Firms choose to internalize transactions if the
cost of performing these through the market is higher than internal costs (Coase 1937). In
particular, contract enforcement imposes costs when contracts are incomplete (Williamson
1985; Grossman and Hart 1986). When contracts are incomplete and their enforcement is
costly, ﬁrms may prefer vertical integration and internal ownership of assets (Hart and Moore
1990; Antras 2015).3

In cross-border trade transactions, additional considerations come into play. Firms may favor
arm’s-length transactions when they seek access to export markets similar to their home
markets and when technology, knowledge, or resource transfers are not required (Dunning
and Lundan 2008; Lanz and Miroudot 2011). As a result, arm’s-length transactions are more
prevalent in low-skilled sectors and among less productive ﬁrms (Corcos et al. 2013).

In practice, multinationals employ intra-ﬁrm and arm’s-length transactions to varying de-
grees. In 2015, intra-ﬁrm transactions are estimated to have accounted for about one-third
of global exports (UNCTAD 2016). Vertically integrated multinational companies, such as

    The expansion of global value chains contributed signiﬁcantly to the rapid rise in trade growth during
1985-2000. However, during 2000-16, growth in value chains has stabilized (Haugh et al. 2016; Constanti-
nescu, Mattoo, and Ruta 2015).

    Incomplete contracts can result in underinvestment when ﬁrms undertake signiﬁcant relationship-speciﬁc
investments. Parties to a contract may underinvest in expectation of their counterpart not complying with
the terms of a contract. As suppliers often customize their products to ﬁt the needs of a speciﬁc buyer and
buyers undertake signiﬁcant investment speciﬁc to a particular supplier, such cost could be signiﬁcant.

Samsung Electronics, Nokia, and Intel, trade primarily intra-ﬁrm. Samsung, the world’s
biggest communications equipment multinational, has 158 subsidiaries across the world, in-
cluding 43 subsidiaries in Europe, 32 in China and 30 in North and South America (Samsung
2014). Other multinationals, such as Apple, Motorola, and Nike, rely mainly on outsourcing,
and hence on arm’s-length trade with non-aﬃliated suppliers (Lanz and Miroudot 2011).

Multinational companies and their aﬃliates accounted for one-tenth of global GDP and their
sales amounted to about half of global GDP in 2015 (UNCTAD 2016; Figure 1). The world’s
largest multinationals (Shell, Toyota, and General Electric in advanced economies; China
National Oﬀshore Oil, Vale SA, and Petronas in EMDEs) are systemically important in both
their home and host economies. Post-crisis, foreign aﬃliates of multinational companies
have fared better than their domestic counterparts and contributed more signiﬁcantly to the
recovery of global GDP. For example, during 2010-14, the value added of multinationals grew
faster-than-average, at 6.6 percent—well above global GDP growth of 4.4 percent.

Unfortunately, data on global intra-ﬁrm trade are not available. However, a unique dataset
on bilateral U.S. exports and imports can provide an indication of developments in intra-
ﬁrm trade growth. The United States plays an important role in global trade (Figure 2): it
accounts for about 11 percent of global goods trade and 23 percent of global foreign direct
investment (FDI) stocks. It is the largest export destination for one-ﬁfth of the world’s
countries and the largest import source for one-tenth. U.S. multinationals account for about
30 percent of the employment and sales of the world’s largest 100 non-ﬁnancial multinational
companies. Most of the post-crisis slowdown in U.S. trade growth can be attributed to the
sharp slowdown in arm’s-length rather than intra-ﬁrm trade. By 2014, intra-ﬁrm trade growth
had returned to near pre-crisis rates while arm’s-length trade growth has lagged signiﬁcantly
below elevated pre-crisis rates.

We show that compositional eﬀects combined with a higher income and real exchange rate
elasticity of arm’s-length trade contributed to the strong pre-crisis growth and the steep post-
crisis slowdown of arm’s-length trade compared to that of intra-ﬁrm trade. First, arm’s-length
trade depends more heavily than intra-ﬁrm trade on sectors with rapid pre-crisis growth that
boosted arm’s-length trade pre-crisis but that have languished post-crisis. Second, arm’s-
length trade is also more concentrated in emerging market and developing economies, where
output growth has slowed sharply from elevated pre-crisis rates.

These compositional eﬀects were compounded by a greater elasticity of arm’s-length trade
than intra-ﬁrm trade to demand and real exchange rate movements. Using an econometric
framework of the determinants of bilateral U.S. exports by sector, we show that arm’s-length
exports are more sensitive to changes in demand and real exchange rates than intra-ﬁrm

exports. The income elasticity of arm’s-length exports is about one-ﬁfth higher than that
of intra-ﬁrm exports. Similarly, the real exchange rate elasticity of arm’s-length exports is
one-tenth stronger. As a result, the post-crisis global growth weakness has weighed more on
arm’s-length than on intra-ﬁrm trade growth.

Several other factors may have also constrained trade among unaﬃliated ﬁrms. In particular,
unaﬃliated ﬁrms may have been hindered more than multinational ﬁrms by constrained
access to ﬁnance during the crisis, heightened policy uncertainty, and their typical ﬁrm-level
characteristics.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 examines the characteristics of U.S.
arm’s-length exports and imports focusing on sectoral and regional composition; Section 3
explores the evolution of pre- and post-crisis arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade ﬂows; Section 4
discusses the factors that contributed to the sharp post-crisis slowdown of arm’s-length trade;
Section 5 uses an econometric framework of the determinants of U.S. exports to demonstrate
diﬀerentials in the income and real exchange rate elasticity between arm’s-length and intra-
ﬁrm trade; and ﬁnally, Section 6 concludes.


2       Characteristics of arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade
Data. There is only one publicly available dataset on international intra-ﬁrm trade with
a com-prehensive set of partner economies. This unique U.S. trade dataset from the U.S.
Census Bureau uses customs declarations to distinguish arm’s-length trade from intra-ﬁrm
transactions.4 At the most detailed level, the data contain exports and imports at the 6-
digit North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS) level as well as information
on countries of origin and destination, covering annual bilateral trade ﬂows with 234 partner
economies for 2002-14. Similar data are unavailable at the global level; hence, the analysis
here relies on this U.S. trade dataset.

Deﬁnition of arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade. Intra-ﬁrm trade consists of cross-
border transactions between ﬁrms linked by a degree of control and ownership whereas arm’s-
length trade is deﬁned as cross-border transactions between unrelated ﬁrms. The U.S. Census
Bureau records transactions between related-parties. Related-party imports are deﬁned as
shipments between “any person directly or indirectly, owning, controlling or holding power to

    The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis collects similar data with a conﬁdential dataset on intra-ﬁrm
trade data based on ﬁrm surveys. The Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)
database on the Activities of Multinational Enterprises covers trade between OECD countries.

threshold for related-party exports is set at 10 percent (U.S. Census Bureau 2014). For
notational convenience, related-party and intra-ﬁrm trade are hereinafter interchangeably
referred to as intra-ﬁrm trade.5

Quantitative importance of arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade. Just over half (about
57 percent) of total U.S. trade is conducted at arm’s-length between unrelated ﬁrms. The
share of arm’s-length trade is much lower for U.S. imports (50 percent) than exports (70
percent), for U.S. trade in capital goods (50 percent) than ﬁnal goods (60 percent), and
for U.S. trade with advanced economies (51 percent) than with EMDEs (64 percent). In
general, a higher per capita income of a trading partner is associated with a lower share of
arm’s-length trade. The share of intra-ﬁrm trade of total U.S. trade has remained broadly
stable from 2002 until the global ﬁnancial crisis but subsequently increased, especially for
U.S. trade with EMDEs (Figure 3).

Country composition of arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm U.S. trade. Geographical prox-
imity and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) favor intra-ﬁrm transactions
with two of the United States’ largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. About half of
all U.S. exports to, and more than half of all U.S. imports from, Canada and Mexico are
intra-ﬁrm transactions. Canada is the single largest destination of U.S. intra-ﬁrm exports
(almost one-third of total U.S. intra-ﬁrm exports) and imports, followed by Mexico (about
one-ﬁfth of total U.S. intra-ﬁrm exports; Figure 4). More than half of U.S. imports from its
main non-NAFTA trading partners (with the exception of China and Italy) are also intra-
ﬁrm transactions. In contrast, U.S. exports to its main non-NAFTA trading partners are
predominantly arm’s-length—53-65 percent of U.S. exports to large European Union and
Asian countries (France, Germany, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, and United Kingdom; Figure
4) ﬁt this description.


3       Evolution of arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade since the
        crisis
Global trade growth has slowed sharply since the global ﬁnancial crisis, from an average of 7.6
percent during 2002-08 to an average of 4.3 percent during 2010-14. During the 2007-09 global
ﬁnancial crisis, global trade volumes contracted by 11 percent, as domestic demand dropped
and trade ﬁnance was curtailed (Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar 2010; Chor and Manova 2012).

    The two terms imply diﬀerent ownership shares. Intra-ﬁrm trade is deﬁned as trade between ﬁrms with
control and ownership shares of at least 50 percent.

The contribution of global value chains to propagating the negative eﬀects of the global
ﬁnancial crisis remains unsettled.6

The U.S. trade data highlight that arm’s-length trade accounted disproportionately for the
overall post-crisis trade slowdown. This reﬂected a higher pre-crisis average and a weaker
post-crisis rebound in arm’s-length trade growth compared with intra-ﬁrm trade. During the
crisis itself, the U.S. data suggest a broad-based trade collapse in which intra-ﬁrm and arm’s-
length trade contracted to similar degrees. By 2014, intra-ﬁrm trade growth had returned
close to its pre-crisis average (4.3 percent of exports and 5.0 percent for imports). In contrast,
arm’s-length trade growth remained signiﬁcantly below its high pre-crisis average: its growth
slowed to a post-crisis annual average of 4.7 percent compared to 11.3 percent during 2002-08
(Figure 1).


4       Factors contributing to the sharp post-crisis slowdown
        in arm’s-length trade
On average, arm’s-length U.S. trade growth exceeded U.S. intra-ﬁrm trade growth by 1.6
percentage point pre-crisis (2002-08), but fell short of U.S. intra-ﬁrm trade growth by 1.7
percentage point post-crisis (2010-14). This sharp slowdown in arm’s-length trade reﬂected in
part compositional eﬀects in response to global macro-economic trends. In addition, several
other factors may have disadvantaged ﬁrms trading at arm’s-length, raised the cost of arm’s-
length transactions, and hence discouraged arm’s-length trade.

Compositional eﬀects. First, a greater share of arm’s-length exports than intra-ﬁrm ex-
ports is shipped to EMDEs, especially BRICS economies. Just as the rapid pre-crisis growth
in EMDEs lifted arm’s-length export growth, their sharp post-crisis growth slowdown damp-
ened it (Figure 6; Didier et al. 2016). Second, arm’s-length exports and imports include a
greater share of sectors that grew rapidly pre-crisis but have struggled post-crisis (textiles
and apparel and machinery) or sectors that beneﬁted from the pre-crisis commodity price
boom (mining, metals, and energy; Figure 5). The collapse in metals and energy prices from
their peak in the ﬁrst quarter of 2011 has weighed on trade (World Bank 2015a and 2015b;
Baﬀes et al. 2015). These compositional diﬀerences are the main reason behind the steeper-
than-average slowdown in arm’s-length trade growth. Had the composition of arm’s-length

    Global production chains may have facilitated the transmission of output contractions across the global
economy through intra-ﬁrm contagion (Bems, Johnson, and Yi 2009). Conversely, they may have strength-
ened the resilience of trade by facilitating better access to ﬁnance or due to the stability of long-established
contractual relationships in supply chains (Altomonte and Ottaviano 2009; Bernard et al. 2009).

Note: U.S. exports and imports of goods, averages for 2002-14. Agricultural products, paper products,
printing, non-metallic minerals, furniture, and miscellaneous manufactures have been omitted as they each
account for less than 2 percent of total trade. Food and bev includes food and beverages. Textiles and app
include textiles and apparel. Chemicals include chemicals and plastics. Electronics includes electronics and
electrical equipment.
A.-C. Residual to 100 percent is the share of all other sectors in exports (A), imports (B), and trade (C).
D. Residual to 100 percent is the share of arm’s-length transactions in U.S. exports and imports in each
sector.
trade matched that of average exports and imports, arm’s-length export and import growth
would have slowed by 1.2 and 1.8 percentage points less, respectively, between the pre-crisis
and post-crisis periods (Figure 6).7

Other contributing factors. Other factors may have further contributed to the post-crisis
weakness in arm’s-length trade.8

       • Reduced access to ﬁnance for unaﬃliated ﬁrms. Tightening lending conditions
         during and after the global ﬁnancial crisis restricted access to trade credit and other
         forms of ﬁnancing (Chor and Manova 2012). This may have disproportionately aﬀected
         transactions between non-aﬃliated parties (Desai, Foley, and Hines 2004; Alvarez and
         Görg 2012).

       • Disadvantages due to size and productivity. Vertically integrated ﬁrms tend to
         be larger, more productive, and more skill- and capital-intensive (Corcos et al. 2013).
         More eﬃcient management of stocks also helps vertically integrated ﬁrms adjust to
         large demand shocks, such as the global ﬁnancial crisis (Altomonte et al. 2011). Such
         factors may account for the smaller likelihood of exit from foreign markets for ﬁrms
         exporting on an intra-ﬁrm basis, especially since the global ﬁnancial crisis. The number
         of U.S. ﬁrms exporting intra-ﬁrm fell by 8.5 percent during 2009, whereas the number
         of ﬁrms exporting at arm’s-length fell by 12.5 percent (Carballo 2015).

       • Shock ampliﬁcation in complex supply chains. The demand for complex goods,
         such as automobiles, reacts more strongly to income shocks than the demand for basic
         goods (Ferrantino and Taglioni 2014). As a negative demand shock spreads through
         the supply chain, participating ﬁrms observe greater swings in demand the further
         up they are on the supply chain (the “bullwhip eﬀect”). Although intra-ﬁrm trade in
         intermediate goods fell more signiﬁcantly at the beginning of the crisis, it also beneﬁtted
         from a stronger recovery thereafter (Alessandria 2011).

       • U.S. dollar appreciation. Trade conducted through global value chains generally
         shows less sensitivity to real exchange rates. That’s because competitiveness gains
         from real depreciations are partly oﬀset by rising input costs (Ahmed, Appendino, and
         Ruta 2015; Mattoo, Mishra, and Subramaniam 2012; Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings

   7
       The results are robust to using manufacturing trade only.
   8
    Trade policy may have favored intra-ﬁrm trade. However, in the post-crisis period under consideration
here (2010-14) there were no major changes in U.S. trade policy. Apart from three bilateral U.S. FTAs that
are slowly being phased in since 2012 (Korea, Panama, Colombia), applied tariﬀs imposed by the United
States on its imports and faced by the United States on its exports did not change signiﬁcantly.

      2014). To the extent that intra-ﬁrm trade is more strongly associated with global
      value chains than arm’s-length trade, intra-ﬁrm U.S. exports may have beneﬁted less
      from the pre-crisis U.S. dollar depreciation and been dampened to a lesser degree by
      the post-crisis appreciation than arm’s-length exports. In addition, ﬁrms integrated
      vertically may have a wider range of tools available to them to hedge against exchange
      rate movements.

    • Uncertainty. Uncertainty inﬂuences whether ﬁrms outsource or integrate vertically
      (Antras and Helpman 2004). Although uncertainty discourages cross-border vertical
      integration, once established, vertically integrated U.S. ﬁrms tend to be less sensitive to
      uncertainty in their trade decisions (Carballo 2015; Bernard et al. 2010). Heightened
      economic and trade policy uncertainty during and after the global ﬁnancial crisis, may
      therefore have encouraged a post-crisis preference for intra-ﬁrm transactions over arm’s-
      length ones.


5     Empirical estimation
We delve deeper into the role of demand shocks and U.S. dollar movements in an econometric
analysis of U.S. export elasticities. The econometric speciﬁcation follows that of the typical
determinants of export growth recently summarized in Eichengreen and Gupta (2013) and
Ahmed, Appendino, and Ruta (2015). It aims to test for diﬀerences between the elasticity
of arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm export growth to export market growth (GDP) and changes
in real exchange rates. The speciﬁcation used here is as follows:

             Xirt = α + β GDP irt + γ REERirt + δIF T irt + θ(GDP irt × IF T irt )           (1)
                    + λ(REERirt × IF T irt ) + ρi + ρr + ρt + ρrt +   irt


where subscript i represents the 4 digit NAICS industry, r the importing country and t the
year. The dependent variable is growth in real U.S. exports (X ), while among the explanatory
variables we have real GDP growth (GDP ) and changes in bilateral real eﬀective exchange
rates (REER). IF T irt is a dummy variable equal to 1 for intra-ﬁrm transactions and 0 for
arm’s-length trade. Interaction terms between GDP growth and REER, on the one hand,
and the IFT dummy, on the other hand, aim to capture diﬀerences in the sensitivity of
arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade to changes in these independent variables. Finally, sector,
country, importer and importer-time characteristics are accounted for by using diﬀerent ﬁxed
eﬀects ρi , ρr , ρt , ρrt .



                                               13
For any variable Y in the speciﬁcation above (X, GDP and REER), growth rates are calcu-
lated as in Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) based on the following:
                                             Yirt − Yirt−1
                                  Yirt =                                                 (2)
                                           (Yirt + Yirt−1 )/2

The data on exports come the U.S. Census Bureau Related Party Database as described above
and cover U.S. goods exports for the period 2002-2014. Export values were deﬂated using
data on the importer’s consumer price index (CPI) from the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics. Data on real GDP comes from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators
while bilateral real exchange rates were constructed using the importing country’s exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar, deﬂated by the ratio between U.S. and importing country’s CPI.

The results of the econometric estimation are presented in Table 1 for the sample as a whole
(1) as well as sub-samples that include exports of manufactures (2), exports to advanced
economies (3) and to emerging markets (4). They suggest that arm’s-length exports are
more sensitive to changes in demand and in real exchange rates.

The income elasticity of arm’s-length U.S. exports is signiﬁcantly (about one-ﬁfth) higher
than that of intra-ﬁrm exports. This ﬁnding is robust to the use of diﬀerent sub-samples.
For instance, a 1 percentage point increase in the real GDP growth of the importing county
is associated with 1.5 percentage point higher growth in arm’s length exports, but only 1.2
percentage point higher growth in intra-ﬁrm exports.

Similarly, a real exchange rate appreciation of 1 percentage point is associated with 3.1
percentage point lower growth in arm’s-length exports but only 2.8 percentage point lower
growth in intra-ﬁrm export growth. This result is consistent with ﬁndings of Ahmed, Ap-
pendino and Ruta (2015) who show that rising participation in global value chains explains
on average 40 percent of the fall in the real exchange rate elasticity of exports.

These result suggest that the higher elasticity of arm’s length trade compounded compo-
sitional eﬀects that hindered arm’s-length trade over intra-ﬁrm trade. As a result of the
greater income elasticity or arm’s-length trade, post-crisis weakness in global growth and,
especially, the growth slowdown in EMDEs weighed more on arm’s-length trade than on
intra-ﬁrm trade.

6    Conclusion
The United States plays an important role in global trade. It accounts for about 11 percent of
global goods trade and is the largest export destination for one-ﬁfth of the world’s countries.
U.S. multinationals account for about 30 percent of the employment and sales of the world’s
largest 100 non-ﬁnancial multinational companies. U.S. arm’s-length trade growth has slowed
steeply relative to intra-ﬁrm trade in the aftermath of the global ﬁnancial crisis, from high
pre-crisis rates. During the 2010-14 recovery, trade between non-aﬃliated ﬁrms grew at
about half the pre-crisis rate. Intra-ﬁrm trade growth also slowed but to a considerably
lesser degree.

The sharp slowdown in arm’s-length trade growth stems from a number of factors. A high
share of arm’s-length exports is conducted with EMDEs, where growth has slowed sharply
from elevated pre-crisis rates. In addition, ﬁrms trading at arm’s-length are more concen-
trated in sectors that grew particularly rapidly pre-crisis and sectors that beneﬁted from the
pre-crisis commodity price boom, which boosted pre-crisis trade but have languished since
the crisis. In addition, arm’s-length trade is more sensitive to changes in demand and real
exchange rates. For example, the income elasticity of arm’s-length U.S. exports is about
one-ﬁfth higher than that of intra-ﬁrm exports. For the United States, these eﬀects account
for a signiﬁcant part of the post-crisis growth gap between arm’s-length and intra-ﬁrm trade.

Other factors have also been at play. Among these, the characteristics that make ﬁrms en-
gaged in arm’s-length trade less resilient to the severe demand and ﬁnancing shocks of the
global ﬁnancial crisis contributed to the post-crisis weakness of arm’s-length trade. Firms
engaged in outsourcing tend to be smaller, less productive, less eﬃcient in inventory man-
agement, and have more restricted access to ﬁnance than ﬁrms integrated vertically. Such
factors may have accelerated the exit of ﬁrms trading at arm’s-length during the global ﬁ-
nancial crisis and its aftermath. Heightened ﬁnancial risks and policy uncertainty may also
have discouraged arm’s-length transactions.

While the post-crisis environment has favored multinationals that focus on intra-ﬁrm trans-
actions, their activities can also raise policy challenges. For example, multinationals may
have an incentive to adjust their transfer pricing—the prices assigned to intra-ﬁrm trans-
actions—to raise the value of goods and services produced in countries with low corporate
income taxes and reduce the value of those produced in countries with higher taxes. Policies
to promote FDI and trade therefore have to be carefully calibrated to protect ﬁscal rev-
enues. A number of global initiatives have been introduced since the global ﬁnancial crisis
to make global tax practices more transparent (IMF/OECD/UN/World Bank 2011, 2016).
In addition, large and internationally active ﬁrms also tend to be better able to absorb the

                                              16
signiﬁcant ﬁxed costs of exporting. Measures to reduce asymmetries of information and help
small and medium-sized companies overcome regulatory burdens can help level the playing
ﬁeld (World Bank 2016).
