           There is no universal term that refers to unmanned aircraft (UA). Alternatives
           are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); unmanned aircraft systems (UAS); remotely
           piloted aircraft system (RPAS); and drone – a term used mainly by the media. This
           guidance note will use UA unless context requires a different term. If required, the
           complete system (remote pilot, ground control system, and control/communication
           links) will be referred to as the UAS. In this case, UA refers to the flying portion.

         tions: fixed wing (FW), rotary wing (RW), and hybrid.


         FW UA – Configured like a traditional FW aircraft, FW UA have a range of landing
         and take-off profiles usually with a bigger footprint. Their flight profile means that
         they are more aerodynamically efficient and usually have a longer range and greater
         flight endurance.


         RW UA – RW platforms fly using the same principles as manned helicopters,
         although the vast majority often have four, six, or eight rotors. Consequently, the
         1platforms have a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) capability that makes
         them more operationally versatile.

 checklist form
The purpose of this document is to facilitate a comprehensive pre-flight planning process to
ensure that operations are conducted safely, with appropriate authority, and in accordance
with existing regulation. This should be applied broadly across all nations in which tasks are
being flown in support of WBG projects.

The form is divided into a number of sections and designed to serve as a record of
operational planning. It should be retained and presented to relevant authorities if
requested. The form should be completed fully with comprehensive notes and answers to
the principle questions.
