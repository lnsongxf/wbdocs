      his study on Water Use and Reallocation: Implications for Economic Growth has been undertaken
      by the World Bank as part of the World Bank Water Beam Activities, India. The study has been made
      possible through the initiatives and collaboration between various departments of the Government
of Rajasthan, including senior officials (2016): Mr. C.S. Rajan, Chief Secretary; Mr. Ashok Sampatram,
Additional Chief Secretary; Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development
Department; Mr. Ajitabh Sharma, Secretary, Water Resources Department; Mr. J. C. Mohanty, Principal
Secretary, Public Health Engineering & Ground Water Department and Mr. Abhay Kumar, Commissioner,
Industries. All the above officials took a keen interest in the study and guided the study team through
consultations, providing the required data points as well as illustrative examples for the study analysis.
The analysis, findings, and reports have been supported by the consultancy team from Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu India LLP.
Data for the study was obtained from the concerned departments: Water Resources and Planning
Department, Agriculture, Public Health and Engineering Department, Rajasthan Industrial Development
and Investment Corporation, Industries, Bureau of Investment Promotion, and Ground Water Department.
Officials from these Departments also helped in validating the study assumptions.
The study has been carried out under the leadership and overall guidance of Dr. Smita Misra, Task
Team Leader for the Study and Lead Water and Sanitation Specialist, World Bank. Specialized inputs are
acknowledged from Dr. Ravinder P.S. Malik, Senior Water Resources Specialist, World Bank. The study
has been supported by Dr. Bill Young, Lead Water Resources Management Specialist and Mr. Rajesh
Balasubramanian, Senior Water and Sanitation Specialist from World Bank. Administrative support
and coordination has been provided by Ms. Sarita Rana and Ms. Nirmala Chopra, Program Assistants,
World Bank.
The team appreciates advice by Ms. Meike van Ginneken, Practice Manager, Water, for the final report and
dissemination.
The team would like to thank Junaid K. Ahmad, Country Director, India for his support on the cross-
sectoral work in the Water sector.

   Illustrative example
   There are various states in India where the change in cropping pattern has witnessed less water demand
   and high yield, resulting in increase of GSDP. However, it requires policy support and incentives from the
   government. Gujarat government has launched an e-Governance Bulletin called e-Krishi Kiran which suggests
   alternate cropping pattern based on moisture availability index. The government also provides Soil Health
   Card to each farmer to guide them about the soil conditions and cropping practices to be followed. This team
   also provides recommendation of the possible alternative crops to a farmer for better crop production, based
   on their cropping practice and weather condition in the area, considering facts like moisture availability index,
   available water capacity, length of growing period, surplus water and supplementary irrigation.
   Similarly, Bathinda district in Punjab has undergone a major change in cropping pattern and has shown
   positive results. Government supported the farmers with agricultural credit through institutional and non-
   institutional agencies, agricultural training Camp/Institutions at district/block levels and farm mechanization
   by allocating money for purchasing instruments at subsidized rate.

   Illustrative example
   There are various states in India which have changed their Industrial Policy to avoid setting up water intensive
   industries.
   For example, Puducherry government rolled out new industrial policy for sustainable industrial growth in 2012
   to promote less water intensive, pollution free and employment oriented sustainable industrial growth in the
   Union Territory.
   Similarly, Rajasthan Government can consider developing priority list of industries that are less water intensive
   and add more value contribution to GSDP.

  Illustrative example - Water Use Efficiency Program in San Diego
  San Diego County Water Authority has implemented various programs on Water Use Efficiency. Some highlights
  of the work:
      •	 It developed a ground breaking website WaterSmartSD.org, a comprehensive online tool that is
         continually updated to offer the latest news and resources about wise use of water.
      •	 One of the website’s main features is the online Water Calculator, which gives homeowners a breakdown
         of water use at their properties and suggests ways to improve efficiency.
      •	 Also, financial incentives were given by The WaterSmart Turf Replacement Program for turning
         conventional lawns into water-efficient landscapes with financial support from state and federal grant
         money.
      •	 In addition, the Water Authority successfully concluded a pilot series of free Landscape Makeover
         Workshops to provide homeowners with the basic skills necessary to transform traditional turf yards into
         WaterSmart showcases.
