About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      One-Stop Integrated Service Agency (Badan Pelayanan Terpadu Satu
      Pintu/BPTSP)

      BuildCo must submit a completed application form, along with the following
      documentation to the City Planning O ce at the One-Stop Integrated Service
      Agency (Badan Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Pintu/BPTSP) in order to obtain the
      city planning permit (KRK):

      1. A copy of land ownership certi cate (which has been notarized);
      2. A copy of the latest payment receipt for land and building tax;
      3. A copy of the identity card (KTP/Driving License) of the authorized
      representative of the applicant;
      4. A copy of the deed of establishment of BuildCo and its amendment (if any);
      5. A power of attorney (as necessary).


      The city planning o cial at the BPTSP will examine the application and will
      conduct a land situation measurement (the procedural details of which are
      elaborated in the next section below).

      The KRK is a statement that contains planning information about the plot of
      land that BuildCo intends to build the warehouse on. The KRK also includes a
      city planning map scale (1:1000) signed by the Head of Jakarta City Planning
      O ce. The city planning map covers information on:
      a. Building setback (GSB) - the borders within which BuildCo is allowed to
      construct the building
      b. Road border lines (GSJ) - the borders of the front yard or block borders or
      road control borders
      c. Land use plan - explanation about the bene ts of the land
      d. Type of building
      e. Height of building in terms of oors/storey
      f. Floor area ratio (FAR/KLB) - the multiplication gure used to calculate the
      total area of building that is permitted
      g. Building coverage (KDB)
      h. Blocking - the arrangement of city spaces on certain lanes governing the
      length and width of the piece of land for which the city planning permit is
      being applied for

      BuildCo must also request approval of the architectural drawings
      Pengesahan Gambar Perencanaan Arsitektur (formerly known as building
      site plan - RTLB) from the City Planning O ce. This plan outlines the exact
      position of the building on the city planning map and contains the following
      information (some of which is already contained on the city planning map
      previously):
      a. Building setback (GSB) - the borders within which BuildCo is allowed to                                            Page 26

Doing information (some ofIndonesia
                           which is already contained on the city planning map
       previously):
       a. Building setback (GSB) - the borders within which BuildCo is allowed to
       construct the building
       b. Road border lines (GSJ) - the borders of the front yard or block borders or
       road control borders
       c. Building trace form and location
       d. Building usage
       e. Height of building, including KDB (building coverage) and KLB ( oor area)
       f. Building cuts
       g. Parking lot
       h. Kelzar circulation/entry of vehicles

       Once the documents are submitted, BuildCo receives an invoice with the
       amount of fees that must be paid (SKRD). BuildCo must pay the fees at a
       local branch of Bank DKI and submit the receipt to the City Planning O ce.
       The total cost to obtain these documents is IDR 1,482,000.00 according to
       Article 123 of the Regional Regulation No. 1 Year 2006.


       The following is the detailed calculation:
       • Land measurement (based on the land certi cate, namely 500 -- 1,000 sq.
       m.) a retribution of IDR 750,000.00
       • Print out of the map (scale of 1:1000), a retribution of IDR 1,000.00 per copy
       x 12 copies or a total of IDR 12,000.00
       • KRK for plans to use the land for warehouse construction (Karya
       pergudangan/Kpg) for a land area of up to 1,000 sq. m. is subject to a fee of
       IDR 40,000.00
       • Pengesahan Gambar Perencanaan Arsitektur (formerly known as building
       site plan - RTLB) for plans to build warehouse construction is subject to a fee
       of IDR 40,000.00/100 sq. m. of oor surface, so the total fee for the RTLB: IDR
       40,000.00 x 13 (based on a 1,300.6 sq. m. oor surface) = IDR 520,000.00
       • Land marking for city planning implementation purposes (pematokan

      The Building Supervision and Control O ce has 4 di erent teams that review
      the architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical drawings. The
      application is rst reviewed by TPAK (the team that reviews the architectural
      drawings). This can take 3-4 weeks. The application is then forwarded to
      TPKB (team that reviews the structural drawings) and in parallel to TPIB
      (team that reviews the mechanical, electrical and plumbing drawings). This
      also takes about 3-4 weeks on average.


      According to Bylaw No. 3 on Building Tari Rates of October 2012, the permit
      fee is calculated as follows:


      RPP = L x It x HSbg = 1,300.6 x 2.1 x 25,000


      • L = area of the building (1,300.6 sq. m)
      • It = index that is calculated as follows:
      Ikg x If x Ik x Iw x Ipt where Ikg = 1 (for a new building); If = 3 (for commercial
      buildings); Ik = 0.7; Iw = 1 (for permanent buildings); Ipt = 1 (if the building
      does not have a basement). Therefore, It = 1 x 3 x 0.7 x 1 x 1 = 2.1
      • HSbg = IDR 25,000 / sq. m.

      internal wiring installation
      Agency : KONSUIL/ PPILN/ JASERINDO

      The client needs to obtain a certi cate that guarantees the proper operation
      of the internal installation from the Komite Nasional Keselamatan Untuk
      Instalasi Listrik (KONSUIL), Perkumpulan Perlindungan Instalasi Listrik
      Nasional (PPILN) or Jasa Serti kasi Indonesia.


      KONSUIL, PPILN and JASERINDO act as independent bodies in charge of
      inspecting and verifying the conformity of the installation works vis-a-vis the
      norms in place. This is in accordance with articles 21 paragraph (7) and 22
      paragraph (2) of the Government Regulation number 3 Year 2005, amending
      Government Regulation number 10 Year 1989 on the Supply and Electricity
      Connections.

      The following documents need to be submitted:
      • Installation drawings
      • List of materials used: brand, size / specs

      After Konsuil/PPILN/Jaserindo certify the installation, then
      Konsuil/PPILN/Jaserindo will produce an SLO. PLN recommends its client to
      apply once the installation has already been certi ed and there is an SLO.

  2   Submit connection application to PLN and await approval and estimate              3 calendar days    IDR 124,354,246.03
      Agency : PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN)

      The client can apply for a new connection through PLN's web-site
      www.pln.co.id - or through its call center.


      The client needs to input the following information with the application:
      - Identity Card number
      - Capacity of electricity connection
      - Address of warehouse
      - SLO number: PLN recommends its customers to apply once they have
      already obtained a certi cate from KONSUIL/PPILN/Jaserindo


      As part of the application process, PLN may carry-out an external site
      inspection in Jakarta. This is the case for most locations in West Jakarta like
      the Tegal Alur area where PLN has to ensure that the existing network can
      take an additional load and if a new transformer needs to be installed.


      Upon his application, the client receives a registration number. The
      registration number is a code with which the client can pay the connection
      fee and the security deposit charge. The payment can be done through most
      local banks and their delivery channels (e.g. ATM, e-banking). As the payment
      is then processed, one of the vendors of PLN will be informed that the
      external works can commence.

      Agency : PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN)'s contractor

      The external works consist of expanding the distribution network by
      installing an overhead transformer and connecting the warehouse to the                                                 Page 47

        The external works consist of expanding the distribution network by
        installing an overhead transformer and connecting the warehouse to the
        network. PLN will typically contract-out the external works to approved
        vendors, but it provides the main materials needed (e.g. transformer,
        cables).

    4   Obtain nal connection from PLN                                                  3 calendar days         IDR 0
        Agency : PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN)

        After the external works, PLN will do a nal inspection after which they can
        energize the building. Following the inspection, the client receives a letter
        detailing the date for energizing. The client/contractors needs to be present
        for the nal connection.

      KONSUIL, PPILN and JASERINDO act as independent bodies in charge of
      inspecting and verifying the conformity of the installation works vis-a-vis the
      norms in place. This is in accordance with articles 21 paragraph (7) and 22
      paragraph (2) of the Government Regulation number 3 Year 2005, amending
      Government Regulation number 10 Year 1989 on the Supply and Electricity
      Connections.
      The following documents need to be submitted:
      • Installation drawings
      • List of materials used: brand, size / specs

      After Konsuil/PPILN/Jaserindo certify the installation, then
      Konsuil/PPILN/Jaserindo will produce an SLO. PLN recommends its client to
      apply once the installation has already been certi ed and there is an SLO.

  2   Submit connection application to PLN and await approval and estimate              3 calendar days    IDR 124,354,246.03
      Agency : PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN)

      The client can apply for a new connection through PLN's web-site
      www.pln.co.id - or through its call center. The client needs to input the
      following information with the application:
      - Identity Card number
      - Capacity of electricity connection
      - Address of warehouse (the client can show the exact location by tagging a
      map on PLN's website)
      - SLO number: PLN recommends its customers to apply once they have
      already obtained a certi cate from KONSUIL/PPILN/Jaserindo

      Upon his application, the client receives a registration number. The
      registration number is a code with which the client can pay the connection
      fee and the security deposit charge. The payment can be done through most
      local banks and their delivery channels (e.g. ATM, e-banking). As the payment
      is then processed, one of the vendors of PLN will be informed that the
      external works can commence. On-site external inspections are no-longer
      carried-out by PLN thanks to a GIS system.

      The external works consist of expanding the distribution network by
      installing an overhead transformer and connecting the warehouse to the
      network. PLN will typically contract-out the external works to approved
      vendors, but it provides the main materials needed (e.g. transformer,
      cables).

  4   Obtain nal connection from PLN                                                    3 calendar days    IDR 0             Page 52

        After the external works, PLN will do a nal inspection after which they can
        energize the building. Following the inspection, the client receives a letter
        detailing the date for energizing. The client/contractors needs to be present
        for the nal connection

      20/2000 concerning the amendment of law No. 21/1997 concerning the Tax
      on Acquisition of Land and Building).

      In Jakarta, the NPOPTKP is Rp. 80,000,000 (according to Article 5 paragraph 7
      of the Regional Decree of Special Province of Jakarta No. 18/2010 concerning
      the Tax on Acquisition of Land and Building (BPHTB).

       The execution of the sale and purchase of Land Deed is made before Land
       O cials (who are often public notaries as well) appointed by the Head of the
       National Land O ce (PPAT) or a local Head of a District (Camat PPAT), after
       the taxes in Procedures 3 and 4 have been paid. For convenience, those
       payments are usually made by the notary three days before the execution of
       the sale-purchase deed. The PPAT obtains an appointment with the Land
       O ce using the online platform (loket.bpn.go.id) to register the land deed.

       The documentation shall include:
       (i) Original land certi cate
       (ii) Evidence of the latest payment of Tax on Land and Building (PBB). Every
       year, the local PBB Tax O ce issues a tax assessment to land owners. By
       custom, the buyer usually wants to obtain the original of the payment of PBB
       for the past three years and utility bills for the last three months--though in
       practice the o ce will check the last 10 years. The Land Deed O cer drawing
       up the sale and purchase deed will only need to see the most recent PBB
       while the Land O ce will need a copy of the most recent PBB for registering
       the land into the name of the new owner.
       (iii) Evidence of payment of Tax on Transfer of Land and Building (Transfer
       Tax)

       authorized by the Ministry of Justice

       24/1997 concerning the Land Registration). In theory, the registration
       process should be completed within the 5 days statutory time limit. The Land
       O ce crosses out the name of the previous owner and inserts the name of
       the buyer, stamps and signs it.

                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.

                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.
See the methodology for more information.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

                                     procedure then gets converted to reorganization. Suspension of payment cases are heard
                                     before the Commercial Court.

Outcome           going concern      After creditors approve the plan, it is possible to sell Mirage as going concern, because the
                                     prospect is good.

Time (in years)   1.1                BizBank would initiate foreclosure after Mirage's default on payment. According to Part Six of
                                     Law No. 37 of 2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension of Obligation for Debt Payment,
                                     Mirage would petition to the Commercial Court for a suspension of payments. The
                                     foreclosure procedure then gets converted to reorganization. Suspension of payment cases
                                     are heard before the Commercial Court. It takes about 2 months from the moment the case
                                     is filed until the first hearing. The Commercial Court must then grant a provisional
                                     moratorium, and appoint a supervisory judge and an administrator or receiver to assist the
                                     debtor in managing its estate. The provisional moratorium period is 90 days, but the
                                     permanent moratorium, which can be granted as an extension, is 270 days (counted from
                                     the decision on the temporary suspension). During this time, Mirage must propose a
                                     composition plan and creditors will decide whether to accept the plan, reject it or proceed to
                                     a permanent moratorium. BizBank is likely to ratify the composition plan if the terms are
                                     beneficial because it will recover more than through foreclosure. The total process, since
                                     Mirage defaults up to the adoption of the plan is 13 months.

Cost (% of        22.0               The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 22% of the value of the
estate)                              debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
                                     government agency fees (1%), attorneys’ fees (up to 10%), administrator’s fees (up to 7.5%),
                                     fees of accountants, assessors, inspectors (up to 3%), other fees such as announcement fees
                                     (1%).

Time (in years)    1.1              BizBank would initiate foreclosure after Mirage's default on payment. According to Part Six of
                                    Law No. 37 of 2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension of Obligation for Debt Payment,
                                    Mirage would petition to the Commercial Court for a suspension of payments. The
                                    foreclosure procedure then gets converted to reorganization. Suspension of payment cases
                                    are heard before the Commercial Court. It takes about 2 months from the moment the case
                                    is filed until the first hearing. The Commercial Court must then grant a provisional
                                    moratorium, and appoint a supervisory judge and an administrator or receiver to assist the
                                    debtor in managing its estate. The provisional moratorium period is 90 days, but the
                                    permanent moratorium, which can be granted as an extension, is 270 days (counted from
                                    the decision on the temporary suspension). During this time, Mirage must propose a
                                    composition plan and creditors will decide whether to accept the plan, reject it or proceed to
                                    a permanent moratorium. BizBank is likely to ratify the composition plan if the terms are
                                    beneficial because it will recover more than through foreclosure. The total process, since
                                    Mirage defaults up to the adoption of the plan is 13 months.

Cost (% of         20.0             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 20% of the value of the
estate)                             debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
                                    government agency fees (1%), attorneys’ fees (up to 8%), administrator’s fees (up to 7.5%),
                                    fees of accountants, assessors, inspectors (up to 3%), other fees such as announcement fees
                                    (1%).
