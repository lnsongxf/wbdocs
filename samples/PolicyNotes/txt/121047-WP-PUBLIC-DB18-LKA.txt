About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Dealing with Construction Permits
This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

    Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

    Registering Property
This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      On receipt of the last title deed and plan from the seller, a title search has to
                                                                                           4)
      be carried out at the relevant Land Registry. A lawyer/notary engaged by the
      purchaser has to recommend the title. Good title has to be established for
      the past 35 years. All deeds and plans have to be checked. If prior deeds are
      not available with the seller the notary will have to check duplicates of deeds
      at the Land Registry. If plans are not available, the relevant surveyors would
      have to be contacted and obtain duplicates of the plans. Other checks must
      be carried out as well by the lawyer (notary) at the local authority.


      Con rmation from the lawyer (notary) should be obtained that the title to
      the property is clear. On con rmation that the title to the property is clear,
      step 2 will apply; if not title insurance is recommended, and the next step
      would be to obtain a policy of title Insurance (procedure 1a).


      If title insurance is recommended in procedure 1 due to a defect in title, then
      the next step would be to obtain a Buyer's Policy of Title Insurance to cover
      defects. This step is optional and contingent to the result of step 1. If the
      policy is needed, the time necessary to obtain this title will depend on the
      time taken by the title insurance company to evaluate the title, make a
      decision to issue or not to issue the title insurance policy and the cost will
      depend on the premium payable.
      Usually title insurance is recommended for the following reasons:
      • Prior deeds and documentation not being available and further if the
      registers at the land registry cannot be traced for 35 years (if the books are
      damaged).

       be carried out at the relevant Land Registry. A lawyer/notary engaged by the
       purchaser has to recommend the title. Good title has to be established for
       the past 35 years. All deeds and plans have to be checked. If prior deeds are
       not available with the seller the notary will have to check duplicates of deeds
       at the Land Registry. If plans are not available, the relevant surveyors would
       have to be contacted and obtain duplicates of the plans. Other checks must
       be carried out as well by the lawyer (notary) at the local authority.


       Con rmation from the lawyer (notary) should be obtained that the title to
       the property is clear. On con rmation that the title to the property is clear,
       step 2 will apply; if not title insurance is recommended, and the next step
       would be to obtain a policy of title Insurance (procedure 1a).


       If title insurance is recommended in procedure 1 due to a defect in title, then
       the next step would be to obtain a Buyer's Policy of Title Insurance to cover
       defects. This step is optional and contingent to the result of step 1. If the
       policy is needed, the time necessary to obtain this title will depend on the
       time taken by the title insurance company to evaluate the title, make a
       decision to issue or not to issue the title insurance policy and the cost will
       depend on the premium payable.
       Usually title insurance is recommended for the following reasons:
       • Prior deeds and documentation not being available and further if the
       registers at the land registry cannot be traced for 35 years (if the books are
       damaged).
       • If there are any discrepancies in the title deeds and plans.
       • If the present owner had owned an undivided share of a larger land, and
       had sub-divided it without the consent of the other parties or without a
       Deed of Partition or Partition Plan.

       1. Articles of Association of the company
       2. Certi cate of incorporation of the seller
       3. Resolution authorizing the sale of land. If the purchase-sale is a major
       transaction as de ned by section 185 of Companies Act No. 7 of 2007, such a
       transaction should require the shareholders sanction as well.

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

                                                              several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the               - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                           and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                    - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                              commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                              - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                       - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                      - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                        - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.
