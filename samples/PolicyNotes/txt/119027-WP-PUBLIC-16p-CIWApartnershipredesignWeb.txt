THE CHALLENGE OF
TRANSBOUNDARY WATER
COOPERATION IN AFRICA
Water management and development play essential roles in development,
underpinning the means to lift people out of poverty and reduce vulnerability to
climate change. Many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) depend
on managing water more effectively. Tapping into Africa’s tremendous, but
currently underutilized, water resources will help improve livelihoods, strengthen
water security, and fuel economic growth.

With 90 percent of Africa’s surface waters falling within 63 international river
and lake basins, water management in Africa depends on cooperation that
crosses borders. Collectively managing and developing water resources at the
regional or basin-level can produce far-reaching benefits. When countries have
shared priorities and clear methods for communicating and working together,
floods can be prevented or subdued, droughts managed, ecosystems better
preserved, more fields irrigated, and energy sources harnessed and delivered to
people and businesses in need.

     However, the ‘transboundary’ context for harnessing water’s socio-economic
     benefits is complex: each country has its own national objectives guided by
     their own political and economic interests, historical tension between countries
     may exist, resources and technical capacities may be uneven, and it can be
     very difficult to determine how to share the benefits of collective investments.
     Furthermore, the sheer number of parties involved – from multiple ministries in
     multiple countries to local governments and civil-society organizations – can
     make decision making complicated and time consuming. While the largest
     shared river basins in Africa have established River Basin Organizations (RBOs)
     to help unify and clarify how to collectively manage shared waters, multiple
     barriers to effective cooperation still exist.

     Despite the difficulties, countries in Africa are increasingly focusing on the
     importance of regional coordination in order to maximize collective development
     gains while also sustaining longer-term regional stability and peace. Coordination
     among countries is critical to:

     •	 Avoid unilateral development of projects that may have impacts on other
        countries;
     •	 Provide benefits beyond what individual countries could reap by acting
        alone; and
     •	 Ensure that benefits are harnessed sustainably and shared equitably.

     Increasing focus on transboundary water cooperation is driven by two
     inescapable long-term trends: i) growing populations, rapid urbanization, and
     accelerating development intensify the demand on water resources; and ii)
     increasing water variability driven by climate change.

     Demand from African countries and institutions, as well as prior experiences
     on basins such as the Nile, led the World Bank and a group of development
     partners to launch CIWA in 2011. The CIWA partnership demonstrates the
     commitment of the international community to advance water-policy and
     development objectives set out by the African Union and the African Minister’s
     Council on Water to enable African countries to sustainably manage and
     develop their shared waters.

     Institution-building is a long-term process. For that reason, CIWA uses a
     unique business model that prioritizes multi-year support while also providing
     short-term resources to meet stakeholder needs in water, food, energy,
     navigation, and other water-dependent sectors. CIWA provides grants to
     a range of implementing partners including national governments,
     river basin organizations, regional economic communities, and civil
     society organizations in order to support the range of policy, coordination,
     and operational actors that transboundary cooperation requires. The
     program also provides neutral third party facilitation, technical
     support and analysis, as well as develops knowledge products that help
     to strengthen shared understanding, trust, and confidence among riparian

countries. Blending these instruments has led to tangible results in building
transboundary cooperation throughout Africa. However, the demand for
CIWA support currently outstrips supply, so opportunities for impact by both
current and future partners are great.

CIWA’s formal objective is to support riparian governments in Sub-
Saharan Africa to unlock the potential for sustainable, climate resilient
growth by addressing constraints to cooperative management and
development of international waters. By 2020, the program aims to
influence US$10 billion in investment financing for cooperative management
and development of transboundary waters across Sub-Saharan Africa,
targeting benefits for 50 million people.

RESULTS TO DATE
The results supported through the CIWA program in its first five years of
operation are significant, and include the following:

•	 In the Niger Basin, a Climate Resilience Investment Plan highlights regionally
   prioritized investment needs related to climate change adaptation in the
   basin to gather support for securing investment finance. Presented at
   COP21 in Paris in 2015, the plan is already attracting climate-related
   financing; the work helped mobilize a $450 million investment project.

•	 For the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a study
   on sustainable financing mechanisms for the Mono Basin Authority has
   informed the institutional structure of this new river basin organization. As a
   result, ECOWAS is primed to share lessons with other basins in the region.

•	 In the Lake Chad Basin, the Lake Chad Basin Commission and its six
   member states developed an action plan to turn Lake Chad into a model
   of regional rural development. Priority actions were identified to improve the
   resilience of Lake Chad livelihoods and ecosystems under current population
   growth pressures, hydrological variability and climate uncertainty. The plan
   comprises 173 activities estimated at US$1 billion.

•	 In the Nile Basin, the Eastern Nile Council of Ministers agreed to establish a
   regional and individual national dam safety units following their endorsement
   of the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office’s (ENTRO) regional dam safety
   guidelines. ENTRO’s dam safety work has been lauded as groundbreaking
   by the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) and was featured
   at the international ICOLD conference as an example of best practice.

•	 In the Zambezi Basin, the newly established permanent Zambezi Water-
   course Commission (ZAMCOM) Secretariat is leading the development of
   a basin-level strategic plan, approved by its Council of Ministers, which will
   include a project prioritization process and policy tools to coordinate effi-
   cient management, sustainable development, and equitable utilization of
   the basin’s shared waters.

•	 In the Okavango Basin, a Multi-Sector Investment Opportunity Analysis
   helped stakeholders identify three regionally-relevant investments (>US$400
   million) that balance economic, social justice, environmental, and climate
   resilience priorities as reflected in the vision for the basin.

CIWA METHODOLOGY
CIWA support is provided in the following three broad categories: shared,
trusted information; robust, flexible institutions; and sustainable, resilient
infrastructure.

            to generate new project               practices, and identify                  investment quality and
            opportunities and enhance             motivational drivers for                 expanding opportunity to
            project quality                       cooperation                              secure ﬁnancing




CIWA support for establishing shared, trusted information creates trust
and confidence and enables timely, transparent, and regionally beneficial
decision making. The focus on building robust, flexible institutions means
countries will be prepared to manage shared risks as well as equitably share
benefits. Support in this category also drives regional organizations toward
financial and institutional sustainability. CIWA support helps lay the foundation
for sustainable, resilient infrastructure by raising the level of professional
capacity in investment planning and packaging, and by promoting inclusive
stakeholder engagement throughout the project cycle. This ensures socio-
economic benefits, poverty reduction, and improved gender outcomes.

  OPPORTUNITIES FOR
  PARTNERSHIP
  Halfway through its initial phase, CIWA supports activities across the African
  continent through a program of US$85 million. Recognizing the scale of
  the challenge and the potential of CIWA for impact, CIWA stakeholders
  have established a $200 million resource mobilization target. An expanded
  program will allow CIWA to address needs in areas it has so far been unable
  to support and enable currently assisted basins to further advance toward
  development objectives.

  CIWA’s position within the World Bank provides several advantages. As
  a trustee of more than $25 billion dollars annually, the World Bank ensures
  systematic, prudent management and oversight of entrusted funds. The Bank’s
  long experience in utilizing the highest levels of technical capacity, its global
  operational platform, as well as its deep partnerships with recipient countries
  and international actors lends it a unique advantage for program delivery and
  drives CIWA’s ability to play a catalytic role. CIWA’s unique business model –
  built on lessons from the Bank’s longtime experience in transboundary waters
  – allows CIWA to pursue the full range of possible instruments for maximal
  impact. Further, because the program is demand-driven, CIWA support is
  aligned with regional and national objectives.

                            LOOKING FORWARD
                            Rooted in the lessons of what works, the core focus of CIWA will remain on
                            supporting information services, strengthening institutions, and advancing
                            quality regional investments. As the technical challenges facing the continent
                            evolve, so will CIWA. Examples of areas of growing demand include:

                            •	 Furthering informed groundwater management and development;
                            •	 Advancing solutions for water conservation and enhancing basin water yield;
                            •	 Building the evidence base on the importance of natural infrastructure for
                               climate resilience; and
                            •	 Protecting the integrity of environmental services.

      The Partnership Framework is informed by the findings of a comprehensive
      external mid-term review of the CIWA program in 2015, which provided
      useful ideas for strengthening the program, and concluded that the
      program is fit for purpose and has a distinct comparative advantage in
      facilitating cooperative water resources management and development in
      transboundary waters in Africa.

Special thanks and appreciation are extended to the partners who support CIWA’s
work to address constraints to cooperative management and development of
international waters in Africa:

Denmark, European Commission, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United
Kingdom, and The World Bank. Since its inception in 2011, development
partners have entrusted CIWA with over $85 million in pledges and contributions
for fulfilling its mandate.
