About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                        Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

This topic tracks the procedures, time and cost to build a warehouse—including obtaining necessary the licenses and permits,
submitting all required noti cations, requesting and receiving all necessary inspections and obtaining utility connections. In
addition, the Dealing with Construction Permits indicator measures the building quality control index, evaluating the quality of
building regulations, the strength of quality control and safety mechanisms, liability and insurance regimes, and professional
certi cation requirements. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more

      A noti cation of environmental and social impact (notice d’impact
      environnemental et social - NIES) is submitted to the National Department of
      Environment and Hygiene outlining the potential hazards of the project on
      the environment. The warehouse falls under the C category and therefore
      only requires an NIES.
      The environmental department will conduct a site inspection to determine if
      this warehouse will not have a negative impact on the environment. If the
      inspection reveals that the impact is far greater than what was described in

   6   Receive inspection from Regional Urban Planning Department - I                    1 day     no charge
       Agency : Regional Urban Planning Department

       O cials from the Regional Urban Planning Department are always on patrol
       to check projects without building permits. The possibility of receiving an
       inspection is noted in the authorization letter of the building permit, but
       these are conducted randomly. There are foundation, elevation and cover
       inspections. Therefore, a construction like the one in the case study would
       receive at least one such inspection whereby o cials of the Regional Urban
       Planning Department would check whether or not BuildCo has a building
       permit.

       Given the silence-is-consent rule, some companies begin construction
       without the building permit. In such cases, these companies provide the
       inspectors with a receipt obtained from the Urban Planning Department at
       the moment of application. There are three inspector brigades available at
       Bamako.

    Getting Electricity
This topic measures the procedures, time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly
constructed warehouse. Additionally, the reliability of supply and transparency of tari s index measures reliability of supply,
transparency of tari s and the price of electricity. The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June
2017. See the methodology for more information.

      If the client chooses to hire a private rm for the external works, then they
      would need to ask that same rm to prepare the estimate for them. In such
      case, the estimate will also include: a) the fees to EDM-SA for the control and
      oversee of external works; b) the fees to EDM-SA for furnishing and installing
      the meter; c) the security deposit equivalent to 11'655 XOF/kvA. The rst 100
      meters of the cable are at the expense of EDM-SA.

      The distribution department of EDM relies on the supply department for
      transformers. When there is a stock supply issue, EDM helps its clients nd a
      transformer in the private sector and deduct it from the bill.

      Importing a transformer takes on average 3 months. Transformers can be
      imported from Europe (often from France) within 13 weeks. Recently, new
      trends have appeared: transformers might be obtained from Ivory Coast,
      Morocco, Tunisia, within one month.

      The client can either wait for the utility to buy the transformer or buy it
      themselves directly to gain time.

      Agency : Energie du Mali (EDM), Bamako

      The client can choose to hire either EDM or a private rm for the external
      works. In the latter case, the private rm would need the
      authorization/certi cation of EDM in order want to install the material.
      In practice, it is assumed EDM will carry out the works because it is less
      expensive and as such, is often the client’s choice. EDM subcontracts when it
      is not able to face the demands of its customers.

      In this case, an expansion (installation of a transformer) of the network is
      necessary.

      • The quotation for the cable and the material:
      If a company resorts to EDM and uses an overhead cable (not an
      underground cable), EDM will deduct XOF 2,300,000 from the total amount of
      the works. This explains mainly why EDM is cheaper.
      If the cable is dealt with by a private company, the bene ciary will not have
      this reduction but will be able to charge other customers the use of cable.
      Yet, after 5 years, this cable becomes the property of EDM.

       Yet, after 5 years, this cable becomes the property of EDM.
       • The quotation for the transformer
       EDM proposes 2 types of transformers:
       An overhead transformer at 160 kVA costing XOF 4,407,000
       A pad-mounted transformer at 160 kVA costing XOF 4,538, 280
       Private companies tend to charge more for their transformers (higher
       margin).

       The type of service (overhead or underground) depends on the exact
       location of the building. On the left shore of Niger river, part of the service is
       overhead and another is underground (in any case, that side of the river is
       already saturated and cannot accommodate new customers). On the right
       shore, about 90% of installations are overhead, so it is assumed the service
       to connect to will be overhead.
       In this case, the total cost would be about XOF 13 – 13.5M. EDM would
       deduce XOF 2.3M from this, and then the client will need to pay an additional
       10% of the nal cost to EDM.

This topic examines the steps, time and cost involved in registering property, assuming a standardized case of an entrepreneur who
wants to purchase land and a building that is already registered and free of title dispute. In addition, the topic also measures the
quality of the land administration system in each economy. The quality of land administration index has ve dimensions: reliability of
infrastructure, transparency of information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution, and equal access to property rights. The
most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      the true value of the property before the sale agreement. These are
      commonly called “courtiers informels de l’immobilier”. After investigating the
      place and the building these private experts provide a range of acceptable
      prices and charges 0.5% of the property value for their fees.

       The transfer fees are 0.9% of the value of the property divided as follows: 1)
       0.6% to the Budget and 2 ) 0.3% for the Conservateur's salary. *Before doing
       the nal transfer, the land register forwards the whole le to the veri cation
       commission (“Commission de Veri cation”) that checks whether the price
       stated in the contract of sale corresponds to the commission’s price criteria.
       In case the commission contests the price, the parties are requested to
       come back to the Land Registry and pay the di erence in taxes. The parties
       can choose to contest the commission decision by going to court. In the
       latter case, delays are substantial. If the commission does not object to the
       stated price, the application proceeds and the director of the Land Registry
       makes the nal transfer of property. The Registry will then issue a nal deed
       of property in the name of the new buyer.

This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding         liquidation           As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets, it will file a
                   (after an             declaration of cessation of payments (article 25 of the Uniform Act Organizing Collective
                   attempt at            Proceedings for Wiping Off Debts). In order to continue operating, Mirage will try to obtain
                   reorganization)       the opening of reorganization proceedings and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a
                                         composition proposal is a proposal lodged no later than 15 days following the declaration of
                                         cessation of payments, specifying the measures and conditions envisaged to redress the
                                         company. According to our information, Mirage will not reach an agreement with its
                                         creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court will convert the
                                         proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of the proposal (article 33 of the
                                         Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that is later converted into liquidation is the most
                                         likely proceeding in Mali.

Outcome            piecemeal sale        According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the proceedings will
                                         probably be converted to liquidation. The hotel will stop operating and will be dismantled,
                                         and the assets of the debtor will be sold separately.

Time (in years)    3.6                   Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                         reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following the cessation
                                         of payments. The competent court will then declare cessation of payments and open
                                         reorganization proceedings. The composition proposal will fail, so the proceedings will be
                                         converted to liquidation. According to our estimations, the complete process of a
                                         reorganization attempt that is then converted to liquidation takes approximately 43 months.

Cost (% of         18.0                  According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted into
estate)                                  liquidation costs approximately XOF 18,500,000 (18% of the value of the estate). Lawyer fees
                                         (10%), official receiver and receivers (5%), and bailiffs and assignees (3%) appointed under
                                         articles 39, 41 and 48 constitute the main cost components.
