Influence through Evaluation
An Overview of IEG’s Evaluation Activities During the Year
IN LINE WITH ITS MANDATE to evaluate the activities of the World Bank Group, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) ensures that its

evaluations are aligned with the World Bank Group’s strategic priorities and Forward Look. Our overall work program hinges on three Strategic

Engagement Areas: inclusive and sustainable economic growth, investing in people, and fostering resilience to global shocks and threats.


Within IEG, the strategic engagement areas provide a better way to coordinate decisions about what and when to evaluate. They also bring a

more selective, strategic approach within the organization by ensuring that evaluations link to the most pressing concerns. A results framework

underlies the strategic engagement areas, which helps provide a clear line of sight between IEG’s evaluations and its overall mandate.

have helped the World Bank Group and its clients identify knowledge
and data gaps, which can help improve the evidence base for future
policy making.

Aligning CPF program priorities to the constraints and priorities
identiﬁed in SCDs has been challenging. Balancing government
priorities with the World Bank Group’s own comparative advantage
remains an issue. IEG also found that CPFs did not always effectively
address the knowledge and data gaps identiﬁed in the SCDs.
Although the deﬁnition of results chains in CPFs has improved,
it remains a work in progress.

Renewed investments in other channels also yielded strong
results. Our monthly newsletter now reaches over 35,000
subscribers, and our social media channels collectively have
an audience of over 100,000 followers. The IEG weekly blog
continued to perform very well. One of the year’s highlights was
a special blog series on rethinking evaluation, which attracted
over 12,000 readers and generated over 100 comments.

During the year, IEG also hosted 16 dissemination events,
including a stakeholder event in Manila on fragility and
conﬂict that was cohosted by the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank. In addition, IEG hosted two successful
seminars at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund
Annual and Spring Meetings. Through these events, IEG
directly engaged over 2,000 participants, including high-level
stakeholders, representing governments, civil society, and other
international development organizations.

Evaluation Capacity Development
IEG’s mandate includes helping World Bank client countries
strengthen their monitoring and evaluation capacity. IEG’s work
in this area is delivered primarily through two partnerships that
involve other development partners and stakeholders. These are the
Centers for Learning on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR) and the
International Program for Development Evaluation Training (IPDET).


The Centers for Learning on Evaluation
and Results Initiative
The CLEAR Initiative is a global program that brings together
academic institutions and donor partners to contribute to the use
of evidence in decision making in developing countries. Now in
its ﬁfth year, the CLEAR initiative has six regional centers covering
Anglophone Africa, Francophone Africa, South Asia, East Asia,
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Brazil. In 2016, the CLEAR
centers served nearly 13,500 individuals through activities targeted
mainly at government, academic, and civil society clients.

CLEAR’s secretariat is housed at IEG, with support coming from
various partners including the African Development Bank, the
Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank,
and the Rockefeller Foundation, as well as bilateral country donors
such as the Australia, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom.

International Program for Development Evaluation
Training
In March 2017, Carleton University, IEG’s long-term partner in
delivering IPDET decided to disengage from the program. As a
result, the 2017 summer session of the program was canceled.
Plans are under way to ﬁnd a new academic partner to take on this
important program and offer it in 2018.

Staffing and Development
DURING THE PAST YEAR, IEG has continued efforts to strengthen its human resources, revamp its internal structures, and streamline

resource allocation. Recruitments to ﬁll vacant staff positions were completed for most senior management and operational roles. In line with

World Bank Group practices, over the last ﬁve years IEG has reduced the number of senior-level positions, which has freed up resources and

allowed us to invest the savings in our front-line staff—the evaluators and other professionals who carry out the bulk of IEG’s work.

The Road Ahead
FOR THE COMING YEAR, IEG’s proposed work program is expected to continue building substantive knowledge in the three strategic

engagement areas and contribute to enhancing learning and feedback loops. Our proposed evaluation topics strongly align with needs and

knowledge gaps related to the World Bank Group’s strategy and the twin goals. In addition, IEG has taken account of the more recent shifts in

the World Bank Group’s approach by aligning with the 2017 Forward Look, IDA priorities, IFC’s new strategy (IFC 3.0), and the new cascade

approach for maximizing ﬁnance for development.
