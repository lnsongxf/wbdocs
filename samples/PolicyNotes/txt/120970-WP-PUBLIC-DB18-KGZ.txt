About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      architectural planning conditions (AПЗ) from the unit of State
      Department for Architecture and Construction Supervision
      Agency : State Department for Architecture and Construction Supervision of
      Bishkek City

      In accordance with the Regulation “On Order for Issuing Permits for Project
      Designs, Construction and Real Estate Modi cation and Order for
      Commissioning Completed Building the Kyrgyz Republic” approved by
      Government of KR on May 30, 2008, by Resolution # 252, the issuance of
      Architectural Planning Conditions (APU) shall be conducted according to
      One-Stop-Shop principle. The list of documents required for issuance of APU
      was reduced. In particular, a business is only expected to complete an
      established application form which contains information on the type of
      upcoming construction and submit it along with the following documents:
      copy of the land title that veri es that a land plot was purchased or leased,
      letter of attorney, and invoice on advanced payment (advance payment is
      required while obtaining an APU, the remainder is paid after a business
      receives the APU).


      A territorial architecture and construction body, within 3 business days,
      performs the check for compliance of an application form with requirements
      set by urban planning documentation. In case of non-compliance, the
      territorial architecture and construction body issues a Report on Non-
      compliance of Construction and returns the application without approval. In
      each case the body is obliged to indicate the established types of permitted
      land use pursuant to the urban planning documentation.


      In case the territorial architecture and construction body approves the
      application, it submits the application for further approval to the sanitary
      and epidemiology body, re authority, and environmental authority. After
      that, the application is forwarded to the utilities companies by the main
      coordinating agency - State Construction Department - for obtaining
      technical terms to install utility systems using One-Stop-Shop principle
      without participation of the applicant.

      As of February 12, 2009, Government Resolution #121 introduced
      amendments to the Regulation “On Order for Issuing Permits for Project
      Designs, Construction and Real Estate Modi cation and Order for
      Commissioning Completed Building the Kyrgyz Republic” approved by
      Government of KR on May 30, 2008, by Resolution #252. There are now only
      two technical conditions that must be obtained in a compulsory manner --
      water/ sewage and electricity. The remaining communications can be
      obtained on a voluntary basis by applicants and are not linked to obtaining
      the architectural planning conditions. Meanwhile, if the applicant suggests
      alternative solutions to connecting to engineering facilities, then requests
      for technical conditions are not led at all. Based on the functional purpose
      of the building, approvals from sanitary and re authorities are applied using
      a risk-based system. Simple objects would not require approvals from these
      authorities.

      Additionally, requirements for documents to be submitted along with the
      application have been clari ed. These administrative simpli cations made                                                   Page 13

      Additionally, requirements for documents to be submitted along with the
      application have been clari ed. These administrative simpli cations made
      the process of issuance of architectural planning conditions faster and
      possible to comply within the time-limit of 20 working days (28 calendar
      days).

      Despite reforms in disclosing the information on fee schedules, the process
      of cost calculation for this procedure remains nontransparent.


      The payment can be made at the counter of State Architecture Department
      of Bishkek City. Then the shares of each respective utility provider are
      transferred without BuildCo visiting each separately.


      APU is executed in two copies - one is issued to the applicant and the other
      is led with the architecture and construction body.

  2   Request and obtain topographic and geological survey conclusions of               14 days   KGS 7,500
      land from Kyrgyz GIIZ
      Agency : Kyrgyz GIIZ

      Although there are several licensed companies that provide these services,
      Kyrgyz GIIZ has the biggest database of maps that date back the longest and
      is the only licensed institution in the country with the proper equipment and
      capacity. Engineering–geological studies have not been done since the
      collapse of the Soviet Union, therefore, any new land developed would
      require BuildCo to request the full study. However, there are certain parts of
      the city that can be considered to have the proper geological study. In that
      case BuildCo would have to request a certi cate on geological survey,
      assuming that the actual geological survey which is very costly (up to USD
      3,000.00) or the survey of adjacent plot has been done. The cost for this
      certi cate can be anywhere between KGS 5.00 to KGS 10,000.00.

  3   Request approval of project, expertise of project documents and obtain            56 days   KGS 25,000
      building permit
      Agency : State Expertise Authority / State Department for Architecture and
      Construction Supervision

      This procedure consists of three stages: approval of project documents,
      expertise of documents and issuance of building permit. All three stages are
      done under the one-stop shop principle. A single application is led by the
      applicant to obtain all these approvals.

      The approval of project documents consists of two stages: initial review of
      drawings and plans and other relevant chapters of the projects is done by
      the territorial branch of State Architecture Department. BuildCo submits at
      this stage its application along with the following documents:
      • Project documents (drawings, plans); private projects are not required to
      submit any nancial segment of the project (abolished by the Resolution
      #252)
      • Engineer-geological study (for expertise)
      • Copies of letters authorizing persons responsible for construction works:
      technical supervision, author supervision; and for contractor (for
      construction permit)
      • Copies of licenses for construction works (for construction permit)


      BuildCo must obtain an approval from the respective Institute of State
      Agency of Architecture and Construction and other licensed agencies which
      have the right to provide an engineering assessment of objects no lower
      than two stories, stating the possibility of reconstructing, re-pro ling or re-                          Page 14

                             and Construction
      have the right to provide an engineering assessment of objects no lower
      than two stories, stating the possibility of reconstructing, re-pro ling or re-
      planning of objects (for construction permit). Any other documents are
      considered illegal.

      The authority must issue its approval within 10 working days.


      Following that it will send two copies of all documents for review by the State
      Expertise Authority. According to Resolution #252 (30.05.2008), and
      Government Resolution #75 as of February 4, 2009, the expertise can be
      conducted by private companies, but until now there has not been a single
      license issued for expertise works.


      The nature of the expert assessment has been changed as well. In the past,
      the expert assessment was focused on the cost estimate of the project,
      which is prohibited by the above-mentioned regulation.


      The expert assessment of the project design documents is conducted by the
      State Expertise Authority and its territorial bodies or privately licensed
      companies to check the following aspects:
      • Compliance of the object with requirements set by the architectural
      planning conditions, project design terms and city planning documentation
      • Justi cation of space-planning and construction decisions, construction
      materials and equipment, solidity and durability of the bearing structure of
      buildings
      • Checking the results of the geotechnical survey


      Based on the results of the conducted expert assessment, the State
      Expertise Authority prepares a report on compliance of the project design
      documents with normative requirements. In case of any irregularities, the
      State Expertise Authority prepares another report on bringing the project
      design documentation in compliance which identi es the irregularities or a
      report on refusal of approving the project design.

      Under current legislation there are categories of objects that do not require
      state expert assessment. There are notions of mandatory and voluntary
      expert assessment and possibility for expert assessment of project
      documentation by private experts or organizations. BuildCo’s case would
      qualify for the expert assessment.

      No later than one day following the approval date, which is 20 working days
      for projects higher than 1000 sq. m., the report with the positive expert
      assessment is submitted to State Architecture and Construction Supervision
      for issuing a construction permit.

      The State Architecture and Construction Supervision has to issue the
      building permit within 10 working days. Otherwise, the silence-is-consent
      principle applies. However, in practice the State Architecture and
      Construction Supervision does not accept silence as consent rule.
      Amendments regarding construction supervision process were made to Law
      “On Changes to Law of the Kyrgyz Republic” #101 as of March 30, 2009, “On
      City Construction and Architecture of the Kyrgyz Republic” Article 40, and
      Government Resolution #95 “On approving the Order on Classi cation of
      Construction Object Characteristics and Order of Conducting State
      Architecture-Construction Supervision, Reconstruction and Other Real
      Estate Objects in the Kyrgyz Republic.” According to these reforms the
      building supervision process is now based on a risk-based approach.
      Compulsory state control over the building process is applied for buildings         Page 15  
      that fall into high-risk category. Low-risk categories (i.e., buildings less than

       building supervision process is now based on a risk-based approach.
       Compulsory state control over the building process is applied for buildings
       that fall into high-risk category. Low-risk categories (i.e., buildings less than
       1,350 sq. m.) are now subject to author and technical supervision and do not
       require state supervision. Thus, it removes the need for signing a special
       contract with State Architecture and Construction Supervision and paying
       the respective fees. Both author and technical supervision can be done by
       BuildCo sta .

   4   Request and obtain authorization to conduct earthwork in the road                   5 days    no charge
       section
       Agency : City Road Department of Municipality of Bishkek

       According to Decision of Bishkek City Council as of February 4, 2009 which
       eliminated Resolution of Bishkek City Council #194 as of 9 June 2003,
       applicants now need to obtain only a warrant (naryad) for conducting works
       in public road area. The previous requirement has been eliminated under
       the general administrative simpli cation process. The authority responsible
       for issuing this document is now the City Road Department under
       Municipality of Bishkek, formed in August 2008, and replaced the Authority of
       District Administrations. Under the new provision there is no fee related to
       this procedure.

   5   Request and obtain equipment operating authorization                                15 days   no charge
       Agency : State Inspection for Supervision of Industry Safety and Mountain
       Supervision under the Ministry of Natural Resources of Kyrgyz Republic

       Under the existing regulation, this authorization is required to allow the use
       of cranes, excavators and elevators. Five days before using the equipment,
       BuildCo will le a request, followed by a visit by the inspector from the
       Inspection by Gostechnadzor. The inspector, having reviewed the equipment
       to be used, stamps and signs the technical passport of the new projects.


       Regulatory simpli cation reform process also eliminated duplicating
       legislation concerning the fees for equipment operation authorization. This
       eliminated the grounds for o cers by the State Technical Supervision to levy
       fees.

       Agency : Bishkekvodokanal

       Connection can be done without prior inspection if the location has existing
       utility infrastructure. According to the tari approved by the City Council of
       Bishkek (Decree of 30.04.2009. № 68), water connection costs 2,074.4 soms
       per cubic meter and sewerage connection costs 2,178.1 soms per cubic
       meter, plus 12% VAT and 2% sales tax.

       Within 10 days after completion of construction, BuildCo les a request to
       the State Inspection on Environmental and Technical Safety of Act of
       Acceptance of Object for Use. This approval must be issued within 10
       working days. If the Act is not issued within the established time limit, the
       silence-is-consent rule applies. The Act must be signed by the applicant,
       author of project, general contractor, and a representative of State
       Architecture and Construction Supervision’s regional branch who performed
       the technical supervision during construction.                                                            Page 16

       The inspection may take place depending on the case. Sometimes if the
       supervising technical inspector provides sound feedback to the regional
       head o ce, the inspection may not be required. However, a separate visit is
       paid to obtain the actual copy of the Act. The Act is a legal document that
       allows the immediate use of the building.

   9   Receive inspection from the State Registration Service for the technical           1 day     no charge
       inventory of the building
       Agency : State Registration Service

       After obtaining the act of Acceptance, BuildCo has to obtain the technical
       passport. State Registration Service conducts an inspection of the
       completed building in order to issue the technical inventory of the building

       The Gosregister issues the receipt about the acceptance of the documents

       Procedure is expedited. The buyer receives his own copy of the agreement
       where the Registry certi ed the registration, as well as the technical
       documents (technical passport and state act on land property right) where
       Registry made correspondent alterations. In case when buyer and seller
       chose to register transaction without notary certi cation, directly at the
       State Register, the Procedures 1 and 2 are not needed.

       The documentation shall include:
       • Application (in the established form)
       • State act on land property right;
       • Technical original passport;

       The cost for the procedures was updated with the Order #215 of November
       19, 2013 of the State Register O ce. Thus, the cost for the 2 day registration
       is KGS 831 and for expedited procedure is KGS 1591. In practice, the
       expedited procedure still takes 2 business days.

 Takes place simultaneously with previous procedure.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                       Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if

                                                           - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                           - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                           - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                           largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the

                                                           - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                           The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                           loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                           of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                           to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                           where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                           property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                           In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                     equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                 - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                       movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.
