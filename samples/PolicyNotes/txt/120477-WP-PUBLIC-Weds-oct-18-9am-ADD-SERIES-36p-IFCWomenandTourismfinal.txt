4 WOMEN AND TOURISM: DESIGNING FOR INCLUSION
“We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.”
- Malala Yousafzai1




This preparatory World Bank paper on tourism and gender explains the
rationale for integrating a gender lens into tourism development projects.
It also includes a set of resources designed to help development professionals
and project managers get started and find necessary data.* This paper paves the
way for more in-depth operational research and data collection on what works
for empowering women in the tourism sector.

Many advancements have been made in empowerment of women, but women are
still far from enjoying the same basic rights, privileges and benefits that men do.
Women still earn much less than men, do a disproportionate amount of housework,
have fewer rights, less social mobility, and limited access to resources. Research by the
World Bank shows that women lag behind men in nearly all measures of economic
opportunity in every country in the world.2 These inequalities are even more extreme
in low income countries. Achieving greater gender equality is a critical step toward
the World Bank Group’s (WBG) goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared
prosperity, and tourism is one pathway towards achieving these goals.

The importance of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls have
been underscored in the 2012 World Development Report3 and the United Nations’
Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5). In 2015, following the adoption of the SDGs,
the WBG published a new Gender Strategy for 2016 to 2030. This strategy focuses on
how the WBG can move beyond gender mainstreaming toward greater transparency
on the gender-based outcomes of projects in client countries. It outlines four strategic
objectives for enhancing women’s economic empowerment:

i)	    improving human development,
ii)	   removing constraints for more and better jobs,
iii)	 removing barriers to women’s ownership of and control over assets, and
iv)	 enhancing women’s voice and agency.4

To operationalize these objectives, the strategy calls for stronger research and evidence
about what works for gender equality, and for more private-sector partnerships for
effective gender outcomes.

Tourism’s Comparative
Advantage for Women
Why travel and tourism offers more benefits



Travel and tourism have been proven to provide women with
more opportunities for empowerment compared to other
industries, giving the sector increased responsibility for the
advancement of women. According to the UN Global Report
on Women and Tourism 2010 by World Tourism Organization
(UNWTO) and UN Women, tourism provides better
opportunities for women’s participation in the workforce,
women’s entrepreneurship, and women’s leadership than
other sectors of the economy.17

Many studies report that women benefit from their
interactions with other cultures, which are facilitated by
tourism. Women interviewed for a study in Costa Rica,
Belize, and Honduras viewed working in tourism very
positively, saying that tourism provides them with a much
better life than other paid work in the dairy or citrus fruit
industries. Younger women also mentioned that it was a
great way to earn a living, and an opportunity to meet a
diverse array of people and gain more confidence through
these interactions.18

According to ILO’s 2010 analysis of developments and
challenges in the hospitality and tourism sector, women
made up between 60% to 70% of the labor force in
the hotel sector.19 In the Philippines, 58% of workers in
the accommodation and food industries are women.20
Not only are women employed in tourism, they have more
opportunity for advancement. A study in Bulgaria revealed
that 71% of managers and administrators in tourism are
women compared to just 29% in the country as a whole.
This is further reinforced by a 1997 European Union study,
which discovered that women held 63% of management
positions in tourism.21

14 WOMEN AND TOURISM: DESIGNING FOR INCLUSION
The emergence of the Women Entrepreneur’s Financing Initiative (We-Fi)*
in 2017, a USD1 billion fund for women entrepreneurs to be housed at the
World Bank, provides opportunities to take this agenda forward at scale.
To further this goal, this paper encourages project managers to incorporate a
gender lens into all stages of the project cycle. Considerations include:

•	    Analysis that puts greater focus on gender context and systematically
	     includes a breakdown of the client country’s tourism and gender
	     challenges and opportunities prior to intervention plans;
•	    Actions and interventions designed to encourage and enable women to
	     step outside of traditional gender roles and take higher paying jobs in
	     tourism; and
•	    Monitoring and evaluation that focuses on the quality, as well as quantity
	     of jobs held by women.

Preliminary Guidelines for
Applying a Gender Lens
at Each Project Stage
A holistic view of gender interventions


These guidelines will be of use to those involved in projects, as well as
those designing other kinds of tourism projects with a gender component.
For IFC and World Bank projects, an organization-wide gender tag
process is in place to indicate to project teams when and how gender
considerations need to be incorporated into project design. Further advice
on the Gender Tag for World Bank staff can be found through Operations,
Policies and Country Services (OPCS) platform.* Other development
agencies and institutions are likely to have similar arrangements.

Key Takeaways
and Next Steps
The path forward



Countries that capitalize on all their human potential, not just half of it, are more
competitive. Countless reports reveal that firms that include women on their
boards or as owners, executives, managers, and staff perform better in terms of
profitability, creativity, and sustainability.

The potential for a gender-equal tourism industry is
promising, but there is still much more to do to reduce
stereotypes, enable entrepreneurship, and foster leadership
by women.
Project managers and consultants can make important contributions during
project analysis, action, and design monitoring that can improve outcomes for
women. Change starts with good data which leads to awareness and innovation.

There are still large gaps in knowledge about what works to empower women in
tourism and why. Further empirical work is needed to determine the following:
why some regions have been more successful than others for women in tourism,
how to increase the number of women in formal and well-paid tourism jobs,
and why training might increase employment levels but not raise wages.40
In particular, there is a need to examine global case studies, workplace practices,
and operational results to further advance this discourse. This preparatory
paper was designed as a starting point for critical examination of tourism
projects so that all opportunities for the economic and social empowerment of
women are realized. Comments, feedback, and suggestions are encouraged and
appreciated.*
