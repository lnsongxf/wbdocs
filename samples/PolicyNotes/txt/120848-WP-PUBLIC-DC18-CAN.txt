About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                    Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      total prescribed building permit fee. Once the application has been received
      and payment is made, the application will be circulated to city divisions and
      external agencies for detailed technical review and comments.

      Within 30 days of payment of the application fee, a written notice will be
      provided to the applicant in regards to the completeness or incompleteness
      of the application and the applicant will be assigned a STAR stream and

      Agency : Toronto Municipal Authority

      A pre-consultation with City Sta (Planning Department) is advised. This step
      will help save time later on in the process. Several documents are needed in
      this application, including Site Plans, Floor Plans, Elevations, and SWM Plan


      Site Plan Control is legislated under Section 41 the Ontario Planning Act and
      allows the City to review and control important aspects of a proposed
      project -- for example, the site of buildings, landscaping, pedestrian access,
      parking, exterior design and appearance, storm water management and
      waste disposal.

      The municipality forwards the site plan to the re department for approval.
      On some occasions, a City councilor will get involved in the review of the site
      plan and community consultation may be requested by the Planner. The
      process can take anywhere from 3 month to 9 months depending on the
      complexity of the site plan, political interests, and on how often the applicant
      needs to revise the plan to meet the City's desired revisions. Once approved,
      the City often has conditions that need to be met before building permit can
      be obtained.

      The building permit is issued by the City of Toronto. BuildCo must post the
      building permit on the construction site. In certain cases, the process of
      reviewing the building permit application can be started by the City before
      the site plan is approved. The City can issue a temporary building permit at
      that time. However, the nal building permit cannot be issued before the site
      approval is granted. The building permit and the site plan approval are
      granted by di erent municipal departments. The site plan approval entails
      verifying planning compliance with the city bylaws (for instance, if enough
      parking spaces are included in the plans). In contrast, the building permit
      application review analyzes technical issues.                                                                              Page 13

  1   Submit application to Toronto Hydro and await comments on proposal                  15 calendar days       CAD 1,400
      Agency : Toronto Hydro

      An application for an electrical connection can be submitted through a
      written request by letter or email.
      Required documents:
      (1). Architectural, electrical, mechanical drawings (2). Survey plan and site
      plan (3).Locations of other services, gas, telephone, water, cable (4) required
      in-service date, proposed service entrance equipment, rated capacity and

      At this point Toronto Hydro requests for a preliminary design deposit based
      on ($10,000 per MVA of load) which is put towards the cost of the job once it
      proceeds.



  2   Await completion and approval of project design                                     13 calendar days       CAD 2,125
      Agency : Contractor

      The customer's electrical consultant prepares the design of service entrance
      requirement. The electrical design has to be approved by the Electrical
      Safety Authority. Usually the approval is obtained by the electrical
      consultant/hired electrical design rm.

  3   Submit nal design to Toronto Hydro and await o er to connect                        22 calendar days       CAD 0
      Agency : Toronto Hydro

      The customer’s private consultants will provide Toronto Hydro with the nal
      design drawings and requirements. Toronto Hydro prepares an O er to
      Connect, which includes the connection charges and schedule of work.
      During this time Toronto Hydro will check for feeder capacity, prepares the
      design scope and cost, and present the customer with an o er to connect.
      The OTC outlines the cost of the project and the responsibilities of each
      party.

      After the O er to Connect is issued, the applicant must sign and comply with
      all the conditions in the OTC before any further work can be completed,
      which includes payments.


      An external inspection is performed by the utility to prepare the o er to
      connect and the technical study. No one from the applicant's party is
      present during the inspection. Toronto Hydro submits an O er to Connect
      to the customer within 60 days of the request (all information required from
      the customer must be submitted).

  4   Await completion of external works by Toronto Hydro                                 80 calendar days       CAD 44,363
      Agency : Toronto Hydro

      After the estimate has been issued a part of the external connection works
      are carried out by Toronto Hydro. The works will most likely include the
      following: (a) Extend the overhead primary feeder cables down the street by
      installing a new pole line up to the point that is in line with the customer's
      building. (b) From an overhead feeder install a primary riser switch and
      fusing at the pole. (c) Construct underground ducts from the base of the
      pole up to the customer’s property line. (d) Install underground primary
      cable from the riser switch to the padmounted structure. (e) Install                                                      Page 21

       pole up to the customer’s property line. (d) Install underground primary
       cable from the riser switch to the padmounted structure. (e) Install
       padmounted transformer. (f) Make primary and secondary connection at
       padmounted transformer. The connection fees paid to Toronto Hydro
       include: engineering design, labor, material, equipment, overhead costs
       (including administration and inspection). The utility will obtain an
       excavation permit for the part of the work which is their responsibility.

       Toronto Hydro performs an economic evaluation on the "expansion" portion
       of the connection and the forecasted revenue of connecting this customer.
       In this case, the customer will have to provide a security deposit known as an
       Expansion Deposit. This expansion deposit will be returned to the customer,
       if the customer reaches its demand of 140 kVA within the rst ve years (i.e.
       after each year a portion of the expansion deposit will be given back relative
       to the demand realized). For the case study, the customer will receive the full
       amount back after the rst year of operation.

   5   Await completion of external works by contractor                                  14 calendar days   CAD 20,500
       Agency : Contractor

       While Toronto Hydro nishes its part of the connection works an electrical
       contractor proceeds with his part of the works. The contractor's work
       includes: a) Install padmounted structure on customer property. (b)
       Construct underground ducts from padmounted structure to join ducts
       provided by Toronto Hydro at property line and construct ducts
       underground from padmounted structure to Customer building. (c) Install
       secondary cable from padmounted transformer to building.

   6   Await and receive inspection of internal wiring                                   1 calendar day     CAD 650
       Agency : Electrical Safety Authority

       An inspection of internal wiring is required and can be performed by the
       Electrical Safety Authority at any time during rough in and nal stages of the
       process so there are at least two inspections of the internal wiring. The
       inspection would be performed by the Electrical Safety Authority, who in turn
       would submit a "Turn On Notice" to Toronto Hydro. This allows Toronto
       Hydro to provide the nal connection of power to the facility in question.

   7   Await nal inspection, meter installation and nal connection                       7 calendar days    CAD 0
       Agency : Toronto Hydro

       Once Toronto Hydro receives the connection authorization, the nal
       inspection is performed during meter installation and the nal connection
       can be made. There is no separate supply contract to be signed. The supply
       contract is signed at the same time as the connection contract in one
       contract.

                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s

                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or

                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for

documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                       several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the        - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                    and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                        economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                       - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                       - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees
                                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)             - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                       commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                       - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                               - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
                                                                                                                            Page 50

  Time to enforce the judgment
                                                      several assumptions about the case:
Cost required to enforce a contract through the       - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                   and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                       economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                      - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                      - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees
                                                      equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)            - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                      commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.
  Court structure and proceedings (-1-5)
                                                      - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                               - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                              - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                      movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Time (in years)     0.8               The maximum time permitted for a reorganization under the BIA is 6 months (statutory
                                      limit). Mirage would make an application to the court for reorganization under the BIA, and
                                      then Mirage´s reorganization plan would be negotiated and developed. The initial order
                                      granting protection under the BIA proceedings will contain a broad stay of proceedings
                                      against all creditors. The stay of proceedings is initially of 30 days and can be extended by
                                      court order. Assuming that there are any oppositions or appeals, the process will last 9
