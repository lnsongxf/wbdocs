vi   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
                                     Executive Summary
Economic progress in the Philippines will depend on the success of development in Mindanao. Because
Mindanao is the major center of conflict in the country, peace there means peace for the Philippines. Because
Mindanao holds about a quarter of the country’s population but about a third of its poor, significantly reducing
national poverty hinges on reducing poverty in Mindanao. Because Mindanao is the Philippines’ main source
of agricultural products, enhancing production there could reduce food and input prices, improve welfare,
and make Philippine products more competitive. Unless there is development in Mindanao, it is hard to see
how the Philippines can achieve sustained and inclusive growth.


The central policy challenge for Mindanao, like the rest of the Philippines, is how to accelerate inclusive
growth—the type that creates more and better jobs and reduces poverty. But that is more difficult in
Mindanao than in Luzon or the Visayas1 because armed conflict there is of long standing. Progress has been
made in making growth more inclusive, but Mindanao still trails the rest of the Philippines in shared prosperity.
Its per capita GDP, about US$1,800, is only about half the national level. Within the island, the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has the lowest per capita GDP, about US$700—just 8 percent of per
capita GDP in the National Capital Region. There has long been a lack of political will to tackle important
reforms that would combat severe underinvestment and institutional weaknesses in Mindanao.


    Agriculture is not very productive except for a few export crops, manufacturing is constrained
    by inadequate infrastructure, and the low-productivity, low-skill services sector has become the
               catch basin for excess agriculture workers who cannot find jobs in cities

Instead of rising agricultural productivity paving the way for a vibrant manufacturing and services sector
linked to the agriculture value chain, the converse has taken place in Mindanao. Agriculture is not very
productive except for a few export crops, manufacturing is constrained by inadequate infrastructure, and
the low-productivity, low-skill services sector has become the catch basin for excess agriculture workers who
cannot find jobs in cities. Lack of competition in key sectors, insecure property rights, complex regulations,
and severe underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and health—all exacerbated by the deficient
institutions—have led to this anomalous growth pattern, which has left the majority of the Mindanawons
without good jobs and has led to the emigration of many talented people. In addition, conflict arising from
land disputes deters investment and job creation.


Mindanao is a land of real potential that has a rich history. The southern island group of Mindanao, one of
the three major subdivisions of the Philippines, consists of main-island Mindanao, several small islands off
the northern and southern coast, and the Sulu Archipelago in the west, which stretches to Borneo. Mindanao
covers two-fifths of the country’s total land area, a third of territorial waters, and a fifth of the total population. In
2010, its population was 22 million, of whom 4.4 million (20 percent) were Muslims and 2.9 million (13 percent)

       Luzon and the Visayas are the Philippines’ two other major island groups, centering respectively on the cities of Manila and Cebu.

       indigenous people. In 2014, its nominal GDP was PHP1.9 trillion, 15 percent of Philippine GDP. Mindanao
       is blessed with a good climate for agriculture. Most of its provinces lie below the typhoon belt. It has fertile
       soil and a wide range of elevations suitable for a variety of crops; large deposits of minerals, such as gold,
       copper, and nickel; extensive forests (although of secondary growth); and vast marine wealth. Historically,
       Mindanao was the first area of the Philippines to develop. The Sultanates of Sulu and of Maguindanao had
       fairly well-developed governance systems as early as the 15th century, and close trade links with China and
       insular Southeast Asia.


       Despite its rich endowments, Mindanao’s growth and development outcomes are below potential. In the
       1960-70s, in terms of GDP per capita it was on a par with Luzon and three times richer than the Visayas.
       It has since trailed significantly in the pace and quality of economic growth. Perhaps more striking is the
       comparison to neighboring countries with a similar comparative advantage in agriculture. Although until
       1980 Mindanao was as rich as Thailand and richer than Indonesia and Vietnam, today their fortunes are
       reversed: today Thailand’s GDP per capita is triple that of Mindanao, and Indonesia’s is double. Minimal
       economic dynamism and high population growth, exacerbated by armed conflict, have resulted in few jobs
       being created, widespread poverty, and net emigration. Even though Mindanao’s comparative advantage
       lies in agriculture, many farmers and fishermen still live in or are vulnerable to poverty. Human development
       indicators are bad in Mindanao and even worse in the ARMM.2


                 Minimal economic dynamism and high population growth, exacerbated by armed conflict,
                     have resulted in few jobs being created, widespread poverty, and net emigration



       In Mindanao, the weakness of the economy is the result of decades of not only armed conflict but also a
       narrow growth strategy. Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient for good job creation and poverty
       reduction. What also matters is how broad-based and pro-poor the growth is. Unlike Luzon and the Visayas,
       which had a more diversified, innovative, and labor-intensive economic structure, Mindanao’s economy was
       driven by plantation crops, forestry, mining, and heavy manufacturing to support an import substitution regime.3
       Because these sectors were capital-intensive, involved little local processing, and reinvested little profit locally,
       they had low local multiplier effects. While they contributed to Mindanao’s high GDP per capita in earlier years,
       they created few jobs and hence did little to reduce poverty. In addition, trade and industrial protection policies
       taxed agriculture heavily.4 Thus, Mindanao’s growth path failed to build on the main comparative advantage:
       agriculture based on smallholders. Ultimately, this narrow growth model could not be sustained and contributed
       to conflict as wealth and power were concentrated in the hands of a small elite group. This drove economic and
       social injustice, the core cause of violent conflict in Mindanao (World Bank 2005).

                 ARMM is comprised of the following provinces: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao (except Cotabato City), Sulu, and
                 Tawi-Tawi.
       	
       3
                 The policy of import substitution to support local manufacturing lasted into the 1980s. It kept the exchange rate artificially overvalued, which
                 together with high effective protection and tax rates on agriculture, significantly eroded Mindanao’s agricultural competitiveness.
       	
       4
                 Free trade, a major source of income in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago for centuries, was declared illegal when Philippine customs
                 and tariff laws were passed. This drastically raised the cost of living because rice and other commodities had to be sourced from within
                 the country rather than from nearby Sabah, where food and oil are much cheaper. Maritime cabotage restrictions and domestic shipping
                 oligopolies, along with a lack of investment in ports, have constrained trade and the ability of Mindanao to export its agriculture produce
                 and capitalize on its comparative advantage.



viii       A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
Today, the jobs challenge facing Mindanao is daunting. In this report, jobs refer to what people do to make
a living, whether that is wage work or self-employment, formal or informal. Good jobs — jobs that raise
real income and lift people out of poverty — are needed for more than two million Mindanawons who are
today either unemployed5 or underemployed.6 In addition, large cohorts of youth will enter the labor force
in the next few years7 and better jobs are needed for the many Mindanawons who are currently employed
informally and who account for more than half of total employment in Mindanao.


The report proposes a strategy and specific interventions for Mindanao that will support sustainable peace
and development, including job creation. Resolving conflict in Mindanao rests on addressing the causes of
conflict and providing jobs and economic opportunities as alternatives to violence. The proposed framework
builds on the World Development Report (WDR) on conflict, security and development (World Bank 2011b).
Breaking the cycle of insecurity and reducing the risk of its recurrence requires a virtuous spiral of (1) restoring
confidence in collective action between groups who have been in conflict, and (2) transforming institutions to
provide a sustained level of security, justice, and jobs. “Restoring confidence” requires a deliberate effort by
both public and private actors to build sufficiently inclusive partnerships from the national to the community
level to launch confidence-building and institutional transformation and secure early gains. “Transforming
institutions” requires giving priority to early reforms of the institutions responsible for citizen security, justice,
and jobs. Building legitimate institutions can take a generation or more. Along the way short-term milestones
are necessary to maintain popular support.


              Accordingly, inclusive job creation can lay the foundations for peace by providing
               equitable access to economic opportunity for all, including people in remote,
                                         conflict-affected communities


However, job creation will not be enough. Where the cause of conflict is not economic, such as the struggle
for identity or self-rule, economic measures will not be enough to resolve the conflict. In Mindanao, peace
and development will hinge on the success of a political solution that addresses the causes of violence —
injustice, weak governance, land dispossession, discrimination, and sociocultural marginalization.8 However,
there are economic dimensions to conflict: some people who feel left out of the economy turn to armed
groups for both livelihood and social status. Accordingly, inclusive job creation can lay the foundations for
peace by providing equitable access to economic opportunity for all, including people in remote, conflict-
affected communities.


Unlocking Mindanao’s Potential
This report proposes a comprehensive strategy for unlocking Mindanao’s potential. Driving down poverty
and delivering on the government’s Strategic Framework for Mindanao Peace and Development will demand
a new approach to engagement in Mindanao. To support this, the World Bank is working with the Philippines

    government and on-site stakeholders to draw up a strategy for regional development in Mindanao. The
    three main components are: (1) raise agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2)
    boost human development; and (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility and build up institutions in ARMM
    and conflict-affected areas.


    The strategy will build on Mindanao’s comparative advantage and tighten its links with the rest of South East
    Asia. It identifies three priorities for interventions to unlock agricultural potential: (1) raise farm productivity
    through agrospatial approaches and productive alliances; (2) build up logistics services, improve roads from
    fields to markets; and (3) develop key ports and modernize customs procedures.


    Connectivity bottlenecks are compounded by limited human capital, especially skills deficits. Over 80
    percent of Mindanao’s farmers and fishermen are poor or near- poor and lack scale and skills to compete.
    To maximize productivity in Mindanao, a number of interventions are planning to address shortfalls in the
    inter-locking areas of basic education and skills and job creation. The plan gives special attention to youth in
    conflict-affected areas.


    Security, justice, and economic stresses are linked. To ensure the success of violence prevention and
    recovery, a specialized suite of interventions is planned for fragile environments, combining elements of
    security, justice, institution-building, and economic transformation.


        Engagement strategies will be adapted to areas with a clear potential for further growth and
        private investment; other strategies and interventions will respond to the particular needs of
      conflict-affected and more poverty stricken areas and support the peace agreements and peace-
                                  promoting socioeconomic development


    Certain guiding principles recognize the need in both designing and carrying out the strategy to differentiate
    delivery modalities and ensure conflict sensitivity. Engagement strategies will be adapted to areas with a
    clear potential for further growth and private investment; other strategies and interventions will respond to
    the particular needs of conflict-affected and more poverty stricken areas and support the peace agreements
    and peace-promoting socioeconomic development. Activities will need to be adapted to the local context
    and different types of institutions, such as national and local government agencies, the ARMM government,
    potentially the Bangsamoro Transitional Authority and future Bangsamoro government, and other institutions.
    From the design phase on, the interventions proposed will be based on analysis of specific drivers of conflict
    and fragility to ensure that (1) activities address these drivers, and (2) proposed interventions will not have
    counterproductive impacts. A minimum level of security is essential for making possible many interventions.
    The proposed strategy and its interventions could have wide-ranging benefits, for, e.g., the whole nation
    due to customs reform, for subsistence farmers and day laborers in Mindanao accessing farm-to-market
    roads (FMRs) in the poorest areas, and for Mindanao’s youth seeking training for employment. The strategy
    also reaches across the divide between non-conflict and conflict-affected areas and will support peace-
    promoting catch-up socioeconomic interventions as well as longer-term economic opportunities that
    would help reduce the risk of conflict in the future. The World Bank engagement in Mindanao will be
    based on this strategy.




x    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
Policy Recommendations: How to Address the Job Challenge
A special focus of the strategy for regional development in Mindanao is to provide specific and practical
recommendations on how to address Mindanao’s jobs challenge. The report strives to complement
good analysis with policy recommendations that respond to the “how to reform” question. Key policy
recommendations are made in separate sections of the report on (1) increasing agricultural productivity
by improving extension and irrigation services, along with price reforms to realize Mindanao’s agriculture
potential; (2) building up logistics and transport connectivity by improving road networks and the efficiency of
shipping services to reduce trade costs; (3) improving the supply of reliable power and the speed, affordability
,and quality of information and communications technology (ICT) services by fostering competition; and
(iv) supporting private investment by addressing the growing skills gap, the high regulatory burden for
businesses, and by improving financial inclusion and the governance of land. A dedicated section considers
economic policies that can support the resolution of Mindanao’s longstanding violent conflicts.


The Need for Broad-based Progress throughout the Island Group
Growth and poverty reduction in Mindanao as a whole will require making agriculture more productive,
particularly the smallholders. Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries employ almost half of all workers, yet 78
percent of individuals with incomes below the poverty line live in rural areas. Rural areas are meanwhile
dependent on cities for food processing (e.g., canning, bottling, and packing), marketing, and logistics
support to bring produce to the rest of the country and to the world. In 2012, about 60 percent of Mindanao’s
economy and employment was driven by agriculture value chains, of which about half was contributed by
urban areas. By connecting agrarian and conflict-affected Mindanao to national and global value chains,
cities serve as conduits of rural development.


Recently, as the formal services sector has evolved the major Mindanao cities have become a more
independent source of growth, for example in information technology and business processing operations
(IT-BPO). IT-BPO services have been increasing in Davao and Cagayan de Oro (CDO) by about 20 percent
annually. Remittances from overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are also drivers of service sector growth. For
instance, over half of new condominium units are sold to OFWs intending to retire in Mindanao.



   In 2012, about 60 percent of Mindanao’s economy and employment was driven by agriculture
                 value chains, of which about half was contributed by urban areas


Policy should operate to better connect rural and urban spaces rather than taking an oversimplified
approach to equalize public expenditures across areas. Policies should therefore focus on inclusive
development in rural and remote areas (e.g., investing in basic education and healthcare, and getting the
basics of agriculture right for smallholders) and economic integration (e.g., investing in power, logistics, and
Internet, and simplifying regulations). This could make urban spaces demand centers for rural products.
In this way, the rest of Mindanao, especially conflict-affected areas, can benefit from the growth of Manila,
Cebu, and Mindanao’s leading cities.




                                                                            A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   xi
      Policies to Make Agriculture More Productive
      The majority of Mindanao’s farmers, the smallholders, can only work with large farms and connect to
      markets and agribusinesses if their crops are more productive. An effective rural development agenda
      needs to address primarily the basic constraints of smallholders. First, the resolution of land disputes while
      respecting traditional land allocation practices, and measures to secure land titles in an equitable manner,
      would encourage economic efficiency. This is fundamental for development and job creation in Mindanao.
      Second, investing in education and health of farming households would allow for more gainful employment
      and higher household income. Together, human capital development and more secure property rights could
      be the catalyst for investment that helps raise the current low returns to labor and land.


      Coordinated efforts by government, educational institutions, and the private sector could strengthen
      extension services. Extension services could be better administered if services now provided by several
      national agencies were consolidated. Increased funding could facilitate broader provision of services and
      support the efforts of Department of Agriculture (DoA) regional offices to support local government services
      and coordinate national and local services. The number of educational institutions with a mandate to provide
      services could be increased, while reorienting incentives for academics to favor extension, providing more
      resources, and offering training in practical agricultural skills. Civil service organizations, successful farmers’
      organizations, and private firms also could play a more effective role in extension services, perhaps supported
      by government efforts to improve their coordination. Finally, agricultural research could have more impact if
      the emphasis on rice were reduced and resources shifted from specific commodities programs to research
      that targets gaps in promising value chains, and adaptation to climate change.


            Agricultural research could have more impact if the emphasis on rice were reduced and

                                 value chains, and adaptation to climate change


      Efforts to decentralize responsibility for operations and maintenance to irrigators associations should
      continue, with encouragement for increased participation in community procurement, to improve the
      management and sustainability of investments. Irrigation has not been used much to raise agricultural
      production because of low investment and inadequate maintenance. While more government investment is
      expanding irrigation in Mindanao, what is urgently needed is better planning and more incentives for efficient
      water use. An inventory of water resources would help ensure that investment in irrigation takes into account
      their sustainability. Irrigation service fees are important to finance both the operation and maintenance of
      irrigation systems and the organizational development activities of irrigators associations.


      While distortions in agricultural prices have been reduced by replacing across-the-board subsidies with
      targeted programs and opening rice imports to private sector participation, some laws still make it hard
      for farmers to diversify into more profitable crops. Lowering barriers to the import of food products, such
      as removing the import quota for rice and reducing tariffs on other food products, would improve the real
      incomes of both urban consumers and the many poor farmers who are net buyers of food. It would also
      reduce widespread illegal importation of rice.

Improving Connectivity by Expanding and Upgrading Roads
Better rural roads would reduce transportation costs and product losses for poor farmers and could make
a major contribution to reducing poverty. Local government units should be given incentives for planning
rural roads and allocating road funds so as to promote productivity, equity, and the potential for creating jobs
into consideration (e.g., more resources could be devoted to unconnected sitios9). A comprehensive rural
roads plan that such considerations into account, establishing a central inventory of road projects, and closer
coordination of the various agencies involved in road improvements could make funding allocation more
strategic. In conflict-affected areas, rural road investments should be targeted to remote villages. Connecting
them opens up market access and extends the footprint of the state, which would address grievances that
sustain the insurgency. Furthermore, devoting resources to alternatives to road investments in the most remote
areas, by investing in horses, cable lines, and pathway clearing, could suffice and improve transportation.



    One option is to channel all trade with other Philippine island groups and the rest of the world
        through the Mindanao International Container Terminal (MICT) near Cagayan de Oro


More centralized planning of urban road projects would better connect cities with each other and with the
countryside. While the Philippines is devoting more resources devoted to the construction of national roads,
congestion (particularly of roads leading to ports); the still-limited network (paved-road densities are much
higher in Luzon than in Mindanao), and inadequate maintenance impair safety and slow the shipment of goods.
In the short term, the emphasis should be on closer coordination of road projects; ensuring that all projects
are geotagged and mapped; constructing bypass roads to reduce congestion around the ports in Cagayan
de Oro, Davao, and Zamboanga; and moving forward on projects already underway and in the pipeline. As
resources become available, attention should turn to upgrading national roads to concrete and local roads to
at least asphalt, expanding high-volume road segments, and making roads in mountainous areas safer.


Reducing Trade Costs
Shipping is expensive in the Philippines. The average port-to-port cost per nautical mile in the Philippines is
almost double that of Indonesia, and in Mindanao costs are likely to be even higher, given the small scale of
shipments, distance from trading partners, and the inability of many ports to accommodate modern vessels.
The costs are then pushed up further by regulatory barriers to entry into provision of shipping services;
the complexities of obtaining approvals (several steps require travel to Manila or a regional center outside
of Mindanao); the Philippine Ports Authority’s incentive to approve increases in cargo rates; requirements
that dry docking and repair be undertaken in the Philippines rather than in less expensive foreign ports,
prohibitions on foreign ships servicing domestic routes, and a VAT tax regime that limits chartering.


Costs could be slashed by consolidating port operations to increase scale. One option is to channel all trade
with other Philippine island groups and the rest of the world through the Mindanao International Container
Terminal (MICT) near Cagayan de Oro. Another is to ship all domestic cargo through the MICT and foreign
cargo through Davao. Another way to reducing shipping costs is to promote private sector competition to
provide services within ports. Eliminating the need for domestic vessels to obtain a license to ship goods to

      foreign ports would facilitate partnerships between domestic and foreign companies, which would open up
      access to technology and a larger market, strengthen safety standards, and enable operators to choose the
      mix of domestic and export cargo that maximizes cargo load. Laws and regulations could also be revised
      to ensure that VAT is not charged on the full value of ships chartered for temporary periods, eliminate the
      requirement to dry dock and repair domestic ships exclusively in the Philippines, and shift port tariffs from a
      percentage of cargo-handling fees (which in part determines revenues to the PPA) to a fixed annual charge
      to reduce the PPA incentive to push up cargo fees. Allowing foreign ships to service domestic ports could
      significantly reduce shipping costs. While removing all cabotage10 restrictions would require removing the
      Constitutional limitation on foreign ownership of domestic shipping, restrictions could be eased through
      executive action (e.g., simplifying procedures for and increasing issuance of special permits to ancillary and
      adjunct cargo on high-impact routes).


      Reducing the regulatory burdens on shipping companies also could reduce costs. That can be done by
      fully implementing the National Single Window (NSW) automated system (especially for small traders on
      Mindanao), using risk management assessments to allocate resources devoted to enforcement, making more
      information available on the processes and fees required of private firms, eliminating redundant regulatory
      requirements, increasing the use of on-line systems to grant approvals, and devolving more responsibility for
      approvals to regional and port offices.


      Philippine agricultural exports are often rejected in foreign countries for failure to meet sanitary and
      phytosanitary standards (SPS). Oversight, equipment, and training in many DoA laboratories is substandard,
      policies for accrediting private laboratories are inconsistent, and traders complain of delays in securing
      export permits. To improve the reliability and reputation of agricultural exports, more resources must be
      devoted to testing, increasing laboratory capacity, and updating technology, and to improve compliance for
      major export products and target high-risk traders.


              Low prices for hydroelectric power from the grid have discouraged large-scale private
           investment in power generation, and the unreliability of power sources has led many firms to
                  invest in relatively small-scale, and thus high cost, oil-fired power generation


      The Importance of Sustainable Power Resources
      Frequent and lengthy power outages in Mindanao impose huge costs on businesses by interrupting
      production and damaging equipment. The power outages are also a major source of discontent because they
      fuel Mindanawons feelings of neglect. Low prices for hydroelectric power from the grid have discouraged
      large-scale private investment in power generation, and the unreliability of power sources has led many firms
      to invest in relatively small-scale, and thus high cost, oil-fired power generation. Inadequate maintenance,
      underinvestment in alternative power sources, rising demand for power, and competing water uses have
      drastically reduced excess capacity and led to a severe power crisis during the 2011 El Niño. The destruction
      of transmission towers by armed forces, unclear property rights that affect right-of-way access, and poor
      governance practices in electricity cooperatives have further reduced power availability and raised costs.

             Cabotage here refers to the shipping rights within the country.


xiv    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
The government and the private sector supply have responded strongly to the energy crisis. Work on new
power capacity and in improving transmission networks is underway, efforts are being made to improve
security, the process for approving new power plants is being streamlined, and governance reforms have
been proposed for electricity cooperatives. The private sector is building new coal-fired plants, which should
assure adequate power supply until early in the next decade and is already driving down prices.


       There is also an urgent need to provide off-grid solutions, such as solar home systems,
            for remote or conflict-affected areas that are likely to be left behind despite
                                 the recent progress on production.


Nevertheless, planning should begin now to cope with the expected increases in demand and to make the
power sector more environmentally sustainable. This might involve restructuring contracts to raise power
prices to levels that reflect their economic value and diversifying power sources (e.g., to natural gas and solar)
to limit demands on scarce water resources and reduce reliance on coal- and oil-fired plants. These plants are
increasing urban pollution and, unless policies change, will make it difficult for Mindanao to help the country
meet its Paris Agreement commitments to reduce carbon emissions. It is critical that Mindanao avoid being
locked into large, environmentally-destructive carbon power generation that could constrain development
of alternative energy sources for the foreseeable future. There is also an urgent need to provide off-grid
solutions, such as solar home systems, for remote or conflict-affected areas that are likely to be left behind
despite the recent progress on production.


Changes to Spur Competition
Internet speed in Mindanao is much slower, and prices much higher, than in the rest of the country, a major
limitation on Mindanao’s IT and business process outsourcing industry. Poor Internet services are largely the
result of a lack of competition; the market for both fixed and mobile broadband services is almost entirely
controlled by two vertically integrated telecoms firms. This market structure is driven by legal restrictions that
limit foreign ownership of telecom companies to 40 percent; difficulties involved in obtaining the required
congressional approval and licenses (only telecoms companies can sell Internet connectivity, purchase data
from international gateway facilities, or distribute bandwidth); and prohibitions against Internet services
providers building their own networks. Yet sales of Internet services are either poorly regulated or not
regulated at all; spectrum allocation is neither competitive nor transparent; there is no competitions policy
for telecoms; enforcement of consumer protections is inadequate; and many current laws are obsolete,
rendering many stipulations and penalties useless. Essentially, there is little to restrain the duopoly from
charging whatever it likes for poor quality services. A further drag on service quality and availability is the
lack of serious investment in fiber optic cables and cellular towers, which is compounded by regulatory
obstruction, difficulties in securing right of ways, and a lack of coordination with public works projects to
share the network and the cost of civil works.


A complete revamping of the sector to encourage competition could greatly improve Internet services.
The national broadband plan to identify policy reforms is a first step. Achieving open access for Internet
services, which is the best approach to establishing a competitive market, would require amending the
Constitution to remove limits on foreign ownership of utilities. Even without constitutional change, however,



                                                                             A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   xv
      competition could be spurred, for example, by reducing the need for Congressional approval for some
      service providers and allowing domestic firms to use infrastructure owned by telecom firms. Connectivity
      could be expanded through the sharing of Internet infrastructure and simplifying the approval process for
      sharing the cost of civil works. Establishing a competitions policy for the internet, enforcing current antitrust
      laws, setting clear guidelines for spectrum allocation, and penalizing false advertising could add weight to
      regulatory oversight. More public investment, e.g., in new landing stations and the BIMP-EAGA Submarine
      Terrestrial cable system, and attracting more investment through public-private partnerships and providing
      subsidies to depressed areas could greatly enhance the infrastructure supporting the Internet.


      Reforms to improve IT connectivity could promote greater job growth in Mindanao. Faster and more
      accessible Internet services would also create opportunities for Internet-based delivery of health and
      education services to remote communities.


      Addressing the Growing Skills Shortage and Rising Inequality
      Highly-skilled technical workers are at a premium in Mindanao, undermining growth of the manufacturing,
      construction, utility, and IT-BPO sectors. Skills shortages are exacerbated by low rates of enrollment, cohort
      survival, and completion in basic education, and by the migration of graduates to more prosperous areas
      of the country and abroad. Government and business should work together to offer more scholarships
      in engineering and science, and collaborative efforts in Manila to improve the IT curriculum and improve
      foreign language skills could be expanded to Mindanao.


             Training programs are targeted at secondary school graduates, who are largely middle-
            or upper-income, and few programs provide training in skills relevant to the sectors where
                                most poor people work, particularly agriculture



      The inequitable distribution of education and training perpetuates inequality, as is particularly evident in the
      limited economic opportunities for indigenous groups. For example, educational outcomes in the ARMM
      are much worse than national averages. In addition, training programs are targeted at secondary school
      graduates, who are largely middle- or upper-income, and few programs provide training in skills relevant to
      the sectors where most poor people work, particularly agriculture. Expanding training to workers with only
      basic education, linking community-based training to non-formal basic education programs offered by the
      Department of Education, and improving coordination between training and livelihood assistance programs
      and employment facilitation services could make it easier for workers who are poor to improve their skills.
      These efforts should be accompanied by investments in management and information systems to evaluate
      their impact. Finally, a substantial expansion of investment in basic education, particularly in underserved
      communities, could help reduce inequality. Additional financial incentives will be required to encourage
      teachers to work in remote and conflict-affected areas. Outsourcing the delivery of education services to
      NGOs (such as schools in ARMM) should be considered where government capacity is inadequate.




xvi   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
Regulation of Labor Markets and the Business Environment
While minimum wages vary widely in Mindanao, on average the minimum wage is high compared to other
parts of the Philippines and other East Asian countries. This reduces firm competitiveness. While only 10
percent of workers in Mindanao are covered, there is some evidence that the minimum wage requirements
are associated with low levels of employment in manufacturing. Moreover, coverage of labor regulations is
likely to expand over the medium term as the formal sector expands. Limiting the number of wage brackets
would improve transparency, while removing exemptions; enforcing the lower minimum wage (the poverty
threshold) for exempted establishments would expand coverage and perhaps reduce poverty.


Requirements for business registration, securing construction permits, and registering property are more
cumbersome and time-consuming in urban Mindanao than in other East Asian cities. Requirements for
frequent renewal, the multiplicity of licenses and permits required for business start-up and operation, the lack
of coordination between government agencies and with private service providers, limited use of the Internet
or other modern technology, and the need to travel to Manila or a regional center for some approvals all
contribute to high costs and excessive time spent in meeting regulatory requirements for businesses. The high
tax rate and the large number of payments required per year further increase costs, particularly for small firms.


     Ultimately, an online or mobile registration and payments system would drastically reduce
     business costs, but it would have to be accompanied by improvements in Internet services



Regulatory requirements are gradually being simplifed. National and local governments are signing
memoranda of agreement (MOAs) that commit them to reduce the steps involved in starting a business,
a practice which may soon reach cities in Mindanao. Some Mindanao cities are streamlining their business
approval processes through the RS4LGU (Regulatory Simplification for LGUs) program. Some cities in
Mindanao have passed executive orders to simplify their own business licensing systems. Davao and CDO
introduced a single assessment of all business permit fees, Davao is speeding applications and payments for
fire-safety evaluation clearances, and CDO has computerized its business registration process.


Much can be done to reduce the time and cost related to starting and operating a business. Among
these are implementation of the Philippine Business Registry (PBR) at the national level and the Regulatory
Simplification for LGUs (RS4LGU) program at the local government level, coupled with training and
incentives for compliance; harmonizing national and local requirements to reduce overlaps and redundant
requirements; weeding out unnecessary requirements; and reducing the frequency of renewals of government
licenses, permits, and employment clearances. Improvements in transparency, such as prominent displays
of requirements and service standards in government offices, would make compliance easier. Ultimately, an
online or mobile registration and payments system would drastically reduce business costs, but it would have
to be accompanied by improvements in Internet services. Simplifying tax forms and registration, facilitating
tax payments while eliminating some bookkeeping and reporting requirements, and integrating national
and local taxes and compliance systems could increase revenues, reduce corruption, and particularly ease
the tax compliance burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).




                                                                             A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   xvii
        Better Governance of Land
        Building up the governance framework for land will require allocating more resources and streamlining
        regulation. Better administration can make property rights more secure, minimize land disputes, and raise
        tax revenues. In the process it can also help finance much-needed infrastructure to make Mindanao’s cities
        more competitive. Effective land management can help manage urban growth, allocate land to its best use,
        contribute to food security, manage migration and informal settlement, reduce negative externalities like
        congestion, pollution, and crime, and manage natural disasters.


        For all aspects of land management, this report recommends, first, preparation of a physical plan for urban
        Mindanao and zoning plans for all types of land, followed by building a comprehensive mapping and
        database of land parcels. Over the medium term a national land use code could guide local planning.
        On titling and registration, it would be useful to prepare land tenure improvement plans as a basis for
        titling and other forms of tenure security and streamline the Registries of Deeds (RoDs) registration process.
        Enhancement of property taxation will depend on greater transparency and ensuring that properties better
        reflect market prices by creating a National Valuation Authority to centralize the review and approval of
        property valuations.


        Improving Prospects for Financial Inclusion in Mindanao
        The expansion of financial services in Mindanao must be accompanied by a significant effort to improve
        financial education and awareness. There may be an opportunity to gradually introduce financial education as
        part of community development programs, cooperatives support programs, and conditional cash transfers.
        This could help people learn to gradually rely on a broader set of financial instruments.


                On titling and registration, it would be useful to prepare land tenure improvement plans
                        as a basis for titling and other forms of tenure security and streamline the
                                      Registries of Deeds (RoDs) registration process


        There is a particular need in ARMM for targeted interventions to increase financial inclusion. One possible
        approach is to consider integrating financially inclusive dimensions in support programs delivered in ARMM by
        the government and development partners, especially ways to diversify from reliance on grants to alternative
        financing arrangements, such as repayable or matching grants and credit finance arrangements in programs
        supporting entrepreneurship. Also, to increase access to less-expensive formal credit there is a need to
        consider integrating market-based mechanisms to support the development of local financial intermediaries
        and facilitate a mind-shift in local individuals and businesses toward financial sustainability and viability as the
        region recovers from conflict. There is also potential for the use of mobile financial services and other service
        delivery innovations to better serve local needs. Since men are less likely to use financial services, it is likely that
        conflict in the ARMM area is an exacerbating factor and needs to be considered as interventions are designed.


        An Islamic finance framework is an important element of any financial inclusion effort in ARMM. The National
        Commission for Muslim Filipinos, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Amanah Bank, and the Development Bank of
        the Philippines have worked with stakeholders and the legislature to put forward a bill amending the law so




xviii    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
that Amanah Bank can offer Islamic banking in the Philippines (World Bank 2015). In parallel with updating
the general legal basis for Islamic banking, consideration of piloting approaches for Shari’ah-compliant
microfinance is recommended.


Supporting Efforts to Bring Peace to Mindanao
Five decades of violence has depressed growth and poverty reduction. Conflict, which has destroyed
infrastructure and kept businesses small-scale and smallholders at subsistence levels to avoid kidnap and
extortion, has affected 62 percent of Mindanao’s population. About 60 percent of those resident in conflict-
affected areas lives below the poverty line. Millions of people have been displaced: in August 2014 almost a
million internally displaced persons resided in Mindanao and another million may have moved to Sabah in
search of a better life. Even in areas of Mindanao that are relatively unaffected by conflict, the violence has
limited investment and tourism revenues.


Economic policies and programs can support peace efforts by providing jobs for workers who might
otherwise be tempted to join extremists’ armed groups or organized crime, and by doing a better job
of delivering basic government services. The conflicts can only be resolved by reaching a settlement on
grievances that are rooted in longstanding social and political disputes. While many who take part in violence
do so for ideological reasons, others join armed groups to escape poverty. Economic policies can support
peace efforts by ensuring that jobs are available for workers who would otherwise have little alternative than
to engage in violence, and by strengthening the delivery of basic government services.


        Education can be reformed by continuing to improve personnel and payroll systems,
         streamlining merit-based recruitment processes, decentralizing spending control,
       and increasing the involvement of civil society and communities in education planning,
                                  implementation, and monitoring


Delivering government programs and basic services more effectively could help anchor stabilization. Cash-
for-work programs would benefit poor individuals as well as local communities. Entrepreneurship programs
could provide small cash grants to groups of people with approved business plans. To ensure equity, these
programs should target those most at risk of engaging in conflict, such as decommissioned combatants, out-
of-school youths, and internally displaced people, as well as those who are poor generally. Partnering with
civic organizations and universities could improve basic service delivery, but monitoring and evaluation of
all these programs is essential to support efficient scaling up. Programs should be accompanied by training
appropriate for workers in conflict-affected areas, and take into account private sector recommendations on
the curriculum and demand for skills. The government also could support projects that promote Mindanao’s
rich cultural, ethnic and religious diversity and help organize contract-growing schemes bringing together
smallholders and agribusinesses.


Normalization includes the support to the development of communities which are impacted by conflict and,
in parallel, specialized support to decommissioned combatants. Interventions are needed to support the
transition of combatants to civilians. For longer term support and sustainable development of livelihoods,
decommissioned combatants could be linked with agricultural development projects, job skills and



                                                                           A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   xix
     employment facilitation interventions, as well as with interventions to increases access to basic education for
     children of decommissioned combatants.


     Locally-generated fiscal resources are few and government administration is weak in many conflict-affected
     areas, due to a lack of political contestability and minimal presence of the central government. Local leaders
     are often active in the “shadow economy” of informal markets and illicit activity, such as illegal logging
     and mining, smuggling of goods and people, and the sale of narcotics and weapons. Unregulated profits
     gained through the shadow economy make it harder to grow the formal economy. Decades of violence has
     depressed investment in roads, bridges, health clinics, and schools, and ports and shipping services remain
     expensive and inefficient. Educational attainment, test scores, and literacy rates are significantly lower,
     maternal mortality is higher, immunizations are fewer, and access to health care is more limited in the ARMM
     than in the rest of Mindanao and in other areas of the Philippines.


     Given the scale and complexity of land conflict, promoting more equitable access to land will require
     systematic support. Measures to address land conflict can succeed only if they have solid support of both
     national and regional political actors. In the short to medium term, mechanisms to resolve land conflicts need
     to be expanded. Experience across Mindanao suggests that hybrid institutions that marry the authority of the
     state and the social legitimacy of transitional institutions can be effective. In the long term, it will be crucial
     to ensure effective reform of land administration policy and management both nationally and in Mindanao.


          To make progress in both education and health innovative approaches are necessary, such as
           training traditional birth attendants, using the Internet to provide health services, involving
              traditional institutions in education, and supplementing salaries for work in remote or
                                              particularly insecure areas


     Health services can be reformed by expanding coverage of PhilHealth, constructing more health clinics, hiring
     more staff, and emphasizing maternal and infant health services. Education can be reformed by continuing
     to improve personnel and payroll systems, streamlining merit-based recruitment processes, decentralizing
     spending control, and increasing the involvement of civil society and communities in education planning,
     implementation, and monitoring. To make progress in both education and health innovative approaches are
     necessary, such as training traditional birth attendants, using the Internet to provide health services, involving
     traditional institutions in education, and supplementing salaries for work in remote or particularly insecure
     areas. Finally, the national government could rely on NGOs or the private sector to provide services in areas
     where the local government is not functioning effectively or lacks capacity to meet the demand for services.


     Given the unique context of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi (Basulta), development options for this region
     could be also unique. Options range from converting Basulta into a free trade zone, to regularizing consular
     services for almost half a million Filipinos in Sabah. This could reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade,
     and help Filipinos get better jobs and access to social services. As a result, higher remittances could help
     Basulta stabilize and grow.

Introduction

1.	   A historic opportunity has arisen to address Mindanao’s long history of conflict, limited development,
      and high rates of poverty. For the first time ever, the president of the Philippines, leaders of both houses
      of Congress, and a majority of cabinet secretaries are from Mindanao. Moreover, peace negotiations
      with both the Muslim and communist insurgent groups is underway, and the national economy is
      enjoying robust growth. This report builds on the Philippines Development Report Creating More
      and Better Jobs (World Bank 2013) to arrive at a better understanding of Mindanao’s economic
      development challenges and to suggest policy priorities for the future. It presents the most important
      policy recommendations, some of which emerging from intensive consultations with stakeholders in
      Mindanao and the rest of the Philippines.


2.	   Boosting development in Mindanao is essential for the economic progress of the entire country. A large
      proportion of the country’s poor are in Mindanao: Mindanao holds about 25 percent of the country’s
      population but 37 percent of the country’s poor. Thus, significantly reducing poverty nationally depends
      on reducing poverty in Mindanao. Moreover, Mindanao is the country’s major source of agricultural
      products, so increasing production there could reduce food and input prices nationally, improve public
      welfare, and heighten the competitiveness of the entire Philippine agriculture. Achieving successful
      development in Mindanao will be a major test of the country’s ability to achieve its long-term vision of
      rapid, sustained, and more inclusive growth.


3.	   Resolving conflict in Mindanao rests on addressing its root causes of conflict and providing jobs and
      economic opportunities as alternatives to violence. The main drivers of the conflict are both economic
      and political. Attaining a just and lasting peace requires a political solution to address the causes
      of conflict—injustice, weak governance, land conflicts, and discrimination. The peace agreements
      that have been signed are not enough alone to put all of Mindanao on the path of inclusive growth.
      Peace can be secured only by both addressing the sources of conflict and creating jobs and economic
      opportunities. Fostering economic development is necessary to support stabilization. Jobs provide
      opportunity to those who have not previously felt the benefits of economic growth.


                                                                             A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   1
    4.	    This report adds value because its inclusive approach of engaging with a broad-based group of
           stakeholders at the time of both analysis and engagement has served a means of building support
           for needed reforms. The goal was to generate ownership among Mindanawons through consultations
           which were guided by mostly local technical experts. For the analysis, the World Bank partnered with
           leading universities, think tanks, experts, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Some 90 percent
           of the extended team came from within Mindanao, and they contributed more than 40 background
           papers. The study’s inclusive approach was to listen intently to government, business, labor, civil society,
           and vulnerable groups who are often left out in the engagement process, such as indigenous people,
           Moro women, out-of-school youth, combatants, and internally displaced people. From January 2015 to
           June 2016, some 1,500 stakeholders were consulted. Finally, 10 eminent individuals with government,
           business, labor, and civil society experience provided strategic advice to the report team.


    5.	    The second important value-addition of the report is that it is a report about the whole of Mindanao.
           Much of the previous research is focusing only on conflict-affected areas or on specific economic
           sectors in Mindanao, but this study looked for ways to grow the entire Mindanao economy. Conflict and
           nonconflict areas in Mindanao are closely interconnected on maps that depict product movements, for
           instance. Because nonconflict areas and cities serve as consolidation stations for produce from conflict
           areas, developments in the latter have profound implications for the rest of Mindanao and vice versa.
           Mindanao’s jobs challenge can only be addressed effectively if the development strategy seamlessly
           connects conflict and lagging regions to growth poles, so that all of Mindanao can benefit. Addressing
           constraints in any area will therefore improve economic activity and job creation throughout Mindanao.


    6.	    The report complements the rich literature on peace building in Mindanao by recognizing that jobs
           and economic opportunities are central to stabilization and peace. Conflict affects nearly 60 percent of
           all Mindanao’s local government units (LGUs). Breaking the cycle of insecurity and reducing the risk of
           its recurrence requires a virtuous spiral of restoring confidence in collective action and transforming
           institutions so that they can provide sustainable security, justice, and jobs (World Bank 2011). Jobs
           offer a stake in society to groups that might otherwise receive more respect and recognition from
           engaging in armed violence rather than lawful activities. However, job creation will need to be
           managed carefully to ensure equity and avoid favoring any group, as that could exacerbate tension
           rather than underpin stability.


    7.	    Finally, building on the dialogue with the Philippine government and stakeholders in Mindanao,
           this report proposes a strategy for regional development in Mindanao. The three main components
           are to (1) raise agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2) boost human
           development; and (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility and strengthen institutions in ARMM and
           conflict-affected areas. The World Bank engagement for Mindanao will be based on this strategy.


    8.	    Policy recommendations are made in four separate categories: (1) increasing agricultural productivity
           by improving extension and irrigation services, along with price reforms to realize Mindanao’s
           agriculture potential; (2) building up logistics and transport connectivity by improving road networks
           and the efficiency of shipping services to reduce trade costs; (3) improving the supply of reliable power
           and the speed, affordability, and quality of information and communications technology (ICT) services


2    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
      by fostering competition; and (iv) supporting private investment by addressing the growing skills gap,
      the high regulatory burden for businesses, and by improving financial inclusion and the governance of
      land. A separate section considers economic policy measures to support the resolution of Mindanao’s
      longstanding violent conflicts.


9.	   It will not be easy for Mindanao to achieve rapid and sustainable growth. Productivity in agriculture
      is low except for a few export crops, manufacturing is constrained by weak infrastructure, and a
      low-productivity, low-skill services sector has become the catch basin for excess agriculture workers
      who cannot find jobs in cities. Lack of competition in key sectors, insecure property rights, complex
      regulations, and severe underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and health—not to mention
      weak institutions—have led to this anomalous growth pattern, which has not provided good jobs to
      the majority of Mindanawons and has led to substantial emigration of many of its talented people.
      Decades-long conflict has caused untold human suffering and severely constrained growth in conflict-
      affected areas (about 60 percent of Mindanao’s cities and municipalities are directly affected by
      conflict), while reducing confidence and discouraging investment throughout Mindanao.

    The Development Challenge in Mindanao

    Slow Economic Growth
    10.	      Mindanao has fallen behind the rest of the Philippines. Once its per capita income was similar to
              Luzon’s and triple that of the Visayas. However, its growth has since fallen far below the other two
              island groups. GDP increased by 3.4 percent annually between 197511 and 2014, compared to 4.1
              percent in Luzon, so that for the period growth in Luzon was 30 percent higher (Figure 1). By 2014,
              Mindanao’s per capita GDP was only about half that of Luzon. Compared to neighboring countries with
              a similar comparative advantage in agriculture, until 1980 Mindanao was as rich as Thailand and richer
              than Indonesia and Vietnam. Yet in 2014 per capita GDP in Mindanao was 50 percent of Indonesia’s,
              30 percent of Thailand’s, and 87 percent of Vietnam’s. Moreover, the ability of growth to generate
              employment has declined steadily. Between 1975 and 1996, for every 1 percent Mindanao’s economy

         grew, employment grew by 1.04 to 1.72 percent. However, the elasticity fell to 0.43 between 1997 and
         2008 and to 0.31 between 2009 and 2014, suggesting that higher growth in recent years did not create
         a commensurate number of jobs.


11.	     Slow growth in Mindanao since the late 1970s reflects limited technological progress. From 1978 to
         201412 the contribution of physical and human capital to Mindanao’s growth was comparable to that of
         Luzon, but growth in output per worker was minimal and the contribution of total factor productivity
         (TFP)13 was negative (Table 1). Mindanao’s negative TFP contribution is probably the result of conflict,
         which tends to undermine institutions, the rule of law, and incentives to innovate and grow. The number
         of conflict-related deaths and incidences of negative TFP from 1986 to 2004 are positively correlated.14

12.	     Since 2010 Mindanao’s economic performance has improved significantly. From 2010 to 2014 growth
         averaged 6.1 percent, on a par with Luzon and the Visayas. Key cities in Mindanao, like Davao and
         Cagayan de Oro, are engines of growth. Like the rest of the country, Mindanao’s growth reflects the
         fact that investment has been improving for the past six years. It also reflects policies (e.g., partial
         liberalization of cabotage) and resources (e.g., tripling of infrastructure budget) devoted to improving
         growth in Mindanao, and growing investor confidence about the prospects for peace.


The Labor Force: Both Opportunity and Challenge
13.	     There is considerable, and rising, demand for good jobs — jobs that raise real income and lift people
         out of poverty. In 2014 some 2.4 million Mindanawons were either unemployed (about 460,000) or
         underemployed (1.9 million).15 Moreover, Mindanao’s relatively young population means that 392,000
         workers may enter the labor force every year from 2016, for a total of 5.2 million by 2022 (Figure 2).
         Benefiting from the availability of young workers, which is an enormous potential resource that can
         boost growth, will require the availability of productive jobs that pay decent wages. Moreover, enabling
         workers to transition from the informal sector (about 70 percent of employment) to formal sector jobs
         could improve their welfare and increase their productivity.

         1977 is the earliest year all data were available. Two years are needed to measure initial capital formation, and 2014 data are the most
         recent available.
 	
13
         TFP is the residual of growth after accounting for the contributions of capital and labor, adjusted for educational attainment. On average,
         statistical errors should equal zero, so that the negative residual likely reflects a lack of technological and institutional change.
 	
14
         Sufficient data are available only for these years.

         About one in five Mindanao workers would like to work more, but many jobs are only temporary or part-time.

    14.	      The sources of growth in Mindanao have not generated enough high-quality jobs. Unlike Luzon
              and Visayas,16 which have more diversified, innovative, and labor-intensive economic structures (e.g.,
              higher-value exports like electronics and furniture, and fast-growing formal services, such as IT-BPO),
              Mindanao’s economy was driven by plantation crops (e.g., rubber, abaca, banana, and pineapple) and
              by forestry, mining, and heavy manufacturing (e.g., steel) to support the import substitution program.17
              These are capital-intensive sectors that require little local processing, result in little local reinvestment
              of profits, and hence had low local multiplier effects. The few infrastructure funds were directed to
              building logistics networks to connect Mindanao plantations to its cities, and ultimately to Manila and
              Cebu; the neglect of intra-Mindanao networks discouraged intra-Mindanao trade. While in earlier years
              these sectors contributed to Mindanao’s high GDP per capita between 1960 and 1980, they created
              few jobs and hence did little to reduce poverty. The concentration of power and wealth resulting from
              this pattern of growth entrenched deep inequality and ultimately contributed to conflict as few of the
              benefits of growth reached most Muslims and Indigenous Peoples.

              The rapid growth in the Visayas is also explained by large investments in Leyte province under Ferdinand Marcos, whose wife, Imelda,
              comes from there.
    17
         	    Between the 1950s and 1980s, an import substitution policy was implemented to support local manufacturing. In Mindanao, Iligan City
              was a center of heavy manufacturing (e.g., steel production).




6    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
High Incidence of Poverty
15.	    The poverty rate is higher in Mindanao than in Luzon and the Visayas. According to the Family Income
        and Expenditure Survey (FIES) 2015, 36 percent of the population of Mindanao lived below the poverty
        line, compared to 13.1 percent in Luzon and 28 percent in the Visayas. Poverty is particularly high in
        rural Mindanao. In 2012, there were 1.2 million food-poor farmers and fisherfolk (27 percent of the total)
        and 1.1 million (25 percent) living between the food and poverty thresholds. Another 1.4 million (31
        percent) lived close to the absolute poverty line (20 percent above), making them highly vulnerable to
        fall back into poverty. Thus a total of 3.7 million farmers and fisherfolk live in or near poverty,18 leaving
        only 0.7 million (16 percent) with regular marketable surplus to generate savings for the next planting
        season (Figures 3 and 4). In part, the high poverty rate reflects unequal economic and political power.
        When one person or firm controls the land, labor, credit, and product markets or any combination
        thereof,19 he can drive farmers to subsistence by exploiting interlocking markets or even blocking
        access to markets.20 Consultations and research undertaken for this study suggest that these practices
        thrive in Mindanao and have the effect of locking some farmers and fisherfolk into a vicious spiral of
        poverty and indebtedness.

        Based on the 2012 FIES. In 2012, in Mindanao the average annual per capita food poverty line was PHP 13,453 and the poverty line was
        PHP 19,291 both slightly higher (1.4 percent) than Luzon, despite Mindanao being less developed. People falling below the provincial
        per capita food thresholds are considered food-poor, while those with per capita income equal to or above the provincial per capita food
        thresholds but below the provincial per capita poverty thresholds are considered poor. Those with per capita income equal to or above the
        per capita poverty thresholds but below the 50th population percentile (agricultural workers tend to have lower income) are considered
        near-poor.

        For instance, in a Mindanao town, the datu (local chieftain) can control local politics, own the only rural bank, have a monopoly of security
        services and wide influence over labor and land allocation.

    16.	                    Poverty is significantly lower in urban than in rural areas and has even fallen recently in the former.
                            Between 2003 and 2012, small-area estimates of poverty21 show moderate to significant poverty
                            reduction in cities (Figure 5). The largest cities, Davao and Cagayan de Oro, have the least poverty
                            (Figure 6), in large part due to their distance from conflict. Nevertheless, the incidence of poverty there
                            is higher than in urban areas outside Mindanao: the share of the population with incomes below the
                            poverty line averaged 19 percent in Mindanawo cities, compared to 4 percent in the National Capital
                            Region. The high share of urban poverty in Mindanao is being mitigated by the 4Ps22 conditional cash
                            transfer program, which benefits between 8 and 32 percent of households in major cities. Moreover,
                            Mindanao cities have fewer modern amenities than cities in Luzon or the Visayas. Proxy indicators show
                            that Mindanawons have less money for basic wants, savings, and luxury items.

                time jobs. The self-employed are more likely to be poor than wage-earners—for the most part self-
                employment reflects lack of opportunity rather than entrepreneurial drive. Underemployment, not
                temporary unemployment, is the main reason for in-work poverty. The key to reducing in-work poverty
                in Mindanao is better education and skills training and enhancing productive job opportunities by
                making the investment climate more attractive.


The Costs and Benefits of Migration
19.	            Migration within the islands to urban areas and from urban Mindanao to the rest of the Philippines is
                substantial. The cities attract many rural migrants in search of better jobs and safer living conditions;
                the more rapid growth and relatively safe environment in General Santos, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao
                attract the most permanent migrants.23 However, these three cities also experience the most emigration
                as their people find better jobs in Cebu, Manila, or overseas. Temporary migrants looking for jobs or
                fleeing from conflict account for a large share of the urban population.24 Many temporary migrants are
                internally displaced persons (IDPs)25 or individuals looking for temporary work.


20.	            The impact of migration on Mindanao development is ambiguous. Remittance receipts are likely to
                be substantial; remittances totaled 9.8 percent of GDP in the Philippines as a whole. The ability of
                urban areas to absorb displaced persons helps to reduce suffering, enables workers to move to more
                productive jobs, and eases population pressure in conflict-affected areas. However, the most highly-
                educated workers are leaving in droves. The top college courses—nursing, accountancy, maritime
                studies, and hotel and restaurant management—are those in demand in Manila and abroad, and many
                vocational students leave to find work in construction in Manila, Cebu, and the Middle East. The high
                rate of emigration of skilled workers is contributing to high job turnover and a scarcity of the highly
                productive workers who are essential if the services and manufacturing sectors are to grow.

                Permanent migrants are defined as individuals who lived in a different city or municipality five years before the census.
 	
24
                Transitory migrants are defined as the difference between the number of voting age (18 years and above) from the 2010 Census of
                Population and Housing and the number of voters registered in 2010 with the Commission on Elections less the number of overseas
                workers. Because the difference is not adjusted for unregistered voters, the estimate should considered an upper bound.
 	
25
                In 2015, the number of people displaced by armed conflict was reported at 208,232 in the ARMM, the highest in any region, followed by
                Central Mindanao (24,193), the Davao Region (3,030), Caraga (9,260), and Northern Mindanao (1,582); many of them live in or near major
                cities like Cotabato and General Santos.

     Development

     Unlocking Mindanao’s Potential
     21.	   Driving down poverty and delivering on the new Philippine Government Strategic Framework for
            Mindanao Peace and Development will demand a new form of engagement in Mindanao. The
            Strategic Framework recognizes that there are “two Mindanaos”: one that can be characterized as
            relatively stable and prosperous, and the other suffering pervasive poverty, violent conflict and, poor
            governance. To address the goal of a peaceful, cohesive, secure, and inclusively developed Mindanao,
            it calls for five linked strategic outcomes: resilient communities built; effective governance promoted;
            inclusive economic growth and jobs ensured; security environment stabilized; and the consensus for
            peace strengthened.


     22.	   The World Bank has drawn up a strategy for regional development in Mindanao, building on dialogue
            with the Philippines government and local stakeholders. The three main components are: (1) raise
            agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2) boost human development; and
            (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility while building up institutions in ARMM and other conflict-
            affected areas.


     23.	   Mindanao’s comparative advantage lies in agriculture, yet its full potential is not being realized,
            mainly because productivity remains low. Agriculture and related services and industries account
            for 60 percent of GDP and 57 percent of its employment. Mindanao accounts for 40 percent of the
            country’s total agricultural output and 60 percent of its agricultural exports. However, only 16 percent
            of Mindanao farmers produce a marketable surplus and more than half of farm households are poor.
            Rural underemployment is high. Many farmers are neither organized nor linked to value chains. With a
            few exceptions (e.g., bananas) the sector’s once vibrant growth has stalled.




10    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
 Box 1: The market potential of agriculture in Mindanao

     Mindanao is considered the agricultural basket of the Philippines, producing a diverse set of crops and already
     serving both local and international markets. Of the three island regions, it accounts for the largest share of
     agricultural production and contributes significantly to national food security. For example, it produces about
     50 percent of national corn production. Also, it produces most of the country’s high-value crops: about 80
     percent of bananas and coffee, and over 60 percent of coconuts. In addition, Mindanao contributes a significant
     share of the country’s key commodity contributions to total world export volume. Its bananas, pineapples, and
     coconuts comprised about a third of the world export volumes.26 However, Mindanao’s agricultural sector has
     not realized its potential.

     A number of Mindanao’s agricultural products could well extend their shares in both domestic and international
     markets. As background research for this report, value chain analyses were conducted for about two dozen of
     these. Some products, such as coffee, aquatic products, seaweed, and coconut, appear to have considerable
     market potential, either for more effectively serving nearby urban centers or for expanding in markets abroad.

     One argument for ramping up coffee production in Mindanao is that it could also address demand for
     domestic consumption of currently imported coffee products. In recent years, domestic coffee consumption
     rose significantly, to about 130,000 metric tons of coffee in 2015 alone—more than double consumption in
     2007. Until the 1990s, the Philippines was a major exporter of coffee beans, but following a sharp decline
     in prices, domestic production had steadily declined. Today, green coffee is among the country’s top 10
     agricultural imports. For Mindanao, where about two-thirds of national coffee production takes place, there
     is a potential for the expansion to coffee processing, such as the production of instant coffee, given that 95
     percent of all domestically consumed instant coffee is imported.

     Aquatic products like milkfish, tilapia, and seaweed could serve wider domestic and international markets.
     According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Philippines ranks among the top 20 global producers
     of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, accounting for about 1 percent of total global production; Mindanao
     contributes already nearly half of total domestic production. Domestically, milkfish and tilapia are central
     items in the Filipino diet, yet Mindanao’s contribution to milkfish production is about 15 percent and for tilapia
     7 percent.

     In terms of the aquatic export markets, for Mindanao seaweed has the most market potential. The Philippines
     ranked 3rd globally in production of aquatic plants with 5.7 percent of total world production in 2014. Mindanao
     accounts for more than half of total Filipino production, most of it taking place in ARMM. Moreover, as an
     aquatic export seaweed is second only to tuna in terms of value, accounting for US$202 million—about 20
     percent of total fisheries exports earnings in 2015. There is heavy demand from international markets for
     seaweed, from which carrageenan is extracted for use as an additive, binder, and emulsifier in the food,
     pharmaceutical, beverage, and cosmetic industries.

     Building on established export commodities such as coconut offers many of Mindanao’s poorest farmers an
     opportunity to become more closely linked to enterprises. The Philippines is the second largest producer of
     coconuts in the world; in 2015 coconuts accounted for about 40 percent of total export earnings, and over 60
     percent of those coconuts came from Mindanao. In recent years, international demand has outstripped supply
     because of the proliferation of coconut byproducts, such as virgin coconut oil, coco sugar, and copra. This is
     an opportunity to expand Mindnano’s coconut-related agribusiness for both domestic and export markets.

                                                                                              A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   11
     24.	   There is domestic and foreign market potential for Mindanao’s agricultural products (Box 1). First,
            there is scope to supply more rice and maize to the other islands of the Philippines as food or feed
            ingredients. Although Mindanao accounts for a high proportion of national food production, it is only
            tenuously linked to the national market, thus limiting its contribution to national food security. This is
            a missed opportunity for both Mindanao and the country. There is also an emerging opportunity to
            cater to growing urban demand within Mindanao for higher-value perishable meat and vegetables.
            Realizing the domestic market potential will depend on addressing limited connectivity to give farmers
            better access to markets both within Mindanao and beyond. Finally, there is an opportunity to expand
            the production of exportable agriculture products: aquatic, coffee, and coconut products. Here the
            challenge will be mainly to more closely link farmers with enterprises. It is primarily agribusinesses that
            have the opportunity to differentiate or diversify product lines.


     25.	   A major constraint for the agriculture sector is limited connectivity. Farmers are disconnected or
            misconnected with technical service providers, agro-enterprises, markets, and consumers, a problem
            that has multiple consequences (Table 2). Many roads are in bad condition or congested, with the result
            that agricultural produce is often rejected, especially perishable commodities like bananas and other
            fruits and vegetables. Beyond the lack of adequate FMRs, there is the need to prioritize modernization
            to relieve congestion on roads accessing ports for more connectivity beyond Mindanao. Mindanao
            ports lack economies of scale: there are some 690 ports, yet the top four handle only 17 percent of
            domestic cargo and 12 percent of foreign. Many ports are owned by private companies and are closed
            to smaller farmers.

      Dulled incentives for producing higher -       Reduced export competitiveness and
      quality products and frequent rejections       profitability




     26.	   Customs procedures are a major bottleneck to trade facilitation, especially for agricultural products.
            On the Doing Business indicator for Trading Across Borders the Philippines ranked at 95 in 2016 (World
            Bank 2016a), 1 rank lower than to 2015. The World Bank Logistics Performance Index ranks the country
            at 71, down from 85 in 2014, with Customs and Border Management ranking at 78—31 points lower.


     27.	   Finally, because the protracted land disputes and conflict have deterred investments in agriculture,
            they have slowed job creation and poverty reduction. It is true that favorable climatic conditions,
            the presence of Lake Lanao and the Liguasan Marsh, and the impact of climate change elsewhere
            in the country have encouraged large firms based in Davao and CDO to extend their operations to
            Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao through contract growing agreements with smallholders. However, the


12    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       large majority of prospective investors are deterred by unclear and overlapping property rights, and
       even current investors are deterred from expanding their operations. Land disputes can easily turn
       into violent confrontation and inter-elite clashes, which can destroy inventory, delivery, and production
       schedules. In some cases, the potential for profit from large pineapple and banana farms has led elites
       to dispossess smallholders as they consolidate lands for contract growing.


28.	   The proposed strategy is designed to support Mindanao’s comparative advantage and strengthen
       its linkages with the entire region. It identifies three priorities to unlock agriculture potential and
       streamline farm-to-market connectivity (Figure 7).

Figure 7: How to unlock Mindanao’s agriculture potential

                  through                       development,                  and modernize
                agro-spatial                  improve roads from                 customs
              approaches and                    agricultural to
             product alliances                 markets and ports




29.	   Connectivity bottlenecks are compounded by skills deficits. Over 80 percent of Mindanao’s farmers
       and fishermen are poor or near-poor, lacking scale and skills to compete. People with more education
       in Mindanao, especially ARMM, see few prospects for wage gains. To maximize human development
       and productivity in Mindanao, weaknesses need to be addressed in both basic education and skills &
       employment development. The approach needs especially to target youth in conflict-affected areas.


30.	   Resolving conflict in Mindanao rests on addressing the causes of conflict and providing jobs and
       economic opportunities as alternatives to violence. The proposed framework builds on the 2011
       World Bank World Development Report (WDR) on conflict, security and development. Breaking the
       cycle of insecurity and reducing the risk of its recurrence require restoration of confidence in collective
       action, and transforming institutions to provide a sustained level of security, justice, and jobs.
       “Restoring confidence” requires deliberate efforts by both state and private actors from the national
       to the community level in order to launch the initial stages of confidence-building and institutional
       transformation and secure early gains. “Transforming institutions” requires giving early priority to
       actions to reform the institutions responsible for citizen security, justice, and jobs.




                                                                               A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   13
     31.	   For a number of reasons, creating jobs is central to stabilization and normalization in conflict areas:
            (1) Jobs address one of the roots of conflict, which is a lack of employment opportunities that drives
            many, particularly combatants and out-of-school youth, to desperation. Without prospects for earning
            a decent income, the unemployed (especially the young) become pessimistic about the future. (2)
            When employment opportunities are available, recruitment by rebel or criminal elements promising
            better income becomes less attractive. (3) Jobs give individuals the sense of being part of society
            because they share in its benefits. (4) Because they feel that they belong to society, they will have a
            greater stake in its preservation because the outbreak of conflict will result in their losing their jobs and
            hence their goal of a better future.


     32.	   However, job creation will not be enough. Where the cause of conflict is not economic, such as the
            struggle for identity or self-rule, economic measures alone will not be enough to resolve the conflict.
            In Mindanao, peace and development will hinge on a political solution that can successfully address
            the causes of violence—injustice, inadequate governance, land dispossession, discrimination, and
            sociocultural marginalization. Inclusive job creation can support peace by providing equitable access
            to economic opportunity for all, even those in remote, conflict-affected communities.


     33.	   Supporting the transformation of institutions is not simple and cannot be done quickly. There will be
            no single “make or break” moment; it will take a series of self-reinforcing actions to restore confidence
            and gradually build effective institutions. Violence prevention and recovery is only possible if it is
            recognized that security, justice, and economic stresses are linked: a specialized suite of programs is
            needed in fragile environments that combines elements of security, justice, institution building and
            economic transformation. In addition to making agriculture more productive, improving farm-to-
            market connectivity, and promoting human development, it will be necessary to build up institutions
            in ARMM and other conflict-affected areas and addressing less obvious drivers of conflict and
            fragility. One aspect is to support resilient communities and responsive local governments. Another
            is to promote citizen security through supporting normalization processes and promote justice by
            addressing land conflicts.


     34.	   The proposed strategy could have wide-ranging benefits, from nationwide improvements due to
            customs reform, to subsistence farmers and day laborers in the poorest areas accessing FMRs to
            youth seeking training for employment. It will also transcend the divide between nonconflict and
            conflict-affected areas in Mindanao and support both peace-promoting catch-up socioeconomic
            development interventions and longer-term economic development opportunities that would help
            reduce the risk of conflict in the future. The strategy proposed will guide the World Bank engagement
            in Mindanao.

35.	     Mindanao is the agriculture center of the Philippines, producing diverse crops and livestock, including
         many high-value commodities. It contributes 40 percent of the country’s agricultural products (Figure 8),
         with significant shares (Figure 9) of rubber, cacao, coffee, coconut (small farms), bananas and oil palm
         (mid-sized farms), and pineapple (large farms). The top three Philippine exports are coconuts (38
         percent of world export volume in 2014), bananas (33 percent of world export volume in 2014), and
         pineapples (28 percent of world export volume in 2014).28 Since most workers in Mindanao rely directly

     	   This chapter is based on a suite of comprehensive background papers. This chapter points out the most important conclusions and
         strategic thrusts of an agricultural-driven jobs agenda for Mindanao. Other details can be found in background papers for the forestry
         subsector and for the poultry and livestock subsectors. A separate chapter discusses important features of Mindanao’s agrarian sector
         in conflict-affected areas (e.g., land conflict, use of forest and mining land, and Islamic financing). These chapters and background
         papers complement each other, and together provide a more comprehensive picture and strategic agenda for transforming Mindanao’s
         agricultural sector.

            on agriculture, transforming the sector could be significant for generating jobs. In 2012, the agriculture
            and agricultural produce value chain accounted for 60 percent of Mindanao’s value added and 57
            percent of employment.29

     36.	   Mindanao’s agriculture sector is dominated by smallholder farming. About 60 percent of farms in
            Mindanao cover less than 2 hectares (smallholders). Another 33 percent are 2 to 5 hectares (equivalent
            to mid-size farmers). Mindanao also has a large proportion of landless agricultural workers—estimated
            at over a million, or about a third of all farm workers.

     37.	   Despite the promise of agriculture, until now a number of constraints have caused high
            underemployment rates and low wages in Mindanao. Limited job creation in agriculture has had
            economy-wide implications. Because agricultural growth has not been strong, millions of workers have
            turned to the informal services sector, where jobs are low-pay, low-skill, and low-productivity. Services
            generates 44 percent of Mindanao’s economic output, but half of the jobs are informal, for example in
            petty retail trade, public transportation, and personal services. The picture that emerges is of workers
            who escaped an unproductive agricultural sector in depressed rural areas, many in conflict, and are
            vying for better-paying jobs in urban areas, where there are not enough such jobs.

     38.	   Current constraints to realizing the transformative potential of agriculture relate to poor policies,
            investment deficits, and institutional shortcomings. Among the drivers, and causes, of poor sector
            performance are insecure and disputed property rights, ineffective farmer organizations, fragmented
            agricultural research and tenuous research-extension linkages, limited access to and low quality of
            agricultural services, and continued weaknesses in the devolution of services to LGUs. There are also
            problematic gaps in rural infrastructure, especially farm-to-market roads and irrigation systems. Access
            to capital is a continuing problem. Finally, there is an extensive unfinished agenda of complementary
            reforms, primarily relating to agricultural price and trade policy distortions.

     39.	   Historically, a number of government policy distortions have penalized agriculture in Mindanao.
            Up to the 1980s, import substitution policies in support of local manufacturing kept the exchange
            rate overvalued. High effective protection and tax rates on agriculture significantly eroded agricultural
            competitiveness. High tariffs also pushed up the cost of living, as rice and other food commodities
            had to be sourced from within the country at higher prices rather than from nearby Sabah, where
            food and oil are much cheaper. Maritime cabotage restrictions and domestic shipping oligopolies,
            together with the lack of investment in ports, stifled trade. That was a disincentive for farmers to
            generate surpluses that could have been exported—a failure to capitalize on Mindanao’s comparative
            advantage in agriculture.

     40.	   A rural development agenda for Mindanao would need to focus on getting the basics right for
            smallholders, who are the majority of farmers. Smallholders can only work with large farms and
            connect to markets and agribusinesses if their crops are more productive. Drawing on international
            experiences with good practices,30 to be effective a rural development agenda would need to address
      	
     29
            Of which 30 percent came from the farm (crops/livestock), fishery and forestry sectors (primary sector) and the balance (30 percent) from,
            various industrial and services sectors that add value to farm produce.
      	
     30
            Even in the 21st century, agriculture is still a fundamental means of sustainable development and poverty reduction, especially in developing
            countries (World Bank 2013). Agriculture alone will not be enough to eliminate poverty, but it has proven to be a uniquely powerful
            impetus for reaching that objective.


16    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       first the basic constraints on by smallholders and advocate for investing in the education and health
       of farming households. Together, human capital development and more secure property rights could
       help raise the current low returns to labor and land.31 This could be the catalyst for other investment to
       raise productivity and, in the process, generate savings.


41.	   Better land security and minimum savings could help to improve access to formal credit. Responsive
       agricultural research, more closely connected with extension agencies, and expanded access to
       irrigation can improve yields and crop diversity to raise the financial returns on their limited but
       productive assets. At the same time, expanding farm-to-market roads (FMRs) are essential to connect
       farmers to markets and to become more competitive. Such interventions and enabling conditions
       can be delivered more efficiently and effectively if farmers are well organized. Finally, complementary
       measures in the farm and non-farm sectors, including simpler regulations and providing appropriate
       insurance and social protection that reduce the impact of shocks (e.g., weather, health, and conflict)
       could be part of a rural development strategy (Figure 10). For the significant number of landless rural
       workers, the creation of non-farm employment would be important.

42.	   It will be necessary to prioritize and sequence interventions to promote higher productivity among
       smallholders in Mindanao. While ideally all of the ingredients of the basic rural development package
       will apply, some areas in Mindanao will need more support on one issue than others. Priority could go,
       for instance, to areas of high poverty by piloting approaches that use both national and community-
       driven approaches.

 	
31
       The resolution of land disputes and measures to equitably secure title to land encourages economic efficiency while respecting traditional
       land allocation practices is fundamental to development in Mindanao. However, addressing these issues will involve difficult political
       negotiations (for example, land issues are an important driver of conflict). Therefore, there is a need to adopt approaches that will
       harmonize the technical and political dimensions of enhanced land security.

     Speeding Up Agricultural Productivity Growth
     43.	                       Despite its natural advantages, Mindanao’s agricultural performance has been mixed. In only two
                                of the five decades since the 1970s (Figure 11) has average agricultural growth in Mindanao been
                                faster than in the rest of the country.32 As a result, the increase in its agricultural value-added since
                                the 1970s has been 36.3 percent less than in Luzon (Figure 12). Moreover, among the top five crops
                                of the Philippines (banana, coconut, corn, rice, and sugarcane), only the first two have the highest
                                yield in Mindanao (Figure 13). Compared to neighboring countries with similar conditions, Mindanao’s
                                agricultural productivity is low (Figure 14).

        	                       The series begins in 1975 (earliest available data). High growth in the 1970s reflected dividends from the Green Revolution, which
                                increased rice yields through modern varieties. The slump in the 1980s and 1990s reflected armed conflict and uncertainties arising from
                                the impending implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Higher growth in the 2000s reflected lagged
                                gains from more focused attention to Mindanao during the Ramos administration (1992-98) and more certainty around property rights
                                following land distribution and implementation of agriculture venture agreements. Still, growth potential was not realized in the 2000s
                                because of “half-baked” agrarian reform that did not provide extension service and rural public goods to farmers. In the 2010s, slower
                                growth likely reflected exogenous factors such as climate change (e.g., super typhoon Pablo, known internationally as Bopha) and El Niño
                                in 2010 and 2015.



18     A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
Securing Property Rights
44.	   Land as a core factor of production is of immense importance with serious implications for job
       creation. Expanded access to land provides the means to generate investments, create jobs, and
       raise productivity. Streamlining land governance with rational approaches is central to more fully and
       sustainably utilizing productive land in Mindanao. Apart from the usual problems that arise when
       property rights are insecure, conflict-affected Mindanao also suffers from severe land disputes that
       have resulted in violence. As will be discussed fully in chapter 8, two factors explain the prominence
       of land disputes: (1) the legacy of resettlement and land programs from the 1900s to the 1980s, which
       mainly affects the Moros; and (2) the magnified effects of overlapping legal systems, which largely
       affects indigenous people.


45.	   In addition to the problems caused by the protracted armed conflict, land governance in Mindanao,
       has several serious deficiencies. Some of the bases for property rights insecurity in Mindanao relate
       to (1) its unique history; (2) overlapping rights, exacerbated by unique sociogeological features; (3) the
       complexities of land titling and registration, title issuance, issuance of Certificate of Land Ownership
       Awards (CLOAs) and unregulated use of agriculture venture agreements); (4) limited access to public
       land for investment; (5) weak development of Certificates of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) lands; and
       (6) the existence of dual land markets.


Weak Farmer Organizations
46.	   Farmer organizations can encourage collective action and contribute to smallholder-led agricultural
       transformation. However, there appear to be are few successful farmer organizations in Mindanao, which
       may help explain why farmers and fisherfolk there are poor. Such organizations, often cooperatives,
       often suffer from poor governance, inadequate regulation, and lack of support from other stakeholders.
       Conflict makes it even harder for farmers to organize themselves because of high transaction costs,
       in particular between communities. The lack of organizations also limit the option of entering into
       agriculture venture agreements (AVA) with agribusiness firms. Without farmer organizations the reach
       of government lending programs is limited. To fill the credit gap, suppliers and buyers often provide
       financing to smallholders in exchange for lower prices.


Research and the Extension System
47.	   Integrated agricultural research closely linked to enhanced extension services could do a great deal to
       raise agricultural productivity. That is unlikely given the current research system:

       •	    The multilevel organization of national agricultural research is complex and fragmented. For
             example, three departments (the Department of Science and Technology, DoST; the Department
             of Agriculture, DoA; and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, DENR) all have
             roles in creating agriculture-related technology. The DoA agency coordinating research is the
             Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR), but how effective it does so is questionable.
       •	    There is a lack of both coordination and synergy among government institutions that provide
             extension research and of private sector participation. For instance, the BAR and the DoST’s
             Philippine Council for Agricultural Resources, Research, and Development could be working
             together to identify research priorities.

                                                                               A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   19
     48.	                    What agricultural research there is has rarely been targeted to practical applications in the field.
                             Spending on research has gone up substantially since 2010 when the BAR increased its funding for
                             national programs on rice, maize, and high-value commercial crops. However, not all of what has been
                             budgeted has been spent, and research is largely supply-driven with little participation by the private
                             sector in areas that could create commercial value,33 and agricultural R&D expenditures are rarely
                             monitored and evaluated. The usefulness of research might be higher if there was less focus on rice
                             and more on other crops. More generally, research is a fragmented into commodity programs; it fails
                             to address gaps in value chains; and there is little if any effort to incorporate climate change adaptation
                             into the research and extension agenda.


     49.	                    Extension services can help farmers to raise productivity, but they currently reach very few farmers.
                             Extension services disseminate best practices in the use of new advances, such as high-yield and
                             climate-change-responsive seeds, and in improved agricultural techniques. They can help farmers to
                             diversify into higher-value crops and meet new production and environmental standards. They can
                             also advise on possible nonfarm income sources. In Mindanao, only 10 percent of corn farmers and
                             48 percent of rice farmers use extension services (Figure 15). Among reasons for the low uptake are
                             the remoteness of many farms from extension services and their lack of resources. Poor transport and
                             communication infrastructure, not to mention conflict, hinder the effective delivery of services and the
                             monitoring of the results and of the quality of services (see Menz, Johnson, Puerto, Predo, Carusos,
                             and Aspera 2014).

     50.	                    The quality of extension services in Mindanao has been questioned. The 1991 Local Government
                             Code (LGC) devolved responsibility for frontline agricultural services to LGUs,34 but fragmentation, lack
                             of funding, and unclear guidelines and allocation of responsibilities undermined extension services.
      	
     33
                             The BAR favors field-based research; the Council supports the research of academic institutions, which is more oriented to publication
                             than practical applications.
      	
     34
                             In June 1992, the extension service budget, personnel, onsite research, facilities, and other assets, previously under the DoA, were
                             transferred to LGUs. Devolved activities were (1) services for livestock, poultry, and dairy industries, devolved from the Bureau of Animal
                             Industry; (2) control and prevention of pests and diseases that affect farm crops, from the Bureau of Plant Industry; (3) services for fishery
                             and aquatic resources, from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources; (4) services related to effective use of soil, land, and water
                             resources, from the Bureau of Soils and Water Management; and v) establishing agricultural cooperatives, from the Bureau of Agricultural
                             Cooperatives and Development (Magno 2001).


20    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       The mandate of national government agencies shifted from service delivery to policymaking, planning,
       coordination, and technical support. However, until 2004, the DoA had no platform to operationalize
       the LGC, although efforts have been made in the last 15 years to better deliver extension services.35


51.	   Many LGUs lack the financial and technical capacity to provide extension services. This prevents them
       from regularly training extension workers on new developments in agricultural science and technology.
       Technical personnel are also scarce in poorer or remote LGUs, where extension service staff often have
       other duties, such as collecting taxes. This problem is particularly severe in the ARMM, where just 32
       coconut extension workers serve 100,000 farmers and farm laborers working on 300,000 ha. Moreover,
       because extension workers tend to be knowledgeable only about a single crop, such as rice, they
       cannot help farmers diversify into other crops. To some extent, too, extension services have been
       politicized.36 Finally, local extension offices are autonomous, with no vertical or horizontal linkages to
       each other, the Agricultural Training Institute, research institutions, or public colleges and universities.


52.	   Higher and better-quality investments in agricultural research and development (R&D) could bring
       about technological changes that could support productivity growth. Improving the institutional
       design, spending more on R&D, and expanding R&D focus beyond rice could contribute to both
       the much-needed productivity growth and to the country’s food security objective. However, because
       knowledge gained through research has little value if it does not reach farmers, it will be crucial to ensure
       the efficiency of education, research-extension linkages, and provision of extension services. It would
       also be useful to give priority to research that addresses identified gaps in promising and competitive
       value chains, and to incorporate climate change adaptation into the research and extension agenda.


53.	   The national government, led by the DoA and its regional offices, can help reinforce local government
       extension services and improve the coordination of agencies delivering services. For example,
       through the Mindanao Rural Development Project (MRDP), the DoA developed protocols and systems
       (e.g., cost-sharing arrangements, technical standards, and capacity building) to equip LGUs with the
       necessary technical competencies to provide extension services. One priority is to rationalize services
       spread over several national agencies. Other priorities are covering more crops and areas, supporting
       delivery of services by colleges and universities, building a corps of national and regional subject matter
       specialists to train provincial and academic faculty on extension work, and upgrading DoA regional
       offices to support service delivery and coordinate national and local services (e.g., road planning,
       training, and marketing).


54.	   All stakeholders need to work together to add value to extension services for farmers in Mindanao.
       The role of DoA regional offices in managing extension services could be supported by creating
       provincial interagency committees to (1) identify gaps in extension services and optimal ways to fill
       them; (2) reallocate scarce resources to priority crops, using the Provincial Commodities Investment
       Plans; and (3) reviewing budget allocations with municipal governments to ensure adequate delivery.
       Mindanao’s universities and colleges with agricultural programs could go a great deal more by

 	
35
       It was 2004 before the DoA had a framework for partnerships with local governments.
 	
36
       After the devolution of extension service, the quality of service declined significantly in several areas, especially in Mindanao, as merit-
       based appointments were replaced by patronage-based appointments.



                                                                                                    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development      21
                         ensuring that all institutions with the ability to deliver extension services have a formal mandate
                         through agreements with the Commission on Higher Education, national government agencies, and
                         local governments. They could focus funding and human resources to support extension services that
                         provide training in practical agricultural skills and create a future pool of agriculture specialists. NGOs,
                         civil society organizations, successful farmer organizations, and the private sector can also help to
                         enhance extension services through improved incentive, coordination, and participation mechanisms.
                         For example, they could support establishment of more rural farm schools (Mindanao has only one),
                         provide vouchers to farmers for privately-delivered extension services, and tap more productive farms
                         to provide farmer-to-farmer mentoring and apprenticeship programs.


     Rural Infrastructure Deficits
     55.	                There is continued demand for more and better FMRs. This has been confirmed by preliminary impact
                         assessments from the Philippine Rural Development Program (PRDP), which show robust direct benefits
                         to farmers—not only because of reduced travel time and costs, greater trader competition, higher farm
                         gate prices and farm incomes, and expanded agricultural services, but also because of easier access
                         to health and educational services. Spending more to close the FMR gap, together with adequate
                         operations and maintenance (O&M) funding, could help increase farmer incentives and profitability,
                         which in turn could increase crop yields, diversification of crops and livestock, and farm incomes.


     56.	                Although irrigation services now cover a wider area, irrigation in Mindanao still trails that of Luzon
                         and the Visayas and needs more investment, especially for crops other than rice (Figure 16). Only 43
                         percent of Mindanao’s irrigable farm area was irrigated in 2015, compared to 61 percent in Luzon and
                         71 percent in Visayas (Figure 17). At only 29 percent, ARMM had the lowest ratio. Dependable irrigation
                         helps raise yields and diversification into higher-value crops, which can creates job throughout the
                         entire value chain. For instance, in North Cotabato, moving from rainfed to irrigated rice not only
                         doubled the yield but more than doubled the number of full-time jobs per ha.37 Insufficient irrigation
                         also helped worsen the impact of El Niño in 2015, forcing five provinces to declare a state of emergency.

22    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       Irrigated farms do not always fare better, however, because many irrigation systems have been in use
       for over 50 years and need major rehabilitation and repair. Moreover, insufficient O&M funding can
       greatly reduce the effectiveness of irrigation.


57.	   The government is now allocating more funds to irrigation. Funds are largely devoted to a more cost-
       efficient strategy of rehabilitation and restoration, with smart expansion to new areas near existing
       schemes. The 2016 budget included PHP 6.3 billion for new irrigation projects for Mindanao. The
       government has also been pursuing the transfer of irrigation management from the National Irrigation
       Administration (NIA) to irrigator associations (water users) and rationalizing NIA functions. From 2011
       to 2014, new service areas covered 164,230 ha, allowing farmers to increase cropping from once a year
       to up to five times every two years. However, the cost of extending irrigation to all unserved areas is
       immense. Fully irrigating the remaining 534,000 hectares in Mindanao as of 2015 would require PHP
       158 billion (1.2 percent of GDP). Priority should therefore be given to ARMM and Region XII, which
       have high potential but the lowest irrigation coverage. Prioritizing irrigation projects can be made
       more inclusive by involving farming communities.


58.	   All irrigation investments need to emphasize sustainability. As water becomes scarcer with increasing
       population and urbanization, it is urgent to thoroughly assess water sources. In the short to medium
       term, ground water irrigation needs to be developed, with the use of least-cost shallow-tube wells
       expanded. Deep-tube wells can be harnessed for high-value crops like vegetables, while over the long
       term, water-impounding systems can be developed for rice and other crops. Sustainable management
       will be necessary to ensure good maintenance and reduce the need for repeated rehabilitation. That
       will depend on allocation and timely release of sufficient funds for regular and major operations and
       maintenance O&M activities and incorporating climate-resilient design and features in rehabilitation
       and restoration.


59.	   Adjusting service fees for irrigation systems could improve incentives. Irrigation service fees should
       be based on the quality of the services (in the past, farmers have had to pay regardless of quality and
       even if the service does not reach them, unless their harvests are 40 cavans / ha or less). Abolishing
       the fees would reduce the funds available for O&M, thus threatening the sustainability of irrigation
       services and functionality of the irrigation systems (NIA regional and irrigation management offices
       depend on the fees to finance O&M, including salaries of most staff), and also reduce funding of
       the organizational development activities of irrigators associations. However, with careful discussion,
       access to irrigation could be maintained for the poorest farmers by providing vouchers to purchase
       services as a cost-sharing arrangement.


60.	   Better management of irrigation is also important. Although 96 percent of irrigation associations
       have O&M contracts under the NIAs irrigation management transfer program, others need to be built
       up so they can enter into such contracts and take a larger O&M role. This could be complemented
       by rehabilitation and restoration of irrigation systems. Modifying procurement regulations to allow
       qualified associations to procure and manage simple complex civil works (current rules only allow
       communities to act as project service providers) could improve delivery of services. The Government
       Procurement and Policy Board is currently drafting an amendment to this policy.


                                                                           A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   23
     Fundamental Problems Affecting Access to Capital
     61.	   Expanded access to capital is vital to transforming Mindanao’s rural areas. Capital is essential for
            farmers to begin planting, improve productivity, shift to high-value crops, and move up the value chain
            to post-harvest, processing, and marketing—all with positive impacts on their households.


     62.	   The small scale of farms and their low productivity, together with insecure land rights, limit the access
            to and availability of collateral and amplify the high risks of providing financing for smallholders.38
            Although one-third of the economy in Mindanao is dominated by agriculture, farmers struggle to
            attract financing, whether informal or from banks. This largely reflects national trends where, despite
            mandatory lending targets and a range of initiatives to expand agricultural lending by private financial
            institutions, the agricultural credit portfolio has marginally declined over the past five years. Thus
            Mindanao as a region faces general challenges in mobilizing necessary financing from the private
            sector (discussed more in chapter 7). Mindanao’s extensive conflict areas pose specific challenges
            because security risks and instability deter investors and financiers and also dis-incentivize farmers.


     63.	   The current system of mandatory lending targets is not stimulating lending by banks to the agriculture
            sector.39 The government could consider reforming the agricultural credit guarantee program currently
            operated by the Land Bank of the Philippines. The current program has limited capital and operational
            challenges that limit its ability to mobilize financing, especially from larger financial institutions. Crop
            insurance is another essential element where reform would be important. The Philippines Crop
            Insurance Corporation needs to expand the range of crops covered, review reinsurance options,
            and enhance its own financial position. Banks also need to be educated about agricultural lending,
            especially value chain financing approaches. Reforms on the financing side would need to be hand-in-
            hand with the efforts to boost productivity and improve producer capacity.


     Complementary Farm and Nonfarm Reforms
     64.	   Complementary reforms could enhance the role of agriculture in job creation and poverty reduction.
            Many of these are national reforms, such as efforts to eliminate constraints on production and reduce
            import barriers that would have a greater impact on. For example, legal restrictions that prevent farmers
            from diversifying into more profitable crops need to be eliminated, such as Banana Hectare Law (Letter
            of Instructions [LOI] 58 of 1973 and LOI 790 of 1979), Section 36 of the Agricultural Land Reform Code
            (RA 3844 of 1963), and the Coconut Cutting Law (RA 8048 of 1995). If the market were left to determine

      	
     38
            While the share of smallholders who borrow from formal sources now comprises about 48 percent in Mindanao, about half from formal
            sources, they suffer credit constraints, mainly because formal financial institutions find it too risky to lend to subsistence smallholders
            too risky because lack of information on credit history and the credit risks of commercial smallholders prevents banks from accurately
            assessing qualifications for credit. Also, lending to agriculture entails high transaction costs, as smallholders are in dispersed rural areas
            with low population density. As a result, banks impose a number of requirements to ascertain creditworthiness, but because they raise
            compliance costs, they dissuade many smallholders from even attempting to borrow from banks. Guarantees could reduce risk aversion in
            agriculture lending. The Agricultural Guarantee Fund Pool (AGFP) is expected to encourage more private financial institutions to extend
            credit to commercial smallholders who are considered high-risk. But even though it can cover loan defaults, not all banks are responsive to
            the AGFP; large financial institutions still prefer to lend to less risky sectors where loans can be secured with collateral. The lack of insurance
            and reinsurance products for smallholders also contributes to bank discomfort with smallholder lending. Despite government subsidies, the
            Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation operating challenges contribute to the lackluster insurance penetration rate.
      	
     39
            Banks still prefer to use alternative modes to comply with the agriculture loan quota imposed by law, such as financing eligible securities,
            loans, and credit in which proceeds are used exclusively for agriculture and agrarian reform activities.




24    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       the best use of land and the most profitable crops to plant, farm incomes could soar. Also, significant
       investments in health, education (lifelong learning), and social protection are needed to raise human
       capital, which is vital for a more productive farming sector.


65.	   Postharvest facilities need to be enhanced to complement directly agricultural reforms. This calls for
       expanded private investment in milling, cold chains, storage, and drying facilities, with the public sector
       ensuring an enabling environment and effective complementary infrastructure. To a large extent, these
       value-adding activities will come more naturally once the basics are assured.


66.	   Price distortions in agricultural products are being eliminated. Large subsidies on seeds and fertilizers
       have been replaced by targeted programs to help farmers access to inputs based on private sector
       development approaches—although price distortions, especially on prominent commodities like
       rice, corn, and sugar, still prevent farmers from diversifying and raising real income, and consumers
       from having more food security because prices are still artificially high. But a universal rice subsidy
       managed by the National Food Authority (NFA), previously known for poor targeting and high
       costs to the budget, has been replaced by a better-targeted and more cost-efficient conditional
       cash transfer program. The Philippines has done a great job in still producing 90 percent of its rice
       requirement despite fast population growth and no comparative advantage on rice. Now is the time
       to balance the policy of rice self-sufficiency with the more important policy of food security so that
       all Filipinos can benefit.


67.	   Further removing import barriers to agricultural goods would help reduce prices for consumers—
       including many farmers who are net food buyers. Replacing the import quota for rice with an appropriate
       tariff would offer adequate incentives to rice farmers, discourage the currently wide illegal importation
       of rice, and promote agricultural diversification. The government could remove any remaining limits on
       private imports on rice, and the NFA could concentrate on building up stocks to buffer emergencies
       and on disaster mitigation programs. Simulations demonstrate that moving away from quantitative
       restrictions and reducing tariffs would lower rice prices and significantly reduce poverty.40 The benefits
       of rice reform would be larger in Mindanao than in the other island groups because so many more of
       its people are poor. Finally, reducing tariffs on other food products, such as corn (35 percent), sugar (50
       percent), poultry (40 percent), pork (30 percent), and flour (10 percent) would also ensure greater food
       security for the poor.




 	
40
       Eliminating the import quota on rice would lift 424,000 people out of poverty. Converting the quota into a lower tariff of about 25 percent
       would lift 647,000 people out of poverty. On the other hand, a more restrictive quota would raise rice prices by 10 percent and push
       393,000 people into poverty. These estimates are based on data from Cororaton, Clarete, and Sharma (2013).

     Building Up Logistics and Transport                                     41



     Connectivity

     68.	     Lowering logistics costs would benefit Mindanao’s agriculture value chains significantly. An efficient
              logistics system is essential if Mindanao’s potential to become a global supplier of basic and value-
              added produce is to be unleashed. Ensuring a seamless logistics network from farm to markets will
              entail (1) connecting farms to towns by investing in village roads; (2) connecting towns to ports by
              investing in major roads; (3) promoting competition in the domestic shipping industry; (4) liberalizing
              cabotage; (5) modernizing the major ports; and (6) streamlining export and import procedures. Because
              the logistics chain is only as good as its weakest link, partial reforms will not lead to lower prices and
              better service. For instance, reforming domestic shipping and cabotage without modernizing ports
              and improving the roads will not lower shipping cost; shipping lines will not upgrade to larger ships to
              increase scale if cargos movement will still be delayed on the road and at the port.


     69.	     Improving connectivity from farm to market would have numerous positive effects on development.
              Without that farmers must deal with higher input costs and lower prices for their produce. Because
              they few marketing options, their lack of bargaining power further reduces prices. Poor roads may
              also limit access to extension services, and lower the quality of the produce that does reach markets
              due to multiple handling required by the need to use for a single shipment a variety of transport
              modes, from animal-drawn carts to truck. Thus, poor connectivity reduces both the scope of farmers
              to diversify into higher-value perishable crops and their ability to invest in productivity or quality
              improvements. Without good roads, much produce is wasted because transporting it would lead to
              a loss.42 Improved connectivity also benefits rural societies more generally by facilitating the entry of
              social services to villages and encouraging higher school attendance. In fact, in the Philippines, road
              investment complemented by education investment has a significant direct and indirect impact on
              the welfare of the poor (for an extensive discussion see Balisacan and Pernia 2002). Agro-enterprises

              For example, around Mindanao, coconut water is dumped to lighten the coconuts carried by horses or people. In Sulu, because of poor
              roads and the high cost of shipping, many fruits are left to rot on farms despite high urban demand (e.g., mangosteens).

       for dietary diversity and good nutrition, and increased exposure to food safety risks.


The Importance of Rural Roads
70.	   Many small farms are not well connected to markets. In 2010, 26 percent of rural barangays43 in
       Mindanao—45 percent in the ARMM—were not connected to a national road (Figure 19), a much higher
       proportion than in Luzon or the Visayas. Given Mindanao’s mountainous terrain, there is also a higher
       share of similarly affected sitios.44 Moreover, some 22,491 meters of bridges need to be rehabilitated.
       There is a high correlation between a barangay’s lack of access to a national highway and municipal
       poverty; a 1 percentage point increase in the percentage of barangays with no access to a national
       highway is associated with a 0.2 percentage point increase in the incidence of municipal poverty.45
       Poor village roads in Mindanao lead to higher transportation costs and losses of up to 2.5 times more
       than if the roads were in good condition. For example, the difference between good and bad roads


 	A barangay (village) is the smallest political unit.
43


 	A sitio is a small, usually remote part of a rural barangay. There are no data for sitios.
44


 	
45
       This finding is based on a double log regression with regional dummies and a control for altitude. The dependent variable is the 2012
       incidence of municipal poverty and the independent variable is the 2010 proportion of barangays in a municipality with access to a
       national highway. This negative relationship is consistent (and significant at 10 percent) at the regional level, except in ARMM, which has
       the reverse sign but is insignificant.

                     is associated with costs of 20 to 27 percent higher for Cavendish bananas in Davao del Norte and 140
                     percent for rice in North Cotabato. Similarly, farmers in the municipality of Senator Ninoy Aquino
                     in Sultan Kudarat province can only transport two to three sacks of coffee to market per trip using
                     motorcycles or horses, compared to 116 sacks using a seven-ton truck if good roads were available.


     71.	            Though in the past few years various programs have made more funds available for road construction,
                     there is still a lack of broad planning and coordination between programs. Also, current annual budget
                     allocation processes often allow only short segments of roads to be rehabilitated or upgraded.


     72.	            Clear technical allocation criteria for rural road construction in Mindanao is crucial. Allocations based
                     on production criteria (Visual Soil Assessment score, absolute yields in metric tons, or total farm size)
                     favor high-yield areas and farms that are well-connected to supply chains, such as bananas in Davao
                     del Norte, oil palm in Maguindanao, and pineapple in South Cotabato. By contrast, allocating road
                     funds on the basis of equity would favor areas of high poverty incidence, areas where more barangays
                     are not connected, and areas that are populated by indigenous peoples, such as Mt. Matutum in South
                     Cotabato, where they grow Arabica coffee, and Bukidnon, where they grow vegetables, cassava, and
                     coffee. The Philippine Rural Development Program is exploring tools to better identify rural roads,
                     such as satellite mapping and crowd-sourcing technology to provide detailed roadmaps down to
                     the village level, which can be overlaid with poverty and production maps to evaluate the criteria
                     used in road funding allocations. Uploading these maps on public websites and posting them in all
                     provincial, municipal, and barangay halls significantly improves transparency in village road allocation.
                     The Mindanao Development Authority can take the lead in coordinating this reform. The efforts at
                     increasing transparency should be complemented by incentives, such as using matching grants and
                     requiring solid network plans before funds are released.

28    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
The Need for Management Reforms and Resources
73.	   Because there are different funding sources for village roads, effective coordination and a central
       inventory system is needed. Responsibilities for national, provincial, city, and municipal roads are
       clearly defined by law, but providing village roads is more complex because of different approaches
       and funding sources, such as regular FMRs, PRDP FMRs, bottom-up budgeting, and even some
       LGUs. Both top-down (based on plans) and bottom-up (based on community demand) approaches
       are used to determine road needs. This complexity could be relieved by better coordination between
       government agencies and establishing an inventory system for all roads in Mindanao. LGUs will need
       incentives to encourage better planning and resource allocation for road construction. They will also
       need technical support in conflict-affected areas, which often lack the personnel and skills required
       to deliver basic services.


74.	   As the budget envelope increases, the government can begin a sub-village road investment program
       to connect sitios with a population of at least 500 to a main road. On average rural barangays in
       Mindanao comprise seven sitios. Assuming that 60 percent of sitios are not connected to any other
       road46 and each requires a simple 2 km one-lane road, the estimated cost of connecting all sitios is
       PHP 172 billion (1.3 percent of GDP). Connecting remote villages in areas affected by armed conflict
       can help to minimize the grievances that help sustain the insurgency. However, a broader rural road
       network needs to also consider that some communities, including those of indigenous people, may
       not wish to be connected to the outside world. Building roads in areas under the effective control of
       armed groups might also be a challenge that will demand exceptionally close coordination.


75.	   In some cases, alternatives to roads are needed, which would require relaxing procurement regulations
       to allow nonstandard community procurement. Given Mindanao’s mountainous terrain and numerous
       reserved areas, building village roads may not always be feasible. In such cases, alternative means
       of transport, such as horses, cable lines, and pathway clearing, could suffice.47 For example, B’laan
       Arabica coffee growers on Mt. Matutum in South Cotabato need only horses to bring upland coffee
       down to the consolidation center in the midland, but need roads to connect the midland to the town
       center of Polomolok.48 Similarly, market information could be enhanced by allowing farmers to procure
       community satellite phones (cheaper than erecting cellular towers), with which they can check market
       prices before deciding whether to sell.


Defects in Urban Road Connections
76.	   Road transport connections to and within urban areas were poorly planned. Until the early 1990s,
       infrastructure funds were largely devoted to building road networks that would connect Mindanao
       plantations to major ports to supply Manila, Cebu, and foreign markets. Moreover, development plans
       were formulated for administrative regions (there are six in Mindanao) and there was no Mindanao-wide

 	
46
       In Mindanao, because of their remoteness, more than half of sitios are assumed to be isolated.
 	
47
       The slopes of many mountain farms are steeper than 18 percent, so using animals and animal-drawn carts, which are more flexible and
       adaptable to the terrain than vehicles, may be more appropriate than using a road. In protected forest areas, building village roads might
       encourage or intensify farming and encroachment.
 	
48
       As assets animals can serve as collateral in emergencies (i.e., death, sickness), for school enrollment, or as payment for farm inputs,
       especially during crop failures.



                                                                                                  A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development      29
            plan. By neglecting networks within Mindanao, this planning approach discouraged intra-Mindanao
            trade. In recent years, however, there has been significant progress in improving the national road
            system. The Department of Public Works and Highways share of investment rose 30 percent in 2016,
            more than double the share from 1998 to 2010. Today, 79 percent of national roads are paved compared
            to 54 percent a decade ago, cutting intercity travel time and lifting trade and tourism. Nevertheless,
            right-of-way issues (reflecting insecure property rights) have slowed progress, and even less progress
            has been made on local roads, because LGUs have serious capacity and budget constraints. Paved
            road densities average 7.3 km per 10,000 square km for national roads and 11.3 km per 10,000 square
            km for the known49 local road network in Mindanao. In contrast, Luzon has densities of 10.5 km for
            national and 13.2 km for local roads.


     77.	   At present, many national road segments are hard-pressed to accommodate increasing traffic,
            especially container traffic, efficiently and safely. Rising congestion is particularly evident on main
            thoroughfares around Davao, General Santos, Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Bukidnon, and Zamboanga,
            and in port catchment areas. The quality of secondary roads is also inadequate for large trucks, which
            soon results in road damage. It is taking years to finish major repairs and widening projects (e.g., the
            Bukidnon-Davao road). These problems have come at a huge cost to trade. For instance, it takes trucks
            9 hours to travel the 288 km from Davao City to Cagayan de Oro, compared to an estimated 6 hours
            over well-maintained roads. This translates into a 33 percent tax on productivity.


     78.	   Roads leading to ports are jammed with traffic. This is especially serious in Davao and Cagayan de
            Oro, where the public ports are located in the city center, where the roads are already congested. In
            Cagayan de Oro, port roads are narrow, construction of the planned bypass road is moving sluggishly,
            and large informal settlements make expanding roads difficult. The Mindanao International Container
            Terminal (MICT) just outside CDO is also putting pressure on the surrounding road system. The
            problems are similar in Davao, where traffic around Sasa and Panabo ports is severely congested
            during peak hours (for more discussion, see JICA 2014b), as is the Zamboanga port. To a large extent,
            the underlying problem is poor urban planning.


     Priorities for Improving Urban Roads
     79.	   Among the short-term priorities for urban roads are better planning, upgrading roads in and around
            ports, and briskly moving forward major road projects that are underway. It is crucial that the Mindanao
            Development Authority (MINDA) and LGUs take the lead in coordinating all road projects in Mindanao
            and ensuring that they follow strict criteria based on production (the efficiency criterion) or poverty
            (the equity criterion). Geotagging and mapping all roads in the openroads.gov.ph platform would
            improve both management and transparency. The priority for making ports more accessible should
            be constructing bypass roads in Cagayan de Oro, Davao, and Zamboanga. In addition, enforcement
            of a comprehensive traffic management plan, which could be crafted in coordination with the MDA
            and affected LGUs, could speed truck movements. Finally, Faster progress could be made on major
            projects already underway, such as (1) the 12 km, PHP 200 million CDO bypass and access road, now
            nearing completion; (2) the 44.8 km north-south Davao City bypass road; (3) the PHP 5 billion Panguil

            Because village and farm roads are not recorded systematically, their true extent is not fully known.

80.	     Depending on the resources available, the medium- and long-term program could focus on upgrading
         and maintaining the road network already in place. That means ensuring that all national roads made
         of asphalt, gravel, or dirt are concretized; expanding national roads in high-volume areas (e.g., within
         25 km of a major city) to at least two lanes in each direction; building diversion roads in the major
         cities; setting minimum turning requirements that can efficiently and safely cater to 40-footer container
         trucks on national roads traversing mountainous areas (e.g., the Bukidnon-Davao road); and upgrading
         local roads to at least asphalt.50 The total estimated costs for completing all these projects in six years
         (Table 3) is about PHP 565 billion (4.3 percent of 2015 national GDP), or about PHP 94 billion a year (0.7
         percent). This level of spending would be similar to the spending patterns of fast-growing East Asian
         countries three decades ago when they were at the same income level as Mindanao.

     Shipping and High Trade Costs
     81.	   The Philippines has higher export transaction costs than its neighbors. In the 2016 Doing Business
            Report (World Bank 2016b), the Philippines does generally poorer on trading across borders than
            Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The Philippines ranks ahead of Vietnam on processing
            time, but is last in terms of the number of documents required and in the cost to export. For companies
            operating outside the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), exporting a 20-foot container
            containing 15 mt of cargo takes six documents and costs about US$509 (PHP24,100) (including
            domestic logistics costs). The process can take more than 14 working days, 2 of them devoted to
            domestic transportation and handling. These high transaction costs particularly penalize SMEs which
            may lack connections with officials to speed approvals and may not be able to afford customs brokers
            or freight forwarders to handle processing.


     82.	   The growth of agribusiness is suppressed by the high cost, low quality, and poor safety record of
            domestic shipping.51 The average port-to-port cost per nautical mile in the Philippines is US$1.47,
            compared to US$0.77 in Indonesia and US$1.36 in Malaysia.52 It is also more expensive to ship
            domestically than internationally. The Manila-Davao route, for example, costs US$0.97 per nautical
            mile (nm); the Manila-Bangkok route costs only US$0.40. Direct ship calls from international ports to
            Mindanao ports are few (especially in CDO and Zamboanga), because most foreign-bound vessels
            go via Manila, which raises the cost of shipping to Mindanao by 30–50 percent.53 As a result, logistics
            account for 24–53 percent of wholesale prices in the Philippines, but less than 20 percent in East Asian
            countries.54 For the Philippines, shipping and port-handling costs account on average for 35 percent
            of logistics costs, 8–30 percent of the wholesale price, and 5 percent of the retail price. In Mindanao,
            these costs are likely to be higher.


     83.	   The high cost of shipping in part reflects the small scale. Economies of scale in shipping are derived
            not from operating costs—the costs of operating a small or a large vessel do not differ much—but on
            the carrying capacity of the vessel. Scale in the Philippines, and even more so in Mindanao, is small
            because of (1) minimal consolidation at the farm level; (2) inadequate roads and postharvest facilities
            that hinder consolidation there, and (3) the proliferation of ports (691 ports, including 13 base ports
            and 107 terminal ports) that spread the market thinly.


     84.	   High trade costs are also a function of inadequate port facilities. Except for MICT and the new Davao
            International Container Terminal,55 Mindanao ports need significant upgrading to accommodate
            modern container cargo and larger vessels. Because many do not have quay-side cranes, ships must

            The Philippines trails its neighbors in various logistics performance and connectivity indices. Moreover, in 2004-2012 the country had the
            highest maritime casualty rate in the region (ASEAN-Japan Transport Partnership database).
      	
     52
            One problem with these estimates, which are averages based on available data, is that they do not compare similar products. A better
            approach would be to get the costs of shipping the same product for multinational companies (such as Nestlé or Unilever) that have
            operations in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This could form part of future analysis.
      	
     53
            Shipping directly from Davao to Hong Kong rather than Manilla would save 38 to 48 percent. Similarly, direct shipping from General Santos
            could save 38 to 57 percent (IFC 2012).
      	
     54
            Although one reason for high cost of shipping in the Philippines is its geography, Indonesia, which is a much bigger archipelago, has lower
            unit shipping costs.
      	
     55
            Only MICT and DICT offer cargo-handling services as efficient as those in Manila and Cebu ports. MICT cargo- handling services meet
            international standards (25 box moves/hour/crane). Similarly, DICT can do 25–28 moves/hour/crane. (In both cases this assumes that
            containers are ready for loading, loading lists are submitted promptly, and electronic data from previous ports is accurate).


32    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       carry their own cranes, which takes up cargo space. Structural berth deficiencies prevent the ports
       of Davao, General Santos, and Zamboanga from installing shore-based cranes (see also World Bank
       2014b). Many ports also lack conveyor belts, cold storage facilities, reefer plugs, bulk storage for grain
       (silos),56 and other timesaving equipment, such as reach stackers and bagging machines. Berth depth
       is also a problem. As the world’s vessel fleet is upgraded to larger ships, major ports in the Philippines
       must begin to accommodate deeper vessel drafts. Many ports, like CDO and Zamboanga, are already
       operating near full capacity, with little or no room for expansion because of their location in city centers;
       encroachment on port areas by shipping facilities, such as container yards; and informal settlements that
       have sprung up around the port. For these ports, in the long run relocation is the only feasible option.


85.	   These inefficiencies heighten turnaround time and hence shipping costs. On average, domestic
       vessels take 60 hours to turnaround in Davao and 75 hours in General Santos, compared to just 38
       hours in Manila. Turnaround times for foreign berths in Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Nasipit, Surigao,
       Davao, General Santos, and Zamboanga are all more than 38 hours.


Inefficient Regulation Pushes up Costs
86.	   Until recently, regulations made it hard for new firms to enter the industry. Firms wishing to operate
       a commercial domestic shipping service had to first obtain a certificate of public convenience (CPC)
       and give incumbents advance notice of their market entry and an invitation to a public hearing in which
       incumbents could contest the feasibility of the new service. At the very least, the regulation made it
       possible for incumbents to process to delay the entry of a new competitor and add to its startup cost; at
       worst, incumbents could use the CPC process to block entry altogether. Cumbersome and costly CPC
       procedures and their lack of transparency also deterred new firms from entering the market. However,
       in March 2014 the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) issued new regulations to streamline the CPC
       process and eliminate the requirement to inform incumbents of new market entry. This has reduced
       CPC processing time by some 40 percent because most applications are no longer contested. A new
       “special processing window/express lane” has also been created to bring CPC processing down to
       within nine days for particular types of vessels. By halving processing time, vessels can be deployed
       more quickly and more profitably.


87.	   Regulations require that some services to vessels be done in the Philippines even though cheaper
       options are available elsewhere. Currently, domestic vessels must dry dock and undergo repair in
       domestic shipyards, unless they have an exemption.57 Dry docking abroad (e.g., in China) can be up to 50
       percent cheaper for large vessels (World Bank 2014a). Even if transportation time and costs are factored
       in, it can still be cheaper to dry dock a vessel abroad.


88.	   The cabotage law restricts foreign shipping companies from serving domestic routes even if they
       can provide better services. This prevents the creation of combined domestic-overseas routes (e.g.,
       Hong Kong-Manila-Davao) that could reduce transshipment costs. However, the 2015 Foreign Ships
       Co-loading Act (Republic Act 10668) partly relaxed the restrictions by allowing foreign-flagged vessels

 	
56
       Loading 5,000 tons of grain, for example, takes one day if the port has silos and 10 days without (JICA 2014a).
 	
57
       Presidential Decree 1221 requires Philippine-flagged ships, even those engaged in international trade, to dry dock in the Philippines,
       unless they get an exemption.



                                                                                                   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   33
            to make direct calls on other Philippine ports to pick up and drop cargo, primarily in order to lower
            logistics costs for importers and exporters operating outside Manila and Cebu.58 With the reform,
            the Philippines is expected to attract more foreign ships to serve secondary ports that do not have
            sufficient trade volumes for regular ship calls—but to ensure that these ships come, the capacity of
            Mindanao ports needs to be upgraded. Further liberalization is needed before Mindanao can see
            significant impact on prices.


     89.	   Prohibitive taxes also discourage investment in more efficient ships. In 2012, the government clarified
            that firms chartering vessels need to pay value-added tax (VAT) and tariff on the value of the vessel. The
            previous practice was to exempt chartering from these taxes. The change makes chartering for short
            periods very costly.59 By limiting access to the global charter market, domestic shipping companies
            cannot quickly adjust to changes in market demand and bring in more efficient ships.


     Agency Contributions to High Costs
     90.	   The Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) has a serious conflict of interest. As regulator, the PPA approves
            and sets cargo-handling rates and other port charges (Asia Foundation 2011), but as operator, it also
            gets 10 percent of domestic cargo-handling rates and 20 percent of foreign. PPA also is well-placed to
            limit private port development to protect its own ports and operators. Recognizing the problem, the
            PPA is now drafting regulations to transfer full management of ports to the private sector, charging
            operators a fixed annual fee.


     91.	   The proliferation of regulatory agencies further adds to external trade costs and time. More than 40
            national agencies have some responsibilities for overseeing trade in the Philippines. For example, 11
            different offices of the DoA set agricultural import criteria, among them the Bureau of Plant Industry
            (BPI) for plant products, the National Food Authority for rice and corn, the Philippine Coconut Authority,
            the Bureau of Animal Industry for animal products, and the National Meat Inspection Service. Products
            already processed for human consumption fall within the purview of the Bureau of Food and Drugs
            (BFAD). Export requirements are also handled by several agencies, especially for regulated products.
            For instance, fresh fruit exporters have to obtain clearances and permits from the DoA’s BPI, the
            Department of Health, and the National Plant Quarantine Service. However, there is little information
            available and hardly any coordination between agencies; nor is it clear which clearances need to be
            obtained in central offices in Manila or in Mindanao local offices.


     92.	   Many agencies have little or no presence in Mindanao, forcing traders to go to Manila or a regional
            center to complete the requirements. For example, obtaining a Bureau of Customs (BOC) custom
            client number (CCN), initial accreditation of some agencies (e.g., BFAD), Bureau of Internal Revenue
            (BIR) approval for an importer’s customs code (ICC), or approval from the Philippine National Police
            to transport controlled chemical substances all require application in Manila. Moreover, the approval
            process in regional offices varies considerably. For exports, the processing of requirements and
      	
     58
            Severe port congestion in Manila in 2014 prevented imported goods from reaching Mindanao and delayed shipment of exports from
            there. Mindanao would not have been affected if shippers could bypass Manila.
      	
     59
            Vessel charters allow domestic firms to lease a ship for a specific period to test the feasibility of new routes or use new vessel types without
            shouldering the full cost outright. The current tax regime on vessel chartering limits the willingness of firms to charter vessels because they
            are highly unlikely to recover the additional taxes during the short charter period.



34    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
       accreditation appears to depend on the ability of the Philippine Exporters Confederation (PhilExport)
       regional offices and their relationship with the BOC regional offices. In SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII),
       when all documents are complete, PhilExport immediately issues a certification and the BOC regional
       office quickly grants approval. On the other hand, because of delays in BOC approval, in the Davao
       Region (Region XI), accreditation can take from a month to a year, depending on firm size (preference
       is given to large firms).


93.	   Institutional fragmentation and inadequate food safety regulation and standards contribute to the
       poor Philippine SPS track record for exports. A major problem for is the rejection of exported products
       for SPS reasons. Many countries, among them the United States, Australia, and Japan, regularly reject
       or detain Philippine produce caring pesticide residue, toxins, or bacteria.60 Philippine exporters also
       report problems in securing timely export SPS testing results. In particular, traders are concerned
       about the quality of the Department of Agriculture’s export and import laboratories. Upgrading
       these laboratories, along with improvements in quality assurance and development infrastructure,
       would increase the ability of exporters from Mindanao to compete and venture into new markets.
       The Department has identified over 170 public laboratories that lack central oversight, equipment,
       proper maintenance, training for personnel (in part due to weak budget incentives), consumables for
       testing produce, and limited compliance with International Organization for Standardization standards
       to achieve global recognition. There is also a lack of consistent policies to accredit private laboratories.


94.	   Restrictive regulatory practices and inefficient management encourage bribes to facilitate trade.
       Traders claim that they pay much more than the de jure costs to speed up the process. For example,
       exporters often face longer processing time if they do not pay grease money.61 In 2014, the Export
       Development Council (EDC) conducted a survey on the cost of exporting in Manila. In 2015, the World
       Bank expanded its survey to CDO in Mindanao and it is now being conducted in Davao City. The
       Mindanao survey finds that in contrast to Manila, where corruption is minimal, Mindanao exporters have
       to pay more bribes to speed up transactions. Because of the limited availability of shipping, exporters
       would rather pay up than risk missing a shipment schedule. In Cagayan de Oro, for unregulated
       commodities, total de jure cost per transaction averages PHP 4,389 and total de facto cost ranges
       from PHP 6,575 to more than PHP 8,000. For regulated commodities, exporters reportedly have to
       pay about PHP 3,000 more in un-receipted costs per transaction. These findings are corroborated by
       anecdotal evidence from exporters.


Policies to Lower Shipping Costs
95.	   Increasing the scale of port operations could greatly reduce shipping costs. This requires a holistic
       package to build better port-related road networks, modernize ports to accommodate larger and more
       efficient vessels, and liberalize cabotage and other barriers to competition to entice more efficient shipping
       operators. Trade-offs arising from cargo consolidation, such as city road congestion, can be mitigated by
       improving port access roads (e.g., bypass roads—see above). Two options can be considered:


 	
60
       For instance, in 2010, in terms of countries with the most frequent agri-food import rejections, the Philippines ranked 13th in Japan, 7th
       in Australia, and 12th in the United States (Institute of Developing Economies-Japan External Trade Organization 2013).
 	
61
       Examples of grease money are payments to speed processing time, minimize intentional delays, and prevent physical inspection of cargo.



                                                                                                  A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development      35
     96.	   One option is to consolidate more cargo, whether domestic or foreign, at the MICT in Tagaloan, near
            Cagayan de Oro,62 as the gateway to all Mindanao. MICT has one of the most modern port facilities in
            Mindanao and has room for expansion. It is strategically located with easy connection to Visayas and Luzon.
            In fact, most ships can reduce costs by docking in northern Mindanao rather than sailing around the
            island to reach General Santos, Cotabato, and Davao on the southern coast. Recognizing its potential,
            Unilever, Nestle, and other firms have built warehouses and distribution centers. To making Tagaloan
            the gateway, it will need to expand the number of berths, invest in modern port equipment, and
            expand the road network considerably to efficiently connect Tagaloan to other regions—a must before
            firms would consider spending more on efficient trucking services.63 At the same time, city diversion
            and bypass roads are needed to reduce congestion in Metro Cagayan de Oro, because consolidation
            will significantly increase traffic.


     97.	   Another option is for Cagayan de Oro to specialize in domestic cargo while Davao specializes in
            foreign cargo. CDO has a clear advantage in domestic trade, and Davao has the potential to emerge as
            a hub for foreign trade. The Davao port system (DICT and Sasa ports) can be an international gateway
            because it is the largest consumer hub in Mindanao, is home to major agricultural exporters, and
            ships call directly to Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan. With more investment
            and policy reforms, Davao can become the transshipment hub for the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-
            Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) region. Like the previous option, this will
            only be successful if complementary reforms in roads, port modernization, and shipping liberalization
            are pursued in parallel.


     98.	   Consolidating domestic cargo around these ports could increase scale to the level of Manila and
            Cebu and reduce costs significantly. The 2016 domestic cargo traffic for the government ports of
            Davao, Cagayan de Oro, MICT, General Santos, and Zamboanga totaled 10.7 million metric tons
            inbound, slightly larger than the traffic in the Southern Luzon ports, and 6.77 million metric tons
            outbound. Export and import cargo in the five ports equals 8.9 million metric tons inbound and 5.4
            million metric tons outbound, which is higher than Cebu’s inbound cargo of 3.2 million metric tons and
            outbound cargo of 1.2 million metric tons. Consolidation could reduce shipping rates in Davao from
            PHP44,000 per container to a level closer to Cebu’s PHP32,000. Moreover, larger scale would increase
            the availability of direct routes, further reducing costs.


     99.	   In addition to consolidation, ports could be made more efficient and trade costs reduced, through
            higher investment and better regulation. The investment needs of major ports (CDO, Davao, General
            Santos, and Zamboanga) are substantial, so a decision on whether to consolidate the operations of
            the many other ports on the island would be important. Without consolidation, the investment budget
            will need to provide for immediate installation of quay cranes, cold storage, reefer facilities, and other
            equipment and facilities to reduce service time. Higher repair and maintenance budgets in PPA, Cebu
            Port Authority (CPA), and independent port authorities for port structures and regular dredging works
            would avoid more expensive rehabilitation or reconstruction work.

      	
     62
            Cagayan de Oro ports account for only 30 percent of total Mindanao domestic cargo.
      	
     63
            Consolidation and improving road network are endogenous. For example, now that there are better roads to Zamboanga, ship calls to
            smaller cities like Pagadian have been decreasing.



36    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
100.	 Getting the private sector more involved in port operations would enhance competition and improve
      efficiency. Privatizing ownership, management, or operation of PPA/CPA-owned ports can encourage
      modernization. Privatization efforts should focus on the major base ports to improve the quality of
      their service. Privatized services might include port management, investment in equipment, or cargo
      handling. At the same time, private commercial ports that complement public ports need to be
      supported. The private ports through which high-value processed foods and crop exports (e.g., fresh
      and processed fruits), tend to have better port facilities with phytosanitary treatment and testing that
      is not usually available in public ports.


101.	 Removing constraints on competition would reduce shipping costs and improve services and
      safety standards. Eliminating licensing requirements for domestic vessels to ship goods to foreign
      ports would enable local shipping companies to partner with foreign companies, which would give
      them access to better prices for the purchase or lease of new ships, a larger market, and state-of-
      the-art shipping management and information systems. Because safety standards are more strictly
      enforced on international routes, this would result in an upgraded domestic fleet and fewer maritime
      accidents. Most importantly, it would allow operators to maximize the cargo load of ships with an
      optimum mix of domestic and export cargo. Clarifying that the VAT tax does not apply to the whole
      value of chartered vessels would enable firms to lease ships temporarily to test out new routes or new
      shipping technology. Removing the requirement to dry dock and repair domestic ships exclusively in
      the Philippines would increase the competition domestic shipyards face and reduce costs for domestic
      shipping operators. For the largest vessels, eliminating this requirement could save up to 50 percent
      of dry-docking costs. And shifting port tariffs from a percentage of cargo-handling fees (which in part
      determines PPA revenues) to a fixed annual charge would reduce the conflicts of interest inherent in
      the PPAs dual role as regulator and operator.


102.	 Allowing foreign shipping companies to operate domestically would also enhance competition.
      International evidence suggests that opening up the domestic shipping industry to international
      competition can improve efficiency. For example, in New Zealand, freight rates dropped by 25 to 50
      percent following cabotage liberalization in 1995. For certain types of cargo (mostly containerized), the
      cost of shipping via larger and more advanced foreign-flagged vessels is lower, while the need to transfer
      cargo between international and domestic vessels could be reduced. Cabotage liberalization also can
      increase adherence to international safety standards and good practices, introduced technological
      advances, and reduce the acquisition costs of new and safer vessels.


103.	 The legal obstacles to removing restrictions on cabotage are significant. The 2015 Foreign Ships Co-
      loading Act (RA 10668) allows foreign ships to load and unload import and export cargo along domestic
      routes after being cleared at the port of entry. This is expected to reduce costs for importers and
      exporters, and decongest ports. However, full cabotage liberalization would require a constitutional
      amendment to eliminate the restriction on foreign ownership of shipping, perhaps relegating the
      decision to impose restrictions to congress or the president using the biannual foreign investment
      negative list. A more gradual approach would begin with changes that require only executive action,
      such as simplifying procedures, granting more special permits, and promoting time and bareboat
      charters. Special permits could be given more often to ancillary and adjunct cargo and to high-impact


                                                                            A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   37
            routes, which can help lower shipping costs and improve efficiency—two reasons that can justify the
            public interest criterion for special permits. Time and bareboat charters could be promoted to facilitate
            the access of domestic firms to better ships and more innovative foreign maritime technologies and
            practices. Chartering lowers the upfront investment costs for deploying better and more efficient ships,
            particularly those that comply with international safety standards.


     Regulation, Efficiency, and Costs
     104.	 There is considerable potential for reducing trade costs by simplifying regulations and improving
            transparency. Full implementation of the National Single Window (NSW) automated system, especially
            for small traders on Mindanao, and ensuring the flow of government data would significantly reduce the
            regulatory burden on traders. Enhancing the NSW could facilitate clearances by all relevant government
            agencies (which now number about 42) via a single gateway/website, as would full integration of the
            system with the BOC declaration processing system. The government can also explore extending the
            DoA and BOC risk management functionality to other agencies.


     105.	 Publishing information on all trade procedures, processes, fees, rules, regulations, and agreed
            performance standards would improve transparency. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
            has launched the Philippine National Trade Repository (PNTR) for this purpose. However, many
            PNTR functions require enhancement, such as the commodity search function that lays out specific
            requirements for each type of product to be imported. Providing detailed information on export and
            import procedures on the BOC website64 would make it possible to monitor the actual cost of trading
            across borders. Moreover, creating a simple, user-friendly trade portal, similar to those established in
            Laos and now being rolled out in Cambodia and Myanmar, would benefit traders.


     106.	 There is also potential for eliminating redundant regulatory steps. For example, enabling BOC divisions
            to have access to export declarations online would make it feasible to eliminate the requirement that
            exporters submit a printed copy to different divisions. An online system would also remove the need for
            traders to travel to major cities to get approvals, thus reducing transaction costs—and opportunities for
            corrupt practices. Also, devolving decision making and responsibilities for logistics-related regulations
            to regional and port offices, while improving communications to facilitate their coordination, would
            reduce costs for traders in Mindanao.


     107.	 Finally, increased resources and changes in procedures would improve compliance with quality and
            with SPS rules. Modern IT systems and scientific analytical techniques can be used to manage biological
            risks. Quality assurance gaps can be closed by introducing trade traceability and technology-enabled
            regulatory services to enable the exchange of SPS data with trading partners. Key reforms include
            (1) inventorying current bureau laboratory capacity and funding; (2) focusing efforts on improving
            compliance rates for key crops, e.g., reducing offshore market pest finds on Philippine bananas; and
            (3) analyzing data from exporters to reduce resources for inspecting compliant traders and focus on
            those that are high-risk.

Improving Power and ICT Infrastructure


6.1 Ensuring Adequate Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution                                                           65




108.	 Daily power outages are a huge cost to businesses, which consistently cite unreliable power supply,
     after logistics problems and conflict, as one of the three most binding constraints on investing in
     Mindanao. In 2015, in major cities scheduled power outages due to insufficient generation averaged
     three hours a day (Table 4). Occasional unscheduled shutdowns and maintenance of power plants can
     add up to four hours,66 and transmission repairs due to bombings can take weeks.67 Besides disrupting
     work, power outages and fluctuations can damage machinery and equipment. The total cost of power
     outages is huge: perhaps PHP42 billion (0.3 percent of Philippine GDP) in 2015 in Davao City,68 and PHP
     600 million for businesses in Zamboanga City for three months during the peak of the 2013 Mindanao
     power crisis.69


Problems of the Power Sector
109.	 The bulk of power generation in Mindanao for about 50 years has come from hydroelectric plants
     built, owned, and operated by the government’s National Power Corporation.70 Private sector
     participation in power generation was discouraged by fixing hydroelectric power at a very attractive
     price of PHP2.9 per kwh. Since no new capacity was coming on line, the island came to rely on a
     collection of smaller, oil-fired generators, often mounted on barges, to meet peak demand and

     This section draws largely from Townsend (2016).

     For example, in early 2016, a seven-day corrective maintenance of a unit of the Therma South coal-fired plant in Davao City led to daily
     brownouts lasting three to four hours (Lacorte 2016).
 	
67
     For example, the November 2015 bombing of transmission lines in Marawi City shut out power from the Agus-1 and Agus-2 hydroelectric
     power plants for more than two weeks (Manar 2015).
 	
68
     The chamber of commerce estimates the hourly cost of power outages at PHP 80 million, as reported in the Inquirer article by de Quiros
     (2016). The cost for 2015 assumes two hours of power outages a day x 260 work days x PHP80 million = PHP41.6 billion.
 	
69
     This is double the amount of business tax paid by Zamboanga businesses in 2014. A major hospital spends an additional PHP 600,000
     a month on generators (http://www.zamboangachamber.com/home/articles/172--the-cost-and-effect-of-the-power-crisis-on-businesses-
     and-residents-of-zamboanga-city).

     Until coal power plants began operations in 2016, state-owned hydroelectric resources plants provided about half of installed capacity,
     with 36 percent provided by diesel, 10 percent by goal, 5 percent by geothermal, 2 percent by biomass, and 0.5 percent by solar.

                                                1. Unreliable power supply, leading to daily power outages.
                                                2. Businesses incur huge costs due to loss of power during business hours.

            years.

              provide back-up during drought. Businesses addressing the issue by buying their own generators, and
              the government commissioned oil-fired generators to address the supply deficiencies. However, the
              unit cost of oil-fired power can be more than twice the cost of power from the grid, which reducing
              Mindanao’s competitiveness generally.


     110.	 Decades of overreliance on hydroelectric power, inadequate maintenance, and underinvestment
              in other power sources has limited the growth in capacity. Meanwhile, economic growth in the
              past decade heightened demand for power and pressure arose because of agricultural and urban


40   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
          competition for water use. As a result, excess capacity during times of peak demand fell below zero.
          The problems reached a climax during the severe El Niño-induced drought of 2010–2011, when
          blackouts affected much of Mindanao. El Niño also exposed the overuse of hydroelectric resources,
          because little attention had been given to storing water in case of drought.


111.	 Power transmission is vulnerable to sabotage and complicated by unclear property rights. From
          January 2015 to April 2016, 21 transmission towers were bombed.71 Repairs on half of these were
          impeded by landowners blocking access to the site, claiming the government had not paid rent for
          decades.72 Many transmission lines, such as those connected to the Baloi substation in Lanao del Norte,
          are also vulnerable to vegetation and structures placed underneath them by landowners, presumably
          to extract rents by creating transmission problems.


112.	 Poor management of electric cooperatives (ECs) impairs distribution. Power distribution in Mindanao
          is administered through four private distribution utilities (in Davao, Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, and
          Cotabato); 25 ECs that are connected to the grid; and seven ECs in outlying islands. ECs and their
          customers have inherited a decades-old situation of bad management and counterproductive
          contracts, as when long-term fixed contracts have been awarded without competition. These problems
          are widely recognized and are often being addressed, but it will take years to clear up the situation.
          Even with a generation surplus that began in 2016, many areas of Mindanao may continue to suffer
          from power outages because of high systems losses, low collection efficiency, and mounting debts
          (Table 5).73 More broadly, EC management and operating problems of Mindanao ECs will continue
          to block full development of the power sector, including efforts to achieve universal electrification;
          currently, despite improvements in recent years, electrification is 80 percent in Mindanao—the national
          average is 89 percent—and just 49 percent in ARMM (Figure 21).

          Some ECs in Mindanao would like to disconnect from the grid because of collection problems. It is said that for some ECs local politicians
          control the board or coerce it to supply electricity free, supposedly to fulfill campaign promises. In ARMM many WX customers refuse to
          pay electricity bills (Antonio 2012).

     Effects of the Power Crisis
     113.	 The power crisis led to a steep rise in power supply. Private investors have begun to build new
           generation facilities, mostly coal-fired plants, which should add 1,610 MW by 2020 to double the
           installed capacity and ensure adequate supply at least until 2023 if growth is low (DOE and MinDA
           2014). Some investors have not even waited for the government to approve of power sales agreements.
           The increased market competition has then driven down the prices offered to ECs. While the supply
           response to the power crisis could rapidly turn shortages into surpluses, increased reliance on coal
           power raises environmental and economic risks (Box 2).


     Box 2: The impact of coal-fired plants in Mindanao

      The continuing rise in coal-fired power plants raises serious economic and environmental concerns.
      While efficient coal plants are the least-cost approach to baseload generation in Luzon and major Asian
      markets, the sizes of plants to serve the Mindanao market are too small to achieve comparably low
      prices. Moreover, the rapid increase in capacity in Mindanao means that initially some new units will run
      at relatively low capacity, pushing unit costs above those of natural gas-fired plants in mid-cycle and peak
      operation. The coal plants will also reduce the potential to attract least-cost investments in more efficient
      gas-fired capacity and in renewable energy.

      Heavy reliance on coal-fired plants will have severe environmental consequences. A coal-intensive
      business as usual case would imply a rise in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates in areas
      where coal-fired power plants are situated, resulting in smog, acid rain, and health concerns. In this
      scenario, if installed coal-fired generation should exceed 4,800 MW by 2035, CO2 emissions will
      jump from about 2 million tons in 2015 to as much as 25 million tons by 2035. Yet by that time per
      capita consumption of electricity in Mindanao would still be only about half the projected national
      average—and one-quarter of per capita consumption in China today. Without limits on coal-fired
      plants, Mindanao’s CO2 emissions would amount to 21 million tons per year, compared to only 6.3
      million tons if Mindanao is to make a proportional contribution to the Philippines Paris conference
      commitments for carbon emissions.

      Aggressive policy actions could encourage greater reliance on natural gas and renewables. A scenario
      that assumes increasing inflows of climate investment funds to support renewables, using coal only for
      efficient baseload operations, introducing more power generation from natural gas, and retiring existing
      oil-fired capacity could substantially reduce CO2-emission to about 16 million tons per year by 2030 —
      still much higher than the Paris commitment and underscoring the fact that the coal build-out underway
      now will lock in emissions for years to come.

114.	 The government, with MinDA leadership, has moved decisively to address Mindanao’s power
             problems. In July 2012, the Mindanao Power Monitoring Committee was created to coordinate policy
             reforms and investment in new generation capacity. Some rehabilitation work is in progress at the
             Agus and Pulangi hydroelectric power complexes, but Agus needs more work. A web-based, one-stop
             facilitation and monitoring center was created to fast-track renewable energy project applications.
             A Mindanao power data portal was launched to monitor the power situation. In transmission, the
             National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) is investing in better networks and studying the
             feasibility of connecting the Mindanao grid to the integrated Luzon and the Visayas grid via Negros
             and Misamis Occidental, where there are already broadband submarine cables. Together with the
             government, NGCP is also working to improve transmission tower security. Meanwhile the government
             is encouraging better EC management of distribution through reforms in composition of the boards,
             more detailed financial and management reporting, more transparency about EC credit status, and
             tighter but more efficient regulation—all supported by budget support for expanding electrification.
             These efforts have had some success. However, the attempt to establish an Interim Mindanao Energy
             Market (IMEM) to attract more energy supplies into the grid, did not succeed, in part because the ECs
             cannot afford oil-fired power.


The Importance of Planning and Policy Changes
115.	 For generation, long-term supply planning should start today and bureaucratic requirements should be
             rationalized to speed investment. While the generation shortfall is expected to be relieved as of 2016,
             a deficit could return as early as 2020 if Mindanao growth accelerates and suppressed demand starts
             sourcing from the grid74 as demand catches up with new supply. From 2015 to 2030, the Department
             of Energy (DOE) estimates that Mindanao needs 910 MW of new capacity75 in addition to committed


 	
74
             In a high-growth scenario, where peak demand increases by an annual average of 9.1 percent, the critical supply period will be reached
             at 2020, when 150 MW of baseload plants will be required. This will require 4,930 MW in addition to committed projects to meet peak
             demand and reserves through 2030 (source: DOE and MinDA 2014).
 	
75
             This comprises 210 MW of baseload (e.g., coal, geothermal, run-of-river hydro, and nuclear) and 700 MW of midrange (e.g., natural gas
             and diesel gas turbine).



                                                                                                          A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   43
            power projects.76 Long-term planning is being facilitated by the MDA and DOE based on the Mindanao
            Energy Plan 2014–30. This could be facilitated by rationalizing the complex bureaucratic procedures
            for building a generating plant. According to DOE, it takes on average of three to five years before a
            power plant is put up, in large part because LGUs (LGUs) take so long to issue the necessary permits.
            Over the medium term, Mindanao could expand its generation portfolio to cheaper and cleaner
            power sources. For example, rural and off-grid electrification could be enhanced by investing in solar
            energy, supported by feed-in-tariff subsidies, and a public-private partnership could be established
            to develop a floating terminal for liquefied natural gas. The government has identified the area
            around the Phividec Industrial Park, which hosts the MICT, near CDO as the least-cost location for
            such a terminal.77


     116.	 Amendments to policies and regulations could greatly strengthen the power sector. Greater private
            sector development of least-cost energy sources could be encouraged, for example, by restructuring
            the Agus and Pulangi hydro contracts and operating protocols to bring prices up to where they would
            reflect the true economic value for mid-cycle and peaking requirements in Mindanao. This policy would
            lay a firm foundation for investments in least-cost generation to ensure that there is enough reserve
            capacity to carry Mindanao through droughts. Diversifying Mindanao’s energy mix to cleaner and more
            sustainable sources over time would free up scarce water to irrigate farms and supply growing cities.
            With a sustained surplus within reach, a wholesale electricity spot market could be established in
            Mindanao, which could make power rates more competitive. Increases in power generation would
            have much more economic impact if steps are taken to protect power system assets from sabotage; to
            improve management of ECs (depoliticizing the boards and privatizing some ECs that could be better
            managed by the private sector, leading to greater accountability and a more results-oriented design
            for electrification subsidies; and to encourage distribution companies to optimize the portfolio mix
            of coal, natural gas, large hydro, and renewables through more competitive procurement of power.
            In the absence of competition, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) needs to avoid approving
            expensive power supply agreements. Finally, subsidies to poor consumers (lifeline rates) could be
            enhanced by better targeting and more transparency.


     6.2 Creating Internet Services78
     117.	 Efficient and affordable Internet service has the potential to transform Mindanao, as it has transformed
            Manila. Telecom liberalization in the 1990s paved the way for the IT business process outsourcing
            (IT-BPO) industry,79 one of the main drivers of growth in the Philippine economy. In 16 years, the
            industry, centered in Manila, has created over a million direct and five million indirect jobs in real
            estate, construction, finance, telecoms, and trade. Through strong multiplier effects, it contributes
            some 10 percent of GDP. It is now expanding aggressively to secondary cities; Davao has emerged as

            As of 2016 aggregate capacity of committed power projects was 1,854 MW—1,610 MW of coal, 16.7 MW of oil- based, 131.8 MW of hydro,
            55 MW of biomass, and 40 MW of solar (MinDA 2016).

            The Philippine IT-BPO industry includes contact centers, back office services, data transcription, animation, software development,
            engineering development, and game development. Since 2000, it has grown at exponential rates. In 2015, it employed over 1.2 million
            workers and generated US$22 billion in revenues.

     BPO firms in Davao and Cagayan de Oro, with total employment of 35,389. Other major cities, such as
     General Santos and Iligan, are marketing themselves to attract IT-BPO firms.

119.	 Should Internet services improve, there is considerable potential for the growth of IT-BPO firms in
     Mindanao. In 2012, about 60 percent of IT-BPO firms in Mindanao had fewer than 20 employees.86 The
     Davao ICT Council suggests that IT-BPO jobs could easily double by 2019 if Internet and skills constraints
     are addressed. Many individuals have found Internet-based self-employment (“e-lancing”).87 For
     instance, Iligan has no IT-BPO firms but has the second largest e-lancing industry outside Metro Manila,
     earning PHP 342 million from 2010 to 2014 (see also Garcia 2014). Even cities in conflict-affected areas
     like Zamboanga, Marawi, and Cotabato could benefit from IT-BPO services. For instance, Cotabato

     The 2015 Tholons top 100 outsourcing destinations in the world ranked Davao 69th among 100 cities. Davao is also in the 10 “next wave”

     Latency or round-trip time (RTT), usually measured in milliseconds, is the amount of time needed for a data packet to reach its destination.
     The more “hops” or stops the data packet makes, the longer the RTT. This affects applications such as voice over internet protocol (VoIP)
     and online games. Jitter is the fluctuation or variation of end-to-end delays from one packet to the next. Commonly referred to as “noise,”
     it usually impacts real-time traffic such as VoIP. Packet loss is the percent of data packets that do not reach their destination.

     In the absence of official data, a third-party website (http.testmy.net) was used to collect Internet speed. Individual speed test results
     from each city are averaged. This method depends on the plan of each user who conducted the speed test. The plans are assumed to
     be fairly similar.

            and Marawi have substantial Moro populations with some knowledge of Arabic, which could attract
            the Arab market. However, only one BPO firm set up office in 2011 in Cotabato, and it closed down
            after a year because of unreliable Internet and power supply, and lack of skills. Similarly, Zamboanga,
            whose people speak a Creole Spanish, Chavacano, could attract the Spanish market, but only three
            small BPO firms have set up operations, and one has now closed. The local ICT council cites poor
            Internet quality as a major constraints. The situation in Zamboanga is so bad that the two remaining
            BPOs and perhaps other major firms have to subscribe to two Internet service providers (ISPs), paying
            double to ensure a reliable connection.

     The Value of Increasing Competition
     120.	 In the Philippines the Internet is essentially a duopoly. Both the fixed and the mobile broadband
            markets are dominated by two players, one with 70 percent of the market and the other 28 percent.
            Both are vertically integrated: they control the international gateway facility (landing station for
            submarine cables), the backhaul (domestic cable backbone), the middle mile88 (wholesale line), and
            the last mile (retail line89). This is in sharp contrast to the open access models found in other countries,

      	
     88
            The middle-mile transit is the second segment in the telecom structure, in which data from international gateways or landing stations are
            distributed for in-country transit.
      	
     89
            The duopoly typically allows small independent ISPs to serve new markets or missionary areas, but once the market matures, they often
            enter with predatory pricing to gain market share.




46    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
      where different players operate different segments. The global best practice, full open access, is found
      in the United Kingdom and Singapore. Though other countries have varying degrees of open access,
      none is as vertically integrated as the Philippines.


121.	 Competition is deterred by the analog legal framework for the Internet, which has not caught up with
      the digital world.90 The analog framework is based on a centralized, monolithic, and obsolete long-
      distance telephone system to govern the naturally decentralized Internet, which does not fit in this
      old system. The obsolete system encourages high barriers to entry, anticompetitive practices, weak
      regulation, and underinvestment in infrastructure.


122.	 The 1987 Constitution and the 1936 Public Services Act limit foreign ownership of telecom companies
      to 40 percent, even if the sector, being capital-intensive and technology-driven, could benefit from
      foreign participation. The 1936 act requires telecom companies to secure both a congressional
      franchise (even if some services do not directly serve the public) and a license to operate from the
      National Telecommunications Commission (NTC). Securing a franchise is a cumbersome and protracted
      process that dissuades new players from entering. The 1996 Telecoms Act, enacted on the eve of
      the Internet era, mandates that while certain value-added services such as data/Internet and related
      services may be provided by entities that are not franchised public telecommunications entities (PTEs),
      but NTC rules still require that non-PTE value-added services ultimately purchase Internet connectivity
      from PTEs. These services are not regulated. Moreover, only telecom companies can purchase data
      from international gateway facilities and distribute bandwidth. The law also requires ISPs to use
      telecom company infrastructure, and prohibits ISPs from building their own networks. The outcome? A
      duopoly structure that is highly vertically integrated. At the retail level, duopoly dominance has led to
      a substantial decline in the number of ISPs, from about 300 in the 1990s to just 10 in 2014.


123.	 The highly vertically integrated industry in the Philippines breeds anticompetitive practices, especially
      in Mindanao, where prices are highest and the speeds slowest. By law,91 ISPs must use the backhaul
      network of telecom companies, and this entails access charges, which are not and negotiated by
      the telecom company and the ISP. Wholesale and retail pricing is also deregulated. This in effect
      authorizes the duopoly to charge monopoly prices and provide low quality service. Reportedly, some
      telecom companies charge exorbitant rates and their contracts have non-disclosure clauses. For
      example, according to industry observers, landing station bandwidth that costs US$3 to 6 per mbps
      (if buying at least 1 gbps) are reportedly sold by telecom companies for US$20 to US$105 in Manila
      and up to US$200 in Mindanao.92 Moreover, unconditional Internet protocol (IP) peering, which allows
      customers from different ISPs to exchange local data traffic without leaving national borders, is not a
      universal practice even though the DoST has established neutral local IP exchange by the Department
      of Science and Technology (DoST). This is because the dominant player refused to engage in neutral,
      multilateral, and settlement-free peering with other telecom companies and ISPs, preferring instead to
      negotiate bilaterally negotiations and charge a fee to connect to its system. This further slows Internet
      speed, as data need to take a circuitous route halfway around the globe and back. Finally, there is no

            specific policy for local loop unbundling where incumbents give competitors access to their networks.
            The end result is that the duopoly pair are among the most profitable telecom companies in the world,
            with EBITDA93 margins of 40–45 percent for the past few years.


     124.	 The poor regulatory regime makes it difficult for the government to protect the interest of consumers.
            There is no explicit competition policy for telecoms; decisions on mergers and acquisitions are not
            transparent and do not conform to the antitrust mandate in RA 7925 and Executive Order 546;94
            spectrum allocation is not competitive, transparent, or efficient; and consumer protection by both the
            NTC and the DTI is inadequate in both form and substance. The lack of regulations to protect consumers
            has encouraged opaque, unilateral data usage caps set by the duopoly. To a large extent, obsolete laws
            (e.g., RA 7925) have rendered many provisions and penalties useless. For instance, telecom companies
            would rather pay the fine of PHP 200 per day than comply and lose monopoly profit.


     125.	 Underinvestment in fiber optic cables and cellular towers, especially in Mindanao, has exacerbated
            Internet service problems. Civil works account for about 75 percent of the cost of a fiber optic corridor,
            and cellular towers can easily account for 50 percent of capital expenditure and some 60 percent of
            operating expenditure. Still, telecom companies prefer to prioritize raising corporate earnings over
            investing in remote areas like Mindanao. These problems are exacerbated by agency bureaucratic
            requirements (some LGUs are said to demand informal payments), demands from private property
            owners, and a lack of coordination with public works projects to share the network and the cost of civil
            works. In Mindanao, lack of competition translates to lack of interest in investing in a small market.
            For instance, apart from the backbone and the middle mile, Mindanao would benefit from its own
            landing station in Davao (the site identified by one of the duopolies) or Parang (the site identified by
            the BIMP-EAGA Submarine Terrestrial [BEST] Cable Project), but there are few incentives to encourage
            this. Moreover, even with additional landing stations, bringing that connectivity inland and distributing
            it across the region will be difficult, given the duopoly structure of Internet service delivery. Finally,
            because ICT infrastructure has to traverse rural areas to reach cities, it is readily sabotages. This problem
            is quite severe in Cotabato, Zamboanga, and Marawi, where cellular towers have been bombed.


     126.	 A series of coordinated national policy reforms is needed to reduce Internet cost and improve speed
            in Mindanao. The Philippines needs an updated digital strategy and a national broadband plan that
            emphasizes lagging areas like Mindanao. The strategy could identify policy reforms to lower cost and
            increase speed. The DICT can lead this initiative, with significant inputs from the private sector, the
            IT-BPAP, academia, and national and regional ICT councils. The MDA could begin coordinating with
            stakeholders to ensure that the strategy and plan capture Mindanao’s ICT needs. It could also draft a
            Mindanao-wide broadband plan as input to the national plan.

            mergers and acquisitions. However, in its decision to approve the merger, no official documentation, such as position papers or comments
            by parties opposing the decision, was made available for public review. The NTC simply said it used public interest as the criterion for
            approval, without defining what in its view constituted public interest.




48    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
127.	 The legal framework must be changed to spur competition through open access. A first-best solution
     would be to amend the 1987 Constitution to remove the restriction on foreign ownership of public
     utilities and relegate this power to congress, where in light of new developments liberalization can be
     discussed more openly. If constitutional change is not feasible, a second-best solution would be to
     amend the 1936 Public Services Act and 1995 Telecoms Act to (1) remove the need for congressional
     approval to operate landing stations and the middle-mile backbone; (2) delink telephone and Internet
     services; (3) “unbundle” the industry to allow access of infrastructure and services separately;95 and (4)
     limit the scope of public service to the retail stage, as is done for the power sector.96 These changes
     would open up ownership of infrastructure and service delivery to greater competition by addressing
     negotiated pricing and nondisclosure agreements, which would in turn reduce access charges. Next
     steps to level the playing field would be for the government to (1) support open and neutral Internet
     exchange points like the Philippine Open Internet Exchange to allow more local peering; (2) establish
     a clear policy on local loop unbundling so that competitors can access the networks of incumbent
     operators; and (3) promote sharing the costs of infrastructure networks and civil works to encourage
     telecom companies to invest more.


128.	 Changes in the legal framework would be more effective if complemented by improvements in
     regulatory oversight. To ensure compliance, the new Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and
     the NTC could be more proactive. Priorities for the PCC could be to (1) establish a clear competition
     policy for telecom companies; (2) review market structure and address any antitrust violations; and (3)
     enforce sanctions as needed. The NTC could set clear guidelines on spectrum allocation and make
     the process more transparent and consultative. Working with the DTI Consumer Protection Bureau,
     the NTC could enhance consumer protection by issuing regulations and penalize ISPs that misuse
     terms like “unlimited” service and deviate regularly from the published Internet speed. Finally,
     to improve transparency and service delivery the NTC can publicize in the open data portal the
     performance of ISPs.


How Cooperation Can Contribute to Better Internet Services
129.	 Speeding up important ICT infrastructure projects in Mindanao would lower costs and up the speed
     of internet services. More public-private coordination and partnerships to reduce construction costs
     could spur investment in fiber-optic corridors. For instance, fiber-optic laying and road projects can
     be done simultaneously to share civil works expense and significantly reduce cost (by about half for
     telecom companies).97 Where there is no private sector interest, the public sector could build the
     middle-line during public works projects and then lease the operation to the private sector under
     open and nondiscriminatory access at competitive prices. MINDA could lead this initiative as part of
     the formulation of a Mindanao broadband plan, in coordination with various local government units
     and regional offices of concerned line agencies such as the Department of Public Works and Highways.
     In addition, while subsidies are generally not needed given strong market demand, some depressed

 	
95
     “Unbundled access” refers to policies where new entrants are allowed to the incumbent’s facilities. Currently, the two largest players in the
     telecommunications industry own and control most of the existing internet infrastructure. Thus, the dominant companies dictate access of
     internet services in the Philippines (Mirandilla-Santos, 2016a).
 	
96
     At present, only telecom companies with a congressional franchise may provide middle-mile service. This has allowed large companies to
     engage in uncompetitive practices.
 	
97
     This is in line with the proposal of the DOST ICT Office (DOST-ICTO) to embed ducting in road widening and repair projects.

            areas, such as ARMM, may need subsidies to entice more investment. Also, investing in new landing
            stations can further improve speed and lower prices significantly. Key locations for landing stations are
            Davao and Cagayan de Oro, in addition to the planned landing station in Parang, Maguindanao.


     130.	 The regional government and the MINDA could improve Internet service in ARMM, and potentially
            the rest of Mindanao, by facilitating realization of the BEST cable project. The BEST cable system,
            with Parang, Maguindanao, as landing station98 will directly link ARMM to Singapore, Malaysia, and
            Brunei without passing through Luzon, where most international landing stations are located. Because
            it is autonomous, ARMM has the power to regulate Internet service within its territory. The project
            could lower Internet cost in ARMM significantly and enable it to leapfrog into a modern information-
            based economy. Reforms already discussed would enable the rest of Mindanao to benefit.


     131.	 Cutting LGU red tape would reduce the costs of laying fiber optic lines and building cellular towers.
            The number of requirements and the costs, plus informal payments, add to the already very large
            capital expenditure these activities require. Telecom companies must also deal with right-of-way
            issues, which often delay projects. Rationalizing requirements, making processes more transparent,
            reducing unnecessary costs, and addressing right-of-way issues by advancing titling and registration
            reforms (see below) could attract telecoms investors, especially in Mindanao. Similarly, national
            governments could reduce the bureaucratic requirements associated with issuing licenses. Finally,
            allowing LGUs to build their own backhaul and retail infrastructure in partnership with the private
            sector could be promoted.

            The franchise for this landing station is provided by the ARMM regional assembly.

Supporting Private Investment


7.1 Preparing for a Skill-based Economy in Mindanao
132.	 Despite heavy demand, skills shortages are slowing expansion of the IT-BPO industry. The Davao
          ICT council estimated job vacancies at 5,500 in 2015, but the industry could not fill them although
          every year 20,000 students graduate from college99 in Davao City and surrounding provinces.100 Most
          applicants in Davao are rejected for lack of both soft101 and technical skills.102 This results in a supply
          gap of 70 percent in Davao’s ICT sector and 40 percent in Davao’s BPO industry.103 In CDO, this is less
          of a problem because the industry is much smaller here. A shortage of engineers is also affecting
          manufacturing, construction, and utility firms in Mindanao.104 The construction sector is hard-pressed
          to find civil, electrical, design, planning, and contract engineers. Manufacturing is seeking mechanical,
          chemical, and industrial engineers. Business chambers confirm a dearth of engineers in Mindanao,
          as the very few engineering graduates tend to leave Mindanao for jobs in Manila and overseas. As
          leading cities in Mindanao transform into manufacturing and high-skill services economies, skills will
          become even more important. The major reasons for these skills shortages are too little investment in
          basic education, inadequate training programs, and the migration of skilled workers.


133.	 Lack of investment in basic education makes it harder for students to learn and accumulate skills,
          both soft and technical. Enrollment in basic education, cohort survival, and completion rates are
          generally lower in Mindanao than in Luzon or the Visayas (Table 7). Inadequate and skewed distribution
          of educational inputs (teachers, classrooms, teaching materials, and Internet connections) partly

100
      	   High attrition rates are also a problem. A study by IBPAP and TeamAsia (2014) estimates the attrition rate of IT-BPO firms at 15 percent.
          In addition, about 18 percent of employees leave the industry as a whole each year (IBPAP).

               explains this poor performance (Maligalig and Caoli-Rodriguez 2010). In 2015, Mindanao was short by
               80,000 teachers and 2,724 classrooms.105 In 2012, 80 percent of Mindanao public classrooms were not
               connected to the Internet and lacked computers.106


     134.	 Migration contributes to the skills mismatch. Most universities in Mindanao report that many of their
               students take courses like nursing, hotel and restaurant management, accounting, and maritime studies
               to prepare for jobs overseas. In fact, about 17 percent of their graduates find jobs outside Mindanao.
               Even vocational students leave Mindanao. All in all, about a third of Mindanawons find jobs in Luzon,
               the Visayas, or abroad, leaving Mindanao with a shallow pool of skilled workers.


     135.	 Joint public and private efforts are needed to increase the supply of high-skilled workers. The IT
               and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) and local ICT councils could work with
               government agencies like the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and
               institutions of higher learning to provide scholarships, well-targeted training, and apprenticeship
               programs to potential IT-BPO workers. Government funding of scholarships could be reallocated to
               professions in short supply: currently, only 28 percent of the funds from the Commission on Higher
               Education (CHED) Student Financial Assistance program is allocated to priority engineering, math, or
               science courses. The collaboration between industry and selected schools in Manila to enhance the IT

      curriculum, improve English proficiency and behavioral skills, and in some cases offer some full-time
      internships in participating companies, could be expanded to Mindanao. Universities in Cotabato,
      Marawi, and Zamboanga could also provide more Arabic and Spanish language courses to heighten
      the potential of these areas to cater to foreign markets.


The Inequitable Distribution of Education and Training
136.	 Unequal access to educational opportunities and training perpetuates income inequality and social
      isolation. The data on average attainment masks the highly unequal distribution of educational
      resources, given Mindanao’s mountainous terrain and the large number of Moro and indigenous
      people. For instance, educational outcomes are much worse in the ARMM. Moreover, training
      programs in Mindanao are generally targeted to more educated workers, leaving the less educated
      behind. Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in the Philippines is regarded as
      complementary to basic education and about 95 percent of trainees in Mindanao have completed at
      least secondary education. Very few programs cater to trainees with less than secondary education,
      and most are short-term training courses that lead to certificates of competency, which employers
      hardly recognize. There is also little training related to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, where most
      poor people work.


137.	 Better TVET programming would open up opportunities for less educated and rural workers. Based
      on an assessment of skills needed, training programs could be expanded for workers with only basic
      education. The regional offices of the DoLE, the Department of Education, and TVET could partner
      with local industry associations to determine which skills their industries need and how to design
      training programs to equip workers with those skills. Community-based training can be linked with
      the non-formal basic education programs the Department of Education offers to individuals who lack
      access to formal schooling. Here priority could be given to Moro and indigenous communities where
      functional illiteracy is higher. Training and other government programs could be better coordinated.
      For example, training could linked with livelihood assistance programs or with employment facilitation
      services to match trainees with prospective employers. There are already initiatives that offer workers
      full-cycle employment support, which can be expanded in Mindanao if they prove to assist vulnerable
      workers.107 Finally, investments in management and information systems would make it possible to
      evaluate the impact of programs on beneficiaries.


138.	 In the long term, significant investment in basic education is needed to help students learn better and
      accumulate both technical and soft skills. The K-to-12 program is intended to build the foundation.

     The Impact of High Minimum Wages
     139.	 Minimum wages in Mindanao range widely. After Luzon and the Visayas, Davao and Northern Mindanao
                have the highest nominal minimum wages in the Philippines; ARMM has the lowest (Figure 23).108 And
                while on average minimum wages and the median range in Mindanao are about the, the average
                minimum wage in Luzon is only 74 percent of the median range, and in the Visayas 88 percent (Figure 24).


     140.	 The minimum wage in Mindanao is higher than in other countries in the region (Figure 25). Firms
                complying with the minimum wage requirements are therefore likely to find it difficult to compete in
                labor-intensive manufactures and tradable services with firms elsewhere in the Philippines or abroad.


     141.	 Minimum wage requirements cover only about 10 percent of workers. Wage-earners account for
                only 46 percent of workers; and more than half of these are employed in informal firms that likely do
                not comply with labor regulations, and a fifth of workers in formal firms are hired informally, without
                written contracts, social security, health insurance, or protection from dismissal. Moreover, almost all
                businesses are exempted from the minimum wage law because they have fewer than 10 employees.109

       	
     108
                Across Mindanao’s six regions, there are 27 different minimum wage rates, depending on sectors and firm size. A detailed discussion of
                labor policies is available in the Philippine Development Report on Jobs (World Bank 2013).
       	
     109
                Regional tripartite wage boards can grant minimum wage exemptions in their regions. Exemptions are not automatic; eligible firms
                have to file for them. Eligible firms include retail/service firms employing less than 10 workers, new businesses, and distressed business.
                According to DoLE, the exempted firms are still required to pay their employees no less than the poverty threshold. However, this is not
                explicitly written in wage orders. In practice, even if they do not apply, they are rarely inspected.

     142.	 Minimum wage enforcement is limited, particularly in conflict-affected areas. That may be why firms
               do not report labor policies to be a major constraint to investment and job creation. Nevertheless,
               there may be some potential for increased coverage of labor regulations, given the growing use
               of the notorious 5-month rotating contract to avoid giving workers regular status. And as the
               formal sector expands over the medium term, minimum wage requirements are likely to become
               increasingly important.110


     143.	 It appears that Mindanao’s high minimum wages are associated with lower employment in
               manufacturing. Regression analysis using firm-level data from 1996 to 2008111 found that the elasticity
               of manufacturing employment to the minimum wage in real terms is negative and significant across
               several specifications, with large firms the most affected (see annex tables).112 This finding is similar to
               the one for the Philippines as a whole (see World Bank 2013).


     144.	 With some adjustments, the minimum wage regime could be more useful. Reducing the number
               of to at most two per region (agriculture and nonagriculture) would improve transparency, and
               gradually removing all exemptions would expand coverage. In the interim, the policy that exempted
               establishments are still subject to a minimum wage equal to the poverty threshold could be clarified
               and enforced. This could increase the coverage of the minimum wage policy among workers in smaller
               firms and make it more effective as an anti-poverty tool.


     7.2 Overcoming Burdensome Business Regulations
     145.	 Cities in Mindanao, as in the Philippines in general, tend to have worse Doing Business indicators than
               other East Asian cities. For instance, the two best performers in Mindanao, General Santos and Davao,
               ranked 124th and 125th among 151 economies (Quezon City was 128th) in starting a business (Singapore
               was 1st, Thailand 59th, and Malaysia 71st). The ranking of Philippine cities differs in the Subnational
               Doing Business Report (SDBR), where the latest data are for 2011, and in the National Competitive
               Council report, which has data for 2014.113 A number of reasons explain the high cost of starting and
               maintaining a business. First, many government agencies at both the national and the local levels are
               involved in starting a business, and several private sector providers (e.g., bookstore, banks, etc.) are
               also involved, but there is lack of coordination. Second, one-stop-shops and process automation are
               limited, especially in Mindanao where internet service is slow. Third, several steps, such as securing
               an import permit and getting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval, take several days
               because processing is done in Manila or in a regional center (e.g., SEC registration of Iligan firms is
               done in Cagayan de Oro, which is 90 km away). And fourth, most agencies have yet to shift from annual
               renewals of licenses to less frequent renewals, such as every three years for low-risk businesses.

       	
     110
               The ARMM rules governing labor markets are different but information on the labor rules is scarce: The ARMM has no obligation to report
               to the DoLE central office and national data do not usually include ARMM. Better coordination between DOLE-ARMM and DOLE central
               office could make more data available, and make it easier to evaluate labor market policies.
       	
     111
               This is the only available panel data at the firm level.
       	
     112
               Using the manufacturing data from the annual survey of Philippine business and industry, a small panel dataset of labor-intensive
               manufacturing firms is used to explore the effect of minimum wages on within-firm employment over time. The dataset is composed of
               385 firms, all with at least 20 workers, surveyed from 1996 to 2008 from all three island groups. Regional minimum wage data are from the
               National Wages and Productivity Commission for 1990 through 2010. Minimum wages are expressed in real terms, using the published
               PSA national and regional consumer price indices. See Annex I for a discussion of the methodology.

58    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
146.	 Mindanao cities perform slightly better than those in Luzon and the Visayas in some indicators of the
      ease of starting a business reported by the SDBR for 2011 (Figure 26), where General Santos and
      Davao topped 25 cities in having the least number of days and procedures for starting a business
      (Figure 27). Mindanao’s four cities also did well in ease of getting a construction permit: Davao ranked
      1st, General Santos 3rd, Zamboanga 4th, and CDO 7th, all much higher than Quezon City (ranked 22nd).
      However, Mindanao cities performed poorly in registering a property, with ranks between 20th and 25th,
      due to slow turnaround at BIR regional offices and the local Register of Deeds (in CDO the average
      time spent at the Register of Deeds was 60 days, the highest reported). This may reflect poor land
      management in Mindanao (see below). Since the 2011 report, many cities have reformed their
      business procedures. In Mindanao, CDO, Davao, Butuan, Mati, and Ozamis have simplified the
      steps needed to secure a mayor’s permit. Data from the National Competitiveness Council (NCC)
      indicate that in both 2011 and 2014 cities in Mindanao were roughly on a par with other Philippine
      cities in registering a business and obtaining permits (Figure 28).


Impediments to Licensing and a Difficult Tax Regime

      tedious and often requires informal payments.                             Philippines compares to neighbors, 2009
      Licenses must be renewed annually—more often
                                                                                    Lao PDR
      than in other countries (Figure 29). Up to 18
      licenses, permits, and forms have to be approved                           Philippines

      And several steps, such as securing an import permit and getting Securities and Exchange Commission

      SEC registration of Iligan firms is done in CDO, 90 km away).


148.	 Paying taxes is cumbersome in the Philippines, especially in Mindanao, given its poor Internet service
      and the limited capacity of firms to comply with national standards. In the 2016 global Doing Business
      report, the Philippines ranked 126th among 189 economies in paying taxes, among the worst in the
      ASEAN region. This is largely attributable to the country’s high total tax rate,114 equivalent to about
      42.9 percent of profit — the highest in the ASEAN 5115 — and to the number of payments per year —
      which at 36 is triple that in Malaysia, double that in Thailand, and five payments more than in Myanmar.

  	
114
      The total tax rate measures the amount of taxes and mandatory contributions borne by a business in the second year of operation,
      expressed as a share of commercial profit. The 2016 Doing Business report uses the total tax rate for calendar year 2014. The total is the
      sum of all the different taxes and contributions payable after allowable deductions and exemptions. The taxes withheld (such as personal
      income tax) or collected by the company and remitted to the tax authorities (such as VAT, sales tax, or goods and service tax) but not borne
      by the company are excluded (World Bank 2016a).

               The time required to comply with tax requirements116 in the Philippines was 193 hours a year, less than
               the 264 hours in Thailand and 234 in Indonesia, but far above the 118 hours in Malaysia. However,
               these figures do not adequately measure the full compliance costs for Filipino taxpayers, given alleged
               systemic corruption in the tax system. In Mindanao, business chambers say paying taxes is costlier for
               small firms because they have less capacity to maintain books and engage accountants. Thus, owners
               do the tasks themselves, incurring opportunity costs from filling up forms and standing in queues.


     Simplifying Procedures and Increasing Transparency
     149.	 Some progress has been made both nationally and locally to make it easier to start a business. At
               that national level, four landmark memoranda of agreement (MOAs) were signed by nine national
               government agencies and an LGU in April 2015,117 committing them to reduce the number of days
               needed to start a corporate business in Quezon City from 34 to 8 and the number of steps from 16 to
               6. As of initiative is now being rolled out to other cities. At the local level, several cities have begun
               to streamline their business registration process through the RS4LGU project of the Department of
               Interior and Local Government (DILG),118 in which cities methodically analyze and target steps for
               elimination in business registration. As part of the re-engineering process, some steps were deferred
               to post-licensing. Since 2010, 37 Philippine cities (10 in Mindanao119) have passed executive orders
               (EOs) to simplify business licensing. These cities reduced registration steps from an average of 45 to
               3 and days from an average of 30 to 1. More successes are expected to follow as DILG rolls out the
               program to other local governments.


     150.	 Davao and Cagayan de Oro are undertaking further reforms. Davao and CDO have introduced a
               one-step assessment of all business permit fees at the City Treasurer’s office, instead of requiring
               visits to different agencies, and Bureau of Fire Protection officials are now stationed at Davao city
               hall to facilitate fire-safety evaluation clearances. As a result of its reforms, Davao has cut seven
               procedures, speeding up the start-up process by an average of 16 days. Moreover, barangay clearance
               and a certified true copy of a land title are no longer required when registering property.120 CDO has
               completely computerized its business registration process using touchscreen terminals. It is now third
               fastest city in the country for registering a business,121 and the fastest in Mindanao, at under an hour.


     151.	 While such reforms significantly reduce the time and costs involved in starting a business, there are
               many more opportunities for simplifying procedures, for instance, (1) harmonizing and streamlining
               remaining procedures of national agencies and LGUs to avoid overlaps and redundancies (e.g.,
               merging city and barangay business permits into one permit); (2) removing steps that can be verified
               by government offices at the back end (the recent policy directive that a SSS clearance is no longer

     116
           	   The hours-per-year indicator “measures the time taken to prepare, file, and pay three major types of taxes and contributions: the
               corporate income tax, value-added or sales tax, and labor taxes, including payroll taxes and social contributions” (World Bank 2016a).

     118
               In the Philippines, cities, municipalities, and barangays (villages) play a big role in the business registration process. In fact, about one-
               third of the registration steps are the domain of the LGU.

               Furthermore, the National Building Code is being revised to resolve apparent overlaps and contradictions and to address disaster risk
               reduction and climate change adaptation in building design/construction/maintenance/use/occupancy.

       required when renewing business permits is a good example122); (3) reducing requirements whose
       purposes are not fully justified;123 (4) fully implementing the PBR at the national level and the RS4LGU
       program for LGUs, training personnel on applying the rules effectively, and linking LGU access to the
       Performance Challenge Fund to compliance with RS4LGU monitoring indicators; and (5) reducing the
       frequency of renewals of government licenses, permits, and clearances for employment purposes,
       for example, from annually to once every three years, with compliance based on risk-based auditing
       principles rather than an extensive review of every applicant. Implementing some ideas may require a
       comprehensive review of all national and local laws and regulations.


152.	 Increasing the transparency of business regulations could reduce transaction costs. Mandating the
       prominent display of easy-to-understand process flowcharts and service standards in all government
       offices would reduce the time required to comprehend requirements. This would be based on a
       step-by-step guide, with a list of required documents and which offices to visit when and with what
       documents, and listing the address, working hours, and contact number for each office. A first step
       in this direction was the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007,124 which brought about the Citizen’s Charter
       flowcharts now displayed in government offices. These could be improved for more completeness,
       accuracy, and accessibility.


153.	 The ultimate goal should be an efficient online or mobile registration system, with provision for
       online or mobile payments that minimizes the need for interacting with officials. This approach would
       not only save the time of both officials and businesses but also minimize opportunities for under-the-
       table transactions. In Mindanao, this reform needs to be complemented by improvements in Internet
       connections (see above).


7.3 Better Access to Finance
The Financial Services Deficit
154.	 Mindanao contributes 15 percent of national GDP but receives only 3 percent of total credit granted
       in the country. In the Philippines 87 percent of credit granted by banks is concentrated in the national
       capital region. Mindanao’s low share of credit compared to its GDP contribution is similar to the
       statistics in the Visayas and Luzon (Figure 30). Bank credit tends to be concentrated in metropolitan
       areas, which are also centers of economic activity. This pattern is repeated in Mindanao where, credit
       extended in Davao represents 27 percent of the regional total, and credit in Davao, CDO, and General
       Santos add up to 52 percent of the total. However, the statistics on the credit reported by banks may
       not fully reflect its geographical destination because many banks process loans, especially for large
       commercial borrowers, in their regional or main offices.

       This includes (1) reducing or abolishing the paid-in minimum capital requirement; (2) making the use of notaries and lawyers optional for
       startups; (3) moving toward a fixed registration fee that covers only administrative costs; and (4) removing antiquated mandatory practices
       of having the BIR stamp the company’s invoice and account books.

                    microfinance organizations and cooperatives: 43 percent report having used a bank, including ATMs
                    the figure is 57 percent in Luzon, but 35 percent in the Visayas (Figure 31). In Mindanao, 36 percent of
                    residents use microfinance organizations and 21 percent use cooperatives.125 But 34 percent residents
                    report using informal credit, and 28 percent have savings, which suggests possible demand for financial
                    services (Figure 32).

                    an account in a formal financial institution, which is higher level than in in most Luzon regions outside
                    of NCR. At the same time ARMM and Caraga have the least access to formal financial services in the

62    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
157.	 Trends in financial access are largely determined by the type of economic activity, particularly
      agriculture in Mindanao economy, and conflict. The main urban centers in Mindanao—Davao, General
      Santos, and CDO—have in recent years shown substantial growth, especially in credit, as economic
      prospects have improved. Yet, even though agriculture contributes 27 percent to regional GDP
      compared to 15 percent in the Visayas and non-NCR Luzon, the agricultural sector throughout the
      Philippines struggles to attract bank finance. Agricultural lending represents only 3 percent of the total
      national lending portfolio, although agriculture accounts for 11 percent of GDP and employs about
      33 percent of the population. Despite mandatory lending targets and a range of initiatives for private
      financial institutions to expand it, the agricultural credit portfolio has instead declined marginally over
      the past five years even as total bank credit has gone up on average by 25 percent a year in nominal
      terms. Since a substantial portion of financing needs in Mindanao is agricultural, Mindanao as a region
      is having real difficulty in mobilizing financing from the private sector. In areas of conflict, too, security
      risks and instability deter investors and financiers.


Specific Constraints on Financing in Agricultural and Conflict Areas
158.	 Agricultural businesses throughout the country have similar financing problems, but in Mindanao
      instability caused by conflict is an additional deterrent. All farmers the high risk involved in providing
      finance to smallholder agriculture, especially when land rights are not secure. While changes in national
      policies (see chapter 4), could increase lending to the agriculture sector nationally, several specific
      policies could help increase lending in the conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.


159.	 Financial inclusion and better access to financial services is one element of the broader development
      effort envisaged to lift economic performance in the ARMM. The National Strategy for Financial
      Inclusion (NSFI) adopted in 2015 creates a framework for efforts to boost financial inclusion throughout
      the Philippines. A range of policy and regulatory actions, financial education, and consumer protection
      programs and advocacy initiatives can improve prospects for financial inclusion in ARMM, but
      considering its specific challenges, there is also a need for interventions tailored to the region.


160.	 One possible approach is to integrate financially inclusive dimensions in support programs delivered
      in ARMM by the government and development partners. For example, the main financing mechanism
      in most programs is grants to beneficiaries. Although this is often appropriate, often there is also
      scope to experiment with alternative arrangements such as repayable grants, matching grants, and
      credit finance arrangements, for example in programs supporting enterprise development. A large
      proportion of the ARMM population must rely on more expensive informal credit than alternatives in
      the formal sector because formal providers are reluctant to lend to them. As the region recovers from
      conflict, there is a need to consider integrating market-based mechanisms to support development
      of local financial intermediaries and to facilitate a mind-shift among local residents and businesses
      toward financial sustainability and viability. There is potential for the use of mobile financial services
      and other innovations to better serve ARMM residents. Design of interventions might also take into
      account the fact that gender analysis indicates that men are less likely to use financial services, as is the
      national trend in the Philippines, but it is likely that conflict is an exacerbating factor in the ARMM.




                                                                               A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   63
     161.	 Introducing of financial services must be accompanied by a significant campaign to improve financial
            education and awareness. There is growing empirical evidence that financial education and literacy
            programs are more effective when delivered at “teachable moments” in the use of financial services.
            There may be opportunities to introduce financial education as part of community development and
            cooperative support programs or conditional cash transfers linked to the use of funds, so that gradually
            people learn to rely on a range of financial instruments. The Cooperative Development Authority in
            ARMM already coordinates and support cooperatives in ARMM and could well take on this role.


     162.	 Islamic finance and pilot programs to introduce Shari’ah finance are important elements of a
            financial inclusion effort in ARMM. The National Commission for Muslim Filipinos, the central bank
            (BSP: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas), Amanah Bank, and the Development Bank of the Philippines have
            worked with stakeholders and the legislature on a bill amending the legal framework for Amanah Bank
            to establish a legal basis for Islamic banking in the Philippines (World Bank 2015a). In parallel piloting
            approaches for Shari’ah-compliant microfinance is also recommended. Pilot projects would define
            product characteristics suitable for the Philippines context and help validate the feasibility of applying
            various models (World Bank 2016b). Moreover, piloting Shari’ah-compliant microfinance in parallel
            with capacity building and financial education would help prepare the ground for eventual integration
            of market-based and social models of Islamic microfinance.


     7.4 Improving Land Management Policy in Urban Areas                                              126



     163.	 Inadequate land use planning and zoning is impairing the quality of life in Mindanao’s fast-growing
            cities: City centers are becoming congested and polluted, and informal settlement enclaves are
            multiplying. Public administration is finding it hard to cope with the growing demand for services, and
            infrastructure investments and regulation of land use for housing, commerce, and industry is becoming
            more challenging to coordinate. While several Mindanao cities are beginning to proactively update
            their comprehensive land use plans, recent fast growth will require more regular updates—the Local
            Government Code mandates every five years.


     164.	 About half of urban parcels lack titles, because titling is slow and there is no complete cadastral
            map. For a long time, titling was done mainly through the Miscellaneous Sales Patent, where the long-
            term occupant had to pay the value of the property based on the assessed value. This can be very
            expensive and cumbersome, particularly for those who have occupied the land for a long time. In 2010,
            the Residential Free Patent Act was passed, authorizing streamlined titling of residential lands. The
            DENR has over a hundred partnership programs with various LGUs to accelerate titling through the
            residential free patent option, but because they are not being done systematically, progress is slow.


     165.	 The registry of land transactions does not reflect reality. Local registrars and assessors consulted
            estimated that 10 to 20 percent of transactions are not registered—mainly because of the high costs
            (formal and informal) of transferring127 and registering a property. In 2011, the time and cost involved
            in registering a property in Mindanao’s cities were the highest in the Philippines (Figure 34). Moreover,

            This section draws largely from Eleazar and Hilhorst (2016).
       	
     127
            The cost is driven a number of taxes and fees: capital gains, transfer, and documentary stamp taxes, and registration and survey fees.
            Often, the magnitude of back taxes deters people from registering.

             Project has ironically made accessing land records very expensive even by government offices fulfilling

             Davao City. Many LGU records do not contain current property information, such as an inventory of idle
             land, because tax mapping is not done regularly; LGUs do not have access to the Registry of Deeds
             (RoD), making tax mapping difficult. Furthermore, as of March 2016, only 9 of 33 cities had updated
             their schedule of market values (SMVs).129 Obsolete valuations are associated with lower real property
             tax collection (Figure 35), which is further depressed by the granting of tax exemptions, which in some
             cases is beyond the LGU’s authority. On average from 2011 to 2014 cities in Mindanao collected only
             0.2 percent of their GDP in real property taxes and hardly any on idle land tax (Figure 36); 76 percent
             of total revenues come from internal revenue allotments.


167.	 There are a number of ways to improve land use planning, e.g., (1) preparation of a physical plan
             for urban Mindanao; (2) ensuring timely updates of comprehensive land use plans; (i) more proactive
             development of zoning plans for all types of land after assessment of land tenure (agricultural, industrial,
             urban, conservation, etc.); (4) generation of a comprehensive database of land parcels describing
             categories, land use, and property boundaries, supported by a unified LGU land information system;
             and (5) over the medium term, enactment of a national land use code to guide local planning.


  	
128
             This refers to actual as a percentage of potential collection. The real collection efficiency rate is likely lower because LGUs determine
             potential tax collection rather than an independent third party. Moreover, in most LGUs, the statement of collectibles and collections are
             not accurate because parcel records and tax maps, the bases of assessments and collections, are not accurate and complete.

     168.	 There are also a number of ways to Improve titling and registration, e.g., (1) preparation of land tenure
                                                  improvement plans as the basis for titling and other forms of tenure security; (2) rapid application of
                                                  the residential free patent law; (3) further streamlining the RoD registration process by reducing fees,
                                                  eliminating requirements with no clear rationale or that can be verified at the backend; (4) amending
                                                  the contract between the government and the land computerization contractor to enable government
                                                  offices to access registry information for free and the public at low cost; and (5) enforcing LGC Section
                                                  209, which mandates that RoDs provide local governments with annual abstracts of their registries.


     169.	 Property tax revenues could be increased by creating a National Valuation Authority to centralize
                                                  decisions about property valuation standards, which would increase transparency, ensure that
                                                  properties better reflect market prices, and depoliticize the valuation process. Determining market
                                                  values based on the valuation standards and actual collection of the property tax could remain with the
                                                  local administration.

Economic Policies to Reduce Conflict

170.	 Though the long-standing armed conflicts affecting parts of Mindanao can only be resolved by a
      political solution, economic policies can help reduce conflict. Dealing with historical injustices and
      recognizing cultural minorities is essential for peace and reconciliation. The government’s peace and
      development roadmap sets out ways to overcome drivers of conflict. This section offers out a series of
      recommendations to tackle these drivers as a complement to a political solution.


Five Decades of Violence
171.	 Violent conflict in Mindanao is complex and affects large areas. The state is engaged in peace processes
      with two groups: Moros fighting for self-determination, and communists fighting for ideology and
      against poverty and inequality.130 Violence can occur between political dynasties, communities (Moros
      versus indigenous peoples, Christians, or other Moros), and clans, and with criminal, terrorist, kidnap-
      for-ransom, and other armed groups. Of Mindanao’s six regions, conflict is most prevalent in the
      ARMM, the Zamboanga Peninsula Region, and the Caraga Region (see Figure 37). Almost 60 percent
      of Mindanao’s 455 cities and municipalities and 13.6 million people (62 percent of the population)
      are directly affected by conflict.131 In conflict areas, farmers often produce at subsistence levels and
      businesses remain small to escape notice.132 About 63 percent of the people in areas affected by conflict
      live below the poverty line,133 and of the Mindanao regions, ARMM has the highest poverty incidence.
      The provinces that became part of the ARMM decades ago were the richest region of Mindanao and
      are now the poorest.134

  	
130
      Some groups, however, are now little more than extortionists fronting as a communist insurgency.
  	
131
      Sources include the Bangsamoro Conflict Monitoring System (BCMS), supplemented by field consultations and research),
  	
132
      Fear of kidnapping or extortion keeps businesses small and capital mobile. Most produce is sent to processing centers outside ARMM in
      places like Davao, Cebu, and Zamboanga. In 2015, there were only 13 large companies registered in mainland ARMM; they were engaged
      in agricultural planting and processing, or biomass energy production (data provided by the ARMM Regional Board of Investments; a
      large establishment is defined as one that employs at least 200 persons).
  	
133
      World Bank staff estimates based on the BCMS, census of population and housing, and small area estimates of poverty.
  	
134
      Growth in Caraga and Davao Region has been higher than in the ARMM due to less intense conflict, a more predictable conflict
      environment, and a mining boom.



                                                                                               A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   67
     172.	 Land disputes result in conflict.135 Two factors explain the prominence of land dispute among Moros
            and indigenous people: (1) The legacy of resettlement and land programs from 1900s to the 1980s,136
            and (2) magnified effects of overlapping land law frameworks. The former largely affects the Moro
            people, the latter the indigenous people. Dispossession of the original inhabitants of Mindanao came
            in four waves: (1) from the end of Spanish rule in 1898 to the end of the Philippine Commonwealth
            in 1946; (2) the early years of the third republic, from 1946 to the late 1960s, (3) the martial law years
            from the 1970s to the mid-1980s; and (4) the comprehensive agrarian years, from the late 1980s to the
            present. Each was characterized by a policy instrument driven by the political and economic agenda of
            the central government at the time. The magnified effects of overlapping land legal frameworks grew
            from Mindanao’s unique socio-geology that creates multiple rights over the same plot. The Philippines
            has eight separate land laws with significant overlaps and no clear rules of precedence that are the
            responsibility of five offices in four agencies, often without coordination.137 The situation is exacerbated
            by unique socio-geological features that disproportionately impact indigenous people.


     173.	 The complicated and overlapping land laws have resulted in competing but legitimate claims of
            various groups on the same pieces of land. In Caraga, large agribusiness and mining firms with
            legal instruments that justify their land claims have displaced indigenous people and small farmers
            who cannot defend their land rights because of poverty and little knowledge of legal procedures.
            Consequently, indigenous people in Caraga have become recruitment targets of the NPA, which has
            successfully exploited their grievance over unjust dispossession of their lands by the powerful local elite
            and large corporations (see also Quitoriano 2016). Unless the land ownership uncertainty is resolved,
            violent conflict will continue.


     174.	 These problems have resulted in massive land dispossession and violent conflict, especially in mainland
            ARMM and in the neighboring provinces of North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and Lanao del Norte.
            Over time, land conflict has involved many parties: between Muslims and Christians, among Muslims,
            between title holders and traditional right holders, between firms and indigenous peoples, between
            LGUs, between clans or communities, and between private parties.


     175.	 Land dispossession and conflict are aggravated by policies and developments that have disregarded
            traditional institutions based on communal ownership of land. Among them are (1) poor land
            administration and management that results in the grant of conflicting and multiple rights over the
            same plots (all with legal anchors though not necessarily seen as fair); (2) cadastral surveys that cause
            conflict because of formal approaches were used to dispossess holders of land; (3) land dispute systems
            favoring “confrontational” judicial mechanisms that ignore customary approaches such as mediation by
            leaders; (4) excessive accumulation of land by the new political elite and commercial interests in mining

            Unlike the Spanish and American colonization of the Philippines, “colonization” of Mindanao by Manila was fairly recent, and there are
            people still alive who speak of how their land was grabbed.

            These are the Public Land Act of 1936 (Commonwealth Act 141), Forestry Code of 1975 (Presidential Decree 705), Comprehensive Agrarian
            Reform Law of 1988 (Republic Act 6657), People’s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 (RA 7076), Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160),
            National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992 (RA 7586), Mining Act of 1995 (RA 7942), and Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act of
            1997 (RA 8371). They are implemented by the Land Management Bureau and Forest Management Bureau in the DENR, Land Registration
            Authority in the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), and the National Commission on Indigenous
            Peoples (NCIP).

        and logging; and (5) displacement of people due to violent conflict and environmental factors. Clearly,
        conventional solutions to land problems must be complemented, or even trumped, by solutions that
        address the core reason for grievances and are sympathetic to local customs.


176.	 Mass displacements have exacerbated the welfare impact of conflict. In August 2014 there were
        almost a million internally displaced persons in Mindanao, according to the United Nations High
        Commissioner for Refugees. Some 41 percent of the population in mainland ARMM and adjacent
        provinces have been displaced at least once, with many suffering far more often. Millions have
        migrated from Basulta and central Mindanao to safer areas in the Philippines and neighboring Sabah.
        The Malaysian Government estimates that in 2015 there were 470,000 Filipinos in Sabah (unofficial
        sources put the number at about a million, of whom 25 percent are considered “stateless” —, they do
        not have birth certificates or passports to prove their nationality – which reduces their access to jobs
        and services and increases their vulnerability to exploitation.


177.	 Violent conflict has had a major impact on growth and poverty levels throughout Mindanao.
        Concerns over security have depressed tourism and boosted the emigration of skilled workers. The
        reputational damage caused by insecurity even reduces investment in areas relatively unaffected by
        violence. These areas also bear the fiscal burden of coping with displaced persons. On the other hand,
        more peaceful areas have benefited from opportunities to process agricultural produce from conflict-
        affected areas, where processing facilities are rare. And many skilled workers from conflict-affected
        areas have migrated to other regions of Mindanao.

     178.	 Economic policy can support the resolution of conflicts. The issues at the root of the conflict, in
            particular a deep sense of injustice that is a consequence of greatly unequal political and economic
            power, and longstanding grievances over land dispossession can only be resolved by a political
            settlement. It is clear, however, that poverty and economic hopelessness in conflict-affected areas
            help perpetuate conflict, as individuals without land or work opportunities are driven to join armed
            groups to survive or to seek social status. Discontent arising from social injustice and discrimination in
            the distribution of economic opportunity and development resources can also fuel violence. Thus, this
            report focuses on two major supports for peace: providing alternative income sources and improving
            the delivery of basic services, particularly in areas that have been neglected. Although such policies
            cannot on their own resolve conflicts, they can facilitate peace by creating economic opportunities and
            demonstrating that the government can be effective role in improving welfare.

     179.	 Jobs address a basic cause of conflict, the lack of employment opportunities that drives many,
            particularly out-of-school youths, to desperation.138 Youth inactivity is prevalent in conflict-affected
            areas, and particularly in Basulta, where 24 percent of working-age youth (national average is 16
            percent) are idle. Having a good job also give a person a greater stake in the preservation of society.
            Job creation initiatives need to be managed carefully to avoid favoring one group over another, which
            could exacerbate tension rather than promote stability.


     180.	 Targeted community cash-for-work programs can support stabilization.139 The target groups should
            initially be people vulnerable to taking up arms, such as ex-combatants, out-of-school youth, and
            internally displaced people. After being piloted, programs could be expanded to other poor people
            to avoid the perception that they are rewarding participation in violence. Given the importance of
            social inclusion in forestalling violence, job creation schemes could give priority to programs that
            promote solidarity, such as group employment in public works and group borrowing for livelihood.140
            Programs that link former combatants with noncombatants can also usefully expand social networks
            and help social integration. The projects need to be labor-intensive, for example planting mangroves
            or building or rehabilitating village roads, irrigation facilities, and community water systems, community
            facilities such as barangay health centers and daycare centers, and dikes.


     181.	 Globally, of all jobs programs entrepreneurship promotion programs like cash grants have proved to
            have the most positive effects.141 Such programs, such as the USAID’s Mindanao Youth for Development
            project have been implemented throughout the Philippines. The government’s Comprehensive Local
            Integration Program provided training, living expenses, and cash grants for investment to 98 former

       	
     138
            The common response (40 percent) to a survey on what drives young people to join rebel groups was unemployment/idleness (World
            Bank 2011). A survey of government militia by the Institute of Bangsamoro Studies/Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (2011) also showed
            that poverty and lack of employment options were the most common reasons for joining (33 percent). For ideological militant movements,
            however, the WDR (World Bank 2011) suggests that belief in the cause or a sense of injustice drove most people to join (46 percent) rather
            than unemployment or idleness (about 20 percent).
       	
     139
            Cash-for-work programs in the Philippines have been limited to emergency work given by the Department of Social Welfare and
            Development (DSWD) and the DOLE, and the Sajahatra Bangsamoro Program, which under DSWD provided cash-for-work for 11,000
            beneficiaries identified by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). The Department of Public Works and Highways mainly uses workers
            from outside the locality. There are also some direct donor-supported programs like the World Food Programme.

70    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
      New People’s Army (NPA) members who surrendered their arms); 145 Moro Islamic Liberation Front
      (MILF) combatants who were part of the ceremonial decommissioning in June 2015 also received a
      cash grant. A multifaceted small-grants program could be targeted initially to ex-combatants and
      idle youth and later expanded to other poor or at-risk people. The program could be designed to
      (1) provide cash grants to young people (at least two in each group) who submit a business plan; (2)
      assist preparation of business plans and offer sustained support or mentoring for one year; (3) be used
      for whatever the recipients deem most important for the success of their enterprise; and (5) allow
      sufficiently large groups to invest in equipment in rural areas. To improve its scope and market access,
      the program could be conduct in partnership with civic organizations in Mindanao that have the
      necessary experience and skills. The program could be managed like the 1995 Youth Entrepreneurship
      Program, which was created through the National Youth Commission (Executive Order 485). The
      Mindanao State University system, with campuses in ARMM, could provide support and training.


182.	 Cash-grant pilot programs need rigorous monitoring and evaluation before expansion. That might
      include (1) regular follow-up and tracking of beneficiaries; (2) having grant recipients report to local
      community organizations, such as the Out-of-School Youth Development Alliance; (3) devising a
      randomized control experiment to improve evaluation, and (4) releasing money conditional on
      performance—recipients might receive 75 percent of the grant up-front, and 25 percent after one year
      if they can present evidence of investment (not necessarily success).


183.	 Training should be part of jobs programs. While the Philippines has numerous training programs,142
      relatively few are in conflict-affected areas and they are not always relevant to labor market needs.
      In ARMM, for instance, there is no training on agriculture for the self-employed, even though the
      demand is high. Neither is there any training offered in life skills, which employers in ARMM prioritize
      over technical skills. To ensure maximum return, training programs in conflict-affected areas need to
      be socially appropriate, accessible, and relevant to the market.143 The government, primarily through
      TESDA, could partner with the private sector at the outset to develop curricula relevant to the market.
      If the private sector cannot afford to hire trainees, the government could subsidize on-the-job training
      or apprenticeship programs. For workers whose goal is self-employment, training programs could
      be offered on agriculture, financial management, and business development. After such a course is
      completed, targeted cash grants could help with business startup or the purchase of equipment that
      training graduates need, such as tools or sewing machines.

184.	 Job promotion and entrepreneurship programs can enhance efforts to preserve Mindanao’s rich
      diversity in cultures, ethnicities, and religions. Intangible cultural assets such as music and dance and
      tangible skills such as traditional boat-making, making traditional musical instruments, wood carving,
      jewelry making, and traditional weaving, can find markets both in Manila and internationally with the right
      type of support, such as training in business development and marketing. Expanding public appreciation
      of the cultural heritage of Mindanao, for example through media, education, and promotion by LGUs,
      could support such activities. Preservation and promotion of cultural heritage can also build mutual
      understanding and appreciation between Christians, Muslims, and indigenous peoples.

  	
142
      These include the umbrella TVET programs and several other training programs not registered with TESDA, such as DSWD’s Sustainable
      Livelihood Program and the DOLE JobStart Program.

     185.	 Agricultural joint venture agreements, such as contract growing schemes, can be a good vehicle for
            heightening agricultural productivity in the region and the incomes of the poor. Because they have
            been fallow for decades, many production areas in conflict-affected provinces have high potential.
            The government could help organize partnerships between smallholders and agribusinesses that
            can provide capital, technology, and market access to increase farm productivity and market reach.
            Contract add-ons can help smallholders build capacity and gradually take over farm management.
            An example of an add-on is giving farmer cooperatives the contract for hauling and trucking services,
            security services, and even operations of a firm’s cafeteria.


     Public Services and Sustainable Peace
     186.	 Local governance in conflict-affected areas is often, although not uniformly, poor. Of the 123 LGUs
            in ARMM, only 37 (30 percent) passed the Department of Interior and Local Government’s (DILG)
            2014 Good Financial Housekeeping core assessment area (the national average is 91 percent) and
            none received the 2015 Seal of Good Local Governance (national average is 15 percent) award.144
            Fiscal resources are limited; many conflict-affected areas must rely on the national government for
            99 percent of revenues. There is also probably spending inefficiently—(the number of qualified audit
            reports tends to be high in conflict-affected areas. Only 4 percent of city and municipal treasurers in
            conflict-affected areas passed the national exams for treasurers (the national average of 16 percent),
            suggesting that these important positions are being politicized for personal gain.


     187.	 A leading cause of poor governance is lack of political contestation. Entrenched political dynasties
            in some areas monopolize both economic resources and political power (for more discussion, see
            BrandLab 2011). While this is a problem throughout the Philippines, it is worse acute in conflict-affected
            areas, particularly ARMM, which is still highly feudal. Dynastic control of politics can deter investment
            and slow the pace of economic growth, and hence job creation. There is a strong correlation between
            low political contestability and poor socioeconomic welfare in Mindanao’s conflict-affected areas
            (Querubin and Robinson 2014). But political competition is often associated with more violence,
            particularly during elections. Voters then face a difficult choice, because powerful clans provide security
            to their supporters.


     188.	 Another concern for local governance is that in conflict-affected Mindanao economic activity is often
            either informal or illicit. Activities range from transactions in the informal land market, illegal logging
            and mining, and smuggling of goods up to drug trafficking and gun-running. Many local officials have
            little motivation to grow the formal economy because they profit heavily from the shadow economy.
            Perpetuating conflict is a useful smokescreen for avoiding central government scrutiny and giving
            space to powerful clans to run LGUs as personal fiefdoms. Vote-buying, which is common, aggravates
            the governance problem. A World Bank study found a robust negative correlation between vote
            buying and the delivery of primary health services in the Philippines (see Khemani 2013). Nevertheless,
            there are many examples of high-performing LGUs, including the current ARMM regional government,
            where progressive leadership has helped to improve the economy and delivery of services.

       	
     144
            To receive the Seal of Good Governance award, a local government must pass all three core assessment areas: 1) good financial
            housekeeping, 2) disaster preparedness, 3) social protection. For more information, see http://www.dilg.gov.ph/reports-and-resources/

72    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
189.	 There are a number of ways to give LGUs better incentives to fulfill their mandates. These range
      from expanding performance-based and matching-grant programs key government services that link
      financing to results to enhancing the use of open data. For example, all ARMM regional agencies
      have begun to upload their budgets and project information on the Internet. ARMM DPWH took a
      step further by uploading a comprehensive map of all roads in ARMM to the DPWH e-ARMM portal
      (dpwh-e.armm.gov.ph). Once data are public, ARMM could partner with universities, civil society
      organizations and the private sector to analyze the data and work together to narrow service delivery
      gaps. This will help to turn transparency into accountability through constructive external scrutiny.

190.	 Decades of conflict have led to severe underinvestment in infrastructure. Until six years ago,
      government investment in roads, bridges, education, health, and other facilities has been minimal.
      Mainland ARMM, and Basulta even more, suffers severely from the lack of irrigation, village roads, and
      a network of primary and secondary roads to bring farm produce to cities. Roads also bring government
      services and economic opportunities to remote communities; road projects could prioritize village
      roads and inter-barangay roads that connect the interior and border zones of municipalities to rural
      centers and cities. Among Mindanao regions, at 30 percent ARMM has the lowest share of irrigated
      land. Serious gaps in roads connecting mining and logging sites to urban centers limit the potential
      of businesses in Caraga to engage in processing. Ports and shipping services are also expensive and
      inefficient. For instance, there is only one weekly trip between Jolo, Sulu, and Zamboanga, and that
      cargo is charged quadruple the rate on other inter-island routes. The combination of long distances
      and poor logistics means that conflict-affected areas like Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-tawi are isolated from
      the mainland, leading to high shipping prices; tariffs are reportedly four times higher than for similar
      distances in Luzon and the Visayas.145

191.	 Educational enrollment, completion, and attainment rates are low in many conflict-affected areas.
      In the ARMM, in the 2011-12 school year only 23 percent of students who had been enrolled in grade
      1 made it to grade 6; the national average was 74 percent. About 45 percent of secondary students
      made it to the fourth year; the national average was 79 percent. The average achievement test score
      for sixth grade students was 54 percent and for fourth-year high school students 37 percent; the
      national averages were 67 and 49 percent. In 2013 among ARMM people aged 10 and over in 2013
      literacy was estimated at 86 percent (national average: 97 percent),146 and functional literacy (critical
      for business employment) is also low. The lack of educational attainment reflects repeated cycles of
      armed violence that have damaged many education and health facilities; low levels of spending and
      poor governance in the delivery of services; and difficulties in finding qualified teachers, particularly
      for remote and insecure locations. Some Muslim and indigenous parents also feel that the national
      curriculum is irrelevant to their culture; the government is now introducing programs to address their
      concerns. Displacement, poverty, and prolonged insecurity have also reduced demand for schooling.
      Teachers in parts of the island provinces, for instance, only teach two days a week due to security
      concerns and remoteness. Based on data from the World Bank ARMM Education Public Expenditure
      Review (World Bank 2015c), school closures are prevalent and absence rates are high for both teachers
      (31 percent) and students (29 percent).


  	
145
      The creation of a free trade zone and improved border services in Basulta would boost trade with Sabah, providing a market for Basulta’s
      agricultural products and enabling residents to access basic commodities at about half of Mindanao prices. However, the Philippines has
      long refused to recognize the legitimacy of Malaysia’s possession of Sabah.

     192.	 Besides devoting greater resources to education, reforms could strengthen management (DFAT
                     Australia and World Bank 2015. Efforts to improve the integrity of payroll systems in the ARMM could
                     include continuing to integrate and cross-reference payroll and the human resources information system
                     (HRIS), building internal structures and procedures for human resource management, streamlining
                     merit-based recruitment through appointment boards, and communicating these achievements to
                     both ARMM citizens and the national government. A priority would be introducing incentives to
                     improve teacher attendance, such as using the HRIS to check attendance during payroll processing.
                     First steps are being taken to decentralizing control over education funds to the region; ultimately,
                     all education funding should be channeled through the ARMM government budget appropriation.
                     Decentralization could be encouraged by adoption of results-based regional performance budgeting
                     that is acceptable to the national government. Efforts could be made to increase the role of civil
                     society and communities in education planning and implementation by improving transparency (e.g.
                     publishing budgets), strengthening control points (such as local school boards), improving feedback
                     mechanisms, periodic surveys, and a publicized open data platform.


     193.	 Health outcomes in the ARMM are also worrying. Maternal mortality is 67.4 per 100,000 live births,
                     compared to the national average of 64.8. Only 3 in 10 1-year-olds are immunized, compared to the
                     national average of 7 (Figure 38). Malnutrition is prevalent, and micronutrient supplementation is rare.
                     Less than half of ARMM households have access to health care, and those that do have to deal with
                     poorly staffed health centers. In general, 95 percent of pregnant Filipino women access antenatal care,
                     but only 53 percent of ARMM women do (Figure 39). In 2012, only 37 percent of ARMM households
                     had access to safe water and 23 percent access to a sanitary toilet; the national averages were 80
                     and 87 percent. As a result, diarrheal diseases are prevalent. Due to malnutrition, poor household
                     environment and access to preventive health services, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and
                     other respiratory infections also remain a problem.

     194.	 Much can be done to improve basic health in ARMM. The 2013 National Demographic and Health
                     Survey (NDHS) in 2013 found that PhilHealth coverage in ARMM is only 44 percent, with self-paying
                     members at 18 percent and coverage of the indigent at 16 percent. Coverage could be increased by


74    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
      ensuring that poor households are aware of their membership, benefits, and entitlements, and where
      services can be found, and adoption of no-balance billing for indigents in government hospitals. The
      Department of Health regional allocation for health facility enhancement is less than 40 percent of what
      is necessary to cover all 120 rural health units. Other critical needs include more staff and availability of
      essential medicines, greater focus on maternal and infant health care (about 39 percent of children 5
      or under are stunted, the second highest of all regions) and ensuring enforcement of the Responsible
      Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law.


195.	 Effective delivery of health and education services in conflict-affected areas will require innovative
      approaches. Traditional birth attendants can be equipped with competencies to provide proper
      antenatal, natal, and postnatal health care. Tele-medicine could link health facilities in isolated and
      disadvantaged areas to specialists outside the region. One-stop-shop medical-surgical missions could
      be provided regularly. To give indigenous children in remote barangays access to basic education,
      “hybrid schools” (buildings used as both schools and evacuation centers to avoid natural disaster
      or conflict) can be built in border zones. Finally, addressing the chronic absence of teachers, health
      workers and agricultural extension specialists in remote or conflict-affected areas may require incentive
      payments to encourage attendance, with third-party verification linked to the payroll.


196.	 The private sector and NGOs may provide some services, particularly where the local government
      is not functioning effectively or lacks capacity to meet demand. NGOs that specialize in providing
      certain services, for example infant immunization, provision of potable water and sanitary toilets, and
      mass feeding programs for children, could complement public programs. NGOs could also provide
      education, especially for women and vulnerable groups. An example in ARMM is the Magbassa Kita
      Foundation, Inc. (MKFI),147 which could be expanded to provide a literacy program for Moro women.
      Where necessary, the delivery of core services (health, education, water supply, agricultural extension)
      could be outsourced to NGOs or the private sector through performance-based contracts.148


Addressing Land Conflict
197.	 The forms of land conflict vary so much that they call for a variety of formal and informal land dispute
      settlement mechanisms. Measures to address land conflict can prosper only if they have solid political
      support, both nationally and locally. Formal mechanisms include the judicial and quasi-judicial systems
      of (1) national government agencies such as the DENR Land Management and Forest Management
      Bureaus, the Department of Agricultural Reform (DAR), the National Commission on Indigenous
      Peoples, and the Land Registration Authority; (2) regional government agencies such as DENR-ARMM,
      DAR-ARMM, and the Office of Southern Cultural Communities; and (3) local government conflict
      resolution bodies. Among informal nonstate bodies are customary or traditional dispute settlement
      mechanisms in Moro and indigenous communities, dispute settlement bodies managed by civil society
      organizations, and the MILF’s shadow Shari’ah courts.

      ARMM is pursuing a similar approach to some extent through the delivery of education services by Building Resources Across Communities
      (BRAC) under the Australian Government’s BEAM-ARMM program.

     198.	 In many cases of land conflict, formal government mechanisms need to either be more sympathetic
           to local customs or give way to informal mechanisms. While government is mandated to settle land
           ownership, it sometimes worsens conflict by imposing discriminatory policies, applying land-related
           laws ineffectively, and passes conflicting land laws that pit legal claimants against one another. The
           bureaucracy has limited coverage, is not immediately accessible, and insists on complicated procedures.
           The confrontational nature of litigation also goes against the local social preference for preserving
           harmony. These factors—plus the alleged involvement of some government officials in anomalous
           transactions—discourage claimants from embarking on official procedures. A major restructuring of
            land-related agencies in the Bangsamoro to make them more sympathetic to local customs is therefore
            necessary before the government can settle land disputes effectively.


     199.	 Although non-state systems often enjoy local legitimacy, often they cannot resolve the underlying
            issues. They are typically low-cost and highly accessible, but because of their emphasis on keeping the
            peace, the core issue of a land dispute is often to be avoided, so that more is achieved in pacification
            than in issue resolution. These systems offer interesting lessons, but their sustainability and scalability
            to the rest of Mindanao needs further exploration.


     Specific Recommendations for Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi (Basulta)
     200.	 The recommendations in this chapter apply to all conflict-affected areas of Mindanao, but Basilan,
            Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi (known collectively as Basulta) require special attention. A central feature of Basulta
            is its dual economy: the traditional rural economy and the shadow economy. Geographic remoteness
            and acute security challenges in Basilan and Sulu also heighten the peace and development challenge
            in those two provinces. Finally, significant outmigration to Sabah and other locations—and the limited
            likelihood of major private investment in the area through the medium-term—makes remittances
            particularly critical for the Basulta economy.


     201.	 The traditional rural economy revolves around agriculture, fisheries, and informal services. The
            shadow economy is broadly defined to include all unregistered economic activities, such as smuggling
            of basic and commercial goods (e.g., rice, oil, sugar, other food items, electronics),149 smuggling or
            trade of prohibited goods (e.g., drugs, weapons), human smuggling and trafficking, kidnap for ransom,
            informal land market and credits, and extortion of businesses (see also Lara and Schoofs 2013).


     202.	 Given this unique context, development options for Basulta should also be unique. One option may
            be to convert Basulta into a free trade zone to reduce both tariff and nontariff barriers to trade. This
            could improve welfare because basic commodities are cheaper in Sabah. With zero tariff and few non-
            tariff barriers, Basulta could return to a version of the barter trade that made it prosperous in the past.
            Another positive impact of the free trade zone could be reallocation of scarce government resources
            to combating illicit shadow economy activities rather than regulating the “coping” smuggling that
            Basultans resort to for survival.




       	
     149
            Local and international players, allegedly including government officials, are involved in the smuggling chain. For a detailed discussion of
            rice smuggling in the Zamboanga and Basulta area, see Sarmiento (2016).

203.	 Regularizing consular services for almost half a million Filipinos in Sabah could help them get better
      jobs, access social services, and in the process increase remittances to help Basulta stabilize and
      grow. Due to the Philippines’ claim on Sabah, no consulate cannot currently be established there.
      Instead, the Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur provides a mobile consular service several times
      a year that processes birth certificates and passports. Given the large number of irregular migrants,
      this service could be made more frequent. Increasing it will require close coordination of numerous
      government agencies. These agencies could form a task force to make monthly visits to areas in Sabah
      where there are sizable numbers of Filipinos. With passports, irregular and otherwise stateless Filipinos
      could attend school, access health services, and get better jobs. They would also be better protected
      from exploitation and discrimination. The remittances they send back, estimated at US$190 million a
      year, could be instrumental in helping Basulta, and Mindanao, stabilize and grow.

     Highlights of the Proposed Strategy for
     Mindanao Regional Development
     204.	 This section outlines proposed interventions following a strategic approach to ensure spatial focus,
           pinpoint targeting of beneficiaries, and appropriate sequencing and linking of priorities. This strategy
           for regional development in Mindanao builds on dialogue with the Philippine government and
           stakeholders in Mindanao and on the government’s Strategic Framework for Mindanao Peace and
           Development. The main goals are to (1) raise agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market
           connectivity; (2) boost human development; and (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility and build
           up institutions in ARMM and other conflict-affected areas. The World Bank engagement for Mindanao
           will be based on this strategy (Figure 40).

78   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
Heighten Agricultural Productivity and Improve Farm-to-market Connectivity
205.	 Raising agricultural productivity and reducing transaction costs by expanding into more inclusive value
      chains would require a hybrid solution—an agro-spatial approach, fostering productive alliances,150
      while enhancing agriculture-based livelihoods. Attention should center on selection of product clusters
      in the poorest and most conflict-affected areas while ensuring linkages to Mindanao’s main agricultural
      processing and trading hubs, urban centers, and mobilizing the combined resources of government,
      private industry, academic/ training centers, financial institutions, and NGOs. For communities, (re)-
      building social cohesion will be crucial, as will support for dispute resolution mechanisms and legal aid
      to resolve land-related disputes. This would also enhance urban functions in rural development; access
      to finance by integrating Islamic financing principles; and increasing the number and quality of jobs
      on and off the farm. This could deepen the integration of the domestic food market and strengthen
      export competitiveness.


206.	 A priority in improving roads should be farms and agricultural centers to ports and streamlining
      related logistics services. Most of Mindanao’s population depends on farming to earn a living, but most
      have small farms in areas with no transport connectivity so they are cut off from markets and trapped
      in poverty. Roads to farm gates are often in poor condition; because they are not mapped, strategic
      planning is difficult. Low volumes and poor roads discourage formal trucking services especially
      when the terrain is mountainous and rolling, often aggravated by natural calamities and accidents.
      Urban roads to ports are already highly congested. Identifying the missing local roads could make
      clearer the path to linking farmlands to strategically located cargo consolidation centers with cold
      storage facilities that are part of a logistics network. That would ultimately support smaller farming
      communities in better managing harvests and minimizing wastage, and facilitate transport connectivity
      to markets, urban centers, and beyond via strategic ports Consolidating at agricultural centers will lead
      to more full-truckloads; reducing unit transportation costs and increasing volumes can attract more
      logistics and transportation services. The capacity of national roads connecting the main cities should
      be expanded and inter-city linkages will be particularly important if ports are to be rationalized.


207.	 If the connectivity of agricultural products to supply chains is to improve, logistics services will need to
      be of higher quality. Interventions would be directed to optimizing inbound (e.g., agricultural inputs)
      and outbound logistics in the main commodity corridors, and addressing needs of specific supply
      chains, e.g., cold chain facilities, container yards, and warehouses. Typically, consolidating logistics
      facilities close to ports or inside regions would need to involve public-private partnerships (PPPs) to
      facilitate direct import and export from Mindanao. An important element would be automation of
      regulatory requirements for the provision of logistics services to the regions, including agri-laboratories,
      customs clearances, export permits, and vessel registration. The main gains will be in the quality and
      reliability of farm-to-market supply chains resulting in fewer product losses due to spoilage; higher-
      quality exports, and better access to markets and new revenue sources. Improvements may also result
      in lower freight costs and a higher logistics labor content.


  	
150
      Productive alliances: horizontal alliances among smallholders to coordinate production and sell collectively; which incentivizes vertical
      alliances between (organized) producers and at least one buyer engaged in provision of a good in a specific value chain based on a
      commercial agreement—often involving a bundling of services.



                                                                                                 A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development     79
     208.	 There is potential to consolidate port cargo to increase economies of scale and modernize customs
           procedures. The traffic at Mindanao is fragmented among public ports at CDO, Davao Sasa, General
           Santos (Gen San), Zamboanga, Nasipit, Ozamiz, Iligan, Surigao, Dapitan and numerous smaller ports
           because shipments move to the nearest seaport due to poor road connectivity and infrastructure
           limitations at the main gateway ports. The lack of infrastructure investments is particularly evident
           at CDO and Davao Sasa, where damaged quays and lack of berth space have led to construction of
           private ports and diversion of a substantial volume of containerized traffic to the new port facilities.


     209.	 With regulatory reforms and a coordinated plan for port development, facilities at the dominant
           gateway ports could eventually complement initiatives by public and private partners, positioning
           Mindanao as a well-connected agri-logistics hub in South East Asia. Economies of scale in consolidating
           cargo encourages private investment in ports; and longer berths that can accommodate ever-larger
           vessels are an incentive for shipping lines to use the ports more often. Increased services also lead to
           higher connectivity and more frequent calls, and ultimately to more competitive freight rates.


     210.	 Modernizing customs to complement transport and logistics reforms will be crucial. While customs is
           administered nationally, problems identified in the center are often much more severe in the regions.
           Adopting international standards, eliminating red tape, and installing modern automated systems can
           therefore have a major impact on traders by (1) improving the transparency and consistency of how
           customs regulation operates; (2) enhancing inter-agency collaboration in facilitating trade; (3) slashing
           opportunities for the inappropriate use of discretionary powers; and (4) better monitoring activities
           and client service standards.


     Boost Human Development
     211.	 Efforts to boost human development need a dual-track strategy: First address first basic education,
           then address skills and employment programs. These initiatives will ensure that the people of Mindanao
           can take full advantage of the opportunities as they are created by greater agriculture productivity and
           improved connectivity.


     212.	 Raising the quality of and access to basic education will ensure that graduates have the foundation
           for further skills development. Improving the quality of teaching and learning will entail building up
           teacher professional programs and improving the systems to support both teachers and students.
           Increased access will be driven by drop-out prevention activities as well as improvements in infrastructure
           management and in improving teaching and learning materials and equipment to make staying in
           school more attractive. Efforts are also needed to fulfill the promise of school-based management by
           strengthening school-level planning and monitoring (e.g., giving more responsibilities to local school
           boards, school governing councils and parent-teacher associations) and ensuring that school-level
           accountability and transparency mechanisms function. Adjusting the current funding formula and
           improving local government financial support to public schools could be an effective and efficient
           way of channeling critical resources to where they are most needed. Complementing these efforts
           will be an adult learning program focused on the ARMM, where many adults are illiterate or at most
           completed only minimal basic education, to provide adults 15 years or older the reading and writing
           skills that will enable them to continue further training for employment. This means increasing access
           to programs and learning materials that meet the specific needs of the targeted group of learners.

80   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
213.	 The second component of the human development strategy will address building jobs skills and
      the bridge to employment for youth through vocational training, second-chance education, and
      employment facilitation and career coaching. This can build on TESDA’s community-based training
      and enterprise development scheme, which has shown promise in preparing youth for jobs in
      Mindanao and in particular expanding TESDA initiatives for agricultural training and other activities
      with high-potential in ARMM (e.g., halal food processing). Vocational training initiatives should include
      interventions to boost the socioemotional skills of youth, especially in conflict affected areas, and
      adoption of proven on-the-job training models. This will also reforms to ensure that the Alternative
      Learning System provides more job-relevant training. Finally, this set of initiatives will include enhanced
      job profiling, employment referral, and career coaching to connect qualified youth to job opportunities,
      for instance through a larger role for DOLE’s public employment offices. The collective impact of these
      enhanced programs will be to ensure that Mindanao youth are prepared to access the jobs generated
      by other elements of the strategy.


214.	 An important element will be to promote employment for vulnerable youth in poor and conflict-
      affected areas. To capitalize on increasing skills for agricultural development, in Mindanao, the
      geographical focus of the agricultural and the skill development projects would be aligned. To address
      the functional illiteracy problem, especially in ARMM, priority would be given for the Alternative
      Learning System for Moro and IPs with higher incidences of functional illiteracy, and perhaps also to
      ex-combatants. Finally, vulnerable youth and young ex-combatants in conflict-affected areas would
      be specifically targeted group to benefit from vocational training and enhancement of skills the labor
      market demands.


Addressing Drivers of Conflict and Fragility
215.	 The interventions seek to build resilience, opportunity, and equity across Mindanao. Recognizing that
      a large part of Mindanao is affected by conflict and fragility, the focus will be on interventions that can
      help to break the cycles of insecurity and reduce the risk of their recurrence. They should facilitate a
      virtuous spiral of restoring confidence in collective action and transforming institutions so that they
      can then provide a sustained level of security, justice, and jobs. Ensuring accountability how funding is
      used and the quality of services delivered will be reviewed regularly against the goals, with mitigation
      or remedial measures in place to resolve inconsistencies.


216.	 Differentiated engagement strategies will be applied as needed, with some actions for areas with
      clear potential for growth and private investment, and others for conflict-affected and poverty-stricken
      areas to support peace-promoting socioeconomic development interventions. For the conflict-
      affected population the speed of interventions is of the essence. The rapid provision of assistance to
      conflict-affected populations is essential to alleviate suffering, deliver a peace dividend, and build
      confidence. Quick results can build the foundation for transformational changes in the medium
      term. For certain areas of intervention, initial support will be provided by Trust Funds to continue
      confidence building.




                                                                             A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   81
     217.	 Differentiating implementation modalities and ensuring sensitivity to conflict in design and work on
            the ground will be crucial. Modalities will need to be adapted to the regional and local context and
            different types of institutions, including national and local government agencies, the ARMM government,
            perhaps the Bangsamoro Transitional Authority and future Bangsamoro government, and MILF-MNLF
            institutions. As appropriate, proposed interventions for a given sector will from their inception an
            analysis of specific drivers of conflict and fragility to ensure that there are activities to address these
            drivers, and that proposed interventions will not have unintended counterproductive effects. Overall,
            a minimum of security is essential for making possible the realization of many interventions.


     218.	 Capacity building and a focus on including and supporting vulnerable groups will be an essential
            feature of the interventions. A long-term perspective on building up local institutions will part of the
            planning. Building capable and legitimate institutions is vital for breaking repetitive cycles of violence.
            Promoting initiative and inclusive decision-making and resource allocation to involve citizens and non-
            state actors will broaden ownership, enhance the adequacy of interventions, and generate trust in the
            peace and post-conflict processes. Projects will be designed ensure support to vulnerable groups,
            including ex-combatants, communities impacted by conflict, and indigenous peoples.


     219.	 Confidence can only be restored and social cohesion strengthened in conflict affected areas if local
            governance is responsive and there is peace-promoting catch-up access to basic socioeconomic
            community infrastructure. Interventions would give priority to socioeconomic infrastructure using
            participatory planning at the local level building on lessons learned from the long history in the
            Philippines of participatory development, community empowerment, and community-driven initiatives,
            including in the ARMM and other conflict-affected areas. This would have the additional benefit of
            strengthening social cohesion in the community level, which is crucial in a post-conflict environment.
            Successful Community-Driven Development (CDD) in the Philippines has proven to improve the delivery
            of basic services, and reduce poverty.151 While national and international evidence has shown that
            CDD in general does not reduce the incidence of conflict incidence, that CDD increases interaction,
            participation, and among villagers, and between villagers and local leaders, and contributes to
            promoting social cohesion. However, a study from 2012 showed that in MILF controlled areas, levels of
            violence tend to decrease because of MILF participation in CDD process (Labonne 2013}.


     220.	 Through support to build up local governments, the ability of institutions to fulfill the social contract
            through inclusive, transparent, and conflict-sensitive delivery of services, LGU governance would
            be enhanced. The conflict-sensitivity of the design would draw from experience with the PAMANA
            program of the government, GIZ, and the AECID among others, as well as KC-NCDDP, the ARMM
            Social Fund, and Mindanao Trust Fund projects. The proposed interventions will also contribute to the
            implementation of agreements under the Annex on Normalization” signed by the government of the
            Philippines (GPH) and the MILF.152 Interventions would strengthen the capacity of MNLF- and MILF-

            Successful use of CDD approaches in poverty reduction interventions in the Philippines was demonstrated in an Impact Evaluation
            from KALAHI-CIDSS showing an increase in per capita consumption, especially for households that were classified as poor (J.
            Labonne, Feb 2013).

            On January 25, 2014, the GPH and the MILF signed the Annex on Normalization. It defined normalization as “a process whereby
            communities can achieve their desired quality of life, which includes the pursuit of sustainable livelihood and political participation within
            a peaceful deliberative society.” It further notes that the aim of normalization is to “ensure human security in the Bangsamoro.” The Annex
            highlights, among other things, the need for programs to be community-based to reinforce social cohesion.

      affiliated institutions, ARMM government, and LGUs at the barangay and municipal level, as well as
      perhaps the new Bangsamoro Transitional Authority.


221.	 While support would be provided for the development of communities impacted by conflict,
      normalization also requires specialized support to decommissioned combatants. Building upon
      previous experiences with decommissioned combatants, not only in the Philippines but also in Latin
      America, the Middle East and Northern and Sub-Saharan Africa, interventions would be directed
      to supporting the transition of combatants to civilians. A first crucial step would be to draw up
      the strategy and mechanisms for this. Support could also be provided for offering socioeconomic
      reintegration packages. For longer-term support and sustainable livelihoods, decommissioned
      combatants might be linked with agricultural development projects, as well as job skills training and
      employment facilitations. Finally, children of ex-combatants could be benefit from opening up access
      to basic education in conflict-affected areas.


222.	 Given the scale and complexity of land conflict, promoting more equitable access to land will require
      support through the short, medium and long terms. Measures to address land conflict can prosper only
      if they have solid political support in Manila as well as Mindanao. As a first step, land conflict resolutions
      could be piloted in areas where land conflicts are frequent through, e.g., the proposed agricultural
      interventions. Experience in Mindanao suggests that hybrid institutions that marry the authority of
      the state and the social legitimacy of transitional institutions can be effective. In the medium to long
      term, successful pilots for efficient and community-acceptable land conflict resolution mechanisms
      should be scaled-up, building on experiences of the GPH, in collaboration with development
      partners like GIZ, USAID, and others. The alternative dispute resolution process could eventually be
      incorporated into a Bangsamoro Land Administration Law. In the short term, interventions could also
      promote understanding of the political economy governing land markets, and the intentions of those
      displaced and dispossessed by the conflict to return to their communities of origin after a Bangsamoro
      government is installed—that could cause anxiety in and possibly violence from current residents.


223.	 In the long term, supporting effective reforms of land administration and management both nationally
      and in Mindanao will be crucial, as will ensuring that they are put into effect.153 Interventions would
      aim to (1) strengthen relevant institutions by clarifying their roles and responsibilities; (2) strengthen
      cadastral surveys and title registrations, using modern technology validated by community mapping,
      and (3) develop accountability mechanisms. If the Bangsamoro Basic Law passes, support could
      be given to designing a Bangsamoro land administration system. As international experience has
      shown, land administration can falter, especially in post-conflict environments unless there are clear
      commitments to good governance.


The Value Proposition
224.	 The proposed strategic approach has many benefits over a simple project-by-project approach,
      notably its geo-spatial advantages. First, the spatial focus through the agriculture interventions can
      reach the poorest beneficiaries while also linking hinterlands to main markets and ports along key

      Congress already has before it a National Land Use Plan Act.



                                                                               A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development   83
           corridors. The intervention related to road connectivity, logistics, and port modernization would build
           on the MinDa Growth Corridors concept and target freight flows on the CDO–Bukidnon-Davao–Gen
           San north south routes.


     225.	 The strategy would also ensure conflict sensitivity in every phase. For example, interventions on
           basic education would include activities to support Alternative Education directed to beneficiaries of
           agriculture interventions, farmers and agriculture-based communities in the poorest barangays, conflict
           areas, and indigenous people. Priority would be given to groups with a higher incidence of functional
           illiteracy. Also, the conflict-sensitive design of agriculture interventions would allow communities to
           implement their own sub-projects or contract in services and training as identified in the local economic
           development plans. This could include a combination of (1) public goods and economic infrastructure,
           such as access roads, post-harvest facilities, irrigation, and farming or fishing equipment; (2) agricultural
           extension services and farmers field schools; (3) home or community vegetable production; and (4)
           market-linked skills training and job referral services, especially for youth. Support might also cover
           dispute resolution mechanisms and legal aid to resolve land-related disputes.


     226.	 The strategic approach builds on programs already underway, and will help with sequencing and
           scaling them up. For example, interventions on road connectivity would be based on the MinDa
           Corridors Program and could complement the Asian Development Bank national roads program for
           Western Mindanao. It would also build on the topographic map for Mindanao prepared by JICA,
           the current master planning for Davao, and the DPWH roads convergence programs. Skills and
           employment support interventions would complement the ADB project on facilitating youth school-
           to-work transition in support of DOLE and TESDA. They would also link to JICA interventions for
           supporting senior high school programs in vocational high schools. Port modernization interventions
           would leverage the preparatory studies for the SASA wharf container terminal PPP for a broader study
           to develop Mindanao ports as strategic multipurpose ports with versatile cargo-handling capabilities.


     227.	 The strategic approach lends itself well to innovations based on global best practices. The interventions
           on basic education and on skills and employment development would package a set of interventions
           that foster skills development and facilitate school-to-work transition that are currently fragmented
           among different agencies, making it difficult to measure their impact on employment outcomes.
           The interventions to expand access to finance for rural farmers would incorporate Islamic finance;
           encourage support of new market opportunities, such as the growing local urban market and halal; use
           of ICT to share market information and agriculture extension; support for convergence of government
           approaches to creating an economic livelihood; and build capacity to adapt to support the normalization
           process under the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro. Port modernization interventions
           would integrate planning for various Mindanao ports, possibly adopting a dual port gateway strategy;
           that would allow packaging urban roads access improvement with ports development, or launching
           a Maritime Training Institute for technical education of seafarers, and port and terminal operating
           personnel, to enhance their operational capabilities. Customs interventions would adopt paperless
           trade processes and eliminate face-to-face contact between officials and traders; help with World
           Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA) alignment focused on transparency,
           accountability, and integrity; and identify client service standards to be publicly reported.


84   A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
228.	 The goal of the proposed strategy is to crowd in partners and maximize a variety of financing options,
      such as grants, loans, multi-donor trust funds, and government funding (Figure 41). It would also allow
      the crowding-in of partner ranging from governments, multilaterals, and bilaterals (other development
      partners [DPs]) to the private sector. Technical assistance and advisory service could be financed
      primarily by trust funds. For scaling-up activities in the longer term, reimbursable advisory services (RAS)
      could be an option, as well as loans to be supported by the International Bank for Reconstruction and
      Development (IBRD). Combining different sources of financing would allow for (1) supporting different
      types of institutions, including MNLF and MILF institutions, the ARMM government, national and local
      governments agencies, and eventually the Bangsamoro Transitional Authority and future Bangsamoro
      government; (2) making longer-term commitments; (3) going to scale; and (4) supporting both the
      transition and the transformation phases of the government’s peace and development agenda.

229.	 Finally, because the strategy is comprehensive, it could ensure buy-in and better coordination
      between implementing agencies. Since it is firmly anchored in the Philippines Development Plan and
      the government’s Strategic Framework for Peace and Development, the strategy’s approach and its
      interventions have the opportunity to bring partners in public institutions closer together (Figure 42).
      This high relevance and tight alignment with the priorities of national and subnational government
      institutions could heighten the chances of delivering on the envisioned results.

86    A Strategy For Mindanao Regional Development
  Annex I: Regression analysis of the impact of minimum wage requirements on
  manufacturing employment

Summary of Methodology
This study investigates the effect of minimum wages on manufacturing employment, using data from
the Philippine manufacturing survey. In particular, it looks at the effect of minimum wages on within-firm
employment using a panel of manufacturing survey data for firms in Mindanao.


Data
From the manufacturing survey, a small panel dataset of firms in Mindanao is used to explore the effect of
minimum wages on within-firm employment over time. The dataset is composed of 40 firms from Mindanao,
all with at least 20 workers, surveyed from 1996 to 2008. No larger dataset was available.


Minimum wage data are from the National Wages and Productivity Commission. National data are available
from 1951 to 1989 and regional from 1990 to 2010 at the regional level.154 Minimum wages are expressed in
real terms, using the published national and regional consumer price indices from the PSA.


Methodology
Equation (1) is used for the manufacturing firm panel dataset. The general regression equation is as follows:




Interpretation of the variables and coefficients is as follows: The alphas are firm ( ), region ( ), and year ( ) fixed
effects. The coefficient         measures the elasticity of manufacturing employment to the real minimum wage. For
regression using ordinary least squares (OLS), the alphas are replaced with dummy variables.                                    was included
as a time-varying regional control vector that includes variables such as the share of exports to revenue, the
share of electricity to total cost, and the natural log of capital spending. For fixed effects (FE), depending on the
specification, the alphas are retained.


To check whether random effects (RE) estimation would be more appropriate, Hausman tests are conducted
for each specification. The tests find that for the panel regressions, fixed effects and random effects are
significantly different in all specifications. This is expected because FE estimation is more appropriate for
the panel datasets as the observations are not necessarily random draws from the population.155 To arrive
at more robust estimates, heteroskedasticity-robust and clustered standard errors are used at the region,
province, and firm levels.156



  	
154
       The breakpoint is due to a change in the minimum wage-setting regime. In July 1989, Congress enacted Republic Act 6727, which
       delegated the power of Congress to set minimum wages to the new Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards (RTWPBs). The
       RTWPBs are mandated to prescribe minimum wage rates for their regions, taking into account regional conditions.
  	
155
       See Wooldridge (2009) for more discussion.
  	
156
       The effect of using this kind of standard error is that the significance of the estimates decreases from one percent to between five and 10
       percent in some regressions.
