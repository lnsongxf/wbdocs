Productivity and Economic Integration
Total factor productivity growth — efficiency of use of the factors of production
is both essential for and can be accelerated by economic integration.



  OVERVIEW:

  Productivity in the Western Balkans is low by international standards. It grows slowly and,
  most recently, has been subtracting from growth. Productivity in the region is hampered by
  an often unfriendly business environment and the dominance of state-owned enterprises
  (SOEs). Unfair competition from informal enterprises and lack of access to finance are the
  only obstacles to businesses that rank in the top five in all six countries. The broad frontier
  of reforms is needed to unleash the private sector and improve formalization of firms.
  Improving the quality of micro-level data is also important for evidence-based policy
  making.

Regional Trade Integration
Achieving Economic Pros p erity through Regional Trade Integration



  OVERVIEW:

  Economic integration is an essential element in many success stories of countries that have
  achieved high income and economic prosperity. Exports have expanded significantly in
  recent years, but the Western Balkan countries remain poorly integrated into world trade.
  Removing market barriers and reducing the cost of trade will make the region a more
  desirable trading partner to the rest of the world, and support integration efforts with the
  EU.

Investment Policy
Towards a regional agenda to attract higher quality investments to the
Western Balkans



 OVERVIEW:

 Greater convergence of regional investment policies and alignment with international good
 practice standards is a key conduit for economic integration and the attraction of more and
 higher quality investment to the Western Balkans. To make greater regional harmonization
 of investment policies a reality, advances at different levels are required. The economies of
 the region need to develop and agree upon a regional agenda, draft relevant regional
 frameworks, and implement them de jure and de facto in all of them so that regional
 integration and better alignment with EC standards becomes a reality in practice. They
 need to increasingly cover different technical areas of sophisticated regulation and
 synchronize integration of policies in different fields, including in particular in investment
 promotion and attraction, entry and establishment, as well as protection and retention.

Fostering Economic Integration through
Effective Competition Policies
Levering the synergies of domestic competition policies to build regional
markets



    OVERVIEW:

    While all Western Balkan countries have competition regulatory frameworks in place,
    implementation remains weak. Effective competition policies would offer a tool to
    complement and support governments’ efforts to promote economic integration in the
    Western Balkans. Regional trade reinforces competition in national markets by increasing
    contestability, entry, and rivalry through increased presence of foreign products, services,
    and investments. Implementing an effective competition policy at the regional level would
    be key to promote economic integration in the Western Balkans and embed competition
    principles in sectoral policies. Competition in domestic markets is also critical to foster
    integration with the EU.

Diversification of Financial Markets
Developing regional capital markets for better economic integration



    OVERVIEW:

    Global financial integration has increased substantially over the last two decades, including
    in the Western Balkans. However, financial deepening has been uneven across countries and
    sectors and lacks diversification. Given that the countries in the Western Balkans are
    relatively small in terms of economic size and population base, there is a compelling case
    for regional integration of capital markets. Capital markets can play a key role in
    complementing bank-centric financing. In this context, a regional capital market in the
    Western Balkans can help (i) unlock more investment for all companies, especially SMEs,
    and for infrastructure projects, (ii) attract more investment into the region from the rest of
    the world, and (iii) make the financial system more stable by opening up a wider range of
    funding sources.

Annex 1: Selected experiences with capital markets integration


  European Union
  Integration of capital markets in Europe is part of a broader process of political, social and economic integration
  imbedded in regional treaties.

  Integration of financial markets in general, and capital markets in particular is anchored on a passport regime,
  whereby products authorized in one jurisdiction can be offered across all jurisdictions and intermediaries licensed in
  one jurisdiction can provide services in all jurisdictions without the need to obtain additional authorizations or
  licenses, and in the case of intermediaries without the need to establish subsidiaries.

  The passport regime is supported by a series of EU directives and in some cases EU regulations that seek to harmonize
  the requirements applicable to products, market infrastructure providers and intermediaries. Initially the approach
  relied more on minimum harmonization (whereby countries have the possibility to add requirements, commonly
  known as gold plating). Increasingly the approach relies more on maximum harmonization (whereby the domestic
  authorities cannot add requirements to those agreed at the European level). This maximum harmonization approach
  has aimed to minimize the potential for regulatory arbitrage. Overall the existing directives and/or regulations cover
  all key areas of the capital markets framework (perhaps the main “gap” is corporate governance of listed companies).
  However, key components of the enabling environment are not yet harmonized, including for example the insolvency
  framework and the tax regime.

  Initially supervision and enforcement were left to the domestic authorities, although provisions exist in the directives
  and regulations that require countries to cooperate and coordinate with each other. Overtime regional bodies
  emerged. Initially, the domestic securities regulators created the Committee of European Securities Regulators
  (CESR), to facilitate cooperation and coordination. More recently regional authorities were created for the financial
  sector. On the securities market side, this authority is the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).
  Currently ESMA has direct supervisory authorities in limited areas (mainly supervision of credit rating agencies and
  trade repositories); however, it has a key role in fostering supervisory convergence (via for example peer reviews)
  and assisting the authorities in the identification of emerging and systemic risks.

  In terms of the market infrastructure, multiple trading platforms coexist at the regional level and the same
  instrument can potentially be traded in different platforms. At the exchange level, it is possible to refer to a process
  of consolidation/integration of exchanges that has taken place mainly via mergers and acquisitions. That is the case
  for example of Euronext, which currently integrates the markets of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal
  and a listing venue from UK. At the same time, with the implementation of MiFID 1, other types of trading platforms
  appeared. In general, it is recognized that the plurality of trading venues brought trading costs down, however there
  has been a recognition that the high degree of market fragmentation poses challenges vis-à-vis market transparency,
  price formation and investor protection. A key objective of MiFID 2 has been to address these concerns. In the same
  vein, several CSDs coexist across the region. However, lack of interoperability, which is particularly important for
  post-trading, remains an important issue to address.




  Canada
  The 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada are responsible for securities regulations. Securities regulators from
  each province and territory have teamed up to form the Canadian Securities Administrators, or CSA for short. The
  CSA is primarily responsible for developing a harmonized approach to securities regulation across the country.

  The CSA brings provincial and territorial securities regulators together to share ideas and work at designing policies
  and regulations that are consistent across the country and ensure the smooth operation of Canada's securities
  industry. By collaborating on rules, regulations and other programs, the CSA helps avoid duplication of work and
  streamlines the regulatory process for companies seeking to raise investment capital and others working in the
  investment industry. In recent years, the CSA has developed the “passport system" through which a market
  participant has access to markets in all passport jurisdictions by dealing only with its principal regulator and
  complying with one set of harmonized laws. It is a major step forward in improving Canada’s securities regulatory
  system by providing market participants with streamlined access to Canada’s capital markets. The CSA's impact on
  most Canadians comes through its efforts to help educate Canadians about the securities industry, the stock markets
  and how to protect investors from investment fraud and market abuse generally.
  As an informal body, the CSA functions through meetings, conference calls and day to day cooperation among the
  securities regulatory authorities. The CSA Chairs meet quarterly in person and by-weekly by conference call through
  meetings of the Policy Coordination Committee. Source: CSA website (www.securities-administrators.ca)

  Latin America: MILA
  MILA is a cross border initiative that currently focuses on the integration of the equities markets of Chile, Colombia,
  Mexico and Peru. In its origins, around 2008, it covered only the exchanges of Chile, Colombia and Peru, while Mexico
  joined the MILA in 2014. The initiative originated in the exchanges, but has had the support of the regulatory
  authorities of the region. Further, in its 2014 Summit, the Ministers of the region on its Pacific Alliance Summit
  expressed their support to the MILA, as a key component of a broader policy for free trade among these countries.

  The MILA has covered only the equity markets and has been mostly geared towards secondary market trading, and
  in particular the development of a single trading platform whereby the companies listed in one of the exchanges in
  the region can be easily traded in the remaining exchanges. Such single trading platform is achieved via technological
  tools, rather than via mergers and acquisitions of one exchange by another. However, it is expected that under the
  umbrella of the Pacific Alliance this initiative will expand beyond equity markets.

  As per its initial focus (i.e. equity markets) the initiative was developed under a two-step approach: (i) on a first stage
  the virtual single market takes place through the routing of orders to local intermediaries. Transactions take place
  in the market in which the securities are listed, in accordance with the rules of that exchange, in the local currency,
  and with book-entry though the local brokers; (ii) on a second stage integration would allow for remote participation
  of brokers from each country in all the remaining jurisdictions.

  The initiative is currently in its first stage. The implementation of the first phase required legal and regulatory
  changes, as well as technological changes. From an issuers’ perspective the project required changes in the regulatory
  framework of the home country to facilitate the offering of securities in the remaining host countries; however, there
  are still differences in the “ease” by which securities from each country can be offered and listed in the others. On the
  intermediaries’ side, the implementation of the first phase did not require substantive changes to the legal and
  regulatory framework, given that remote participation is not yet allowed. But it did require the establishment of
  cooperation arrangements between brokerage houses for the routing of orders. On the exchanges side, important
  technological changes were needed to arrive to a virtual single platform, which are also backed by cooperation
  arrangements between the exchanges. On the CSD side, the MILA required changes in custody rules, to allow for
  omnibus accounts and facilitate cross border custody, as well as cooperative arrangements among the CSDs. Finally,
  some legal changes were made to eliminate some tax distortions; however, there is not yet a fully harmonized tax
  regime.

  The MILA has been supported by MoUs signed by the corresponding supervisory authorities. A first MoU signed in
  2009 committed the regulatory authorities to take all necessary actions to implement the MILA. A MoU signed in
  2010 provided the basis for cooperation, coordination and exchange of information in regard to the activities that
  take place in the MILA. An addendum to the MoU was signed in 2012 to deepen the level of coordination and
  cooperation via the creation of a supervisory committee with a mandate to foster the transparency and integrity of
  the MILA market, determine the technological and process requirements for exchanges, CSDs and intermediaries,
  review counterparty, exchange risk and liquidity risks, and information mechanisms.




  Central America: AMERCA
  AMERCA aimed at integrating the capital markets of Costa Rica, El Salvador and Panama. It originated in the late
  1990s as an initiative of the exchanges. Since its inception the project faced significant challenges both from the
  private sector and the public sector perspective. While in principle the three exchanges had agreed that integration
  was the best way to move forward, in practice they failed to agree on the terms of a cooperative agreement among
  them. At the regulatory level, the project was not backed by the supervisory authority of the Costa Rica securities
  market, the SUGEVAL, mainly due to concerns over the existence of material differences in the legal and regulatory
  framework, and over the intensity of the supervisory program of the three authorities. In August of 2015 the
  regulatory authorities of El Salvador and Panama announced their intention to move forward with the project of
  integration, on a bilateral basis.

  Africa: The capital markets of the East African Community
  Similar to the case of Europe, the integration of the capital markets of the East African Community is part of a broader
  project of political, social and economic integration among Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The
  Treaty for Establishment of the East African Community was signed on 30 November 1999 and entered into force on
  7 July 2000 following its ratification by the original three Partner States – Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. The Republic
  of Rwanda and the Republic of Burundi acceded to the EAC Treaty on 18 June 2007 and became full Members of the
  Community with effect from 1 July 2007.

  The strategy toward integration is largely inspired by the experience of the European Union. It is anchored on the
  development of a passport regime for issuers and intermediaries. Such regime is supported by directives approved by
  the Council of Ministers, which prescribe the minimum requirements that issuers, intermediaries and market
  infrastructure providers would need to fulfil. A key set of directives involving issuers, CIS and intermediaries was
  approved by the EAC Council of Ministers in 2014. In practice, important issues are not being fully detailed in the
  directives. To a large extent this has been a reflection of the difficulties of agreeing on a framework that would need
  to be applied to markets that are at different levels of development. A key example relates to the requirements for the
  licensing of securities intermediaries, and in particular the minimum capital and solvency required. Currently those
  requirements vary significantly among these jurisdictions and coming up to one unified framework has been a key
  source of concern. Thus, the trial with fire of this approach will come in the transposition of the directives, and the
  extent to which concerns about regulatory arbitrage and potential risks to investor protection and financial stability
  could be properly addressed.

  The securities supervisory authorities sought to increase coordination and cooperation through the creation of an
  association, the East African Securities Regulatory Authorities (EARSA) in 1997. In addition, the Capital Markets
  Development Committee (CMDC), consisting of chief executives of the regulatory authorities and security exchanges,
  was established in 2001. It is a standing committee of the EAC, making policy recommendations on regulation and
  integration of the capital markets. More recently, discussions have started on the potential creation of a regional
  supervisory authority.

  The trading and clearing and settlement infrastructure in East Africa is still highly fragmented with four exchanges
  and seven CSD systems that are not yet interconnected. The goal is to make them interoperable.

Harmonizing Financial Reporting to
Promote Regional Integration and Growth
Effective financial reporting frameworks based on international standards
generate reliable and transparent information needed for integration of
regional financial markets and growth.


    OVERVIEW:

    Transparent, reliable, and comparable financial reporting enables investors and lenders to
    identify viable opportunities to offer financing, and also helps companies obtain financing
    on reasonable terms. Improving the quality of financial information and increasing its
    acceptance and use are key to addressing one of the greatest impediments to growth for
    small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in the region, namely the lack of affordable
    financing without excessive collateral requirements. Effective implementation of
    international accounting standards will help broaden financial markets and improve access
    to finance from regional and global sources. It will also help assure reliable information for
    financial market supervisors, bank regulators, and tax authorities, and support insolvency
    mechanisms and creditors’ rights. In addition to promoting financial transparency,
    accountants can become skilled business advisors to help SMEs overcome common
    challenges to growth. Regional cooperation and knowledge-sharing can help countries
    address these common challenges.

Strengthening Institutions for Regional
Integration
Sound governance as a foundation for economic integration and growth and equity


 OVERVIEW:

 Governance is key to effective economic integration in the Western Balkans as it underpins
 harmonization of revenue policies, effective cooperation in tax administration, and efficient
 deployment of limited public resource to strategic priorities that can boost growth and
 equity. Fiscal responsibility and transparency can support coordination of macro-economic
 policies. Joint efforts to strengthen the rule of law can play a critical role in facilitating
 private investment and development of regional markets. Converging around EU
 governance standards and policies in the economic integration would facilitate access to,
 and eventual absorption of, EU pre-accession funds. Improving governance systems,
 especially systems that facilitate improvements in service delivery—such as cross border
 exchange of skills—and those that enhance transparency and accountability in the
 execution of public policy—such as tax administration and public financial management—
 are important foundational actions with potential for system wide improvements.

Justice Reform for Economic Integration
Improvements in court performance can improve the regional business climate



 OVERVIEW:

 Fostering a coherent regional approach to justice system performance could significantly
 improve the business climate across the Western Balkans. The countries of the Western
 Balkans are taking measures to improve the justice system, but their efforts are fragmented
 and citizens and businesses are yet to feel the results. Through coordination and
 collaboration, and with a regional commitment for the medium term, these countries could
 present themselves globally as region that is open for business, deserving of its place among
 EU member states as a place of trusted government and rule of law.

Agriculture and Regional Economic Integration
Advance economic integration by transforming agriculture on and off farm


 OVERVIEW:

 Agriculture can play an important role in the economic integration of the Western Balkans
 both directly (as a primary sector) and through its forward and backward linkages to the
 rural economy (through the agri-food system). Economic integration can drive the
 modernization and competitiveness of the sector by exploring comparative advantages in
 the output base, the natural resource endowments, value addition, and human capital of the
 countries. However, the potential benefits of integration are not immediate and careful
 actions would need to be taken to enable them across the agri-food system and the rural
 economy.

Regional Cooperation on Skill
Development and Employment Policies
Developing a Regional Labor Market Observatory to inform labor market
policies for enhanced economic integration



 OVERVIEW:

 The governments of the six Western Balkan (WB6) countries seek to increase
 competitiveness and employment levels of their national economies, while preparing for
 eventual integration with the European Union. Free mobility of people, or labor, is at the
 core of the latter. Given high unemployment rates across the region, governments want to
 tread slowly and should first build mechanisms to assess skill demand and supply—through
 a regional labor market observatory—and reform labor market policies, gradually
 removing constraints to labor mobility within and eventually beyond the region.

Higher Education for Advanced Skills
and Competitiveness
Using higher education to promote competitiveness through improved
outcomes in teaching and research



  OVERVIEW:

  Countries of the WB6 1 share a range of challenges, which urgently need to be addressed in
  order to enable higher education and research to fuel the development of advanced skills,
  competitiveness, and growth of the countries of the region. Issues which require immediate
  attention include the governance of universities, the efficient use of funds and financing
  instruments, and transparency as a basis for productive steering of the sectors towards high
  quality teaching, learning, research, and innovation. Pooling resources strategically at the
  regional level—for example, through joint organization of quality assurance—will enable
  countries to find solutions to these challenges.

Developing an Open and Integrated
Research and Innovation Area
Towards a more efficient regional innovation system for growth and job
creation


    OVERVIEW:

    Promoting economic growth and job creation in the Western Balkans requires a shift
    toward a more productivity-based, export-oriented growth model in which research and
    innovation are essential components. Yet, research and innovation systems in the region –
    characterized by weak research performance, poor collaboration between science and
    industry, and an inadequate governance regime – are essentially dysfunctional. Working
    towards a Western Balkans Regional and Innovation Area would contribute to changing
    this situation by (1) strengthening the overall governance through the adoption of EU type
    of progams, policies, and institutions, (2) enabling better use of available human, capital,
    and financial resources by avoiding fragmentation and redundancy – including through
    smart specialization, and (3) creating a platform for continued promotion of policy reform
    at national level.

Gender and Equity in the Western Balkans
Integrating for effectiveness through enhancing equity in the Western Balkans


     OVERVIEW:

     Making opportunities available to all groups in society, including women and the youth,
     requires an equitable provision of services and access to markets so that individuals can
     engage productively in society. Going beyond country-level efforts, the challenges
     governments face in achieving equity goals can be tackled more effectively if policies are
     designed in an integrated way following a regional approach. Integration allows economies
     of scale to materialize and takes advantage of strategic complementarities in helping
     people build their human capital, access to assets, resilience, and economic opportunites.
     For example, labor markets can work more effectively and make investments more
     attractive, potentially boosting employment. Credit and insurance markets are more
     efficient at larger scale. Education policies can promote regional learning and knowledge
     sharing. Investment in public goods yields higher social and economic returns.

Regional Broadband Infrastructure
Utilizing existing assets versus constructing new ones


  OVERVIEW:

  WB6 countries agree that regional broadband connectivity is patchy and needs to be
  developed further. Rather than constructing new broadband infrastructure,
  commercialization at a regional scale of already deployed and spare fiber optic assets along
  electricity transmission operators’ (TSOs) grids in the Western Balkans (WB6) provides a
  unique opportunity for economic integration within the region and with the global digital
  economy. This is a real opportunity for beneficial collaboration for national TSOs and the
  WB6 Governments, but implementation requires a truly regional dialogue and agreements.

Regional Women in Online Work (WoW)1
Initiative
Digital inclusion of un/underemployed women through online work


  OVERVIEW:

  The WB6 suffers from low labor force participation of women and their high level of
  unemployment. Women across WB6 face similar barriers to jobs, e.g. lack of opportunities,
  lack of relevant skills, inability to attend to a traditional employment schedule due to family
  responsibilities, etc. Small economies of WB6 cannot create many convenient employment
  opportunities for its women, but the rapidly expanding global online work industry can.
  Un/underemployed women stand to particularly benefit from ICT-enabled online work
  because of the flexibility of location and work schedules that it provides. The regional
  training and employability program aiming to mobilize and upskill un/underemployed
  women in the WB6 to work online is both a modern and a pragmatic action to tap into the
  global online employment marketplace and strengthen access to the jobs already created.
  Furthermore, this program will strengthen the supply of digital skills for the local economies
  and benefit IT companies in WB6 that are facing ICT skills shortage.

Towards a Regional Energy Market
Scaling-up Efficiency, Trade, and Investments in Sustainable Energy


  OVERVIEW:

  Development of a regional energy market strengthens energy security, improves reliability,
  and increases affordability of energy supply. Furthermore, the emerging regional energy
  market creates opportunities to increase energy trade and investments which are at the
  core of economic integration and development across the region. To achieve these benefits
  and create an integrated and competitive regional energy market, WB6 countries should
  reinvigorate the reform agenda and accelerate the implementation of EU compliant laws
  and regulations.

Transport Connectivity
Better transport connectivity is key to further economic integration in the
Western Balkans


  OVERVIEW:

  The lack of adequate and modern transport connectivity systems in the Western Balkans
  hinders the ability to trade and move people efficiently, as well as to unleash the potential
  of regional economic integration. Improving regional transport connectivity requires
  investment in physical infrastructure, but more importantly in addressing non-physical
  barriers. The main challenges to regional transport connectivity are to increase the SEETO
  Comprehensive Network’s (i) efficiency, (ii) reliability, and (iii) environmental
  sustainability. Key interventions to improve network efficiency need to address railway
  market opening, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), and border crossings. Increasing the
  network’s reliability requires more attention to asset management and road safety. Finally,
  strengthening sustainability requires increasing the network’s resilience in responding to
  major climate events, as well as implementing climate change mitigation measures.

Regional Infrastructure for Industrial Waste
Harnessing regional integration to eliminate legacy pollution


  OVERVIEW:

  The industrial and hazardous waste management sector across the Western Balkans
  demands serious reforms as a condition for investments in treatment and disposal
  infrastructure and for enabling private sector engagement. Single-country solutions are
  costly, resulting in the need for public sector subsidy or expensive export outside the region.
  Regional infrastructure solutions leverage volume and geography of waste, and create a
  shared regulatory, policy and tariff economic integration agenda across the region that
  could stabilize the business environment for heavy industry and tourism, attract private
  investment, and facilitate a new service sector.

Sava Integrated River Basin Development
Cross-sectoral and regional water management in the Sava River Basin


  OVERVIEW:

  This integrated river development program for the Sava River Basin will support the
  regional cooperation among the five Sava River Basin countries to accelerate economic
  integration and social development. A coordinated program of multipurpose and integrated
  interventions to enhance river’s navigability, flood management, environmental protection,
  and nautical tourism will also contribute to the development of its hydropower and
  irrigation potential and reduce risks associated to recurrent floods and droughts while
  improving environmental outcomes.
