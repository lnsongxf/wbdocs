O
       bjective. The main objective of this report is to identify and analyze key issues faced
       by the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services in Turkey, as Turkey works to reach
       compliance with the European Union (EU) Drinking Water Directive (DWD) and Urban
Wastewater Directive (UWWD), the WSS-related aspects of the EU Water Framework Directive
(WFD), and to initiate a dialog with authorities on opportunities to enhance the sustainability
(technical and financial) and affordability of service provision, consistent with these Directives.
This objective is consistent with Turkey’s focus on reaching the Sustainable Development Goals.
The report identifies questions which were discussed at a high level workshop on the subject and
hopes to generate interest for further analysis and support from the World Bank.
Turkey’s Rich Experience in WSS Services Management. The Turkish Republic has a long and rich
experience in the water sector. The 1926 Water Law places the overall responsibility for water
resources management at the state level. This was confirmed in the Constitution of 1982 that
provided that the state owns the right to explore and operate these natural resources, but can
transfer this right to private institutions for a defined period. Municipalities are responsible for
WSS services in their respective areas. In 1981, as a pragmatic response to water shortages and
sewage problems in İstanbul, the government of Turkey introduced a new service provision model
in Istanbul’s municipality. It established a dedicated Water and Sewage Administration (SKI),
called “ISKI” in Istanbul, as a public utility owned by the municipality but with an independent
budget. ISKI was entrusted to finance large WSS investments through international loans under
the Treasury Guarantee Scheme. Turkey thereafter created 16 “metropolitan municipalities”
(MM) by consolidating the municipalities in the main urban areas and by equipping each with an
SKI. The March 31, 2014, law created 14 new metropolitan municipalities and SKIs and extended
the service area of all metropolitan municipalities to cover the entire province. As a result, there
are 30 SKIs responsible for providing WSS services to 77 percent of the population (62 million
in 2014). Other municipalities provide WSS services through a municipal department. Special
provincial administrations (SPA) provide services in non-municipal areas.
Turkey Has Made Significant Progress Towards Compliance with EU Directives. The accession
process of the Turkish Republic to the EU led to a major effort to harmonize its legislation with
the EU’s overarching WFD and with WSS-related DWD and UWWD. Consistent with the WFD
principles of “good ecological status,” integrated water resources management and holistic
approaches to protect and control water resources (in both quantity and quality), Turkey
defined 25 river basins and prepared River Basin Protection Action Plans for each of them. It
entrusted the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs (MoFWA) to coordinate WFD compliance
and coordination of the preparation of river basin management plans, both centrally through the
Water Management Coordination Board, and locally through basin management committees.
Turkey also made great progress towards compliance with the DWD and the UWWD, which is
the focus of this report. It entrusted institutions, established service providers and developed
regulations, standards, programs, and action plans for sector investments and management of
WSS. Reshuffling in the government in 2011 resulted in modifications of Turkey’s institutional
arrangements that conferred most of the WSS mandates on MoFWA and on the Ministry of
Environment and Urbanization (MoEU). Funding responsibilities rely on the General Directorate
of State Hydraulic Works (GDSHW or DSI) and on IlBank. The latter, which is Turkey’s development
Bank, also assesses municipalities’ creditworthiness and funds and channels international
funding to the WSS sector.

     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     MoFWA, through its General Directorate for Water Management (GDWM), is in charge of
     preparing river basins management plans. GDWM is attempting, through a draft by-law, to
     redefine the “sensitive water bodies and the drainage areas of these water bodies as urban
     sensitive areas and/or nitrate sensitive areas.” It also determines the environmental quality
     standards which are to be used for improvement of surface and groundwater protection and
     associated threshold values.
     MoEU assesses environmental impacts, determines wastewater treatment standards, issues
     discharge permits, and monitors the performance of wastewater treatment plants. It also
     prepares the EU compliance operational program, creates financial agreement frameworks and
     sets priority levels for projects.
     Turkey’ WSS Sector Status Shows Good Coverage and Service Levels. In 2014, Turkey’s efforts in
     WSS resulted in reaching 97 percent access rates to piped water supply and 90 percent connection
     rates to the sewage network for populations living in municipalities, and respectively 91 percent
     and 84 percent nationally. The Turkish Statistical Institute, TurkStat, reported access levels to
     treated water at 58 percent in municipalities and 54 percent nationally. Considering that the
     customer satisfaction rate with the water supply service was 79 percent in 2012 and above 76
     percent since 2009, it is assumed that the rest of the supplied water is mostly in a good enough
     condition that it does not require complex treatment methods and can be distributed after a
     simple disinfection. In 2014, despite increasing population, access, and per capita consumption
     levels, Turkey decreased the ratio of wastewater discharged without treatment from 36 percent
     (1,226 million m3) in 2006 to 19 percent (813 million m3) in 2014 and lowered the level of non-
     revenue water (NRW) from 54 percent to 35 percent in the same period. These levels match
     those of EU member states in the Danube River Basin.
     WSS Debt-Funded Investments Efforts Limit SKIs’ Creditworthiness. 2014 and 2015 data on
     payables shows that the total debt levels of most SKIs exceed budget revenues. The majority of
     SKIs, most of which were established in 2014, operate at a loss, despite reasonable tariff levels,
     and have low creditworthiness. This shows that better financing and efficiency improvements
     are needed to improve SKI operational and investment capacity.
     There are issues hindering implementation of EU Directives: Excessive standards. If Turkey’s
     drinking water standards are mostly consistent with those set by the DWD, its two wastewater
     standards1are more stringent than those of the UWWD, and are applied in an even stricter
     fashion. Areas labeled as “sensitive” appear to differ from the EU’s recommended linkage of
     sensitivity to eutrophication or to an actual and worsening environmental threat. A new draft
     by-law may harmonize standards to align them with those of the EU, but may augment the list
     of areas set as “sensitive areas”.
     Incremental costs of compliance. The report includes an analysis of the estimated costs of
     reaching compliance in three scenarios: (i) under UWWD standards; (ii) under Turkish standards
     for nutrient removal in sensitive areas; and (iii) under Turkish standards of scenario (ii) plus
     additional nitrogen removal for all cities above 50,000 people. For each scenario two options for
     “sensitive areas” are considered: (i) as currently defined; and (ii) as set in the draft new by-law.
     Resulting estimated costs of compliance range between 5.2 and 6.3 billion Euros for additional
     investments (4 billion Euros more if funded through debt) and 844 million to 1.4 billion Euros
     per year for related operation and maintenance (O&M), which represent between 116 and
     186 billion Euros considering O&M and amortization over the lifetime of the investment. The
     least-cost scenario on investments and O&M is to apply EU standards and current sensitive
     areas. These costs are only partial costs, focused only on wastewater. As publicly available data

and benchmarks did not allow including the cost of pumping stations, deep sea outfalls and
sludge treatment, transport and disposal, assumptions were made that estimated some of
these costs. Nevertheless, considering Turkish versus EU standards with the current “sensitive
areas” is estimated to cost 17 percent more in investments and 59 percent more in yearly O&M
costs. Applying EU standards with new “sensitive areas” would add costs of 15 percent more in
investments and 52 percent more in yearly O&M. Few SKIs can afford such additional costs.
Scattered responsibilities. The multiplicity of institutions with shared responsibilities for the
water sector, whether on resources management or WSS, and the overlapping of numerous
action plans and investment programs, limits Turkey’s efficiency in compliance and complicates
monitoring. It also hinders Turkey’s capacity to have a real vision of the “big picture” of sector
and progress.
Need for utilities to improve their operational and financial performance. Increasing
demographic and economic demand for water combined with resources reduction due to the
impact of climate change make NRW reduction a top priority. Better energy efficiency and capacity
building are also critical to operating wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and managing sludge
to meet discharge targets in a sustainable manner.
Insufficient publicly-available data on WSS utilities. There is currently no benchmarking system
for the provision of WSS services in Turkey. MoFWA/GDWM created one on NRW, but the
guideline document has proven insufficient to obtain reliable and comparable data, and it is not
in electronic form. This affects the capacity to effectively monitor utilities’ performance, to make
informed strategic decisions, and to improve the incentive framework to encourage efficiency and
financial sustainability. MoFWA/GDWM is providing training in order to improve reporting on
NRW.
These Issues can be Turned into Opportunities.
It is well known in the EU that, of all environmental directives, the UWWD is one of the most
expensive to comply with. As a basic measure (Annex VI part B) of the WFD, the implementation
of the UWWD has not yet generated the expected improvements of the “good ecological status”
in EU Member States. This represents an opportunity for Turkey to focus on the core principles of
the WFD, improve and apply water-related regulations accordingly, and then retrofit to the EU.
Other countries have obtained compliance, and their experience could benefit Turkey. Key
aspects to reach sustainability include (i) ensuring the efficiency of new investment, taking
into account the total cost for optimized O&M costs over the lifetime of the investments; (ii)
improving the efficiency and performance of existing infrastructure; and (iii) providing adapted
support to improve SKI creditworthiness.
Setting treatment standards based on expected environmental impacts rather than only on
effluents? Consistent with the WFD, a first question worth asking is whether investment decisions
and standards-setting should be determined on the basis of the expected impacts of the treated
wastewater discharges on the ecological status, taking into consideration its actual water quality,
its documented evolution, and its planned uses in the discharge area and downstream in the
river basin.
Setting “sensitive” and “less-sensitive” areas for impact? The designation limits and geographical
extent of “sensitive areas” determine wastewater treatment standards and costs, but will they
have the expected impacts? Is the assessment of “sensitivity” of receiving bodies adequately
based on reliable water quality monitoring and related to the actual economic impact of the
discharge?


                                                                                                       11
     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     The WFD links the sensitivity of the receiving environment mostly to its level of eutrophication.
     Does it make sense to require stringent and expensive nutrient removal technology in small
     cities in Turkey’s river basins when the pollution they generate is only minimal and presumably
     negligible in comparison to larger untreated point or non-point pollution sources?
     Implementing incrementally-phased approaches? There is strong evidence in support of phased
     approaches, with increasingly stringent requirements implemented over time, based on the
     extent to which prior actions actually contributed to the “good ecological status” of the receiving
     environment. Such phased approaches optimize environmental and sustainability objectives.
     Implemented both in space and time, they entail a holistic approach at the scale of the water
     body and river basin to respond to river basin objectives rather than applying fixed effluent
     standards at the scale of each urban area. They also allow for adapting the approach over time
     if the monitoring of the ecological status demonstrates that objectives are not being met. If EU
     members adopted this approach, why not Turkey?
     Utilizing Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM)? IUWM is widely recognized as a way
     to make decisions on water and wastewater management and reuse to optimize resources
     and funding through a holistic approach at the city level. IUWM utilizes a holistic, integrated,
     and sustainable management of increasingly scarce water resources at the scale of urban
     areas.2 It links infrastructure options to urban planning and considers the whole “water
     cycle” in the solution-seeking process. Questions worth analyzing in Turkey include: To what
     extent are utilities’ plans for infrastructure development integrated into urban plans? Is their
     implementation coordinated? Which incentives and mechanisms would make sense to facilitate
     IUWM approaches as urban centers develop plans to comply with EU Directives and ensure
     water security?

                                                                          Introduction
Background and Objectives

B     ackground. The Government of Turkey (GoT) and the World Bank have a long history of
      collaboration through project financing in the water supply and sanitation (WSS) sector.
      As part of this collaboration, and in order to inform a broader sector dialogue, the World
Bank secured a grant from the Water Partnership Program (WPP) to conduct an analytical work
entitled “Sustainable Urban Water and Wastewater Services in Turkey,” which is the basis for this
report.
Study and Report Objectives. The main objective of this report is to identify and analyze the main
issues faced by the WSS services in Turkey and to initiate a dialog with authorities on opportunities
to enhance the quality, sustainability (technical and financial), and affordability of service provision as
Turkey works to reach compliance with the European Union (EU) Drinking Water Directive (DWD) and
the Urban Wastewater Directive (UWWD) and with WSS related aspects of the EU Water Framework
Directive (WFD). This objective is also very consistent with Turkey’s focus on reaching the recently
established Sustainable Development Goals. The report identifies questions which were discussed at
a high level workshop and related inputs subsequently received.
Data limitations. Collecting and organizing the data necessary to perform in-depth analysis has proven
a challenge that could not be overcome in the timeframe of this study. The report therefore relies
solely on publicly available data and studies and on information collected through meetings with
Turkish counterparts and EU colleagues and disseminated or validated at the workshop.
Structure of the Report
This report is designed and written for high-level officials and authorities in central and local
governments. Chapter 1, which presents the sector’s main objectives, institutional arrangements,
and regulatory framework, is kept short, as these are well-known to the target audience of this
report.
Chapter 2 presents an overview of the technical and financial status of the WSS.
Chapter 3 compares the requirements of the EU Drinking Water and Urban Wastewater Directives
with Turkish regulations and presents a short overview of the current compliance levels.
Chapter 4 estimates the cost of reaching compliance with regulations related to wastewater
collection and treatment and service provisions in three scenarios: (i) under EU Urban Wastewater
Directive requirements; (ii) under Turkish standards for nutrient removal in sensitive areas; and
(iii) under Turkish standards of scenario 2, plus compulsory nitrogen removal treatment for
cities of more than 50,000 people. It estimates the costs and operation and maintenance (O&M)
requirements of existing infrastructure (per available data), incremental costs needed to comply
with the regulations in each scenario, and where data is available, the related impact on O&M
and tariffs for utilities.
Chapter 5 proposes questions worthy of further analysis which were discussed at a high-level
workshop.

                                    and Wastewater Services Managenment

1.1.	 A Long and Rich Experience


T
      he Turkish Republic has a long and rich experience in the water sector, starting from the 1926
      Water Law (No 831), which set the overall responsibility for water resources management
      at the state level. The Constitution of 1982 confirmed that all natural resources, including
water, are under the state’s trusteeship. The state owns the rights for exploring and operating
these natural resources. However, the state can transfer this right to private institutions for
a defined period. The state has supported water resources development while adopting
liberalization policies as part of the economic transformation program.
In the 1980s, population increases in cities, especially in İstanbul and Ankara, resulted in
depletion of available water sources followed by water shortages and serious sewage problems.
In response to these crises, in 1981 Turkey introduced a new model for water service provision,
piloted in İstanbul, by establishing a Water and Sewage Administration, called ISKI, that was
subordinated to the municipality as a public body but with an independent budget. The so-called
“ISKI Law” did not only result in autonomy of WSS services but also encouraged ISKI to finance
large-scale WSS investments through international loans under the Treasury Guarantee Scheme.
As it became clear that the sensible scale for the provision of WSS and other services in large urban
areas is the metropolitan area and not individual municipalities, in 1984 Turkey consolidated the
municipalities forming Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir into “Metropolitan Municipalities” (MM). In
1986, a decision was made to implement the ISKI Law in all MMs. Between 1986 and 1993,
the thirteen largest cities in the country were restructured in the same way3 and a General
Directorate for Water and Sewage Administration (SKI) was established in each of them to provide
WSS services within their provincial borders. In other municipalities, WSS services are provided
by different departments of the municipality. Special Provincial Administrations provide WSS
services in non-municipal areas.
In 2014, Turkey consolidated the municipalities forming the main metropolitan areas into MMs
and expanded ISKI Law to all 30 MMs, covering 77 percent of the population, or about 62
million people. “SKIs” are responsible for WSS services within MM borders, which correspond
to provincial borders. In smaller municipalities, different departments of each municipality
provide WSS services. Appendix A, “Maps and Population Breakdown,” shows a map of the 30
metropolitan municipalities in Turkey.
The accession process of the Turkish Republic to the EU became a major influence on the
development of the WSS regulatory framework as Turkey began to harmonize its legislation in
accordance with EU legislation, particularly the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which aims
at protecting and improving all types of European waters. The directive introduced an ecological
and integrated (holistic) approach in a number of areas, including: river basin planning;
programs of measures; strategies for elimination of pollution by dangerous substances (in a
related directive on priority substances); public information and consultation; and application
of economic incentives (cost recovery and adequate pricing). To be consistent with the WFD
principles of protection and control of water resources, both in quantitative and qualitative
terms, and in order to achieve “integrated water resources management,” Turkey identified 25

     hydrologic basins, defined “sensitive water bodies, urban sensitive areas and nitrate sensitive
     areas”, and completed twenty-five river basin protection action plans. (See Appendix A, “Maps
     and Population Breakdown”, for a map of river basins).
     1.2.	 Overview of Institutional Arrangements
     The roles and responsibilities of different ministries related to the water sector were reshuffled
     in 2011. As a result the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs (MoFWA) and the Ministry of
     Environment and Urbanization (MoEU) were established. At the central level, MoFWA and MoEU
     share most of the water sector mandates.
     The primary mandates of MoFWA in relation to water issues are to develop policies on protection
     of water resources and their sustainable use and to coordinate national water management.
     The General Directorate for Water Management (GDWM) is in charge of delivering on these
     mandates, particularly: (i) preparing River Basins Management Plans; (ii) identifying and
     monitoring urban sensitive areas and nitrate sensitive areas; and (iii) together with related
     agencies and ministries, identifying targets, principles and receiving body standards for surface
     and groundwater protection, and monitoring water quality or having it monitored.
     MoEU also has responsibilities regarding water governance, especially related to environmental
     protection and rehabilitation, and is charged with assessing and monitoring environmental
     impacts of projects and activities. As such, it determines treatment standards for wastewater
     treatment plants, issues discharge permits, and is in charge of monitoring performance of
     wastewater facilities. MoEU is also in charge, through its EU Investments Department, of
     preparing and implementing the operational program in accordance with the legislation, EU
     directives, and international agreements, in particular the financial agreement frameworks with
     the EU. As such, it sets projects’ priority levels.
     IlBank is the development and investment Bank of Turkey. It has a major influence on municipal
     investments, a large share of which is in WSS. It establishes the creditworthiness and therefore
     the acceptable debt level of all local governments in Turkey, provides loans (grants for small
     municipalities and local governments) and guarantees, channels funding from international
     finance institutions (IFI), and carries out all aspects of related due diligence.
     The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (GDSHW) also known as DSİ, is mandated to
     develop all water and land resources in Turkey. It also undertakes investments in the supply
     of potable and industrial water, and if required, invests in wastewater treatment plants for
     municipal settlements (Article 10 of the law No 1053 as revised in 2007).
     Because a number of ministries and institutions are involved in different aspects of water sector
     management, a Water Management Coordination Board was created in 2012. Its primary objective
     is to foster cooperation and coordination among all ministries, institutions, and organizations in
     accordance with a common strategy framework in order to increase potable water quality and
     quantity and to ensure the sustainability of water protection and usage balance. Water sector
     management and monitoring at the decentralized level is carried out by a Local Environment
     Board at the provincial level, and by the recently created Basin Management Committees.
     A General Directorate of Water and Wastewater Administration “SKI” is established in every
     metropolitan municipality to carry out the WSS in accordance with the provisions of Law No
     2560. SKIs are public entities that are affiliated with the metropolitan municipality and have
     an autonomous budget. According to Law No 2560, SKIs are also responsible for drainage and
     for ensuring protection of the water basins, even those located outside the boundaries of their
     service area. The governance structures of SKIs include a General Board, a Management Board,
     and auditors. The Metropolitan Municipality Council serves as the General Board of an SKI. Key
     responsibilities of the General Board include: (i) to decide on the five year investment plan; and
     (ii) to review and decide on annual investment programs.

2.1.	 A Quick Overview of WSS Services in Turkey
2.1.1. Water Supply almost Universal, with Uneven Performance


A
        ccess to water supply: According to TurkStat data - “Main Sector Indicators from 2006
        to 2014” (see Appendix B), for 2014, out of the 84 percent of the population living in
        municipalities, 97 percent had access to piped water supply, but only 58 percent were
served by a drinking water treatment plant. These ratios drop to 91 percent and 54 percent
respectively when considering the whole population, including rural non-municipal areas.
Considering that the rate of customer satisfaction with the water supply service was 79 percent
in 2012 and above 76 percent since 2009, it is assumed that the rest of the supplied water is
mostly in good enough condition, and therefore does not require complex treatment methods
and can be distributed after a simple disinfection. Turkey’s rate is slightly higher than the 90
percent access rate to piped water supply in EU member states in the Danube river basin.4 As
illustrated by Figure 2.1, from 2001 to 2014, when the population increased by 10 million people,
WSS utilities provided access to water to 20 million people.

     Quality and reliability of service provision. There is no centralized data collection system capturing
     information on continuity, reliability, or quality of water service provision in Turkey. However, TurkStat
     conducts surveys on population well-being, which determine, inter alia, the level of satisfaction of the
     people with the network water services they receive, and these can be used as a proxy. The results
     of the latest population well-being surveys carried out between 2004 and 2012 show that 79 percent
     of the customers expressed satisfaction with the water supply service in 2012. This is consistent
     with surveys in EU-member states from the Danube basin, where only Romania and Bulgaria, with
     roughly 70 percent and 60 percent respectively, show levels of satisfaction lower than this figure, and
     where only Slovenia and Austria with levels of satisfaction close to 95 percent, show higher levels.
     This is understood as anecdotal evidence of safety and reliability of the service provided, because
     no information on water quality was published (see Appendix B, Main Sector Indicators from 2006-
     2014.).
     Service performance including Non-Revenue Water (NRW). Service performance that includes
     NRW is not measured in the TurkStat survey. NRW is also not measured by most municipalities.
     In the “Main Sector Indicators table” presented in Appendix B, the term “water distribution”
     corresponds to the amount of water consumed by customers, or water sold. This is measured
     by water meters, which are believed to equip 95 percent of households. However, some
     municipalities also have some bulk consumers or supply the military for a lump sum without
     using metering. District metering and metering at reservoirs and water sources generally does
     not exist, except in the case of pumping.
     Assuming that all of the water distribution by municipal water supply networks is the total billed
     water and that the rest of water abstraction for the municipal water supply network is not billed,
     the NRW values can be calculated as the rate of “difference between water abstracted and
     distributed” to “water abstracted”. Calculating in this fashion results in an NRW decrease from
     60 percent in 2004 to 35 percent in 2014, which corresponds to almost halving the yearly water
     losses per capita, from 43.7 m3 in 2004 (3 billion m3) to 23.7 m3 in 2014. This, combined with the
     sharp increase of the population, demonstrates a significant effort to decrease physical losses,
     to disconnect illegal connections and unbilled authorized water, and to replace customer meters.
     This remains higher than the average in EU member states. Data from EU-member states in the
     Danube river basin show NRW levels consistently lower, in the order of 30 percent or less. Only
     Croatia, Romania (both with about 45 percent), and Bulgaria (with over 60 percent) have higher
     NRW levels. (See Figure 2.2).
     Nevertheless, water losses in Turkey represent about 1.84 billion m3 per year, which corresponds
     to the volume needed to supply the average water consumption of 133 l/day to 38 million
     people. As demand for water increases due to demographic and economic growth while available
     resources are decreasing due to the impacts of climate change, efficiency improvements such
     as NRW reduction appear to be of critical importance to guarantee adequate water resources
     and to improve the financial sustainability of WSS service provision. However, the optimal target
     level for NRW reduction depends on the specific case of each service provider, both in terms
     of availability of water resources and the costs of improving and maintaining water network
     efficiency. Yet, investing in performance improvement is a “no-regret” solution in most places in
     Turkey, and it is increasingly understood that the optimum is evolving to lower NRW as demands
     get closer to the water resources available.
     A MoFWA climate change models’ worst-case scenario estimated that water availability in Turkey
     could drop from the current yearly 112 billion m3 to around 50 billion m3 by 2100 5 or even below

40 billion m3 depending on the models. In the meantime, the cumulative water demand for
domestic, industrial, and irrigation uses is expected to increase from 43 billion m3 in 2015 to 54
billion m3 by 2020 and to 62 billion m3 by 2100. This means that the overall demand is expected
to exceed the water available before the end of the century. Models predict that the water
availability decrease is expected to be more severe in central provinces and provinces located
on the southern and western shores of Turkey. Obviously, the effort to improve water efficiency
should include irrigation and industrial water as well as domestic water supply.

     Per Capita water consumption. Although the water abstracted per capita has decreased from
     2006 to 2014, during the same period there was an eight percent increase in water consumption
     per capita6 from the distribution network, from 113 l/cap/day in 2006 to 133 l/cap/day in 2014
     (Table 2.1). This has been consistently increasing since 2006 and may therefore continue to
     increase in the future, putting additional pressure on the water resources and delivery systems.
     These levels are comparable to international standards. By means of comparison, consumption
     in EU member states from the Danube basin have been declining in recent years and are currently
     in the 100-150 l/cap/day range, with consumption in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary
     already below 100 l/cap/day.
     2.1.2. Sanitation and Wastewater Treatment: An Ongoing Effort
     Turkey has made significant efforts to increase wastewater collection and treatment in
     municipalities, which has resulted in making strong progress in wastewater indicators.
     Connection rates to wastewater services increased. In the “Main Wastewater Indicators for
     Municipalities” table (Table B.3) in Appendix B (“Main Sector Indicators for 2006-20014”), the
     “population served” indicates the connection rate. The analysis of this data shows a remarkable
     effort to increase wastewater collection and treatment in Turkey. Indeed, while municipal areas
     recorded a 14 million increase in population between 2006 and 2014, the connection rate in
     these service areas remained the same for water supply, connection rate to sewage networks
     increased from 87 percent in 2006 to 90 percent in 2014, and the municipal population served
     with wastewater treatment plants increased from 51 percent in 2006 to 68 percent in 2014
     (Figure 2.3). This means that between 2006 and 2014, while the Turkish population increased by
     7 million people, WSS municipal service extended sewer access to 14 million people and access
     to wastewater treatment to 20 million people. In other words, on a daily basis for the past eight
     years, Turkish water utilities connected an average of 4,800 people to a sewer and provided
     wastewater treatment to an additional 6,850 people.



     6	 Water consumption per capita figures are calculated by dividing the amount of water distributed through the municipal water supply network by the
        municipal population served by the water supply network.

These rates are comparable to that of EU-member countries in the Danube river basin, both for
connection and treatment rates. Connection rates in urban areas reach over 90 percent in most
countries, with only Bulgaria and Romania in the 80-90 percent range. Regarding treatment, the
rates range from a low of 28 percent in the case of Croatia to close to 95 percent in Austria, with
an average of 67 percent.
The latest life satisfaction survey results, used as a proxy for service performance, shows that
71.5 percent of customers were satisfied with their sanitation services in 2012.
Biogas digestion, sludge composting or reuse, and treated wastewater reuse remain anecdotal.
Few municipalities in Turkey have piloted biogas digestion, composting, and reuse, as was done
in Ankara, or treated wastewater reuse, as was done in Konya. The most common practice
seems to be to dispose of sludge in solid waste landfills or to incinerate them, but both are very
expensive solutions. Although possible, the use of sludge in agriculture is not a common practice
in Turkey, as it is in most EU countries. The impacts of climate changes on resources and energy
costs should encourage policies in favor of treated wastewater reuse and biodigestion wherever
it makes economic sense, because it serves both economic and environmental agendas. The EU
is working on a new directive aiming at encouraging treated wastewater reuse, Turkey could
benefit from increasing such practices.
2.1.3.	 Some Data on Tariffs and Sector Investments
Tariffs. There is no WSS sector regulator in Turkey. Water and wastewater tariffs set and charged
by municipalities in Turkey are not available as a whole, and they need to be checked separately
for each municipality or service provider. Each SKI applies different water and wastewater tariffs
depending on customer groups. Household rates can differ as well depending on the service area
and/or level of consumption. A discounted household tariff of up to 50 percent is applied under
the law to customers with disabilities and to customers having a martyr or veteran household
member. Customers located in a new service area of an SKI or a former rural area are charged
25 percent of the regular WSS household tariff. The household tariff rates applied by SKIs as
of the end of October 2016 are presented in Table 2.2 below showing the highest and lowest
household tariff rates per cubic meter. The highest total WSS tariff is shown in Denizli for the


                                                                                                                                                                21

     highest block above 251 m3 of consumption monthly, whereas the Mardin SKI provides this
     service to household customers at the lowest reduced tariff among listed SKIs. The relative tariff
     charged for water and for wastewater compared to the total tariff also varies from one SKI to
     another. Wastewater service represents 15 percent to 30 percent of the total tariff applied, with
     the highest being in Mardin at 50 percent.
     Noteworthy: In comparison, the EU reports an evolution of tariffs that breakdown in EU member
     states from a balanced (50/50 percent) status towards a 30 percent/70 percent breakdown in
     favor of wastewater. This means that complying with the UWWD should result in wastewater
     representing a higher share of the overall water tariff. This calls for a policy review of how tariffs
     are used as an incentive to achieve more water efficiency, consistent with the provisions of
     WFD’s article 9.

As observed in Appendix C, “Water and Wastewater Expenditures 2007 – 2013,” Table C.1 shows
that from 2007-2013 the total amount of public sector operational and capital investments was
35 billion Turkish Lira (TL). Of this amount, 79 percent (27.8 billion TL7) was invested in water
and wastewater services, with operational and capital municipal investments representing equal
shares, each being 14 billion TL. This demonstrates the high priority given to the sector, which
led to the improvements presented above. There is little information and data on investments in
water and wastewater financed by commercial loans or bilateral aid without a state guarantee.
While large SKIs may have mobilized such financing, they are expected to be very limited. To what
extent this situation could be related to a lack of interest from the banking sector, presumed
low creditworthiness levels of most utilities, or the terms and conditions proposed to them is
unknown.
2.1.4.	 The Financial Situation of most SKIs8 is Challenging
The final assessment of the financial health of a municipal utility or, in this case, SKIs, is based
on the indicators of total debt/total budget revenues, debt service/total budget revenues, and
operating budget surplus/deficit. In general practice – though this is not defined in Turkish law –
a municipal utility may be considered financially sound if its total debts do not exceed 60 percent
of its total budget revenues, if its total debt service (interest payments and debt repayments in a
given year) does not exceed 15 percent of total budget revenues, and if the municipality has an
operating surplus (its operating revenues exceed its operating costs).
Thus, the purpose of assessing SKIs’ finances and creditworthiness is to get a general impression
of their financial situation, to check whether they appear to be well managed and are reasonably
sound financially, and to determine whether SKIs have room to take on further investments.
2.1.4.1.	 Revenues and Expenditures of SKIs are Uneven
As Table 2.3 illustrates, ten SKIs had budget deficits in 2015, while twenty had budget surpluses,
some up to 89 percent. A closer look at the SKIs with a budget deficit reveals that most of them
are newly established SKIs which in 2014 took over all liabilities of the sub-province municipal
utilities into their balance sheet, and in 2015 continued with investments for rehabilitation of
existing infrastructure (mostly network) in the new service area. Also, some may not have been
very successful in billing and collecting revenues in their first year of operation as an SKI. Two
of the SKIs established in 2014, Kahramanmaraş and Malatya, have not made their 2015 annual
activity reports publicly available.
The structure of the budget expenditures shows that operational expenditures, such as salaries,
social security premiums, and purchases of goods and services, range in 2015 from 36 percent to
89 percent in SKIs established before 2014 and from 31 percent to 80 percent in SKIs established in
2014. However, the financial data available for SKIs is not detailed enough to be able to determine
whether the SKIs are running operating deficits. Some de facto capital expenditures (CAPEX)
may have been categorized under purchases of goods and services (operating expenditures).
The share of capital expenditures in the budgets of newly established SKIs is low (29 percent on
average), whereas it is 40 percent in other SKIs.
It should be also noted that the data available aggregates all lines of businesses in SKIs. It
therefore does not allow for distinguishing whether the accounts also include some expenditures
and revenues which are not directly linked to provision of urban water and wastewater services.
Some of the MM are active in the production and sale of bottled water and it is not clear in these
cases whether this financial information is also included in SKI’s account.

     The data presented in Table 2.3 enables the categorizing of the SKI in four main groups, based
     on the analysis of their financial health (working ratio and debt coverage ratio) and using NRW

     cost recovery. Table 2.4 presents the indicators and respective thresholds used for defining the
     groups.

Note: In activity reports of some of the SKIs, non-revenue water (NRW) assessment was only given for the service area before 2014,
although financial accounts cover the entire service area, as the process of compiling the technical records for the new service area
is ongoing. NRW was nevertheless used as a proxy for the efficiency of service provision, since it represents the standing point of the
SKI to improve and/or to apply similar efficiency to the entire service area.

Accordingly, 28 SKIs could be grouped as follows:
•	    Group 1 – Healthy SKIs (11): Ankara, Antalya, Eskişehir, İstanbul, İzmir, Kayseri, Kocaeli,
      Konya, Manisa, Mersin, and Tekirdağ. Among these SKIs Eskişehir, İstanbul and İzmir got full
      points for all indicators. It is also noteworthy that except for Manisa and Tekirdağ, all SKIs in
      this group were established before 2014.
•	    Group 2 – Moderately healthy SKIs (7): Adana, Bursa, Denizli, Diyarbakır, Muğla, Ordu, and
      Sakarya. Among these SKIs Denizli and Ordu SKIs are newly established SKIs.
•	    Group 3 – SKIs in difficult situations (3): Gaziantep, Samsun, and Trabzon. Among these SKIs,
      Trabzon is a new SKI, but Gaziantep and Samsun were established before 2014.
•	    Group 4 – SKIs in a critical situation (7): Aydın, Balıkesir, Erzurum, Hatay, Mardin, Şanlıurfa,
      and Van. Except for Erzurum, all these SKIs were established in 2014.
The publicly available data was not sufficient to classify the Kahramanmaraş and Malatya SKIs.
Noteworthy: Two-thirds of the SKIs (Groups 1 and 2) appear healthy enough to sustain
themselves. Although their creditworthiness levels would need to be carefully evaluated, they
may be able to support some of the additional investments and O&M costs expected of them.
The remaining ten (Groups 3 and 4) – eight of which are newly established SKIs - are in difficult
or critical situations. These SKIs require dedicated support to help improve their situation and
work towards cost recovery before they can support additional investments.
2.1.4.2.	 Liabilities of SKIs are High for Most
The payables of the SKIs can be divided into two groups: long-term liabilities (investment credits
- primarily from IlBank and/or other financial institutions) and short-term liabilities (taxes, social
security premiums, power bills, and so forth). As was presented earlier in Table 2.3, the data
on payables illustrates that the total debts of the majority of the SKIs exceed 100 percent of
budget revenues in 2015. These SKIs will not be able to support any major investment program
solely based on internally generated funds because it would add a new financial burden to the
repayment of their substantial existing debt.
In conclusion, the creditworthiness of more than half of the SKIs, mostly those established in
2014, is low: budget deficits are common, capital expenditures are low, and total debt as a
percentage of total revenues is in excess of commonly accepted limits. Thus, the SKI investments
are likely to be limited to minor replacement investments of existing assets and to some additional
operational expenditures, unless they improve their financial management.
2.1.4.3.	 Cost Recovery Tariffs and Affordability
The principle of cost recovery holds that the users of municipal services should pay the full cost
of service provision. Thus, a full cost recovery tariff should allow the utility to generate sufficient
revenues through sales to cover all costs associated with service delivery, including operation
and maintenance, debt repayment, and amortization of capital investments. In theory, the


                                                                                                                                          25

     capital investments of utility services are supposed to be financed from the depreciation of its
     fixed assets and from profit which represents a return on invested capital. In practice, however,
     the funds generated from depreciation and profits are often insufficient to finance the large
     investment needs of a municipality or municipal utility, and external sources of finance are often
     needed to undertake large investment programs. When a municipality or municipal utility uses a
     loan to finance its capital investments, the full cost recovery tariff should include a provision for
     debt service, including both payment of principal and interest. Additionally, to ensure capacity to
     pay, the tariff level should be set taking into consideration the affordability of the customers. In
     Turkey, the threshold used for calculation of the affordable tariff per cubic meter is 2.5 percent of
     the household income of the lowest quintile in the SKI service area (See Table 2.5). While social
     considerations motivating the affordable tariff are commendable, they introduce a pervasive
     incentive when such tariff represents the tariff charged to all domestic customers irrespective
     of their consumption and income levels. There are numerous international experiences of tariffs
     and mechanisms being set to guarantee affordability to the lowest quintiles, while at the same
     time maintaining proper demand management incentives and cost recovery capacity. Most
     international organizations, including the World Bank, recommend a threshold of 4 or 5 percent
     of household’s revenue.

Table 2.5 shows that only seven SKIs apply a tariff below the affordable WSS tariff and would
have a margin for a tariff increase to finance the new investment requirements, whereas the rest
of the SKIs would have to improve the efficiency of their operations to be able to finance further
investments and apply an improved tariff scheme to support the households of poorest quintile.
Noteworthy: Article 9 of the EU WFD recommends that the tariff be set to allow having a
transparent vision of the cost recovery level (preferably as high as possible, but giving some
room to the subsidiarity of Member States to integrate social considerations) and providing
adequate incentives. In this context, Member States have the flexibility to determine if they wish
to finance a portion of the costs (typically debt repayment and or amortization) through other
sources. Nevertheless, minimal financial sustainability of the utility requires revenues from
tariffs to cover at least the operating costs.

2.2.	 Some Issues Hinder the Implementation of EU Directives:
This section focuses on the primary sector issues which affect the implementation of the DWD
and UWWD. Additional analysis on all of these issues would need to be carried out in order to
propose actionable solutions, but this was not possible in the framework of this assignment.
Chapter 5 proposes areas for further analysis to consider in this regard. Key issues relating to EU
Directive implementation include:
2.2.1.	 Overlap and Conflicts in regulations, planning and institutions
2.2.1.1. Regulations: Two regulations in force, other standards applied in practice, all
more stringent than EU requirements
Wastewater treatment standards in Turkey are regulated by two by-laws, both of which are in
force: the By-law on Water Pollution Control; and the By-law on Urban Wastewater Treatment.
These by-laws set inconsistent treatment target requirements, which creates confusion. The
common practice has been to pick from each by-law the most stringent treatment target for
each parameter and to request municipalities to comply with the resulting and de facto new
treatment standard, which does not correspond to either of the regulations in force in Turkey.
(These regulations are compared in Chapter 3).
As a result, the wastewater treatment levels are planned according to standards higher than
those of both published regulations and much higher than those of the UWWD. This appears
to be linked to the designation in the regulation of many of the inland and coastal areas as
“sensitive areas” and the introduction of a notion of “potentially sensitive area”, which in
practice is considered as if it requires applying the treatment standards for “sensitive areas”.
The EU regulation makes a direct link between sensitivity of the receiving environment, and
either eutrophication or a rigorous analysis demonstrating the actual and specific sensitivity.
With these criteria, it would appear that very few, and only geographically selected areas, would
qualify as sensitive in Turkey, with the exception of the Black and Marmara Seas (see more on
this in Chapter 5), which have eutrophication issues and a few hotspots.
Although these conservative approaches can be perceived as putting Turkey on the safe side,
they have direct implications which may represent a much greater risk than is thought to be
achieved through perceived additional safety measures:
-	   Higher treatment requirements increase investment costs, have lasting consequences on
     O&M costs, and usually involve more complex treatment systems which require highly
     specialized capacities.
-	   If the capacity is not in place from the beginning and does not operate in the long run,
     the probability that the treatment system performs correctly becomes low, challenging the
     environmental objective.


                                                                                                      27
     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     -	   Critical costs are often omitted in the plans. Adding a nutrient removal treatment can drive
          the operating costs up by more than 40 percent, mostly related to the cost of electricity
          and chemicals. It also generates about 30 percent more sludge, which can become a big
          and costly problem to handle. Long-term costs of sludge transportation and disposal (for
          instance, landfills) are rarely quantified.
     These have been identified as key aspects worth addressing in the River Basins Management
     Plans, as it sets the basis for significant wastewater collection and treatment investments.
     Noteworthy: Experience from EU Member States shows that the UWWD is by far the costliest
     part of reaching compliance with the WFD. It is also the one for which actual environmental
     benefits and related contributions to the “good ecological status” principle of the WFD have
     been lower than anticipated and are, in places, insufficiently monitored. Consistent with the
     spirit of the Directives and the holistic approach they promote, treating first major sources, and
     taking into consideration the pollution dilution and absorption capacity of the sea for coastal
     cities, seems reasonable.
     2.2.1.2. Institutions: many deal with aspects of the sector, which has the big picture?
     Responsibilities for the water sector, whether in resources management or WSS, are shared
     among multiple ministries, departments, and agencies. Following the June 2011 government
     reshuffling, responsibility sharing between the main sectors ministries - MoFWA and MoEU -
     has often been either unclear or redundant. This was noted during the stages of design review,
     standards setting, investment financing, and investment approval. This leads to confusion,
     inefficiencies and delays. A few examples are presented below.
     With respect to water supply, GDSHW under MoFWA is responsible for supplying water from the
     source to the city, GDWM is responsible for determining the type of drinking water treatment
     plant needed, while IlBank under MoEU is responsible for making investments regarding the
     reservoirs and water distribution within the city. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health is responsible
     for analyzing and monitoring water quality at the tap, and the Ministry of Interior regulates the
     subscription of customers to access water and sewerage services. The service provider is left to
     struggle to get projects moving.
     A wastewater collection and treatment project requires the approval of the General Directorate
     for Environmental Management in MoEU and of MoFWA for the treatment plant. The level of
     treatment should be decided by MoEU, based on the sensitivity of the receiving body, and the
     sensitivity is determined by MoFWA. If funded through debt, IlBank would need to review and
     approve the design. The MoEU reviews and approves the Environmental Impacts Assessment
     (EIA) and issues the discharge permit for the treated wastewater, because it is responsible for
     the protection of environment; but it also is under the responsibility of MoFWA regarding the
     protection of surface and groundwater. Discharges are the responsibility of MoEU to monitor,
     while discharges into bathing waters also involve the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. In
     addition it should be also mentioned that:
     	 The General Directorate of EIA, which handles permitting and licensing under MoEU is also
        responsible for the operation of treatment facilities;
     	 The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock is responsible for water resources protection,
        wastewater discharges at fisheries locations, and implementing the Nitrate Directive;
     	 The Ministry of Culture and Tourism is responsible for all public tourism investments including
        environmental infrastructure in touristic cities;
     	 The General Directorate of Natural Resource Protection of the MoEU is also authorized to
        carry out and/or support local authorities for required projects and investments regarding the
        protection of these areas and for avoiding their pollution; and

                                                                                              Chapter 2




	 The General Directorate of Local Administration of the Ministry of Interior has responsibilities
   regarding the functioning of WSS service providers.
Having to deal with so many institutions in decision making on wastewater collection and/or
treatment investments makes it very challenging for utilities to get projects approved. It also
requires utilities to manage situations of contradicting conclusions or requirements among
institutions. This is likely to encourage overdesign in order to avoid having to go through the
process multiple times. This results in potentially detrimental consequences on the technical
and financial capacity to maintain the facilities in the long run, and can defeat the environmental
protection objective which motivated it in the first place.
Despite so many institutions involved, there is still a lack of an institution which has responsibility
for the “big picture” and can ensure that Turkey’s overall vision for the water sector is actually
being delivered for water management aspects, whether at the national level or at the level of
each river basin. There is neither a centralized benchmarking system collecting data on WSS
providers’ technical and financial performance, nor a clear economic regulation for quality and
sustainability of WSS service provision (technical and financial).
Establishing a clear institutional framework with clear roles and responsibilities is important
to ensure integrated planning and accountability in implementation. These are also key steps
for setting Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and Integrated Urban Water
Management (IUWM) approaches.
2.2.1.3. Planning: Numerous action plans and investment programs overlap
As a logical consequence of the multiplicity of institutions and the absence of an overall vision
for the sector, many of these institutions and agencies involved in the sector have developed
their own strategy, program, or plan to support WSS development. Documents, such as the 10th
Development Plan, the National Basin Management Strategy, Basin Protection Action Plans, the
National Climate Change Strategy, and the National Climate Change Action Plan, largely overlap.
Most of these propose funding for infrastructure development. Although they all promote
integrated approaches and share the broader sector objectives, each developed its own set of
criteria to allocate funding. Harmonization of approaches is warranted to avoid defeating the
stated purposes of the activities. The abundance of top-down plans contrasts with the relative
absence of planning at the local levels, both municipal and service provider, for WSS development
and management. There is a strong need to support the harmonization of such planning with
the priorities set through the river basin planning, and to ensure that their implementation is
integrated with other relevant local plans, to ensure integrated approaches at the local level as
well.
Through the Sustainable Cities Project, the World Bank and the EU (with Instrument for Pre-
Accession Assistance (IPA) II grant funding) are jointly providing support to Turkey in order to
assist selected metropolitan municipalities in developing critical local planning and integrated
approaches for infrastructure development and management. This is achieved through the
combination of technical assistance and investment funding for infrastructure development.
The project includes a sizeable technical assistance component that provides MMs and SKIs
with grant funding to prepare or update city or utility planning, to develop tariff and cost
recovery studies, and to provide training and capacity building, all critical elements for achieving
long-term technical and financial sustainability in the provision of services. The project also
encourages establishing mechanisms for improved coordination of project implementation
and for the integration of project-funded investments with urban development plans and other
infrastructure development projects. These are fundamental elements of efficient and integrated
project implementation, which are the core principles of IUWM approaches. Moreover, the
project is structured as a “series of project” model, which allows using the first project to inform
the preparation of others, and makes possible adding other MMs and SKIs as needs and priorities
evolve.

     2.2.2. Completing investments is a beginning, not an end
     Finishing the investment (that is, construction works) does not mean that desired objectives are
     achieved. In order to meet their objectives, the SKIs and/or Municipal Water Utility Departments
     (WUDs) must ensure that the facilities constructed are operated successfully. Normal practice
     requires careful and integrated project design, close supervision to ensure quality of construction
     works and monitoring equipment, embedding in construction contracts the training of staff who
     will use the facilities and equipment, and working during the construction phase to establish an
     inventory of assets and accordingly prepare its maintenance plan. Supply of equipment for water-
     leak detection, monitoring systems, computer-based supervisory control and data acquisition
     systems (SCADA systems), and preventive maintenance systems are often considered by WUDs
     as extra and luxury costs, and thus managers do not invest in them. As a result, new investments
     may not fulfill their objectives when problems of overdesign and lack of proper maintenance
     result in high operational costs. Close supervision during construction is also essential to ensure
     quality of works and to limit problems and breakdowns during operation. The SCADA systems
     and monitoring equipment allow better management of facilities and more effective operation.
     Many WUDs and some SKIs do not have proper as-built drawings for their water and wastewater
     network, and those who have them often only have hard copies. Lack of information about pipe
     material, diameter, depth, and so forth creates operational difficulties for WUD staff and hinders
     preventive maintenance and purchase of materials. When there is a problem, for example a pipe
     breakdown, WUD staff determines the pipe material, diameter, and depth only after excavating,
     which delays procurement until this technical information becomes known. This is likely to result
     in higher prices. WUDs would benefit by recording information gained during breakdowns or
     replacements of new pipelines in a digital database and by also recording technical knowledge
     from its staff, so that the information is not lost when experienced staff retire or leave. Such a
     digital database should be linked to digital maps, preferably through Geographic Information
     System (GIS) software, and should be continuously updated, and information made accessible.
     2.2.3. Monitoring & benchmarking invaluable regulation tools
     There is currently no benchmarking system for the provision of WSS services in Turkey that
     allows monitoring of the actual performance of the WSS facilities and of the services provided.
     Performance improvements can only be achieved when managers can rely on monitored,
     compiled, and available data obtained over time. Without proper information, planners
     and authorities cannot credibly assess whether objectives are adequate, investment plans
     are efficiently implemented, and expected results are actually achieved. These are critical to
     be able to evaluate sector policies and programs, and to keep people aware of the results
     achieved through additional tariffs and public funding investments. Without benchmarking,
     the comprehensive sector programs Turkey is implementing cannot be assessed and deviations
     cannot be corrected in time, which could translate into increased costs, lower sustainability, and
     missed opportunities.
     The GDWM of MoFWA initiated a benchmarking system, but it is not in digital form, and guideline
     documents proved insufficient for getting reliable and comparable data without workers having
     first received prior training. The by-law that requests municipalities’ WUDs and SKIs to report to
     MoFWA on a yearly basis on water losses, and to publish these reports on the Internet for one
     year, is a step in the right direction. However, designing a system requiring service providers
     to monitor and regularly report on key indicators of technical performance (for example, NRW
     and coverage) and financial performance (for example collection and cost recovery), and which
     makes the information available to the public (for example online), would create a friendly
     competition for good service and increase accountability of mayors and service providers to
     their constituents.

In addition, as indicated before, in Turkey there is no institution in charge of regulating,
monitoring, and reviewing the economic aspects of WSS service provision, such as structure and
tariff levels, standards and quality of services, and the performance of WSS service. A regulator
could manage a national benchmark system and issue best practices, guidelines, and procedures
to improve WSS services. This would contribute to improve the sector performance and increase
the homogeneity of service quality across the country.

2.3. Main Issues Affecting the Sustainability of Service
This section lists sector issues that have been identified as critical to the efficiency and long
term technical and financial sustainability of service provision. Although not directly related to
implementation of EU directives, these issues have an impact on the capacity of service providers
to reach and maintain the WFD’s key principles of GES, sustainability, and cost recovery.
2.3.1. Training and capacity building deserve immediate attention
While the importance of training and capacity building is well understood and acknowledged,
the establishment of a comprehensive program to build capacity of staff and institutions in the
long term management of WSS service provision is yet to be delivered. Some of the sixteen “old”
MMs and SKIs have developed their own training and capacity building activities. It could form
the basis for the preparation of a national program.
With the enforcement of Law No 6360, the “old” SKIs (Istanbul and Kocaeli excluded) and
the newly established ones have seen their service areas expand to reach the provincial
administrative boundaries. As a result, the utility of the major provincial municipality “absorbed”
all the other service providers which existed in the province. This means that the personnel,
assets, investments, liabilities, and receivables related to the provision of water, wastewater,
and solid waste disposal services carried out by the sub-provincial municipalities, the Special
Provincial Administration (SPA) and other service providers within the provincial boundaries,
were transferred to the metropolitan municipalities or its SKI (Transitory Article 1/8 of Law No
6360). Such a profound change requires adjustments to build the capacity of the SKI institutions
themselves. Specifically, it needs to consolidate technical information, customer databases,
and billing and collection systems, and then carry out the analysis necessary to understand the
realities of their situation as a service provider and to plan the reforms they need to implement
to improve technical and financial performance. These are prerequisites for developing a service
development plan and engaging in a tariff discussion with its shareholders.
2.3.2. Non-revenue water reduction is often an untapped resource
NRW levels in Turkey are estimated at 35 percent on average in 2014. Although technical information
gathered for all SKIs shows that NRW levels for SKIs in 2014 are close to the national average, with
38 percent on average, it varies greatly, from 12 percent in Malatya to 60 percent in Balikesir and
80 percent in Hatay. There are very few quantified and recent good practice examples of NRW
improvements in Turkey. Although the reduction of NRW from 54 percent in 2006 to 35 percent
in 2014 illustrate that a lot has been done, much more could be accomplished, not only to further
reduce NRW, but also to document good practices and to facilitate knowledge- and experience-
sharing among services providers for faster and more efficient NRW reduction.
The GDWM recently published the Regulation on Control of Water Losses in Drinking Water Supply
and Distribution Networks. This regulation imposes various responsibilities on utilities such as
digitizing the existing water systems and forming a GIS database, establishing monitoring systems,
establishing teams for determining physical losses, and requiring continuous measurement of water
input to the system at the sources and at certain points. It also sets targets for NRW in metropolitan
municipalities and province municipalities that have less than 30 percent losses within 5 years and


                                                                                                         31
     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     less than 25 percent losses within the following 4 years. Other municipalities need to reach the same
     target values within 9 years and the following 5 years, respectively.
     Consistent with the regulation on NRW reduction, the benefits of NRW reduction would certainly be
     an economic option for increasing water supply production in many places. A NRW reduction program,
     eventually considering performance-based contracts where it makes economic sense, is likely to
     compare favorably to the cost of expansion of water supply production in many places. Moreover,
     the impacts of climate change, which are increasingly affecting the availability and reliability of water
     resources, also are a reason to push for NRW reduction and an optimal use of water resources.

Chapter 3 - Comparison of EU and Turkish Regulations

3.1. Turkey Drinking Water Standards Slightly Lower than EU standards


E
      U standards for drinking water are set within EU Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of
      water intended for human consumption, and these standards were incorporated into
      Turkish legislation under Turkish law “Water intended for Human Consumption Regulation:
Official gazette 25730, published 17 February 2005”. The standards published in the Turkish Law
are the same as that of the EU directive except for three parameters (‘Bromates’, ‘Lead’, and
‘ Trihalomethanes’), which are included with more relaxed target values (see tables in Appendix
F – “EU and Turkish Drinking Water Standards”).
As a result, the drinking water standards in Turkey are very consistent with the standards of the
DWD. Although the difference in the three parameters for which treatment values differ would
have an impact in the treatment level and costs, it is not believed to be very significant relative
to the overall cost of investments or operation of facilities ensuring full compliance with the EU
Directive.
3.2. Turkey wastewater standards more stringent than EU’s
EU standards for urban wastewaters are defined in Directive 91/271/CEE on collection and
treatment of urban wastewaters. Turkey addressees urban wastewater treatment requirements
in two by-laws: the 2006 Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulation No. 26047, amended by the
2009 Urban Wastewater Treatment Regulation – Sensitive and Less Sensitive Areas Notification
No. 27271; and the 2008 Water Pollution Control Regulation No. 26786. Appendix F summarizes
and compares these standards with those of the EU UWWD.
Unlike in the case of drinking water, there are significant differences between the Turkish and EU
wastewater standards. The Turkish regulation is more stringent that the EU standards in terms
of:
   -	 Higher treatment standards for most parameters
   -	 Applicability of strict treatment standards to small settlements (less than 2,000)
   -	 Sensitive areas defined in places without environmental degradation or eutrophication
   -	 Application of discharge standards for fresh waters also to discharges into coastal waters
Moreover, discrepancies between the two regulations with regard to defining treatment
standards lead to a practice of applying both standards simultaneously and picking, for each
parameter, the most stringent requirement of each regulation. This results in applying a third
standard combining the most stringent parameters of both regulations, thereby de facto creating
a new regulation.
Furthermore, it is common practice in Turkey that the MoEU conditions the issuance of its
discharge permit to the addition of a Nitrogen removal treatment and the acquisition of the
land necessary for the construction of Phosphorus removal (should it be required at a later
stage). These requirement, albeit stricter than the published Turkish regulations, have therefore
become common practice in the design of wastewater treatment plants, even when discharging
in the Sea.
The combination of these with various standards applying to settlements based on its size makes
the resulting combination quite complex, as is illustrated in details in Tables F-1 through F-3 of
Appendix F – “EU and Turkish Drinking Water Standards”.


                                                                                                       33
     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     In general, the Turkish standards are higher than that of the EU on all parameters (except for
     BOD5 limits in non-sensitive areas), and they are applied in an even more stringent fashion. This
     results in much higher investments needed to meet these national standards than it would be
     for Turkey to just meet the UWWD standards.
     In a Technical Review Note dated 2009, the EU recommended that Turkey “harmonize its
     standards to UWWD standards in order to reduce the cost of investments and avoid investments
     in urban wastewaters that would generate little to no social or environmental benefit. If Turkey
     harmonized its standards to UWWD standards it would avoid the diversion of valuable funds away
     from other priority investments that would yield higher social and/or environmental benefits.”
     A new draft water law, under preparation since 2011, and new draft by-law may harmonize the
     Turkish standards and make them more compliant with UWWD standards. It would however also
     increase the list of areas determined as environmentally sensitive by Turkey.
     The UWWD distinguishes treated wastewater discharges into coastal waters, with more relaxed
     treatment standards, a distinction which Turkish regulation does not make.
     For discharges in coastal waters in less sensitive areas, the EU sets much lower treatment
     standards than for freshwater discharges because it takes into consideration the dilution and
     absorption capacity of the sea. It also applies relaxed standards to up to 150,000 population
     equivalent (PE), as opposed to 100,000 PE for discharges in fresh waters. These differences are
     significant for Turkey because the majority of the population is located in coastal areas, which
     makes a big difference in the cost of treatment.

  Chapter 4 - Cost of compliance with EU wastewater
                  collection and treatment standards


T
      his chapter presents the results of a cost-modeling exercise relying on data available to the
      team. It presents the methodologies, scenarios and key assumptions made, and the criteria
      and hypotheses used to estimate the costs. These results aim at providing information
on their magnitude of the costs of compliance with the EU requirements in Turkey and of the
incremental costs related to the current practices of application of treatment standards in
Turkey. It also analyzes the impacts of the estimated costs related to the 30 SKIs with respect to
their respective financial situations. The objective is to trigger a discussion on standard setting,
the related costs of investments and operations costs, and their impacts on the financial and
technical situations of the 30 SKIs.

4.1. Methodology and assumptions
The purpose of the modeling exercise was to estimate the investment and O&M costs of bringing
wastewater collection and treatment in Turkey into compliance with standards under different
scenarios. This section presents the methodology used to build the model and carry out the
cost-estimate calculations. Appendix E – “Detailed Methodology for Cost Calculations” - presents
more detailed and documented information about this methodology.

	 The 2014 population data was used to ensure consistency with use of financial information
   from published 2014 annual reports for the SKIs of metropolitan municipalities.
	 Wastewater networks and coverage data were taken from the River Basin Protection Action
   Plans (RBPAP). If plans do not include coverage data, it was assumed that no wastewater
   collection network exists.
	 Data on the existence and treatment level of wastewater treatment plants by municipality
   was derived from the draft By-law on Sensitive Water Bodies. If that data was not available,
   RBPAP data was used. If RBPAP had no data, it was assumed that the municipality did not
   have a wastewater treatment plant.
	 Data from the Communiqué on Sensitive and Less Sensitive Water Areas related to the By-
   law on Urban Wastewater Treatment informed option A for Sensitive areas in the model.
	 “Urban sensitive areas” defined in the draft by-law on Sensitive Water Bodies proposed by
   GDWM in May 2016 (pending approval) informed option B for Sensitive areas in the model.
	 A Google map was used to identify likely treated wastewater discharge sites for each
   municipality. This determined treatment levels required in option A Sensitive areas, using
   Appendix E tables.
	 A specific analysis was carried out for municipalities with populations of both less than
   10,000 and less than 2,000 to determine which municipalities of less than 2,000 people are
   likely to discharge into estuaries and which municipalities with a population of less than
   10,000 are likely to discharge into coastal waters. These are critical drivers to define level
   and costs of treatment.
	 Google maps was used to identify municipalities discharging into “sensitive areas”, in
   accordance with option A. For option B, the detailed list provided by the draft By-law was
   used, see Appendix E).

     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     	 Acknowledging that wastewater treatment levels are defined based on the size of urban areas
        and not on municipal administrative boundaries, the team analyzed which municipalities
        belong to a larger urban settlement and assigned them the name of a Metropolitan Area
        (MA). This concerned only municipalities consolidated into MMs as part of the March 2014
        reform.
     	 Population data for municipalities now belonging to MMs was adjusted by multiplying the
        urban population percentage from 2012 with the population figures in 2014. The treatment
        level required was determined according to the adjusted population estimate. See Appendix
        D – “Provincial Population Figures for Metropolitan Municipalities.”
     	 For municipalities outside MM borders, the population is concentrated in urban areas.
        Thus, the entire municipal population was used to determine the treatment levels in each
        scenario.
     	 The calculation was made on the basis of three main scenarios and two options for “sensitive
        area” (A or B), resulting in cost calculations in six different scenarios, described in Table 4.1.

	 The treatment level required for each scenario was decided based on the population of the
   metropolitan areas or municipalities, as relevant, and the sensitivity of the discharge location.
   In metropolitan municipalities, a correcting factor was introduced to account for the share of
   the population living in rural areas, so that only the population located in an urban area was
   considered in the determination of the treatment level and the collection and treatment costs.
	 To estimate the costs, the team compared three sets of benchmarks of unit costs. It decided to
   use the cost functions provided by the FEASIBLE9 model because they provide differentiated costs
   per treatment levels and costs for sewerage. See Appendix E for cost functions and assumptions
   details.
	 Tests performed on the benchmarks of unit costs concluded that the FEASIBLE cost functions
   resulted in higher costs than the costs experienced in Turkey. This is most likely due to their
   establishment on the basis of unit cost databases of early EU member states. The team therefore
   developed an adjustments coefficient based on a sample of contract data and recent feasibility
   studies for wastewater collection and treatment investments in Turkey.
	 Investment and O&M costs for urban centers were estimated after assessing the existing
   infrastructure to determine whether it met treatment level requirements for each scenario.
	 Sunken costs related to existing infrastructure were deducted to present only the incremental
   costs of reaching compliance with treatment or collection requirements in each scenario.
	 The estimated lifetime of the collection and treatment infrastructure was estimated at 30 years.
	 The costs of treated wastewater discharge (submarine outfall or discharge pipe) and of sludge
   management, transport, and disposal were estimated based on anecdotal evidence and the
   author’s calculation.
What was not assessed? The costs of pumping stations, decentralized or on-site sanitation in
rural areas, were not estimated. The cost of wastewater collection was not corrected based on
lower density of population in medium- and small-size cities. The costs and benefits related to
biogas digestion, where it makes sense, were also not estimated. The estimates did not include
the cost of debt and therefore worked under the assumption that the investments are self-
funded by SKIs. The scenarios did not take into consideration the population increase or phased
approaches in developing compliance and related timeframe at the scale of urban areas or per
river basins (holistic approach of the WFD). As a result the estimates represent only a portion of
the costs.

4.2. Results and Analysis
The existing wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure is estimated to have cost about
EUR8.7 billion to build, and the associated yearly O&M costs amounts to about EUR762 million.
Table 4.2 below presents incremental investments and O&M costs of wastewater infrastructure
needed to comply with the six scenarios described above. It provides the total investment cost of
additional infrastructure and the O&M costs of running the upgraded systems, considering both
wastewater collection networks and treatment plants. Scenario S1A standards (compliance with
UWWD) is used as the reference to compare incremental costs of reaching higher standards.

     As can be seen in Table 4.2, the scenario with the lowest incremental cost is S1A (compliance with
     UWWD with current sensitive areas), while the one with the highest cost is S3B. The difference
     of additional investments required between S1A and S2A is low (4 percent). This means that the
     impact of applying EU or TR legislation is limited if the regulation is applied as published with the
     current sensitive areas. It is however much higher (17 percent) for S3A, which goes beyond EU
     requirements and treats all cities above 50,000 PE at a level close to that of a sensitive area. The
     impact is significantly higher on O&M costs, which are 59 percent higher under S3A compared to
     S1A. The treatment standard is therefore a major driver of increased costs, with relative impacts
     on construction costs, but with a much greater and lasting impact due to increased O&M costs.
     Similarly, the impacts related to the proposed change of sensitive areas on additional investment
     costs are moderate, with increases of 15 percent for scenario S1, 13 percent for S2, and 4 percent
     for S3. They are significantly larger for incremental O&M, namely 52 percent for S1B compared
     to S1A, 50 percent for S2B compared to S2A, and 11 percent for S3B compared to S3A. The
     smaller difference for scenario 3 means that requesting nitrogen removal for settlements with a
     population of more than 50,000 minimizes the change in the number of sensitive areas, because
     the way the Turkish regulation is applied (S3) on a de facto basis sets the standards very close to
     that of sensitive areas in most urban areas. It is important to note that the impact on additional
     investments is comparatively much lower than the associated impact on yearly incremental
     O&M.
     The Iceberg effect: the importance of considering the total cost
     It is common knowledge that investments generally capture more attention. They are usually
     implemented as part of large and visible programs, often with concessional loans or grants, and
     are procured on the basis of the lowest cost of construction, without consideration of O&M costs.
     Yet, whether the utility will be able to sustain the additional investments over time depends
     on its capacity to recover the O&M costs during the useful life of the investments, and their
     cumulated amount is allegedly greatly superior to that of the investment cost. This has direct
     impacts on the tariff levels that will need to be charged to customers and has consequences in
     terms of political and social sensitivities, which in essence drive decision-making. The paradox,
     illustrated by the image of the iceberg, is that infrastructure development decisions are made
     on the basis of the cost of investments alone (the top of the iceberg), while the cumulated O&M
     costs (the part of the iceberg which is under water) is usually not considered in the decision-
     making process, although it represents a much greater share of the total cost of investment.

Further analysis of the data available was performed to quantify cumulated O&M costs,
amortization costs, and the cost of debt (using IlBank loan terms). Table 4.3 shows the results
for scenarios S1A and S3A It documents that the additional EUR900 million in investments costs
needed to reach the standards applied in Turkey (S3A) translates into an additional EUR56
billion in O&M over the lifetime of the investment. (See Appendix G – “Results of Cost Estimates
and Tariff Impacts” – for the results in all scenarios. Appendix H describes the “Results of Cost
Estimates in River Basins and Financial Impacts per Person”).

The analysis also allows quantifying the “iceberg effect”.
The cumulated O&M of the required investments
represents over 18 times the cost of investments for
scenario S1A. The ratio reaches 25 times for scenario S3A.
While the additional investment cost represents EUR5.2
billion, the related incremental O&M costs over the lifetime
of the investment represents EUR95 billion. Considering
amortization and the cost of debt (IlBank loan terms), the
total cost reaches EUR120 billion, of which the additional
investment represents only 4.2 percent for scenario S1A.
For scenario S3A, the total cost reaches EUR180 billion
of which the additional investment represents only 3.5
percent. This means that the total cost of reaching Turkish
standards would cost EUR60 billion (50 percent) more
than just complying with EU requirements, which affects
sustainability and tariff levels by just as much.
Table 4.4 presents the distribution of the total additional investments and O&M per category
of service provider. Results in Table 4.2 show that the costs distribution between metropolitan
municipalities and other settlements do not follow the same pattern as the population
distribution (77 percent for MMs).

     Appendix G presents additional data and analysis, including incremental costs and their financial
     impact per capita for each scenario, disaggregated by category of service provider, by MM or SKI,
     and by river basin. The results are presented in table and graphs format.
     The disaggregated analysis shows that:
            -	 Additional investment requirements per capita are comparatively lower in SKI service
            areas than for other service providers, which presumably makes the challenges of service
            extension and sustainability much more difficult for those other non-SKI service providers
            which are not structured as a utility with autonomous budget and management;
            -	 The additional investments and O&M costs vary greatly between service providers and
            amongst SKIs. The incremental investments are the highest in Istanbul and Şanlıurfa MM, and
            the lowest in Kayseri (see Table G.1 in Appendix G for details);
            -	 The incremental costs per river basin vary widely, from EUR15 million in Burdur River
            Basin to EUR1.9 billion in the Marmara River Basin, as do the related costs per capita that
            range from EUR3 or 4 per capita in the Kucuk, Menderes, Sakarya, Seyhan, and Antalya river
            basins to EUR79 in the Van Golu river basin.


     4.3. Financial implication of SKIs’ balance sheets
     This section analyzes the impacts of incremental costs required to comply with scenarios S1A
     and S3A on SKIs’ financial situations, using the following assumptions:10
     •	             The revenues and costs are assumed to remain at their 2015 levels.11
     •	             Incremental investments under each scenario are funded by IlBank credits with current
                    conditions, namely a repayment period of 15 years and a 7 percent interest rate per annum.12

•	     The liabilities related to the required investments are added to the total liabilities as reported
       in the SKI balance sheet for 2015 and are compared to 2015 revenues.
•	     The impact analysis on annual result of SKIs includes the amortization of assets and yearly
       incremental O&M costs in addition to the 2015 costs as a benchmark of upcoming burden
       of these investments on SKIs financial situation.13

     Table 4.5 reveals that the SKIs which are already facing a budget deficit will have to cover a much
     higher deficit if the investment scenarios are implemented. For the SKIs which had a modest
     budget surplus (4 to 20 percent), new investments and related O&M costs are likely to generate
     a deficit, depending on the selected scenario. Although the budget could be balanced with an
     improved revenue policy, the debt ratios of these SKIs are already too high to allow further debts.
     The SKIs, which have a budget surplus of 20 percent or more, on the other hand, are able to
     cover additional O&M and operate with a budget surplus in all scenarios. However, their debt
     ratios, and thus their capacity to absorb additional investments, vary due to their current high
     liabilities levels.
     Considering all parameters, only the largest SKIs of Antalya, Izmir, and Ordu appear to be able
     to carry out additional investments without major consequences on their finances. Moreover,
     if one adds the existing total liabilities of these SKIs to the new debt burden of the scenario
     investments, almost none of these SKIs could implement such investments, regardless of the
     scenario. The cases of Balikesir and Hatay, which showed the highest NRW levels, noticeably
     stand out as particularly unable to absorb the required investments in their current situation.
     4.3.1. Cost Recovery Tariffs, Affordability
     Cost recovery and affordable tariffs are essential for the sustainability of an SKI, because it
     directly affects its ability to make and sustain new investments. While Turkey’s sector policy
     with respect to standard setting will determine the incremental investment and O&M costs, its
     policy with respect to infrastructure financing and tariff setting will influence the capacity of SKIs
     and other utilities to bear all or a share of these costs, while keeping the tariff in keeping with
     affordability levels.
     Appendix G shows to what extent SKIs could transfer the incremental costs on household tariffs,
     as households represent the greatest highest share of the water consumed and wastewater
     generated.

     4.4. Implementation Challenges of the 2014 SKI reform
     In March 2014, the government implemented the consolidation of municipalities into MM in
     provinces with a population or 750,000 people of more. As part of this process, the different
     water utilities within each MM have been aggregated and merged into the larger municipality,
     consistent with the model initially developed in Istanbul and later extended to Ankara and other
     provinces. All SKIs, except Istanbul and Kocaeli, have therefore taken responsibility for a large
     number of additional systems. Many of them did not have the same level of infrastructure,
     maintenance, and capacity as they had previously, and in some cases there were important
     differences among them.
     The purpose of this reform was to take advantage of the capacity of the SKI operating in the larger
     municipality to expand capacity, infrastructure quality, and operations of the smaller ones, in an
     effort to bridge the gap of service provision and quality among them. Although this objective was
     in line with logical sector development objectives, the reform put a large additional responsibility
     onto the larger utilities of each province, which in effect formed the core of the newly created
     SKIs. In terms of scale, the smaller municipalities that were aggregated and merged into the
     larger SKI represent about 19.8 million people, of which about 14.1 million live in urban centers.
     In comparison, larger municipalities have a total population of 40.1 million, of which 35.2 live
     in the urban center. In their new aggregated form, SKIs have to serve about 50 percent more
     people. Although 41 percent of the people are in urban areas, the additional population is spread
     out over a much larger area than the service area that the SKIs were previously managing. This
     introduced tremendous technical, financial, and managerial challenges.

There is little information available that allows assessing the scope of these additional demands
and the challenges facing the newly formed SKIs, which makes it difficult to precisely assess
the issue. Using the assessment of existing infrastructure, an attempt was made to quantify
the investments needed to update and expand the wastewater collection and treatment
infrastructure to bring all municipalities into compliance with the adopted norms, and the
related O&M costs. As an example, for the scenario S1A, the total investment needed to
upgrade existing wastewater management infrastructure in these smaller systems is estimated
to be EUR4.3 billion, with a total O&M cost of about EUR390 million per year. This represents
EUR306 per capita for investment and EUR28 per capita per year for O&M. In comparison, the
average cost of coming into compliance with scenario S1A for the population served by an SKI
represents EUR85 per capita for investments (3.6 times less) and EUR13.6 per capita per year for
O&M (50 percent).
This represents a total cost of about EUR14 billion over a 25 year period just for wastewater
management. If we add to these figures the required additional investments and O&M that will
be also necessary to upgrade water supply systems, reduce NRW, and pay for the increased costs
of managing and ensuring the sustainability of a much larger system, the challenges faced by the
newly created SKIs are without doubt very significant.
The decision to charge newly consolidated areas a lower tariff, sometimes 50 percent lower than
was charged in the pre-2014 SKI service area, generates an additional stress on the balance sheet
of the SKIs. Indeed, it reduces their revenues from areas which are likely to cost comparatively
more to manage (expected lower density of customers, network length per customer and
therefore NRW per km of network likely to be higher, and so forth). In short, the result was more
investment and O&M, more management costs, a staff spread thinner, and less revenue.
It is therefore critical to guarantee efficient investments and efficiency in the operation of these
utilities so that the benefits of synergies and scale derived from consolidation can be better used
and applied. It is also critical to put in place mechanisms to support the transition with concrete
measures to avoid a loss of service sustainability by the utility in the process.
Conclusion: The cost assessment of the proposed scenario and its analysis in the context of
the technical and financial situation of each of the 30 SKIs is proving a powerful tool to initiate
a discussion within the government, and with the metropolitan municipalities and the SKIs,
on many fundamental aspects of utility management, service provision, and capacity and
performance improvement. It also is fostering a comparative analysis of capital expenditures
(CAPEX versus O&M costs during the useful life of the infrastructure. The public private
partnership (PPP) approach promoted by Turkey appears to be an interesting avenue to explore
as its combines optimizing CAPEX and O&M costs, capacity performance and sustainability
improvements, and leveraging private sector financing, so that additional costs could be offset
by resulting improvement in performance.

      Chapter 5 - Sector issues can turn into opportunities
        for Turkey - Questions for discussion and areas for
                                            further analysis
     5.1. Why Questions for Discussion?


     T
            he ultimate objective of this work is to contribute to Turkey’s efforts to make the country’s
            actions on water infrastructure and environmental protection consistent with the WFD,
            (which is also consistent with its overall goal of meeting the SDGs), especially on aspects
     related to potable water and sanitation. This EU directive has been a driving force for the EU water
     legislation around the key principle that all EU water-related directives should be coordinated
     to contribute to the goal of reaching EU “good ecological status” in each river basin, a principle
     to which Turkey adheres. Adopting a single system of water management at the river basin level
     and achieving “good” status in all waters within a given timeline are also keystones of this spirit.
     Previous chapters analyzed the institutional setting currently in place in Turkey to address this
     challenge and the differences between the Turkish and EU regulations that determine the actions
     needed and their costs. The report has shown the relative impact on costs and affordability of
     applying one set of regulations or another, as modeled by the scenarios (see Appendix G for
     detailed results). Moreover, with respect to MMs,15 the report evaluated and quantified potential
     financial impacts of the required investments in each scenario on SKIs, now provincial utilities,
     and on other operators country-wide. Yet, a number of areas could be further analyzed.
     The analysis has also shown that, in the process of implementing the aspects of the WFD dealing
     with WSS (DWD and more importantly UWWD) and assessing the relative contribution they
     make to reaching the “good ecological status” of the environment, Turkey has the opportunity
     to further develop the “spirit” of these directives and thus expand and improve water related
     regulations and directives.16 This chapter also identifies areas that could expand the initial scope
     of the assessment, and thus contribute to Turkey’s effort to reach the “Good Ecological Status”
     for each river basin efficiently and in a sustainable manner. Box 5.1 lists a number of potential
     areas where WFD implementation could be improved.

     5.2. Which Criteria for Actions?
     In previous chapters, where the regulations have been compared and scenarios for action have
     been analyzed, two points come out clearly: (i) investment decisions are based on effluent
     standards/treatment options; and (ii), the criteria for selection takes into consideration individual
     requirements of particular urban areas on the basis of their population, with more or less
     stringent requirements depending on whether the area where treated wastewater is discharged
     is considered “sensitive” or “less sensitive.” Consistent with the spirit of the WFD, sanitation
     is important and the improvements it brings have to be documented. Thus, initial questions
     worth asking include: whether investment decisions should take into consideration the actual
     ecological status and water quality in rivers, lakes, or shores receiving the treated wastewater;
     to what extent the ecological status, water quality objectives, and planned uses in the treated
     wastewater discharge area would be or are impacted by such discharges in the corresponding
     river basin; and which monitoring system should be put in place to adequately measure the
     environmental benefits achieved.

     15	 Available financial data is only limited to these utilities, thus limiting the scope of this analysis.
     16	 One example could be incorporating into water-related regulations the recommendations contained in the EU guidance on water scarcity and
         drought allocation, which is left to Member States to regulate on, consistent with the principle of subsidiarity. (This principle of subsidiarity
         becomes a difficult issue since according to the EU treaty all quantitative issues have to be agreed to unanimously by the all Member States, and
         is also a reason why the WFD is not strong on quantitative issues).

With regard to criteria for setting “sensitive” and “less-sensitive” areas, a related immediate
question refers to the current way sensitive areas are selected and their geographical extent
and borders are set: is the assessment of “sensitivity” of the receiving bodies, which determines
wastewater treatment standards, related to a rigorous assessment and monitoring of water
quality over time and to the actual economic impact of the pollution discharged?
The EU directive links the sensitivity of the receiving environment mostly to its level of
eutrophication. The Aegean and Mediterranean Seas are not eutrophic, except in very specific
and identified areas, even when most wastewaters were discharged without treatment. Does
it make economic and environmental sense to impose nutrient removal on most of Turkey’s
coastline along those seas?
The Marmara and Black Seas have eutrophication problems, but are all the rivers and lakes of
Turkey’s river basin discharging into these seas eutrophic or polluted? Are the main sources of
pollution identified, the related pollution known, and their corresponding impact quantified?
Is it clear and documented that the pollution leading to eutrophication is primarily attributable
to point sources (municipal wastewater, industrial wastewater) versus non-point sources
(agricultural run-off, large river inputs)? What is the comparative impact of agricultural and
industrial sources of pollution in comparison to municipal contributions? In light of these
questions, to what extent does it make economic and environmental sense to require small
communities to install and sustain complex and expensive nutrient removal technology when
the pollution that is generated is presumably negligible in comparison to larger pollution sources
which remain untreated, and that even when the pollution is treated, it will most probably
remain minimal at the scale of the river basins?
Often the definition of sensitive areas is too broad, resulting in the generation of additional
investments and operations costs. Interestingly enough, the WFD foresees this issue.17 It
states the following: “Uses or objectives for which water is protected apply in specific areas,
not everywhere. Therefore, the obvious way to incorporate them is to designate specific
protection zones within the river basin, which must meet these different objectives. The overall
objectives planning for the river basin will define minimal ecological and chemical protection
requirements everywhere, but where more stringent requirements are needed for particular
uses, zones will be established and higher objectives set within them.” One way to do this is to
take into consideration differences among regions in terms, inter alia, of challenges, demands,
environmental constraints, environmental capacity,18 and potential for economic development
by sectors.19 Turkey is a large country with noticeable differences among its regions, thus the
approach could not be the same everywhere.
5.3. Opportunities related to Institutional Issues
Earlier chapters underlined issues of duplication and competency and different interpretations
of regulations and requirements. This section identifies possible improvements to increase the
efficiency of the actions Turkey undertakes to achieve the “good ecological status” of its waters.
Focusing on investments rather than on operations costs can jeopardize the long-term
sustainability of operations. It is clear that the actions contributing to achieve the “good ecological
status” in all river basins need to be part of an integrated plan which looks at the investments,
but also which considers modernizing the institutions responsible for implementing such plan,
as well as the utilities responsible for operating the new wastewater infrastructure, so as to
increase efficiency. Turkey has made significant improvements in this respect in recent years,


17	 http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/info/intro_en.htm
18	 Environmental capacity is a term developed and used as part of the Mediterranean Action Plan to define the capacity a certain area has to receive
    degradable pollutants without losing its good ecological status
19	 Another important step in this direction could be the use of the economic analysis of pollution, measured as the reduction of beneficial uses. In
    other words, could the uses assigned to a river basin district, or a particular area within it, be used to assess the need and justification for water
    pollution control investments?

                                                                                                                                                             45

     particularly with the creation of provincial utilities for the major 30 metropolitan areas and the
     municipalities that form their respective province. Nonetheless, further reform could be carried
     out to provide more incentives for the provincial utilities to operate more efficiently and ensure
     sustainability of infrastructure and associated environmental benefits. Bringing about proper
     management responsibilities, particularly in terms of WWTP design, financing, and operation
     decisions, is the logical next step for all of the new utilities under the SKI model.
     Incorporating proper project design and contractual incentives are keys for reaching the
     economic optimum for the utility over the infrastructure’s useful life and for ensuring that its
     operation does not represent a challenge for SKI staff. It is therefore important to assess whether
     management and technical capacities are consistent with the complexity of the proposed designs
     and whether a utilities’ staff is provided with adequate training on how to run the facilities. How
     should the utility’s capacity (or limitation thereof) be weighed in the decision process of setting
     treatment requirements, contractual arrangements, or deciding on a phased approach? Are
     proposed designs, standardized or not, adapted enough to the local context, in terms of phased
     investments opportunity, embedding capacity building in works contracts, sludge management
     options, and energy efficiency potential?
     Which institutional arrangements are best suited to develop large-scale infrastructure or ensure
     quality operation for long-term technical and financial sustainability? Turkey announced a large
     PPP program on water and sanitation, but which arrangements would make sense and where?
     How do one put in place an efficient incentives framework and ensure a proper balance between
     public and private interests? How do one empower basin committees and authorities to undertake
     key investments, in, for instance, bulk water supply, wastewater planning, management, and
     financing? Would it make sense to consider in Turkey a system similar to the one used in EU
     countries like Spain whereby municipalities can delegate a large part of the management and
     responsibility for wastewater treatment infrastructure to the river basin authorities, recognizing
     the public and regional nature of their function (benefits are received often by those who do not
     generate the effluent, and impacts have a regional scope)?
     All these questions relate directly to the spirit of the WFD. They are known by sector specialists
     and most authorities with responsibilities over the sector, and so are the benefits and added
     sustainability they could represent. The challenge is to identify what the constraints are that
     prevent investments from being applied and to determine how to develop the right set of
     incentives in the action plans to promote reforms. Turkey could not only benefit, but also make
     a substantial contribution to improving EU directives by incorporating these principles in the
     next phases of its actions in this field.

     5.4. Questions on Sanitation Technical Solutions
     The science and practice of wastewater treatment has advanced significantly in recent years.
     Technology has contributed to this advance by providing better monitoring and management
     tools, and the science behind treatment processes has also improved considerably. Several of
     these advances could have direct impact on the implementation of the WFD in Turkey.
     Sanitation in Tourist Areas. Touristic areas represent an important case on their own for two
     main reasons: (i) the direct link between the uses that make such areas viable and so important
     from an economic point of view and the ecological status of rivers and coastal waters; (ii) the
     seasonality of the flows and demands, which exert significantly larger peak demands in limited
     periods of the year, when local permanent population figures increase due to the influx of
     tourists.

   Box 5.1: Other Potential Areas where WFD Implementation could be Improved
   Other set of questions could also be put forward on aspects that could benefit Turkey’s actions
   to improve its water’s quality and achieve good ecological status, which are also consistent with
   related EU directives. The most important among these are:
   •	   Are holistic river basin districts approaches, such as grouping treatment plants for economies
        of scale or setting treatment priorities (and requirements) on the basis of water quality
        modeling at the river basin district level, being analyzed?
   •	   Which are the criteria for decision-making, particularly in setting priority among different
        investments in the same river basin district?
   •	   Are design alternatives analyzed and are public stakeholders’ consultations sufficient?
   •	   Is performance monitoring of existing infrastructure or utility performance adequate?
   •	   Are climate smart investments (NRW reduction, biogas generation, composting, reuse, energy
        efficiency improvement, and micro-hydroelectricity) adequately considered?
   	    What are the constraints or minimal scale for such investments to make sense?
   •	   Are centralized versus decentralized approaches for wastewater collection and treatment
        systematically analyzed? Is the new organizational structure which gives SKI utilities the overall
        responsibility over both urban and rural areas of a province effectively conducive to integrate
        piped and on-site sanitation approaches?
   •	   Is the potential for treated wastewater reuse and the seasonality of demand by irrigation
        considered in the decision process? Is reuse properly considered in tourist areas, where
        water demand peaks (as well as wastewater flows) in the periods of lowest availability of the
        resources?


Several EU countries (for instance Croatia) adopted a gradual approach to address the urgency
of securing the “good ecological status” of their inland waters and coastal waters (EU marine
strategy). The key element of this approach consists of reserving land for upper levels of
treatment that the directives could require, but designing and implementing the wastewater
management system in phases. The objective is to adapt the wastewater treatment option based
on demographic and economic growth, and seasonal variations, by using modular solutions
allowing winter flows to be treated by a dedicated treatment, to limit fixed costs, and introduce
re-use as much as possible.
Turkey could follow a similar approach. It could even incorporate a next step that could, in line with
what has been underlined before, adopt discharge options and treatment requirement adapted
to the different sensitivity of the different areas of the receiving environment, recognizing that
“uses or objectives for which water is protected apply in specific areas, not everywhere.”
It could, for instance, adopt different “sensitivity” levels for different parts of the same coastal
area, designating as “sensitive” the first nautical mile from the shoreline, and “less-sensitive”
areas beyond that line. Therefore different treatment standards would be required for WWTPs
which discharge treated wastewater within this limit and for WWTPs discharging further away
from the shore (less stringent), as long as good dispersion is guaranteed through properly
designed and constructed discharge systems and no other specific uses are present. This could
greatly reduce costs without jeopardizing the achievement of the desired ecological status.
Complementing this approach with state-of-the-art modeling and monitoring to guarantee that
quality objectives are achieved and maintained (and taking additional steps if they are not),
such phased approach could have a significant impact on costs and sustainability, while ensuring
compliance with the “spirit” and objectives of the EU directives.

     5.5. Financing and Management Options for Service Delivery Improvement
     The traditional approach for building new wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is to use
     standard construction contracts and to transfer the plant, once commissioned, to the utility to
     operate. This approach has several shortcomings:
     −	   Tendering is usually based on the lowest construction cost. In practice capital expenditures
          (CAPEX) represent only about one-third of the life cycle cost (LCC) of a WWTP. The other
          two-thirds correspond to the cumulated O&M costs (without amortization). While projected
          O&M costs based on various technical options are usually analyzed during design, there are
          no real incentives to minimize them. Therefore, selecting bidders based on lowest CAPEX
          cost without considering the LLC may not lead to the optimal economic choice for the utility.
     −	   Standard construction contracts are often subject to construction delays and cost overruns,
          which are usually borne by the contracting public agency. The actual CAPEX ends up being
          much higher than planned and environmental benefits materialize later because of delays.
     −	   The utility which takes over the plant may not have the capacity to operate it efficiently
          (especially for cost-saving technologies such as cogeneration). It may not have included the
          training of its staff in the construction contract and there is no guarantee that it will be able
          to set aside sufficient funds to properly carry out O&M over the plant’s useful life.
     While managing these shortcomings can very well be done in the context of a publicly managed
     utility, international experience shows that, in addition to technical capacity and expertise,
     it requires strong leadership by the utility senior management, continuous support from the
     municipality and central government to the utility management to mature and implement such
     reforms, and significant time to implement reforms. Experience shows that such reforms usually
     take a long time to translate into measurable results, and that ensuring that these factors will all
     be met is usually a major challenge.
     In an attempt to mitigate these shortcomings, many countries around the world have relied
     on a combination of public utility management and partnering with the private sector through
     “design, build and operate (DBO) and “build, operate, and transfer” (BOT) approaches for the
     development of new WWTPs, in areas where it makes sense from a practical and economic
     viewpoint. Under these approaches, the private sector is contracted under a turnkey contract
     to build and operate the new plant (usually for 20 to 30 years), with a contractual commitment
     to deliver treated wastewater according to a fixed standard, and where payment is based on a
     tariff per m3 of treated wastewater. Under a BOT scheme the financing comes from the private
     sector, whereas under a DBO scheme the financing comes from public funds. The BOT approach
     puts more risks on the private sector, and conversely fewer risks on the public counterpart, and
     holds several advantages:
     −	   The choice of the private contractor is based on the lowest LCC, instead of lowest CAPEX,
          resulting in a more economical proposition for the government. The private sector has the
          flexibility to choose (at its own risk) the best technological option to reduce LCC (that is, the
          combination of CAPEX and cumulated O&M costs) over the duration of the contract;
     −	   The private sector takes on the risks related to delays, costs overruns, and non-compliance
          of treatment infrastructure.
     −	   The private sector remains in place to operate the plant at its own risk, being liable for
          compliance with discharge standards. The contractual obligation of the utility to pay the
          tariff per m3 of treated wastewater usually result in the public contracting agency making
          sure that sufficient funds are set aside for this (usually setting tariff at sufficient level), as
          opposed to cutting necessary maintenance expenditures.

DBO-BOTs have been used with success in several large countries embarked on national WWTP
investment programs – such as in Brazil, Mexico, China, and India – as well as countries in
Europe (France, Belgium and Slovenia) and the Mediterranean (Jordan). This usually resulted in
developing a new business line for national construction companies who became BOT operators.
There is an opportunity in exploring the DBO-BOT options for the implementation of a portion of
Turkey’s investment program in WWTP, as discussed at the workshop (see Appendix I – “Summary
of the High-Level Workshop”).

5.6. Can Integrated Urban Water Management help manage costs and
water quality and quantity constraints?
One main approach stands out as potentially having a significant impact on the costs and
benefits of more integrated approaches for water quality and quantity constraints management,
if properly implemented. It is called Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM).
The IUWM approach is based on the widely-recognized theory that the management of
wastewaters could be greatly optimized and costs reduced through a holistic approach at the
city level. IUWM consists of the holistic, integrated and sustainable management of urban and
water resources at the scale of urban areas. It is not a new concept, but rather a set of principles
to better integrate the multisectoral aspects related to water resources and management in an
urban area, which face the impacts of broader issues related to water scarcity and security and/
or flood management. It links infrastructure solution to urban planning and regulations, and
considers the whole “water cycle” in the solution finding process.
IUWM deals not only with planning, design, and construction, but also with efficiency
improvement. In practice, it usually achieves positive specific results, including: better adequation
of capacity increase with spatial demand growth; closer linkages with drainage and solid waste
management; finding opportunities to turn waste into products by reusing treated wastewater,
biodigesting and composting sludge; and determining and working to achieve an economic
optimum of water losses. For instance this could include working to figure out what level makes
it more beneficial to invest in NRW reduction versus investing in new costly mechanisms to
increase production capacity which is likely to involve more and more desalination.
In Turkey, the reform leading to the creation of the SKIs was derived from a water crisis and the
March 2014 directive seems motivated in part by the need to harmonize water service levels and
to improve management at the scale of major urban centers and their surrounding areas. Large
urban centers are growing fast, both demographically and economically. Istanbul and Ankara
alone represent about 30 percent of the Turkish population and most likely a larger share of the
country GDP. In the meantime water resources are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive
to mobilize. This trend is expected to worsen with the impacts of climate change. A water crisis
would have dramatic social and economic consequences. Because this places water security
at the top of municipal and government priorities, it should also make IUWM approaches for
optimized solutions a priority.
Therefore, related questions worth analyzing include: to what extent are water and wastewater
facilities development embedded into the master plans and strategic plans of utilities integrated
into urban plans? Are these investments implemented in an integrated or coordinated fashion?
What incentives and mechanisms can be put in place to facilitate the adoption of IUWM
approaches in major urban centers throughout Turkey as part of the plans to implement actions
coherent with EU directives related to water?20


20	 Although storm water management, flood management and perimeter of protection of water catchment areas are important aspects related to
    urban planning and river basin planning within IUWM, this report does not analyze in more detail its relations to the objective of achieving good
    ecological status because of time constraints. It could be the focus of another phase of this assessment, pending the conclusions of the proposed
    workshop

                                                                                                                                                        49
     Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




     The ideas presented above were illustrated at the workshop by presentations of selected good
     practice examples in areas where Turkey’s utilities have done particularly well, such as design
     and operation, phasing of investments, quality of operations, climate smart investments, biogas
     digestion, reuse of treated wastewater and allocation mechanisms between uses (primarily
     agriculture versus water supply), and identifying those “no regret” measures that could have a
     systematic application. Appendix I presents a short summary of the highlights of the workshop.

     Conclusion:
     Turkey has a long history in dealing with water supply and sanitation, and has set a clear and
     ambitious roadmap for the sector. The considerable efforts and investments made in the last 15
     years to expand access to water supply, wastewater collection, and treatment has placed Turkey
     at a level equivalent to or above that of EU member states in the Danube River Basin. However,
     this has impacted the balance sheet of most SKIs, both in terms of debt levels and increased
     O&M costs. As a result, tariff levels set to cover expenditures are close to or above the tariff
     level defined as affordable. Yet, additional investments are needed to bring about compliance
     with the standards set in Turkey. These will result in debt repayment and additional incremental
     O&M costs that could result in tariff increases which will challenge the limit of affordable tariffs.
     This is a real challenge on the sustainability of a WSS service provider. It will become an even
     greater challenge as demographic and economic growths increase demand and as climate
     changes negatively affects the resources available to meet the demand. This situation calls for
     more investment efficiency for new infrastructure and operations performance improvement
     for existing facilities. The above section presents fundamental questions worth further analysis,
     so that the great efforts being undertaken in the water supply and sanitation sector can lead to
     provision of sustainable service to the entire population in order to support Turkey’s efforts to
     bring about a better environmental and economic future. The World Bank has provided support
     to help countries tackle these challenges all over the world, and stands ready to support Turkey
     in its endeavor.

                  Appendix E: Detailed Methodology for Cost Calculations
     Purpose
     The purpose of the modeling exercise is to estimate the investments and O&M costs of bringing
     wastewater collection and treatment in Turkey into compliance with standards under different
     scenarios. This section presents the detailed methodology used to build the model and carry out
     the cost estimate calculations, and it documents the origin of the data.
     Data used
     The data used for the cost assessment was drawn from publicly available sources documented
     below.
     List of Municipalities and Population Data
     Data from the General Directorate of Local Administration (GDLA) of the Ministry of Interior
     (MoI) was downloaded on March 24, 2016, from the following website:
     http://www.migm.gov.tr/kurumlar/migm.gov.tr/BELED%C4%B0YELER/Belediye_listesi_2015.xlsx
     The data includes a list of Municipalities in Turkey with a breakdown of different types
     (Metropolitan Municipality, Metropolitan Sub-Province, Province, Sub-Province, and Belde)
     together with population figures for 2015 published by TURKSTAT. The data also provides
     information on the Geographical Region where each municipality is located and the names of
     mayors and political parties.
     2013 and 2014 Municipal population data was downloaded from the GDLA website on May 27,
     2015:
     http://www.migm.gov.tr/kurumlar/migm.gov.tr/BELED%C4%B0YELER/belediye_listesi_2014_site.xlsx
     The 2014 population data was used for the assessments to ensure consistency with the use of
     financial information from published 2014 annual reports of General Directorates of Water and
     Sewage Administrations (SKIs) of Metropolitan Municipalities and to insure comparability of the
     ratios calculated.
     Existing Infrastructure
     The existing infrastructure data was collected mainly from two sources:
     - The River Basin Protection Action Plans (RBPAP) reports; and
     - The draft By-law on Sensitive Water Bodies (hereinafter referred to as “draft By-law”).
     RBPAP reports: Only 20 of the 25 RBPAP reports were publicly available on the website of the
     General Directorate of Water Management (GDWM) of the MoFWA:
     http://www.suyonetimi.gov.tr/AnaSayfa/eylemplanlari/eylem_planlari.aspx?sflang=tr
     RBPAPs were not available online for the Meriç-Ergene, Asi, Dicle-Fırat, Çoruh, and Aras river
     basins.
     The reports provide information on existing infrastructure for wastewater treatment plants
     (WWTPs) and wastewater collection networks. On WWTPs, they provide the status and the
     treatment level as defined in Table E.1 below. They also present if wastewater networks exist
     and the coverage rate.

Draft By-law: Announced by GDWM-MoFWA on May 4, 2016, it is publicly available at the link:
http://www.suyonetimi.gov.tr/Libraries/su/Hassas_Alan_Yc3b6netmelik__Taslac49fc4b1_3.sflb.ashx
The draft By-law proposes a revised list of “sensitive water bodies”. Annex 7 of the draft (see
below) provides data on existing WWTP and level of treatment for each municipality. It also
suggests treatment levels and protection measures for areas identified as “Urban Vulnerable
Zones” in all 25 river basins.
For the purpose of the assessment:
- WWTP treatment levels were coded as presented in Table E.2.

- Existing wastewater collection network and coverage data is taken from the published RBPAPs.
If plans do not include coverage data, it is assumed that there is no wastewater collection
network in place.
- Data on existence and treatment levels of wastewater treatment plants by municipality is
derived from the draft By-law on Sensitive Water Bodies. If not available, RBPAP data is used. If
there is no RBPAP data, it is assumed that the municipality has no wastewater treatment plant
in place.
Data on Sensitive Areas
Data on “Sensitive Areas” is based on 2 sources, which are included as two options in the model:
- The “Communiqué on Sensitive and Less Sensitive Water Areas” related to the By-law on Urban
Wastewater Treatment (published on Official Journal dated 27 June 2009 and No. 27271), which
informs option A for Sensitive areas in the model; and
- The revised “sensitive areas” defined in the draft By-law on “Sensitive Water Bodies” announced
by GDWM on May 4, 2016, (pending approval), which informs option B for Sensitive areas in the
model.

     The list of areas defined as “Sensitive” in each document is presented in the boxes below, Box E-1
     for Option A and Box E.2 for Option B.
     Determination of Discharge Location for Municipalities
     Google map was used to identify the likely treated wastewater discharge sites for each
     municipality and the urban population connected to a WWTP. This enabled determination of the
     required treatment level.
     A specific analysis was carried out for municipalities with populations of less than 10,000 and
     less than 2,000 to determine which municipalities of less than 2,000 are likely to discharge into
     estuaries and which municipalities with populations of less than 10,000 are likely to discharge
     into coastal waters. These are important drivers to define their level and costs of treatment. The
     results are described below.
     Estuaries: In order to locate municipalities with populations of less than 2000 and discharging
     to estuaries:
     - A filter was used to isolate municipalities with populations of less than 2,000 and located in coastal
     areas. Five met these criteria: Bartın (Kurucaşile municipality), Giresun (Çavuşlu municipality);
     Kastamonu (Doğanyurt municipality); Kırklareli (Kıyıköy municipality) and Zonguldak (Gümeli
     municipality).
     - Out of the five, four are located at estuaries: Giresun; Kastamonu; Kırklareli, and Zonguldak.
     Coastal Waters: Municipalities with populations of less than 10,000 and discharging into coastal
     waters

     - A filter was used which isolated 37 such municipalities, including those with less than 2,000.


          Box E.1: “Sensitive Areas” as Defined in the Communiqué in Force – Option A
                                          in the Model
        Annex 1A Sensitive Basins
        All municipalities within Akarçay, Burdur, Konya, and Van Lake river basins are defined as “Sensi-
        tive”
        Using the Ilısu dam reservoir figure from ENCON archives and checking from Google Earth; Batman
        (Beşiri, İkiköprü, Hasankeyf, Balpınar, Batman municipalities), Diyarbakır (Bağlar, Bismil, Kayapınar,
        Silvan, Sur, Yenişehir municipalities), Mardin (Dargeçit municipality), Siirt (Kayabağlar, Kurtalan, Si-

        Using Google map, the list of municipalities potentially discharging into dam reservoirs used for
        drinking water purposes and therefore identified as “Sensitive Drinking Water” are as follows, per
        province:
        - In the province of İstanbul, Alibey, Büyükçekmece, Sazlıdere, and Ömerli dams provide drinking
        water. İstanbul (Arnavutköy, Büyükçekmece, Çatalca Çekmeköy, and Pendik municipalities) are thus
        “Sensitive”.
        - In Diyarbakır, Dicle Dam provides drinking water, and Diyarbakır (Dicle and Eğil municipalities) are
        “Sensitive”.

        Box E.2. “Sensitive Areas” according to the Draft By-law – Option B in the Model
        The draft By-law includes in its Annex 7 a comprehensive list of areas defined for each river
        basin as “Urban Vulnerable Zones”. The Annex defines vulnerability according to three
        main criteria:
        - Urban Wastewater Management Measures
        - Industrial Wastewater Management
        - Solid Waste Management


        For the purpose of the assessment, urban zones listed as vulnerable because they need
        “Urban Wastewater Management Measures” were considered as “Sensitive areas”. For
        each municipality listed in the “Urban Vulnerable Zone” table, Annex 7 also presents in-
        formation regarding “Existing Status,” “WWTP name,” and “Measure required.” The mea-
        sures required suggest the treatment system to implement including “Secondary treat-
        ment,” “N&P removal,” “Monitoring & Audit” or “Sea Outfall.”
        This data was entered into the model to define the “Sensitive Areas” and the respective
        treatment levels.


     Determination of Urban Centers (MAs)
     In order to be able to determine the required level of treatment, it is necessary to determine
     the population that will be connected to a treatment plant. It is known that in metropolitan
     sub-province municipalities, the address-based population figures from TURKSTAT represent the
     entire population living in the sub-province. However, a portion of this population is living in
     smaller and dispersed settlements, which may be subject to less stringent treatment requirements
     than larger and densely populated urban settlements. The latter urban settlements often cover
     more than one metropolitan sub-province municipality, yet it may make sense to channel their
     wastewater to a common WWTP. Therefore, the appropriate approach to determine wastewater
     treatment is to define the “Metropolitan Areas” (MA) which will share the same WWTP in each
     MM. This concerned only municipalities consolidated into MMs as part of the March 2014
     reform.
     Population data for municipalities now belonging to MMs was adjusted by multiplying the urban
     population percentage from 2012 with the population figures in 2014. The address-based population
     data in 2012 for the 30 provinces, where metropolitan municipalities exist, was obtained from
     TURKSTAT (source: https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en). The treatment level required
     is determined according to the adjusted population estimate.
     Furthermore, in order not to overestimate the investment requirements in metropolitan
     municipalities, a correcting factor was introduced to account for the share of the population
     living in smaller and dispersed settlements and in rural areas, so that only the population located
     in an urban area is considered in the determination of the treatment level and the collection and
     treatment costs. This calculation was made using TURKSTAT population data for 2012 includes
     percentages of urban versus rural population, adjusted to account for 2014 population figures.
     For municipalities outside MM borders, it is known that the municipal population represents the
     urban settlement around a nucleus and the population is considered concentrated. Thus, the entire
     municipal population was used to determine the treatment levels in each scenario.

Scenarios and the Required Treatment Levels
The calculation was made based on three main scenarios and two options for “sensitive area” (A
or B), resulting in cost calculations in six different scenarios. These are shown in Table E.3 below.


                Table E.3: Description of Scenarios Used in the Assessment
 Scenario No   Scenario Name                           Scenario Description
 S1A           EU-UWWD Requirements                    Treatment level determined in accordance with the
               (sensitive areas as in Communique)      requirements of the EU- Urban Wastewater Directive
 S2A           Turkish regulation-1                    Both By-law on Urban Wastewater Treatment and By-law on
                                                       Water Pollution Control are considered, and treatment level
               (sensitive areas as in Communique)      is determined considering whichever is more stringent.
                                                       In this scenario, no additional Nitrogen removal is assumed
                                                       if the discharge location is not in a sensitive area.
 S3A           Turkish regulation-2                    As for S2, both the By-law on Urban Wastewater Treatment
                                                       and the By-law on Water Pollution Control are considered,
               (sensitive areas as in Communique)      and treatment level is determined considering whichever is
                                                       more stringent for each parameter.
                                                       In this scenario, Nitrogen removal is imposed in addition
                                                       to secondary treatment for any discharge, even outside
                                                       sensitive areas, for settlements having a population above
                                                       50,000.
 S1B           EU-UWWD Requirements                    Same treatment levels as above for each scenario.

               (urban sensitive areas: draft By-law)
 S2B           Turkish regulation -1                   The sensitivity areas are as defined in the draft By-law
                                                       prepared by GDWM MoFWA and pending approval.
               (urban sensitive areas: draft By-law)
 S3B           Turkish regulation -2

               (urban sensitive areas: draft By-law)



The difference between scenarios S1A & S1B, S2A & S2B, and S3A & S3B is the determination
of sensitive areas. In Option A, sensitive areas are determined according to the communiqué in
force. In Option B, sensitive areas correspond to the draft-By-law published as described above.
The S1 group mainly considers the EU UWWD requirements for wastewater treatment levels,
whereas S2 and S3 correspond to published and applied Turkish regulations, respectively. The
main difference between S2 and S3 groups is the practice of requiring that Nitrogen removal be
added to secondary treatment for all settlements with populations above 50,000; even if not

The treatment level required for each scenario was decided based on the population of the
Metropolitan Areas or Municipalities, as relevant, and the sensitivity of the discharge location.

     Cost Calculations
     The cost calculations consider both investment costs and operation and maintenance (O&M)
     costs for WWTP and wastewater collection networks facilities. For the calculations FEASIBLE22
     model cost functions and the cost functions used in RBPAP reports23 were evaluated. It was
     decided to use the cost functions from the FEASIBLE model as they provide differentiated
     costs per treatment levels for WWTPs; allow estimating the wastewater collection network
     investments and evaluate O&M costs.
     FEASIBLE Cost Functions Used
     The following cost functions listed in Table E.5 were used to calculate the new WWTP investment
     costs.
     Noteworthy: The FEASIBLE model assumes the same investment cost for treatment levels 3
     (tertiary treatment) and 4 (nitrogen removal added to secondary treatment).

     22	 http://www.oecd.org/env/outreach/methodologyandfeasiblecomputermodel.htm
     	   FEASIBLE is a software tool developed to support the preparation of environmental financing strategies for water, wastewater, and municipal
         solid waste services. The name FEASIBLE stands for: Financing for Environmental, Affordable and Strategic Investments that Bring on Large-scale
         Expenditure. The FEASIBLE model is freeware and can be obtained through the web pages of the OECD, DEPA/DANCEE and COWI. FEASIBLE can
         be used to facilitate the iterative process of balancing the required financing with the available financing. It provides a systematic, consistent, and
         quantitative framework for analyzing feasibility of financing environmental targets. Being a computerized model, FEASIBLE may be used to analyze
         “what if” a certain policy is changed and to document its financial impacts in a systematic and transparent manner.

Since the FEASIBLE model uses international unit prices, the estimates using the above cost
functions in Table E.5 results in higher investments costs compared to the WWTP costs known
to the team. In order to better align price levels with those of the Turkish market, FEASIBLE unit
costs were compared to benchmarks from previous WB and EU feasibility studies and to publicly
available award values for recent WWTP contracts.
On the other hand, calculated O&M costs were much lower in comparison with the experience
of the team as well as the values published by TUIK for environmental expenditure and the
values provided in annual reports of SKIs for expenditures. This analysis allowed developing the
adjustments coefficient presented in Table E.6 below.

Investment costs in new wastewater collection networks were estimated based on the total
length and distribution of pipe diameter within the network, using the following functions:
•	    If Pop. < 50 000 then L = Pop.*(-0.00005833*Pop+4.92)
•	    If 50 001 < Pop. < 500 000 then L = Pop.*(-0.000000278*Pop+2.14)
•	    If Pop. > 500 001 then L = 0.75*Pop.

The following aspects were not assessed or estimated in the calculations:
- Topographical and geotechnical aspects, due to the lack of data
- The costs of discharge (submarine outfall or discharge pipe) and the costs of sludge management
transport and disposal that were not included, due to a lack of benchmarks (estimates were
proposed)
- The cost of decentralized or on-site sanitation in rural areas that could not be estimated
- The costs and benefits related to biogas digestion where it makes sense that could not be
estimated.
Calculating Costs for Sea Outfalls
All municipalities located at the coastline were screened using Google Earth and the Internet
to assess if there is an existing sea outfall used by the municipality and also to decide if the
receiving body for wastewater discharge is either a sea or a river. To calculate the costs related
to sea outfall investment and operation the team used pipe diameters listed in Table E.11 below
for settlements with populations of up to 500,000 inhabitants.

Then for each sea surrounding the coasts of Turkey, a unique sea outfall length was estimated.
The investment cost of the sea outfall was finally determined according to the determined pipe
diameter and sea outfall length for each population range as shown in Table E.12 below.

     The O&M costs for sea outfalls are estimated as 3 percent of the investment costs.

     Sludge Disposal Costs
     For ease of calculation, it is assumed that the sludge generated in WWTP facilities meets the
     regulatory requirements for final disposal to landfills. Then the O&M costs for the disposal of
     sludge will include transport of sludge to landfill and the price for final disposal. The following
     assumptions shown in Table E.14 were made for cost calculation.

     In the case of Istanbul, although the numbers are presented as aggregated, the analysis has
     considered six separated metropolitan urban areas to replicate the sanitation/wastewater
     management areas into which the city can be divided for efficient operation.
     Figure G.1 below shows existing versus additional investments that were required in SKI-served
     MMs for scenarios S1A, S1B, and S3A. These scenarios were selected because S1A means
     reaching EU standards, S3A represents standards as applied in Turkey (‘business as usual’) with
     current ‘sensitive areas’, while S1B illustrates the new standards and sensitive areas set in the
     draft by-laws currently circulated for approval.

* WSS tariff for Manisa SKI was not available;
** For affordable tariff calculation, the household size is set at 4 people and the water consumption is 133 l/cap./day;
*** The tariff applied by SKI is the respective block tariff charged to customers located in the city center of relevant SKIs in 2016.

     As seen in Table G.10 above, for the SKIs or MMs that apply a household tariff below the
     affordability level, it is possible to increase tariffs to cover some of the additional operational
     cost. It is however preferable to first look into the potential for performance improvement of
     existing assets because increasing tariffs may lead to aggravating existing inefficiencies and
     reducing the capacity to increase tariffs in the future.
     For the SKIs charging household tariffs above the affordable rate, further actions should be taken
     to improve the revenues, such as improving the revenue collection rate, improving operational
     efficiency (network efficiency, water loss reduction, energy efficiency, and so forth). There may
     be options to explore an alternative well-defined tariff scheme, which could combine the need
     to support the poor and to meet the cost-recovery tariff level. Such actions are likely to incur
     costs, which would further aggravate the situation of the less performing SKIs, and could in turn
     translate into a degradation of the service provision.

       Appendix H: Results of Cost Estimates in River Basins and Financial
                              Impacts per Person
The following Tables H.1 through H.7 and Figures H.1 and H.2 show the existing assets, incremental
required investments, incremental O&M costs, amortization of incremental assets, and financial
impact per capita for each river basin according to the six scenarios assessed.
It should be mentioned again that for the Meriç-Ergene, Asi, Dicle-Fırat, Çoruh, and Aras river
basins there was no publicly available data from RBPAPs. This means the existing infrastructure
for settlements within these basins are potentially underestimated due to lack of data.
The repayment for loans in the below tables show the amount of money to be paid back, assuming
all the required investments (incremental assets) are financed by a loan. For the purposes of this
calculation it is assumed that; an IlBank loan with an interest rate of 7 percent and a 15-year
repayment period was used for the financing of new investment, and that the replacement costs
for equipment in future are to be covered by the relevant SKI or its Metropolitan Municipality
using its own resources.
Finally, the financial impact of the additional investments per person is calculated by taking
into account the incremental O&M costs, amortization costs for incremental investments, and
repayment for loans over the useful life of investments, which is 50 years.

                        Appendix I: Summary of the High-Level Workshop
      A high-level workshop entitled “Reaching Compliance with EU Requirements on Water Supply
      and Sanitation in a Sustainable Way: Challenges and Opportunities for Turkey” took place on
      October 18, 2016 in Ankara, Turkey. Organized jointly by the World Bank (WB) and the General
      Directorate for Water Management (GDWM) of the Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs
      (MoFWA), the workshop was funded by the Water Partnership Program. It built on a Preliminary
      Report independently carried out by the World Bank, which was disseminated by the GDWM of
      the MoFWA in the letter of invitation to the workshop.
      The workshop was made up of 97 participants, of which 78 were from Turkish key sector
      institutions, four officials were from Croatia, and one attendee from France, and seven World
      Bank and organizing team staff. Twenty-four of the 30 SKIs were represented at the workshop,
      15 of them by their General Director and 5 by their Deputy General Director. The workshop
      was designed to be a platform to discuss and analyze the challenges and opportunities linked to
      providing water supply and sanitation services in a sustainable way to the entire population in
      Turkey.
      The workshop was opened by the Country Director for Turkey Johannes Zutt and by the Deputy
      General Director for Water Management of the MoFWA, Abdurrahman Uluirmak.
      Mr. Xavier Chauvot de Beauchene, from the World Bank, presented the main findings of the
      Preliminary Report and set the stage for a broad discussion of sustainable service provision in
      Turkey. The main point of the presentation was to demonstrate that developing sustainable
      access and service provision requires efficient investment, which entails not only considering the
      investment cost, but also considering the total cost, including costs of operations performance
      and of improvement of existing infrastructure.
      National good practices
      The workshop showcased three cases of good WSS management practices in Turkey: The water
      efficiency improvement in Konya; treated wastewater reuse for green areas irrigation in Konya;
      and highly integrated sludge drying and co-generation in Antalya.
      KOSKI (Konya) officials reported on two good practices: (i) the use of an advanced SCADA system
      for the improvement of the company’s efficiency, with significant results on staff use, energy
      consumption, and reduction of Non-Revenue Water (NRW); and (ii) the treated wastewater
      reuse system, currently at a pilot scale, for the watering of vegetation along main roads and
      streets in the city as well as reforested areas.
      Konya Efficiency Improvement
      Konya is in the driest part of Turkey and only receives 250 mm of precipitation a year. This places
      Konya at the limit between the commonly accepted definitions of semi-arid and desert land.
      The combination of population growth, rapid urbanization, and economic growth increased
      industrial and agricultural water demand much beyond the forecasted demand. This translated
      into high overconsumption of the scarce water resources available to supply Konya, way beyond
      the renewable water levels. Three different resources are used for domestic and industrial water
      demand: surface water, groundwater, and spring water. 90 percent of water demand is supplied
      from groundwater. Predicted groundwater regeneration was 2.4 billion m3/year in 2010 while
      water withdrawal was 3.83 billion m3/year. The 1.43 billion m3 yearly deficit caused a 27 m
      decrease in groundwater level over 30 years. High water losses are a paradox in a place where
      water is so scarce. It worsens groundwater overexploitation. Aiming for more sustainable water
      management practices is an absolute necessity for KOSKİ. It requires achieving more efficiency in
      water resources and distribution management and raising awareness of the public on the need
      to save water and promote rainwater harvesting.

To develop more sustainable water management practices in Konya requires that KOSKI must
be able to improve its monitoring of its large water supply network and facilities. Therefore, a
SCADA system was established in 2007 for more efficient use of water resources. KOSKI used
SCADA to identify where leaks were occurring. KOSKI worked on network repair and renewal
activities, from big diameters to house connections. It created pressure zones, replaced pumps
to ensure they worked close to peak efficiency, and optimized pressure management to save
energy and reduce leakages. In the process, KOSKI recorded relevant information in its SCADA
and linked it to its GIS system, which allowed officials to both improve current service quality and
efficiency and allow for future preventative maintenance.
Konya has managed to use SCADA as a powerful management tool to improve the overall efficiency
of KOSKI, not only in terms of NRW reduction, but also in terms of energy efficiency, staffing
efficiency, customer management improvement, and preventive maintenance development. As
a result, KOSKI generated significant efficiency gains that allowed them to recover the cost of the
SCADA system within 6 months and make it a profitable tool for KOSKI thereafter. KOSKI exceeded
the targeted savings achievements and efficient use of resources faster than anticipated and has
thrived in maintaining this good performance over time, in spite of the demographic, economic,
and perimeter extension evolution.
One of the most striking achievements is the reduction of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) from 66
percent in 2001 to 27 percent in 2015, despite the demographic increase and urban/economic
development of Konya during that period. Supplied and billed amounts of water delivered to the
city in 2015 were respectively 86 million m3 and 63 million m3, corresponding to 27 percent NRW.
Following the March 2014 reform, KOSKI is now responsible for service provision to a much
larger service area. It expanded from the urban center (previously defined as the Metropolitan
Municipality) to the scale of the entire Konya province. This means that KOSKI is expected to
deliver the same quality of service to its extended service area. This represents an unprecedented
challenge. As it consolidates the service provision at the scale of the entire province, KOSKI is
rolling out the SCADA system to replicate the same approach to its enlarged service area, using
its own funds.
Konya Treated Wastewater Reuse
Konya WWTP has been operating since 2009. The treated wastewater is discharged to an
irrigation canal in the catchment area of the salt lake, a closed basin defined as a sensitive area.
KOSKI therefore has to treat the wastewater to remove nutrients. The plant is designed for Carbon
(C) and partial Nitrogen (N) removal. The WWTP is also equipped with a biogas system, which
is used to generate energy. In its effort to optimize its operations, KOSKI created a subsidiary to
manage its electricity generation (biogas digestion) and to explore avenues for more renewable
energy development.
In the second stage, P removal is also targeted in addition to C and N removal, in compliance
with EU standards. Konya WWTP discharge is introduced to tertiary treatment before irrigation
of limited urban green areas (purple network project). Treated wastewater effluent is used in
irrigation of urban green areas (parks, pavements, and so forth) after being tertiary treated in
a pilot plant having 150 m3/h capacity. Tertiary treatment is composed of multimedia filtration
(MMF), microfiltration (MF), Ultrafiltration (UF) and pre-chlorination-ultraviolet disinfection
(UV). In addition, post chlorination systems are used as tertiary treatment. The system has a 24
km long drip irrigation system.
Before the project, commenced, KOSKI did not collect revenue from the downstream use of
the treated wastewater in irrigation, and the municipality used to water its green areas using
drinking water delivered by trucks. The project built a win-win situation: the municipality got its
green and forested areas irrigated through modern water efficient drip irrigation systems, saving
the cost of truck and staff who were watering ‘manually’; while KOSKI got revenue from the


                                                                                                       111

      treated wastewater reused by the municipality and could allocate the drinking water previously
      used for watering to supply more people. The treated wastewater reuse is overall very positive
      for the municipality, for KOSKI, and for the environment because it allows mitigating the pressure
      on already threatened resources.
      The pilot plant with a capacity of 150 m3/hour has been operated since 2012 and 3.2 million m2
      green area has been irrigated for four years. The amount of wastewater reused in irrigation
      is around 400.000 m3/year, which corresponds to the monthly drinking water consumption of
      about 6,700 people (5m3 /cap. /month).
      Optimized Sludge Management and Disposal in Antalya
      ASAT (Antalya) officials made a presentation on their experience in resource recovery through: (i)
      biogas generation from sludge and (ii) its pragmatic win-win dried sludge disposal arrangement.
      Antalya sludge management is an example of an integrated and optimized system. It combines
      sludge dewatering with a cogeneration installation that uses a combination of biogas, natural
      gas, and heating oil, and the innovative and pragmatic final reuse of the sludge as fuel in a
      cement factory located 360km away in Konya province.
      Biogas generation using anaerobic sludge digestion is a very common method widely used in
      domestic WWTP’s to use sludge as a resource not as a waste to be disposed of. What is not
      so common is the level of integration which ASAT has put in place and the win-win solution it
      developed for sludge disposal. Antalya WWTP (Hurma) is equipped with 4 anaerobic digesters
      (each 9.000 m3) generating 12.000 m3/day biogas. Electricity generation from biogas in the
      cogeneration plant is 45 MW/day. Due to high electricity tariffs, ASAT officials considered
      generating electricity with a cogeneration plant using biogas produced in anaerobic digesters.
      Electricity is generated in a cogeneration plant with a Natural-gas/Biogas gas engine having 1950
      kW power  together with 2 MW heat-energy produced from the hot water generated during
      engine cooling and the gas engine exhaust gas. 2MW energy is also produced from a thermal oil
      circuit. The cogeneration plant is operated in a way that optimizes the electricity production by
      adjusting the operation times according to the hours of the day, charging the cheapest electricity
      tariffs, and by using natural gas or biogas when electricity tariffs are high, based on the relative
      price of natural gas versus biogas, so as to seek maximum financial efficiency from the drying and
      cogeneration plant. As a result, ASAT supplies 40 percent of the WWTP’s electricity requirement
      from its biogas generation.
      Sustainable sludge management was a priority issue in the ASAT agenda because Antalya is one
      of the most attractive touristic cities, having 200 blue flag beaches out of the total of 436 blue
      flag beaches in Turkey. Before the sludge drying facility began operations, the treatment sludge
      disposal method was the open dump, which created a very unpleasant situation among the
      citizens. This solution was not sustainable and, in order to prevent health risks to people and
      livestock because of the contaminants, pathogens, and fecal origin of sludge, legislation was
      enacted to tighten procedures about land application of sludge. ASAT has looked for ways to
      dispose of the sludge generated in its WWTP in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly
      manner.
      The most common disposal method for wastewater sludge in Turkey is storage in landfills, but
      there is no appropriate and socially acceptable site for sludge disposal around Antalya and
      the disposal costs related to disposing of the sludge in a landfill far from the city would have
      significantly increased the disposal costs. Therefore, ASAT decided to apply sludge drying as a
      sustainable and effective sludge management method. The sludge generated in WWTP is dried
      in a sludge drying plant with 150 ton/day drying capacity. The final product has 20 percent dry
      solids, which is transferred to a KONYA cement factory located in Konya over 360 km away free
      of charge with the trucks carrying several goods to Antalya harbor and then returning empty. It
      is this approach and the constant efforts to further optimize its system that makes ASAT one of
      the pioneering and leading water utility in terms of sludge management in Turkey.

International Case Studies: Feedback from French and Croatian experiences
Two international case studies were presented at the workshop dealing respectively with the
Croatian and French experiences in implementing the EU Urban Waste Water Directive (UWWD)
and Drinking Water Directive (DWD). De facto, the work was more focused on the UWWD, since
compliance with DWD seems much less challenging for Turkey.
These two countries were selected for the following reasons:
-	   Croatia, which joined the EU in 2013, will have to comply fully with the ‘acquis communautaire’
     in the field of water in 2023 for the UWWD, and in 2019 for the DWD. Croatia is therefore
     adopting regulatory and implementation support measures and is finalizing investments
     necessary for compliance, with the support of EU and IFIs funding, a situation similar with
     Turkey’s situation.
-	   France is at a much more advanced stage of compliance with both directives, but the
     process to reach compliance proved challenging. Turkey could benefit from this experience
     and be interested or inspired by France’s methods to move towards full compliance with
     the directives, and monitoring the progress, taking into account measures taken when the
     European Commission took France to the European Court of Justice.
-	   In addition, both Croatia and France are parties to the Barcelona Convention (and its Protocol
     on Pollution from Land Based Source), as well as Turkey
Croatia international case study:
The Croatia case study was structured in two presentations. First, a presentation of the Croatian
Context was delivered by Dinko Polic and Vesna Grizelj Simic (respectively Deputy General
Manager and Sector Head at Hrvatske Vode - HV). First, information was given on institutional
aspects and on the main actors responsible for the implementation of the Water Management
Strategy (2008/2038), the Implementation Plan for Water Utility Directives, and the River
Basin Management Plan. Among a description of the main challenges for Croatia’s good
implementation of the two EU directives at stake, the presentation singled out several topics of
potential relevance for Turkey:
•	   The delimitation of sensitive areas based on documented studies of existing or potential
     environmental degradation
•	   The preparation of planning documents giving a framework for investment projects
•	   The identification of priority investments
•	   The funding of a total initial investment in water utility projects of €3.8 billion (62 percent
     by EU operative programs from 2007 onwards; 13 percent by state budget; 13 percent by
     Hrvatske Vode, 9 percent by Water service providers and 3 percent by IFIs)
•	   The challenge of affordability since the water price in Croatia is currently of €2/m3
•	   The need to adapt water utility management and to involve local authorities in the
     implementation effort
•	   The key issue of investments sustainability, which depends on technical capacities and the
     funding of operational costs and maintenance (O&M)
A second presentation, delivered by Robert Kartelo, Head of Sector at HV, described the
involvement of HV in the preparation of projects from 2010 onwards for a total value of about
€1.8 bn. He provided feedback on average duration of projects (23.7 months for networks,
32.7months for WWTPs) and respective cost (189 €/ m for networks and 221 €/ p.e. for
treatment plants). Feedback from the Croatian experience showed that due attention has to be


                                                                                                          113

      paid to proper planning, to project quality, and to technical aspects, such as design, technology,
      and demand analysis. The presentation concluded that “knowledge and experience exchange
      was not sufficient to allow new member states to learn from those who had gone through the
      process before them, at least not in an institutionalized way.”
      France international case study:
      The presentation on the implementation on the UWWD in France was delivered by Bruno
      Rakedjian, of the French Ministry of Environment, currently seconded to the European
      Commission (DG ENV). Bruno first discussed the 2007 situation of non-compliance of 20 percent
      of treatments plants, with a corresponding risk for France to be fined about €400 million.
      Bruno explained the measures that were taken and implemented at the various administrative
      levels (Ministry of Environment, National Water Agency, and River Basin agencies and
      municipalities) to cope with the French implementation deficit regarding the UWWTD. He
      underlined the importance placed by French authorities to define sensitive areas, set clear
      priorities, and provide advice and guidance to local authorities / municipalities (for example,
      training support, advice on the best sanitation system, best location of UWWTP, and technological
      options) to support them in reaching compliance in an efficient way. He also outlined associated
      measures that were put in place to monitor progress and make the information available to
      all. These included: dashboards with priorities; transparency policy (website); implementation
      progress; and monitoring of treatments in line with the definition of sensitive areas.
      Statistics were presented about the situation in 2014, showing inter alia that the volume of
      urban waste water in France was €5 billion m3 a year, the total cost (investment + O&M) of
      compliance amounted to about €11 billion, and the average water price was €3.85/m3 (€2/m3
      for water supply and €1.85/m3 for wastewater. The sanitation assets in France corresponds to
      an investment of €2,600/ person/40 years, or €65/citizen/year). Results obtained thru the EU
      Directive implementation can be illustrated by a remarkable Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
      reduction in rivers in France, in the EU territory, but also in other Member States, such as for
      instance, Ireland or Scotland.
      Some lessons from the French experience may be of relevance for Turkey:
      •	   Reaching compliance takes a lot of time.
      •	   Transparency (national database and website) contributes to good implementation as well
           as to dissemination of good practices.
      •	   Implementation action plans, indicators, and clear priorities are critical to success.
      •	   Appropriate funding is needed for investments (€4.3 billion) and even more for operation
           costs (€6.6 billion). Investment efficiency is warranted to optimize operations costs.
      •	   National / local organizations must be in place, with strong political support being a strong
           catalyst;
      •	   Cooperation between national and local authorities is important,
      •	   A comprehensive capacity-building program is useful,
      •	   Alternatives must be compared to single out cost efficient solutions.
      At this point, the audience was invited to discuss how these case studies may be interesting for
      Turkey. The conversation focused on issues such as responsibility sharing between national and
      local authorities, the most accurate type of treatment depending on the size of settlements, the
      funding of investments, and the energy efficiency of UWWTP.
      In the afternoon, World Bank experts made two presentations: one on the concept of integrated

                                                                                              Appendixes




urban water management, including examples of its application in Latin America and Korea; and
the other on the new generation of public-private partnerships (PPP) in the water and wastewater
sector, the opportunity that they may represent, and where using them makes sense. The PPP
presentation underlined that BOT approaches have the advantage of considering the total cost of
investment, which may not be the cheapest to construct, allowing them to implement optimized
solutions and to hold the private sector accountable for operating efficiently.
A panel discussion followed, chaired and moderated by Dr. Yakup Karaaslan, Deputy General
Director, GDWM. Discussants were Mr. Recep Şahin, Deputy General Secretary of Union of
Municipalities in Turkey); Mr. Recep Akdeniz, Deputy General Director, General Directorate of
Environmental Management, Ministry of Environment and Urbanization; and Mr. Taner Kimençe,
Head of Department, Department of Basin Management, GDWM, MoFWA.
The main points raised by the panelists during the panel discussion session are summarized
below:
•	   The establishment of new SKIs and the extension of the service area to the current ones
     under the Law No 6360 brought both technical and financial challenges, since SKIs also took
     over water- and wastewater-related liabilities of the new service area. This, however, could
     be an opportunity for the population served, since SKIs’ expertise on urban areas would
     benefit to the new areas as well. This should be supported by both technical and financial
     assistance.
•	   The Law No 6360 also delegated to SKIs the responsibility of service provision and flood
     management in rural areas, but did not provide financial resources for these activities.
•	   Implementation of regulations on urban transformation and renewal should be integrated
     with water management planning.
•	   Implementation of the existing regulation on water loss management is of utmost importance
     for the sustainability of the services. Several trainings were carried out by the Ministry on
     the implementation of this regulation. Further workshops and trainings to SKI officials are
     needed on the subjects of monitoring, reporting, and minimizing water losses.
•	   Projects on efficient use of water as well as reuse of wastewater should be developed.
•	   Using PPPs with build-operate-transfer and performance-based contracts could present
     a good model to increase the efficiency of service provision. However, the contractual
     conditions should be defined very carefully to achieve the utmost benefit for the SKI and
     the population served. SKIs need assistance in this subject.
•	   The regulation on water losses in irrigation is under discussion at the prime minister level.
•	   SKIs serving populations where refugees are located face special technical and financial
     challenges to provide water and wastewater services, and that these SKIs need more
     assistance.
•	   SKIs established after 2014 have a period of 4-5 years to overcome their institutional,
     operational, and technical issues.
•	   Integrated urban water and wastewater planning should also take socioeconomic impact
     analysis into consideration. Although implementation of a “polluter-pays” principle and
     cost-recovery tariff is crucial for sustainability of the services, affordability of the population
     should also be taken into consideration. A staged approach could be implemented where
     investments are realized following a prioritized plan in stages, with gradual tariff adjustments
     made up to the cost-recovery level within affordability constraints. These plans should be
     monitored on an annual basis and be revised if necessary. Some SKIs would need assistance
     in this regard.

      Republic of Turkey: Sustainable Urban Water Supply and Sanitation




      •	   Tariff-setting procedures of SKIs should be transparent to obtain public acceptance and
           willingness-to-pay. Especially in new metropolitan areas, SKIs should be engaged in
           awareness-raising activities to explain the need for water and wastewater tariffs and
           infrastructure investment contribution fees paid by customers for the sustainability of the
           services.
      •	   A revision of the EU DWD is underway. It will cover reporting requirements on drinking
           water from source to tap. SKIs should anticipate and build necessary data management
           mechanisms.
      During the discussion, officials of the SKIs stressed the new challenges related to the extension
      of their service areas from the densely populated urban areas to the boundaries of the province.
      They stressed that their increased responsibilities have not been matched with additional funding.
      They said that these unprecedented expectations of service extensions and improvements
      represent a direct risk on already challenged balance sheets and have not been matched by
      corresponding staffing and capacity strengthening policies.
      The workshop concluded with a discussion on areas where the Bank could provide additional
      support to Turkey and how the new financial instrument “Program for Results” could be of
      interest.
