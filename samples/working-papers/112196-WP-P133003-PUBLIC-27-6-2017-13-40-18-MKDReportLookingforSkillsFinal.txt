Looking for Skills in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia – an overview


Skills gaps affect jobs and productivity, workers and firms
Could more and better skills help improve labor market outcomes in the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia? Jobs challenges are significant: only two out of five adults are in employment, many
of them in informal and precarious work. Paradoxically, high unemployment co-exists with an unmet
need for skilled workers in the private sector. To address the problem, a better understanding of the
characteristics and causes of these skills gaps are needed. This report presents new insights on the
availability and demand for skills, drawing on two innovative surveys: a household level survey to
measure the supply of skills in the adult population, and an employer survey to measure demand for
skills. The key message coming from these two surveys is that there is indeed a significant skills gap in
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and that closing this gap would be beneficial to workers,
firms, and the economy.
Lack of the right skills is limiting job creation, firm expansion, and firm productivity . There is
persuasive evidence, from both the household and employer surveys, that lack of skills is an obstacle
in the labor market. Firms in former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia that do wish to expand but face
difficulties in doing so, cite skills as the main problem – they cannot hire because they cannot find
workers with the right experience for the job. There are also problems among the current employees:
a majority of firms state that their work force lacks the skills to do their jobs effectively. Hence, lack of
skills is holding back both labor demand and productivity growth. Whereas the business environment
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is marred by many problems beyond skills, employers
are very concerned about the low quality of training provided through the technical and vocational
education system.
The skills gap is related to a range of job-specific technical skills as well as generic skills. Job-specific
technical skills are important for employers everywhere, and the kind of occupations in demand differs
depending on sectors (for example plant and machine operators in the case of automotive industries,
versus technicians, professionals, in the case of information and communications technology, ICT).
However, there are also generic competencies lacking across different industries. Jobs and
occupations that employers emphasize as suffering from skills gaps, generally require a range of
higher-order cognitive and socio-emotional skills including communication skills and people skills (for
managerial and professionals) and basic cognitive, time management and people skills. This suggests
that the skills problem is not primarily due to students making poor choices about what
vocation/occupation to choose, but of the quality of skills imparted through the education and training
systems.
Low skills, or the wrong skills, is an obstacle to workers’ jobs and earnings prospects . Many of those
who have invested in training, in particular technical and vocational training (TVET), find themselves
mismatched – over educated – compared to the requirements of their jobs, and also consider their
education of little use to their daily work. Meanwhile, although unemployment rates for those who
have completed higher levels of education are lower than the average, they still hover around 20
percent. This poor pay-off to educational investments, both public and private, is also evidence of
distortions in the skills development systems. Vocational training at tertiary level appears to have
especially poor pay-offs, manifested in in a high share of workers considering themselves over-
educated, and a significant difference in the intensity in use of skills on the job, compared to those
with general tertiary education.



                                                                                                           8
Skills development systems in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are not equitable, and
especially those of non-Macedonian ethnicity lack access to skills development and higher skilled
jobs. Access to education still differs significantly across ethnic groups, and the gap does not appear
to fall over time. Some more vulnerable groups in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
consequently accumulate fewer skills - even elementary skills such as basic literacy - and have less
access to skilled jobs.


Why is there a skills gap?
Neither education and training systems nor employers are engaging in closing the skills gap. In
employers’ views, both educational and TVET systems fail to provide quality skills. A majority of those
workers identified as having major skills gaps in their work place, had either tertiary levels of
education, or secondary or tertiary vocational education, which emphasizes that it is not only the level,
but also the quality of education, that is an issue. These branches of the education system lack the
flexibility to respond to the needs of employers and students. An overly centralized system with an
emphasis on public provision of skill, is partly to blame.
Firms do not train their workers to compensate for the skills gap. Only one quarter of firms provide
some training to their workers. There are some exceptions: firms with some exposure to international
markets (partly foreign owned, and/or involved in international trade), especially in the automotive
industry, and firms with high intensity of modern skills (ICT), do train their workers, both on the job,
and off-site. Yet, for other firms, this is not the case. There are potential reasons for this, including
that firms do not realize the benefits of training, workers are not at the level where on-the-job training
is sufficient to compensate for poor education quality, or firms find it too costly to invest in training,
because of high staff turn-over or high costs of training.
Labor markets are not sending the right signals for investing in education. In the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, unlike in more advanced OECD countries, diplomas matter more than skills
for labor income. In estimates of returns to different job and workers’ characteristics, including both
education and measures of skills, actual measured competencies should matter more than diplomas,
since education should be a means to an end (developing skills) and not an end in itself. This is not the
case in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, however, where education measures are stronger
determinants for earnings than skills content of the job. At the same time, the share of tertiary
educated in the public sector is higher than in the private sector, and has been increasing. Developing
labor market relevant skills is not a priority for students, if it is more important to ensure a diploma
from an institution that ensures a wide network or that guarantees a job in the public sector with good
salary and benefit levels and relatively secure employment.


What can be done?
Successful skills development systems address skilling and reskilling from birth, through
adolescence and during adult working life, involving employers, education providers, actual and
potential students as well as workers. The provision, quality and allocation of skills is given by how
these stakeholders make choices regarding careers, educational institutions and jobs
(students/workers), hiring (employers) and training (employers, educational providers).
Education reforms need to address both remaining quality problems and inequity in access. Skills
formation starts early in life, and education is “path-dependent” in that poor performance early in life
excludes many future options, Hence, ensuring higher quality in education right from the start and
more equitable access is necessary to foster inclusive job creation. The former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia has undertaken important and successful reforms in the education sector, including on
fostering teacher training, student testing, decentralization of responsibilities to a local level, and an
established monitoring and evaluation system. Nonetheless, more targeted efforts, looking at
constraints from both the demand and supply side, may be needed to access disadvantaged groups.

                                                                                                        9
The skills development system of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would be
strengthened by stronger coordination and collaboration between these different actors . Tax
exemptions and other forms of financial incentives could be used to encourage firms to train their
work force. However, policy could also focus on connecting employers and educational institutions
better, by establishing coordination mechanisms and supporting industrial associations. As part of this
agenda, it would be useful to explore ways of introducing apprentice- and internships systems, that
expose students with the world of work and increases the practical content of training, while lowering
the cost to firms. Efforts to establish labor market information systems in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, that could help students, workers, employers and educational systems
exchange relevant and timely information, are ongoing. A more comprehensive system for monitoring
and evaluation would help policy makers identify bottlenecks and quality problems.

1. Why skills matter for the former Yugoslav
   Republic of Macedonia


1.1     Skills are central to the jobs agenda

There is dire need for better job opportunities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Only
two in five adults are employed in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the remainder are
either inactive or unemployed. Out of those that are employed, a majority is working in sectors with
relatively low productivity, including agriculture and small scale trade. The formal private sector is
small and fragmented, and one in three workers is employed in micro-firms with less than 10
employees. With one in five Macedonians living in poverty, getting more people into more productive
employment is central to the economic and social challenges facing the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia.
Developing a skilled work force is part of the core challenges . Job creation is held back by many
different business constraints, including political uncertainty, lack of a leveled playing field, a
comparatively shallow financial system, and lack of adequate skills in the population. Skills are integral
to the job creation challenge, for several reasons. For advanced economies, analyses of labor market
outcomes suggest that skills are an important determinant of earnings, and that levels of education
become less significant when skills are taken into account – skills, not diplomas, matter. The skills that
are needed in a modern economy are also changing rapidly. Evidence from the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia and other countries in central and eastern Europe suggest that the intensity
of certain skills is increasing rapidly as jobs that are associated with repetitive, manual skills are giving
way to jobs that are more intensive in higher order analytical and organizational skills, or “new
economy skills”.
Skills are becoming a bottleneck. There is evidence that job market relevant skills are becoming an
important bottleneck to private sector growth in some Europe and Central Asian (ECA) countries, more
particularly those that have advanced further towards building a functioning market-based economic
system. This suggests that while skills may not be the key binding constraint in countries where
financial and legal systems are underdeveloped and governance is poor, skills become a significant
constraint once these key pieces are in place. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia there are
nonetheless indications that firms experience skills gaps. In fact, skills emerge as a major issue in a
2010 survey of labor demand in the country (World Bank, 2010). In the Global Competitiveness Report,
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ranks well on labor market flexibility (33 out of 140) but
very poorly on the use of talent (111), including the reliance on professional management, and the
capacity to attract and/or retain talent.


1.2     Information is needed about skills in the former Yugoslav Republic of
        Macedonia, both from the supply and demand side

Skills development systems are complex, involving students and workers, employers, educational
institutions, and government bodies that regulate education and labor market policy. Understanding
the level of skills available and the needs, constraints and incentives of different stakeholders is central
to help fostering that provides relevant skills that in turn pay off with more job creation and higher
productivity. With the exception of the labor demand survey undertaken in 2010, there have been no
prior attempts to measure demand and supply of skills in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.



                                                                                                          11
The STEP Household and Employer Surveys is a significant step towards filling knowledge gaps
around the supply and demand for skills. The STEP1 Skills Measurement Program, launched in
October 2010 by the World Bank, is a systematic attempt to fill knowledge gaps related to skills that
enhance productivity and earnings in developing countries. The program is designed to provide policy
relevant information on skills, much beyond basic information on education levels and literacy, from
both the supply and demand side. Household level surveys focus on measuring skills and the use of
skills in the population in a comprehensive way, including analytical (cognitive) skills, and socio-
emotional traits that affect work place readiness and effectiveness. Firm level (employer) surveys
focus on understanding the skills that employers look for, skills that are difficult to find, and different
means to address the skills gap. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a household level
survey was undertaken in 2013, while a firm survey was undertaken in 2015 (Box 1 and 2). The rich
information available in the two surveys permits an in-depth analysis of whether there is a skills gap
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, whether such a skills gap affects labor demand and
productivity, and prevents people from accessing good jobs, and whether investments in skills pay off.
The analysis presented in the remainder of the report strongly supports the notion of a skills gap in
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with negative consequences for jobs and productivity.
Hiring firms have difficulties in identifying qualified candidates and in general, many firms also have a
work force without the skills set necessary to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. The skills in
demand are first and foremost technical, relating to the specific jobs, but workers are also expected
to have many transversal skills: team work capacity, communication skills, time management skills,
independence, ambition, and so on – and there are important skills gaps relating to these aptitudes.
The weaknesses reflect difficulties in the skills development system, in particular, the lack of interface
between different stakeholders and the poor integration of the demand side (the private sector) in
the planning and execution of skills training.
The report is organized as follows. The next section provides an analytical framework that highlights
the pillars, links, constraints and incentives that make up a skills development system. The third
section focuses on identifying whether there is a skills gap (based on employers’ and workers’ views)
while the fourth section lays out in more detail what such a skills gap looks like in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia. The fifth section brings in the relationship between firms, workers, and
education systems. The sixth section concludes.


                                     Box 1: The STEP household survey

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Household Survey (focusing on individuals and the
supply of skills) was undertaken in 2013, focused on urban population aged 15-64, with a sample size
of 4009. The STEP sample is biased to female older population, and to more educated people; as a
result, key labor market indicators calculated on the basis of STEP household surveys differ from
those based on the standard LFS data. The survey is representative at urban national level.

The survey measures:

(i) Cognitive skills, that is, analytical, logical, intuitive and creative thinking and problem solving skills
are assessed directly, through a reading literacy assessment, and indirectly, through self-reported
information of use of skills in daily life and work.
(ii) Socio-emotional skills and personality traits (behavioral skills soft skills, life skills, personality
traits), include behavioral aspects, including openness to new experiences, conscientiousness,
extraversion, agreeableness, hostile bias (the tendency to interpret others’ behaviors as hostile),
perseverance and focus on long term goals (grit), and attitudes and preferences with respect to
decision making, time and risk.

(iii) Job-relevant skills are task related and include technical skills directly related to the specific
occupation (like, for example, accounting for an accountant) and computer use, repair/maintenance
of machinery, operation of machinery, but also soft skills like client contact, problem solving,

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Employer Survey (focusing on firms) provides
information on the demand from skills as expressed by potential employers. It includes questions
about the skills in use by the current work force, how skills are valued when hiring new workers, and
existing constraints in terms of skills. The survey mirrors the household survey in its focus on a broad
set of skills, including both cognitive, socio-emotional, and job relevant technical skills. The survey is
based on an interview with firm representatives (HR managers or firm owners, depending on the
size of the firm). A total of 1027 firms were included in the survey. Some key descriptive statistics are
available in Annex 1.

Many questions separate out two groups of occupations, which we refer to as “New Economy Skills
Occupations” and “Traditional Skills Occupations”. The New Economy Skills Occupations refer to
the first three occupational categories according to the International Standard Classification of
Occupations (ISCO), i.e. management, professional, and technical occupations, that tend to be more
intense in skills needed for modern economies. The Traditional Skills Occupations refer to clerical
support, sales and service workers, skilled agricultural workers, crafts and trades workers, plants and
machine operators and assemblers, and elementary occupations. Although the tasks related to these
occupations have been increasing in skills intensity over time as well, they tend to be more routine
than those of the NES category, and in some cases involve manual work.

The survey for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was undertaken in early 2015, in urban
areas and is representative at a national level for a few targeted sectors that have been identified as
holding a growth potential for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Food and textiles,
automotive components, other manufacturing sectors, ICT, and logistics sectors. In most cases,
disaggregated analysis focus on the economic sectors. These differ in characteristics, however.
Among other things, data show that the ICT sector stands out in terms of its high share of young
firms, almost all innovative (having introduced a new product or service in the past 3 years), a
comparatively high share of foreign ownership in some form, and the degree of international
contacts. The automotive industry also has a higher share of foreign ownership, but tend to be larger
firms than others. These characteristics matter. For example, exposure to international competition
or influences (e.g. through ownership or through international trade) is likely to influence company
productivity and skills needs.

2. What makes a successful skills development
   system?

“Skills” - the ability to perform a task well, owing to a combination of knowledge, practice, and
aptitude, including technical skills as well as softer skills like the ability to collaborate with other people
or communicate messages well - are applied in the labor market and begin to form in early childhood
and are honed throughout childhood and adult life (Table 1). Policy to reinforce skills development
therefore spans across a wide system incorporating early childhood interventions through to
university education and different training and re-training programs.

The skills development system hinges on strong coordination and collaboration between its key
stakeholders: Firms, workers, students (and their parents), and educational providers (Figure 1). The
system is more efficient if: firms train their workers and are able to articulate to the education system
which skills they need; workers, in particular youth and their parents, who choose vocations and
education paths that are rewarded in the labor market; an education system that listens to employers
and students and provides education and training that is relevant to both; and a labor market that
rewards skills, that allows employers to find and hire the best talent, try them out, reward those who
do well but also fire those who do not well.
Each of these players faces incentives and constraints that shape their choices and hence overall
skills outcomes in the economy. Employers make decisions on investing in training of workers and
organizing themselves with other employers (to provide training, to lobby for changes in the education
system, etc.). These investments depend on the risk of investing in training for workers only to lose
them to other firms (“poaching”), and the cost of organizing themselves with other firms. If employers
cannot achieve this high level of cooperation, we speak of coordination failure. Future and present
workers make choices on how and what career path to follow and what training to undertake, based
on aptitude, the information available on labor markets about job and earnings prospects and training
quality, and the cost of training. If information is lacking, or if labor market success is not depending

                                                                                                                        14
on skills (but on connections, networks, corruption, diplomas), their investments in skills may not be
optimal for society. Accordingly, we speak of information failure if students and workers do not have
adequate access to what skills are rewarded in the labor market; and of a labor market failure if skills
are in act not rewarded as they should. Education systems should be flexible to respond to the needs
of the employers and students, which requires that they have incentives to be responsive. A chief
obstacle to responsive education systems is often the political economy of adjusting teaching staff to
changing demands, which we call a political economy failure.

Measured against this framework, the skills development system in the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia is characterized by some weaknesses, especially on the integration of employers . An
analysis of work force skills development systems in the country (with a focus on Technical and
Vocational Training) suggest that there is a lack of coordination along several dimensions: within the
public sector, within the private sector, and between the private sector and the public sector (World
Bank, 2014). The education and training sector remains disconnected from the private sector
(employers) and while the private sector itself is poorly organized and often unable to articulate skills
needs to the public sector. There are no collaborative mechanisms for forecasting labor market needs,
and data collection and information systems remain underdeveloped. More generally, the system
appears centralized and “top-down”, rendering it more rigid and less attuned to the actual needs in
the private sector.

3. Is there a skills gap in the former Yugoslav
   Republic of Macedonia?

Insufficient and inadequate skills in the workforce hold back demand for labor, firm expansion, and
firm productivity. Based on evidence from the STEP surveys, skills gaps are, in fact, a significant
problem in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Inadequate skills among applicants is the main
problem for firms that have difficulties in hiring workers. A majority of firms also have a work force
that is lacking the necessary skills to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. There are certainly many
problems holding back business expansion in Macedonia, but when asked to rank labor related
constraints to doing business, employers’ most significant concern is the inadequate technical and
vocational training of workers. Many workers also find themselves mismatched, with education levels
that exceed what is required for the job, suggesting that important public and private educational
investments are not put to productive use.


3.1     Skills gaps are holding back job creation and productivity growth in
        firms

Skills-related constraints are considered the most important labor related problems in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – more important than wage levels or strict labor regulation. The
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces many different issues related to the conditions for
business creation and expansion (World Bank, 2016), including labor issues. When asked to rank
different constraints, approximately one third of firms in the Employer Survey consider lack of fair
competition as well as difficult access to finance, more pressing problems than labor related issues.
However, among labor constraints (linked to the availability, cost and quality of labor), skills –
summarized in the training workers have received and the experience they have accumulated at work
- are in fact singled out as the most significant obstacle. Inadequate training, and lack of workers with
adequate experience, is a more important problem than average wages, the cost of social security,
and labor regulations. Nonetheless the skills needs differ across sectors depending on whether the
industry as such is skills intensive or not. The ICT sector – a modern services sector – is particularly
vulnerable to skills deficiencies (Figure 2, a). For traditional manufacturing sectors like food and
textiles, skills are a problem, but unlike in more skills intensive sectors, overall labor availability and
the cost of labor also rank as problems. The importance of skills relative to cost and availability of labor
is also higher for large firms, for innovative firms, and for firms with some foreign ownership (in the
case of education and training of workers).

Expanding firms have problems finding workers with the right skills . Labor demand is relatively
subdued in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – only one in four firms tried to actually hire
workers, whether New Economy Skills (NES) jobs or Traditional Skills jobs. The automotive industry is
an exception where a majority of firms were hiring, especially Traditional Skills workers. Among those
firms who did try to hire, only one third actually experienced problems in finding the right workers
(Figure 3, a and b). The situation differs between sectors, however, with more than half of hiring firms
in the automotive and the food products manufacturing sector in fact experiencing problems. When
hiring problems do arise, they are skills related. The key reason for not finding workers to fill a specific
position was that there were no applicants with the requisite skills (Figure 4). Skills issues are generic:

whom high reservation wages was the main issue.

Skills also appear to be holding back firm productivity growth, with negative repercussions for
competitiveness, profitability and – in the long run – the opportunities for expansion and wage
growth. In fact, half of firms on the Employer Survey experience a skills gap among their current

3.2      Many workers consider their education levels mismatched with their
         jobs

Workers also bear witness to discrepancies between education and occupations. The impression of
important skills gaps from the employers’ side reappears on the workers’ side. A significant share of
individuals across different levels of education consider themselves mismatched to their jobs from the
perspective of the education levels they have achieved (Figure 6, a). In particular, a majority of those
with higher levels of vocational and technical training feel over-educated relative to the requirements
of their jobs. The impression of over-education is high among workers in more precarious forms of
jobs (self-employment, informal work) and among more elementary occupations. Unsurprisingly, a
majority of the over-educated workers consider their education of no use whatsoever to their jobs
(Figure 6, b). The high levels of perceived mismatch among workers who have spent more than twelve
years investing in education – in particular vocational and technical education with a supposed labor
market relevance - is disconcerting. Conversely, one quarter of low educated workers – those who
have finished lower secondary education at the most – are, according to their own assessments,
under-educated relative to the requirements of the job.




                                                                                                            19

There are several potential reasons behind these mismatches, including lack of demand for certain
vocational paths (which students nonetheless choose to enter) and low quality of education, making
it difficult to find a job that is relevant to studies. This kind of mismatch in terms of contents of
education is also witnessed in the fact that higher education is not a guarantee for a job. Certainly,
employment rates are much higher for those with higher levels of education – but more than one third
of those with vocational training, at secondary or tertiary level, are not in a job (Figure 7). Data from
the LFS suggest that unemployment rates for those with tertiary education increased between 2007
and 2011.

The conclusions are that both firms and workers appear to consider that there is a skills gap. Labor
relevant skills are not equal to years of school, which measures quantity, and not content, vocation or
quality of education. A look into the skills gap in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia suggests
that the skills gap in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia does not seem to be related to under-
education, but to lack of relevance of existing training. This can be due to the fact that students make
the “wrong” choices in terms of vocations – suggesting that signals and incentives systems are not
working well in terms of what jobs are in demand – and/or due to low quality of education. The next

4. Understanding the skills gap

The surveys suggest that firms in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia look for a range of
occupations at different skills levels although the type of occupation in demand differs depending on
the hiring sectors. Beyond job technical skills, however, firms are quite similar in their expectations:
workers are expected to be able to solve problems, work in teams, work independently and manage
their time well, and be ambitious, and there are skills gaps in these areas.


4.1      Employers look for a range of occupations and skills

Firms in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are looking for people across a range of
occupations, both those intense in New Economy Skills and occupations with Traditional Skills. The
occupational category with highest demand – by far – was for plant and machine operators, while
demand for technicians was very low (Figure 8).
Nonetheless, firms differ significantly in their hiring needs, depending on the sector where they
operate. The automotive industry is looking for workers across virtually all occupational categories,
including professionals with New Economy Skills. Manufacturing sectors other than automotive,
textiles and food industries are looking mostly for Traditional Skills occupations, especially plant and
machine operators. The contrasts in the two services sectors are even more significant: the ICT sector
is predominantly looking for professionals, technicians and sales workers; the more traditional
logistics services sector is essentially looking for drivers (Figure 9). These numbers reflect hiring in one
year only. Nonetheless, the wide variation of demand across occupations suggests that it is not
primarily the occupational structure that is a problem (e.g., not enough available drivers or machine
operators). Indeed, the demand for different occupations can change from year to year, and
appropriate information systems are needed to inform workers, students and policy makers of
potential demand.

At a more disaggregated level, many skills needs cut across sector specific occupational needs.
Irrespective of sector, when asked to rank different types of skills, both technical, general cognitive,
and socio-emotional skills, firms concur in their appreciation and ranking of skills. Job technical skills,
and the ability to stay on task and want to see it well done, matters significantly (a result which is
consistent with the results from other ECA countries, see World Bank 2015).
As expected, demand for skills in New Economy Skills occupations does indeed focus on “new
economy skills”: aside from job technical skills, skills such as leadership, communication, and problem
solving skills are highly rated. For Traditional Skills occupations, conversely, it makes sense that time
management, the ability to work without supervision, and team work, include the most important
skills. Across occupations, conscientiousness – the ability to stay on task and do it well – is most highly
rated among the personal characteristics (Figure 10 and Figure 11). But it is also interesting to note
what skills are not in demand. Compared to other skills, English and other foreign languages hold
limited value for Macedonian employers. This may speak of limited size and international integration
of many Macedonian firms.

4.2     Managerial and routine manual skills are missing among workers

Skills gaps among current employees are most serious for hard-to-hire occupations. Skills gaps are
not defined by what kind of skills are in demand – skills gaps arise when certain skills are in demand
and not sufficiently available for hire. Hence, the employer survey also asked firms about what
occupations and skills display the most important skills gaps in the current work force, in the sense of
workers not having the skills needed to meet the firms’ objectives. The reported skills gap among
existing employees coincide with those occupations for which it was difficult to hire because of skills
deficiencies: managers, and some Traditional Skills occupations in high demand (Figure 13).

Managerial capacity and sales personnel are lacking in all sectors. Again, when looking at
occupations, sectors matter for the occupations for which skills gaps are most significant (Table 2).
There are skills gaps for the technical routine tasks typically required in each sector – agriculture and
food processing workers for the food products sector, textile machine operators for textiles,

                                                                                                                        25
assemblers for automotive components, drivers for logistics, and wood workers, electronics workers,
and so on for other manufacturing sectors. For the ICT sector, there are no such significant gaps for
Traditional Skills occupations. Instead, a host of New Economy Skills Occupations are missing. But
across sectors, there is clearly an important skills gap for managers, and for sales personnel.2

The kind of occupations that employers say are fraught with skills gaps, are also skills intensive, but
there are clear differences depending on the kind of tasks involved in the job. More particularly, for
New Economy Skills occupations, they concern an array of cognitive and socio-emotional skills
(communication and people skills). For Traditional Skills jobs, the skills intensity is high in basic
cognitive (reading, numeracy) and people skills. Overall, a range of skills are needed and lacking, much
beyond specific technical skills.

 The STEP surveys are not the only source of information pointing to a concern for managerial capacity. In the
Executive Opinion Survey in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report, FYR Macedonia
ranks number 102 among 140 countries in terms of reliance on professional management (World Economic
Forum, 2016).

4.3      The distribution and use of skills is uneven in the population

Although skills gaps are a generic feature in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, some are
significantly more disadvantaged than others. The most notable differences regard ethnic groups.
First, access to education differs significantly. Adults with Macedonian ethnicity have more than two
years of schooling on average than other ethnic groups living in the country. Moreover, the education
gaps are not falling over time: they are as high for those aged between 25 and 49, as for those above
age 50. These gaps translate into low participation of non-Macedonian ethnicities in post-secondary
education – only 20 percent of those in the Albanian ethnic group, and fewer of the “other” group,
have completed some form of post-secondary education. More than half of those with non-

                                                                                                                27
Macedonian ethnicity have at most completed lower secondary education. These differences in
education and training as well as in labor market outcomes are likely related to several interrelated
constraints on the demand and supply side of education, including aspirational and information gaps
as well as social norms that limit demand for training for some groups.

These differences spill over into skills gaps. In general, women and men, the young as well as the old,
are literate, judging from a basic literacy test administered in the STEP household survey (Figure 17
a).3 However, even basic literacy is completely lacking for certain ethnicities (which possibly includes
Roma, although we cannot ascertain this). Although Macedonian adults do better than others, there
is also a significant difference between Albanian and the “other” group, among whom more than
twenty percent are, in fact illiterate, even in this very basic sense. Moreover, the intensity of skills use
is also considerably higher for workers with Macedonian ethnicity compared to Albanian or other
ethnic groups. The differences are particularly significant for the “other group” with respect to skills
used on the job. Illiteracy not only affects employment opportunities but is an effective barrier to
further skills development.

 Macedonia conducted only the “partial literacy assessment,” in which on ly the General Booklet (Reading
Components and Core Literacy) was administered.

There is also some evidence of a digital divide in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Computer skills are particularly interesting, because as economies develop and the technology
content of production and consumption patterns increases, the importance of computer technologies
and the ability to understand them become a necessary skill. In more advanced economies, computers
are used not only by professionals and managers, but by health care workers at all levels, sales
personnel, and car mechanics. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, first, computers tend
to be used intensively, or not at all, on or off the job – much like in the case of literacy above, people
are either proficient (presumably, from working intensively with computers), or have no access to
computer technology. Second, the intensity of computer use is closely linked to age. In particular
workers aged 45 and above – born and largely educated prior to the transition into market economy
began – are not equipped with computer skills.

The conclusion is that close-up, the skills gaps are significant in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, and affects some adults more than others. There are skills gaps across a range of generic
skills, both cognitive and socio-emotional, that prevent firms from operating more effectively and that
holds back productivity and earnings opportunities for individual workers. Hence, skills gaps are not
only due to students choosing vocations that are not in demand, but to the fact that they do not learn

5. Why is there a skills gap in the former
   Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia?

What are the underlying causes of the skills gaps in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia?
The framework in the beginning of the report outlined key obstacles to an efficient skills development
system, focused on the actions and interactions between the key stakeholders: an education system
that is not responsive to labor market needs, employers that do neither train their workers nor
coordinate with peers to train jointly or reach out to the education system, and students that lack
information or incentives to choose vocations that increase chances of employment and ensure that
they develop important skills during their time in school and during training. The STEP surveys show
evidence of these kind of weaknesses. Quality, not level of schooling seems to be the major problem,
but firms do not compensate for this by training their workers or collaborating with the education
system.


5.1       Quality problems in the education system

Skills needs are not met through education systems. As seen, education levels are relatively high in
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -a majority of adults have, after all, completed at least
upper secondary education, and many have a vocational background. Yet, from the perspective of
employers, there are significant problems related to the quality of education that workers have
received. Only half of the firms consider that the skills needs of employers are adequately met; this
goes for the TVET system as well as for the general education system. Lack of practical skills is a
problem, but it is not the only one: good attitude and self-discipline, and relevant up-to date skills are
lacking.

Vocational training does not develop skills. Education pays off in terms of continued skills use, and
skills development on the jobs – those with higher levels of education unsurprisingly use more
cognitive and other skills on the job. However, the bulk of workers with major skills gaps have
education levels above lower secondary education (Figure 20, a). Many signs point to significant
inadequacies in the vocational training system, although this is the kind of training intended to provide
specifically for labor market entry. Those workers identified as having the most significant skills gaps
tended in fact to have vocational training (Figure 20, a), irrespective of the economic sector they are
employed in. And there are, in fact, big differences in terms of skills use, between workers with
vocational training and general education at tertiary level in (Figure 20, b). This is consistent with the
evidence presented above, in section 3, namely that many of those with tertiary vocational training
consider themselves overeducated for their jobs.

5.2        Firms do not train their workers

Skills development is also held back as because firms are not taking steps to train their workers or
engage in training and skills development in a systemic way. There are several potential reasons why
firms may not find skills development (here meaning training outside of normal on-the-job training)
worthwhile. One possibility – supported by the relatively poor evaluation by firms of the education
system - is that workers are simply not at the level where they are trainable: firms are not prepared
to invest in building general skills that should have been part of worker’s education and training prior
to entering working life, but without such basic and intermediary skills, firm specific training is not
possible. Another underlying cause could be a low level of organization on the employer side that
preclude cost effective solutions to training: each firm finds it too costly to engage in skills
development, although a joint effort with other firms, exploring economies of scale, would in fact pay
off. It is also possible that employers and especially in smaller firms, have limited information on the
value of investing in skills development. On average, only about one in four firms do in fact provide
training (Figure 21, a and b). Firms with international links and foreign participation, notably the
automotive industry, and firms with high intensity of new economy skills, specifically the ICT sector,
make up a significant exception: they train workers, and are attempting to engage with the education
sector, although they do not generally interact at a more systemic level. It is perhaps not surprising
that the forms of training, when it happens, differ between different occupations. For traditional skills
occupations, training is more internal – learning more repetitive and in some cases machine specific

externally provided training.

5.3      Firms and education systems are disconnected

In general, Macedonian firms are not linked with the education system. As seen in Figure 22, less
than ten percent of firms, on average, are actually regularly in contact with educational institutions in

                                                                                                                                  33
some form. The ICT and automotive industries again make up significant exceptions, however.
Whereas these two sectors engage with education institutions for both New Economy Skills and
Traditional Skills occupations, their specific skills needs profiles are also in evidence: the automotive
industry is much more likely to be engaging with skills development institutions for Traditional Skills,
while the ICT sector is engaging more significantly for New Economy Skills.
The interface between employers and educational institutions is largely focused on placing workers
in educational institutions, or placing students for internships in firms. These forms of interchange
are a significant pillar of any skills development system, but are not likely to provide enough direct
contact and input from firms to educational systems and vice versa. Among firms who do engage with
education institutions, very few provide input at a systemic or quality enhancing level, which would
include for example developing curricula, help in the student intake process, or participate in the
testing of skills.

5.4     Labor markets do not send the right signals

Diplomas matter more than skills in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, setting it apart
from more modern economies. Skills gaps are also very much a result of the choices students make –
what to study, and where to study. Both information and incentive gaps may play a role. If students
are not well informed about what work opportunities will pay off, or where/which institutional track
and institution provides the best form of training for a particular vocation, they are less able to make
choices that respond to labor market needs. If skills are not well rewarded, the incentive to focus on
quality education is also lower. A general conclusion from recent studies on the determinants of
earnings is that at least in well-functioning labor markets, skills are what matters: once skills are
considered, education by itself is much less significant. In other words, it is the output and result of
the education system rather than the signaling value of a specific diploma, that matters. However, in
the case of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, skills are not among the key determinant of
earnings (Figure 24). Even compared to other ECA countries, Macedonia stands out for the strong role
that education (rather than actual skills) play in determining wages, and the fact that skills (especially
soft skills) matter much less in terms of hourly wages. Thus, unlike in most countries, diplomas, not
skills, are rewarded in labor markets. This could suggest that there are not enough incentives to
develop labor market relevant skills, even if students know what those skills are – getting a diploma,
perhaps from an institution which provides networks in the world of work, or that gives access to
public employment, is more important.

The advantages of public sector jobs– salary and benefit levels, relatively secure employment, status
– may in fact contribute to increasing the skills gaps at the high-end level. The high – and increasing
– share of tertiary educated workers in the public sector suggests that there are incentives for those
with post secondary education to get a job in the public sector (Figure 25, left graph). This would both
affect the kind of educational (and skills development) path that students chose, and their willingness
to hold out for a job in the public sector, rather than looking for one in the private sector. But there is
a de facto difference in the level of skills used in the public versus the private sector (Figure 25, right
graph). Private sector workers are much less likely to read or write on the job, and to intensively be
interacting with different people and teams, use computers, solve problems or work autonomously.
This concentration of skills in the public sector may in fact be both a result of low general
sophistication of production and services in the private sector, and a cause of skills gaps there.

6. Addressing the skills gap

The STEPs surveys show evidence of skills gaps and the negative consequences for jobs and
productivity growth. Employers find it difficult to identify skilled workers for the jobs, and this is true
for a range of different kinds of occupations. These firms also identify gaps in what their current
workforce knows and what would be needed to do the job well. These gaps include job-specific
technical skills but also generic competencies like communication, problem solving, time
management, and team work. Many workers, on the other hand, consider their skills and jobs
mismatched, especially those with vocational training who feel overeducated for their jobs.
These skills gaps show that the skills development system in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia needs strengthening. Returning to the framework presented in Section 2, there are issues
with the choices students (can) make, the quality of training provided by the educational institutions,
and the signals labor market sends. Moreover, different stakeholders do not interact sufficiently to
improve matters. First, there are manifest quality problems in the education system, even at higher
levels, and inequities in access. Once employed, workers have little access to training within firms,
except those working in the ICT and automotive industries, both of which are finding difficulties in
identifying skilled workers. Labor markets are not providing signals that favor skills development for
private sector employment: education levels, rather than the actual skills that education has imparted
on workers, explain differences in earnings between workers.
Coordination and collaboration is weak. There is also very limited interaction between the private
sector and training institutions, neither at the strategic level (curricula development, certification,
industry-wide training centers) not at the “tactical” level (cooperation on work-based learning, like
apprenticeships and internships). These conclusions are in line with those emanating from the World
Bank’s SABER analysis of work force skills development systems in the country, focusing on the TVET
system in particular. This review of strategy, system oversight and service delivery suggests that there
is a lack of coordination along several dimensions: within the public sector, within the private sector,
and between the private sector and the public sector, with negative effects on the quality and
targeting of training (World Bank, 2014). The education and training sector remains disconnected from
the private sector (employers) and as a result, much of the training provided lacks relevance for labor
markets. Moreover, there are no collaborative mechanisms for forecasting labor market needs, and
data collection and information systems remain underdeveloped. More generally, the system is
centralized and “top-down”, rendering it more rigid and less attuned to the actual needs in the private
sector. This lack of coordination and collaboration results in underinvestment in skills by all parties –
concerted and coordinated action is needed for actions to pay of to each side.
What can be done? Figure 26, drawn from a recent research report on demand and supply of skills in
some countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, summarizes different areas of reforms to help (i)
employers train their workers and collaborate with other employers and education systems more
broadly; (ii) education systems respond to student and labor market needs; (iii) students and current
workers to invest in the right skills; and (iv) labor markets signal support for these skills.

       Firms hesitate to train workers because of fear of losing trained workers to other firms
 thus having borne the cost but not reaped the benefit of training. In the former Yugoslav Republic
    Macedonia, firms appear to expect the formal education system to provide skills, and are not
   in bridging this gap themselves. Policy can then help firms by providing tax and other forms of
  incentives for training, or provide platforms that help firms coordinate between themselves and
costs (and risks) equally. For example, the National Qualifications Framework is under reform, and
 involvement of employers in this project is critical to ensure its relevance. Policy can also focus on
       strengthening industrial and employer organizations. Another avenue to explore is the
   of apprenticeships systems. These dual education systems effectively share the cost of training
  firms (who provide training to workers on the job) and workers (who are hired at lower wages).
     Estimates prepared for a public-private skills development project in Slovakia suggest that

                Box 3: Young Stars - Austrian-Slovakian Dual VET in the Nitra Region

The Slovak Republic is marred by imbalances in the labor market, where youth unemployment rates
are high while there are many unfilled vacancies for skilled workers. Austrian firms had identified a
significant shortage in the area of metal work and mechantronics skills. In order to help firms meet
their demand for skilled workers, the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber supported piloting a dual
training system in the Nitra Region.

The “Young Stars” project is a wide multi-stakeholder collaboration involving 8 companies (4
Austrian, 2 German, 2 Slovakian), the Slovak Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport and
the local authorities in charge of education and youth, a local VET school, the Slovak Employer
Association, the Automotive Industry Association of Slovak Republic, an Austrian Research Institute
focusing on TVET, and the Austrian Ministry of Science, Research and Economy. The project also
served as an input to the Slovak authorities’ reform process as they look towards establishing
elements of a dual training system.

Through the project, a dual training system has been developed combining 40 percent class-room
learning with 60 percent apprenticeship training in companies. Curricula have been adapted to
business needs. Upon graduation, students receive a diploma and certificate of apprenticeship.

Based on Austria’s experience of dual training, the project is based on experience of good practice.
There are several companies involved, providing economies of scales, diversifying risk and
employment opportunities, reducing competition bias, and increasing the transferability of skills.
These firms are geographically close to one another and the school, reducing traveling costs for
students. They have been willing to collaborate between themselves to arrive at a common training
program and prepared to deal with schools and local and central government institutions. These
companies have agreed to a multi-annual commitment and to a minimum number of apprentices
per year they take in. They provide human resources and equipment for the on-the job training.
Companies and the school together prepare trainers and jointly take in applicants and unsuited
applicants can still be eliminated after the training has started.

Estimates by one of the participating Austrian companies suggest that compared to training existing
workers, dual vocational training is a cost-effective albeit slower way of getting skilled workers.
Although it is estimated to take between one to two years longer for an apprentice to be trained,
the lower cost of stipends and wages to student, compared to a full-time employee, makes it a
significantly cheaper option (less than one third of the cost, in fact). In their experience, apprentices
stay on as employees after graduation, by which time they have developed into co-workers, have
absorbed company culture, and have the skills to do their jobs well. The apprenticeship system also
permits strategic long- term planning of staffing.

The success of the “Young Star” pilot led to a broader reform the Slovakian TVET system, with many
lessons learned from the pilot now being mainstreamed throughout the country.

Education systems are weakened by a lack of strategic direction, a lack of social dialogue to strengthen
the relevance of training to firms and workers, and a lack of both quality assurance mechanisms, and,
related to this, alternative pathways into different vocations. Spending on education by the
Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (4.1 percent of GDP) is high by regional

                                                                                                       40
standards, but has not translated into stronger performance on international student tests. Resources
are not allocated according to measures of quality of services, reducing the incentives for educational
institutions to aim for excellence. Public authorities should be capacitated to lead the reform process,
coordinate stakeholders, and collect and disseminate information related to training and labor market
prospects.
Students and workers need help to acquire the basic education, including soft skills, that is necessary
to adopt new and more advanced skills, including technical skills, entrepreneurial skills and generic
soft and analytical skills. But they also need assistance in making informed decisions in identifying
career paths that take into account their aptitudes and inclinations, but also the jobs and earnings
prospects from different types of training (as well as the quality of training available at different
institutions). Experience from other countries suggest that labor market observatories and related
research functions can assist both students, workers and potential employers in making choices
regarding skills development. Similarly, effective career guidance in primary and secondary school can
improve efficiency in both education and labor markets. Effective career guidance systems are
characterized by independence (from schools), strong collaboration between different stakeholders,
including private sector employees, and early and frequent exposure to the world of work. Efforts to
collect and disseminate pertinent labor market and education information are underway in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia but not yet well established.
Incentive systems are not working towards more jobs and higher productivity. As such, even with
more information and more training opportunities, students may not choose vocations that close the
skills gaps in the private sector. In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, diplomas, not skills,
are rewarded with higher earnings. Public sector jobs, moreover, seem to be preferred over private
sector jobs, and also use skills more intensively. This calls for labor codes and collective bargaining
agreements that reflect merit, not seniority or personal characteristics such as gender and age, and
for innovative screening processes, including direct skills testing, that reduce the need for diplomas as
the only signaling of competencies in labor markets.
