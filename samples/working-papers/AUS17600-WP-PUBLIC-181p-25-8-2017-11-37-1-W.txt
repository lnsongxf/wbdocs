Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models                          ix
Executive Summary
Rationale to Examine the Conditions for Sustainable
Rural Water Services
The recently issued baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) states that
844 million people in 2015 remain without access to basic water services, and an estimated
2.1 billion without access to safely managed drinking water services, the large majority of
those living in rural areas (WHO and UNICEF 2017).
  Failure by governments and development partners to ensure sustained access to basic
water supplies in rural areas is, to a large extent, the result of inadequate investment to
deliver infrastructure where needed. It is also the result of a failure to ensure that infrastruc-
ture, once in place, continues to effectively provide the expected services over time.
Impressive gains from the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era remain fragile and at
risk, with various empirical studies indicating that 30 percent to 40 percent of rural water
infrastructure is not functioning or functions below expected service levels (RWSN 2010).
  With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), governments have
committed to ensure universal access to water, to close the urban-rural and equity gap, and
to deliver higher levels of services in terms of quality, accessibility, and reliability. This
implies that a shift in policies and resource allocation is increasingly urgent, going beyond
infrastructure delivery and addressing the longer term sustainable management and
financing of rural water services. Such a shift needs to respond to well-known capacity
gaps for rural water service delivery, which are often exacerbated by decentralization pro-
cesses (Bakalian et al. 2009; Van Ginneken et al. 2011). The SDGs thus pose a triple chal-
lenge: to reach unserved population groups, to improve service levels, and to sustain
existing and future services.
  The issue of the sustainability of rural service provision is not new, and has received wide-
spread attention since the international decade on water and sanitation (1981–90). Initially,
the focus to address scheme failure was at the level of the community, particularly during
the implementation phase of new schemes. The Demand-Responsive Approach (DRA) was
elaborated in the 1990s to ensure that interventions respond better to community needs.
However, DRA proved insufficient to address the requirements for support mechanisms to
rural populations beyond project implementation (World Bank 2012). Since the 2000s, more
emphasis has been placed on post construction support to rural service providers, profes-
sionalization, and diversification of service delivery models, including various forms of
private sector involvement (Smits and Lockwood 2011). With increasing demand for higher
service levels, a service delivery approach is now emerging. This approach recognizes the
importance of wider systems of governance and the enabling environment, political econ-
omy aspects, life cycle costs, and the role of local institutions (Whaley and Cleaver 2017).
In this context, it has become essential to better understand the factors of sustainability for
rural water services.

      Aim, Scope and Limitation of the Assessment
      This assessment uses a multi-country case study approach to identify good practices and
      challenges toward building sector capacity and strengthening sustainable service delivery
      models for rural areas. The overall aim is to contribute to the global knowledge base on what
      countries are doing to improve the conditions that are likely to have a bearing on the long-
      term sustainability of rural water services. The case studies also serve to provide policy
      guidance and practical recommendations to country teams and governments on how to
      improve the sustainability of their service delivery approach.
        This assessment does not explicitly focus on the planning, design, and implementation
      phase of developing water supply facilities, which is equally critical especially for predicting
      short-term functionality rates. Rather, it analyzes the ongoing service delivery approach for
      rural water. The scope of the study did not allow for primary data collection at the level of
      water schemes within the 16 countries. A parallel study was first commissioned by the World
      Bank to better define sustainability metrics, in order to inform further research (World Bank,
      forthcoming).
        In summary, recognizing the limitations of the DRA, the emergence of various manage-
      ment models, the identified need for ongoing support to rural service providers, and the
      critical role of enabling institutions and policies beyond the community-level, the added
      value of this assessment lies in:

      •	 The development of a comprehensive analytical framework that can be used to analyze
        and operationalize a more sustainable service delivery approach for rural water supply

      •	 The rich set of cases and good practices from the 16 countries informing the global body of
        “knowledge in implementation”

      •	 The formulation of recommendations and policy directions to improve the sustainabil-
        ity of services depending on sector development stage and the rural service delivery
        context



      Country Selection
      The following countries were selected, based on a diverse range of socioeconomic context,
      regional representation, and presence of World Bank operations: Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil
      (state of Ceará), China (Zhejiang and Shaanxi provinces), Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India
      (Punjab and Uttarakhand states), Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Morocco, Nepal,
      Nicaragua, the Philippines, Tanzania, and Vietnam. While some countries have made sig-
      nificant progress in improving access to rural water services (for example, Benin, Brazil,
      China, Nepal, and Vietnam), others still face challenges in providing basic levels of service
      to a majority of the rural population (for example, in Tanzania, Haiti, and Ethiopia). For
      most countries, access to piped water services onto premises remains low. Only Brazil,
      China, and the Kyrgyz Republic provide such services at scale, with 70 percent, 55 percent

   and 42 percent respectively. Middle-income countries, such as Vietnam and Indonesia, face
   the challenge of increasing service levels as only 10 percent and 9 percent of their rural
   populations benefit from piped supplies at the household level.


   The Building Blocks of Sustainability
   The analytical framework of the study is based on five “building blocks” of sustainability:
   institutional capacity, financing, asset management, water resources management, and
   monitoring and regulatory oversight (see figure ES.1). These building blocks, which repre-
   sent the progress countries have made in putting in place the optimum conditions for sus-
   tainability of service provision, were identified based on previous research, mainly from the
   Sustainable Services at Scale project1, validated through consultation with World Bank staff.
   The framework recognizes three institutional levels: national level (through legislation,
   policy, and the establishment of national authorities), service authority level (authorities
   with responsibilities for delivering services, often local governments) and service provision
   level. How services are organized, and which national and local policies and mechanisms
   are in place to facilitate services, define the service delivery model. In this assessment, ser-
   vice delivery models refer to the management model (for example, community-based
   management, or private operator), in addition to the full complement of policies, capacities,
   regulations, and financing in support of it.

      A Scoring to Assess Progress toward Sustainability
      To provide a snapshot assessment of each country’s progress in establishing the conditions
      for sustainable rural water services, a scoring is applied at two levels based on a set of ques-
      tions pertaining to the five building blocks (see Appendix B). Firstly, the assessment consid-
      ered progress realized at sector level and whether essential conditions for sustainability
      have been put in place in the enabling environment. Secondly, the assessment examines
      whether and how this progress is reflected at service delivery level, considering each of the
      formally established service delivery models in a country. Scores are aggregated at country
      level for each building block and combined into a country sector sustainability score, as well
      as by service delivery model, to allow for an analysis across countries and service delivery
      models to determine common trends, strengths, and weaknesses. It should be noted that
      for some of the larger countries (Brazil, China, and India) the analysis was carried out in one
      or two states or provinces. Assessments were based on secondary data and desk reviews
      combined with primary data from interviews with key informants in-country.


      Different Service Delivery Models are Operating Across Different
      Rural Population Segments
      While the community-based management model remains the dominant service delivery
      model, a differentiation of service delivery models based on local context was found.
      In upper-middle income and higher income countries, an emerging trend toward urban util-
      ities integrating peri-urban and denser rural populations into their service areas was seen
      (China, Morocco, the Philippines). Aggregated management models, under which service
      providers manage multiple rural centers, were also identified (for example, India’s multi-­
      village schemes). Management delegated to private operators was found for rural small
      towns (Haiti, Bangladesh, Vietnam), sometimes even managing standalone systems in their
      service areas (for example, Benin). Service levels, service delivery models and the most
      common challenges for three main population segments are illustrated in figure ES.2.


      Progress Realized in Establishing Sustainable Services:
      Lessons and Challenges
      By aggregating the findings from the 16 cases, a global picture emerges in terms of how far
      the building blocks for sustainability are progressing across different country contexts and
      service delivery models, recognizing that sector governance and country context will have a
      bearing on the scores (see table ES.1). Generally, institutional capacity has advanced fur-
      thest, with financing, and monitoring and regulation following. The relatively low scores for
      asset management indicate the novelty of the concept for rural water supplies in many
      countries. Low scores are found for water resources management, except for Morocco and
      Ceará state in Brazil, both with a long tradition in water resources management. Total sus-
      tainability scores at sector level show high performers such as Brazil, China, and Morocco,
      and countries  that are less advanced in putting in place the building blocks for

                      Institutional Capacity
                      Good progress has been made, particularly at national level, to improve institutional capacity
                      and put in place policies and guiding frameworks for sustainable service delivery. Strong insti-
                      tutional capacity is found where rural water is a development priority, translating into clear
                      mandates for national institutions to plan infrastructure development in consultation with
                      local authorities: this was the case in Morocco, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
                      Both Ethiopia and Benin have shown persistent sector leadership: Benin in reforming the rural
                      water sector transitioning to professional private sector management models, and Ethiopia
                      through the establishment of a sector-wide approach, known as the One WASH National
                      Program. In several countries, national programs have moved beyond infrastructure provision
                      and aim to support local governments in fulfilling their mandates for service provision.
                      However, local governments have not often made that shift and prioritize infrastructure over
                      post construction support to service providers and monitoring. At service provision level,
                      good institutional capacity is seen when service providers benefit from capacity building

      a key component of rural water supply programs, such as in Indonesia, Benin, Brazil, India,
      and Tanzania. Services were typically provided by i) local governments; ii) federations or

      entities or utilities, mandated and well-funded to do so.


      Financing
      The rural water sector has benefited from increased capital investments, delivered as part of
      national investment plans. However, weaker arrangements were found for operational costs
      and capital maintenance. Good practices were found in over half of the countries where
      governments planned capital investments in rural water services based on sector-wide
      approaches and where investments are systematically co-financed through national and

local tax revenues, augmented with development partner transfers. Driven by the access
agenda, a common challenge remains implementing sustainable financing mechanisms to
cover recurrent costs, capital maintenance, and capital replacement, whether through tar-
iffs, taxes, or transfers. Tariff policies remain urban-biased, ill-defined, and not tailored to
the rural context. They tend to require full cost recovery, without detailed guidelines, or
differentiation between operational, capital maintenance and capital replacement costs,
and lack mechanisms for enforcement. A common approach is that local governments are
called to the rescue upon scheme failure through a “fix-on-failure” rather than a planned
life-cycle cost approach. Lack of political prioritization by service authorities further puts
rural water schemes at risk. Tariff guidelines that accurately define and allocate responsibil-
ity for financing different life cycle costs, emerge as good examples (for example, Brazil). The
implementation of such guidelines can help operationalize policies at local level and over-
come low willingness-to-charge by service authorities. Affordability constraints by rural
households were not identified as a critical issue in the study countries (see Appendix F for
details). Other good practices identified to increase the financial sustainability of rural water
services are: i) assessment of realistic demand and flexible design standards; ii) investments
in communications to transition to metered house connections; iii) diversify management
models with utility and private sector models; iv) use of result-based financing to incentiv-
ize service delivery focus.


Asset Management
Asset management is a relatively new concept in the rural water sector. Regardless of eco-
nomic development, half of the countries still need to address basic issues such as clarity
around asset ownership, clearly defining responsibilities for capital maintenance and
renewal, and carrying out first-time inventories or water point mapping exercises. Over half
of the countries have clear ownership arrangements, mostly retaining ownership with
the service authority, or allowing options for joint ownership depending on the financier of
the assets. Common challenges are that de-facto practices conflict with legislation.
Incomplete legal frameworks, and overlapping responsibilities at different levels of govern-
ment, add to the ambiguity in asset management responsibilities (the Philippines,
Bangladesh, and Indonesia). Moreover, the delegation process to the service provider is
rarely supported by a clear allocation of responsibilities for asset repairs and maintenance,
particularly regarding what is understood by “minor repairs” (often by the service provider)
and “large repairs” (often by the service authority). Asset management of small water
schemes, managed by communities or local governments, is mostly absent. Better scores for
asset management at service provider level are found in contexts with urban and regional
utilities, private sector models, or multi-village schemes with aggregated, professionalized
management arrangements, such as the case in Benin, China, India, Morocco, Nicaragua,
and Vietnam. Ghana is a good example where the government has identified: i) clear asset
ownership; ii) allocation of responsibilities for different asset maintenance categories;

        iii)  financing mechanisms, iv) and has prepared asset management guidance documents
        and tools. Some innovative financing mechanisms for capital maintenance of rural schemes
        were identified, for example, pooled fund arrangements, sourced from tariff revenues and
        local taxes (China and Ghana).

        Water Resources Management
        Most countries have legal frameworks for water resources management that prioritize allo-
        cation to the domestic water supply. However, water resources management bodies at
        sub-basin or local levels remain weak in the majority of countries. Only in a few countries do
        sub-basin or local WRM bodies have rural drinking water interests represented through rural
        service providers or service authorities. Good practices in both policy and operations are
        seen in water-scarce environments, such as Morocco and Ceará state in Brazil, both of which
        have a long tradition of water resources management, driven by their physical water ­scarcity.
        However, such water resources management institutions are not present in all water scarce
        contexts (for example Punjab in India). Other examples of good practices have emerged,
        including: i) proactive measures by drinking water entities to recharge aquifers, set up
        ­
        aquifer management initiatives, and integrate catchment protection and management in
        rural water programs (India, Nicaragua); and ii) local-level planning initiatives to enhance
        collaboration among water users, local governments, communities, and water resources
        management entities (Nepal). Advanced practices such as water safety programming
        and  vulnerability assessments were only found for urban utilities serving rural areas.
        Thus  far, adapting such approaches to a rural context with fragmented service providers
        has been challenging.

        Monitoring and Regulatory Oversight
        Monitoring is an area that has witnessed significant progress in many countries, although
        wealthier countries have advanced more, such as China (for utilities and multi-village
        schemes), Morocco, India, the Philippines, and Nicaragua. Monitoring is increasingly receiv-
        ing attention, with emerging national monitoring systems under development or improve-
        ment, for example in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Ghana. Unsurprisingly, monitoring and
        regulation tend to be better organized for public utilities, and in some cases for private
        operators. A common challenge is to make the transition from a water point mapping exer-
        cise toward a well-functioning monitoring platform that is updated and receives regular
        financing from central and local government budgets. Challenges persist in the proactive
        use  of monitoring outputs to take remedial actions, improve performance, and inform
        programming. Good practices are nation (or state) wide systems, such as Nicaragua’s and
        Uttarakhand’s monitoring systems, which include indicators on scheme assets, functional-
        ity, service levels, scheme performance, and sustainability indicators indicating which com-
        munities need support to prevent (further) scheme failure (for example, SIASAR in
        Nicaragua). Although most countries have defined service standards, regulatory oversight is
        still nascent in many countries, especially in terms of the development of and adherence to


xviii   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
tariff guidelines. Emerging good practices promoting better oversight and accountability for
rural services are: i) a national water registry for all small operators to bring them under reg-
ulatory oversight, and introduction of light-handed regulation tailored to the capacities of
operators to comply (the Philippines); ii) assignment of dedicated agencies or units to over-
see the sector, as in China, Nicaragua, and the Kyrgyz Republic, although political interfer-
ence remains challenging; iii) introduction of social accountability measures and a feedback
mechanism (India); and iv) regulation of private operators under contract with local govern-
ments, with oversight by a national regulatory unit.


Lessons from Service Delivery Models
Table ES.2 illustrates to what extent sustainability conditions are met for various service
delivery models across all countries. The public utility provision appears the most robust,
with all the building blocks furthest advanced. Introducing private sector provision provides

     an opportunity to improve the sustainability of services, despite mixed country experiences
     and often the modest scale of such models in any country. There is a wealth of experience
     with community-based management, present in all countries but Benin, although the
     sustainability of the model remains to be strengthened. Some countries, such Morocco,
     India, Indonesia, and Brazil, are leading the way through aggregated management arrange-
     ments, decentralization reforms, nationwide monitoring and systematic post construction
     support. Direct local government provision tends to perform poorly, especially in low capac-
     ity environments. Despite the various efforts to promote supported self-supply as a formal
     service delivery model, there is a remarkable lack of documentation critical to convince
     policy makers of the benefits of this model for remote and dispersed communities. Further
     lessons are included in box ES.1.




           BOX ES.1.   Lessons for Service Delivery Models


           Community-based management model: Although community management is formally
           recognized in all countries, the majority of community organizations are neither legally
           established nor supported by service authorities. However, the model scored higher,
           especially on institutional capacity and financing, in cases where there is structural
           support. This would ideally include support for operations and maintenance, financial
           support on major repairs, and access to administrative and institutional assistance and
           training opportunities. Such models are found in various forms, but principally through
           aggregation or federation of service providers and professional supervision. Examples
           are the Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan, which is a designated state agency for backstopping
           of Water Supply and Sanitation Committees, as well as the three-tier support system
           in Ceará, where i) water supply associations carry out basic daily tasks, ii) activities that
           require economies of scale are carried out by federations, and iii) the state utility pro-
           vides monitoring and supervision and takes care of new system development and major
           rehabilitation. Community organizations responsible for distribution only, with utilities
           responsible for bulk supply, score better on dimensions of sustainability (Morocco,
           Ghana).

           Direct local government provision: All variants of the local government provision model
           scored low and were particularly weak in terms of institutional capacity and financing.
           Water supply units within local government administrations are not corporatized enti-
           ties and often fail to operate along commercial lines, without the possibility to ring-
           fence water operations from the general budget. In some countries, the model appears
           as an interim solution (Benin), while in others, more permanent arrangements are found
           for various reasons: i) no technical assistance to set up municipal enterprises or joint
           stock companies or ii) no clear guidance or regulations to delegate to private o
                                                                                          ­ perators

      (for example, in Vietnam). Central governments can support direct government pro-
      vision in several ways, such as with technical assistance for i) project preparation to
      ensure demand-responsiveness, ii) tariff guidance and ring-fencing budgets, or iii) legal
      support to transition to other management models.

      Public utility provision: Public utility provision for rural water was found to exhibit the
      best conditions for sustainability, although it is present only in China, Morocco, and the
      Philippines, where rural villages are integrated into their service areas. Public utilities
      tend to show professional management of water assets, are staffed with more qualified
      personnel, have better financial capacity and access to funding, and are subject to
      monitoring and regulation. However, the rural water sector does not present attractive
      commercial revenue opportunities for such utilities. Obligatory service mandates for
      rural areas, combined with subsidies as incentives, are used to facilitate expansion.
      Integrating rural areas under public utilities’ service areas comes with challenges, such
      as extending billing and collection services and monitoring to remote areas, and
      ensuring an adequate financial position of the utility.

      Private sector provision: This model consistently scored well on financing, and to some
      extent on asset management and monitoring. Private sector participation was found
      through a range of contractual mechanisms, from build, operate and transfer (Bangla-
      desh) to joint stock companies (Vietnam) and lease and concession contracts (Benin).
      In China, community enterprises commercially manage multi-village schemes. Private
      sector provision has also successfully mobilized private equity and commercial finance
      (Benin and Vietnam). Result-based subsidies have been used to leverage private invest-
      ment. Successful experiences with private sector participation emerge from long-term
      development partner engagement in the sector to address upstream legal and policy
      gaps, support due diligence, provide transaction support and assistance to national
      and local governments, and build capacity of private operators. Private sector models
      still operate at a small scale or are scaling up, and critical gaps need to be addressed to
      realize their full potential.

      Supported self-supply: Ethiopia is the only country with a supported self-supply pro-
      gram. In a few countries, supported self-supply is a de facto model, receiving limited
      support from national entities and service authorities (Vietnam, Brazil). This inter-
      est reflects the recognition that in dispersed settings, communal systems may not
      be feasible. In Bangladesh, where two-thirds of the rural population use individual
      supplies, there is no formalized support, despite the pressing need to improve water
      quality. In spite of efforts to promote supported self-supply as a formal model, there
      is a remarkable lack of documentation, which is critical to convince policy makers of
      the benefits of this model for remote and dispersed communities.

       Recommendations and Policy Directions
       Improving Sustainability Requires Actions at All Three Institutional Levels
       The five building blocks represent the ideal or optimum conditions for rural service delivery
       and frame the diagnostic of a country’s rural water sector. While some countries may have
       a number of these conditions in place, for others, establishing the building blocks will
       require adopting lengthy reforms in the sector. Gradual but persistent interventions will be
       needed, and countries will have to prioritize. There is evidence to suggest that even low-­
       income countries can make substantial progress on improving institutional capacity, financ-
       ing, and asset management, while in the face of competing priorities, robust monitoring
       systems should be addressed first, with regulatory oversight to be developed in later stages.
       All interventions should consider the three levels: the national enabling environment, ser-
       vice authority, and service provider. A comprehensive set of practical recommendations for
       each of the building blocks at each of the three institutional levels is included in section 5.1.


       Interventions Vary Based on Sector Development Stage and Rural Population Segment
       As the speed of reform and sector capacity vary from one country to another, the transition
       toward more sustainable services will follow a gradual path. Figure ES.3 shows a “ladder” with
       three stages or levels of rural water sector development. It illustrates how incremental prog-
       ress can be achieved from basic to intermediate, and from intermediate to an advanced stage
       of rural water sector development in a given country. This sector development trajectory
       needs to be put in the context of the changing landscape of rural service delivery, as countries
       will see different population segments develop at different paces, namely i) remote dispersed
       populations, ii) rural villages and growth centers, and iii) peri-urban and rural small towns.
         With the adoption of the SDGs and its focus on equity and universal access, country gov-
       ernments have in theory committed themselves to simultaneously addressing the chal-
       lenges across all population segments and leaving no one behind. Nevertheless, the biggest
       leap for many lower and lower-middle income country governments will be to respond to
       the demand for higher service levels from a growing middle class, and the transition to
       metered household connections. The country cases show that aggregation of rural service
       delivery can result in economies of scale, scope and more professional provision, either
       through public utilities, private sector operators, or well-supported federated community-­
       based providers. Of equal importance is the aggregation of technical support functions to
       service providers, especially for complex activities such as major repairs and rehabilitation.
       The analysis shows that future rural water policies must ensure that a wider range of rural
       providers will be more effectively supported and monitored.
         However, a challenge for all countries, including for upper-middle economies, is to
       develop adequate service delivery models for remote and dispersed rural populations, who
       continue to rely on either poorly supported community-based management or self-supply.
       Without new approaches, there is a danger that remote and dispersed rural populations will
       be left with stagnating service levels, whilst denser agglomerations will benefit from

                               tries, governments could formally adopt supported self-supply for remote and dispersed
                               populations with a focus on improving water quality aspects. This should not be seen as a
                               route for governments to abdicate their obligations, but rather as a way to support a man-
                               agement model better suited to reach the most remote and marginalized households.
                                 Which interventions to prioritize for which segment of the rural population will clearly
                               depend on the stage of rural water sector development in a country. Table ES.3 includes key
                               interventions that country governments could prioritize for each of the segments to transi-
                               tion from basic to intermediate and from intermediate to an advanced stage.

                               Future Policy Directions Require National Governments to Step-Up Their Engagement in
                               Rural Water Services and Increase Support to Service Authorities
                               Based on this multi-country assessment, box ES.2 summarizes key policy directions that

xxiv                           Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
                improve the sustainability of rural services. The message underpinning these policy recom-
                mendations is that national governments need to continue to play a major role and cannot
                discharge state responsibilities for essential services to rural-based citizens, communities,
                and weakly funded, low-capacity local governments. National governments are required to
                step up their engagement in policy, financing, and technical support domains, in order to
                make a dent in the triple challenge of rural service provision: i) expand services to the
                unserved, ii) improve service levels, and iii) sustain existing and future services.




BOX ES.2.   Policy Priorities to Improve the Sustainability of Rural Service Provision


Institutional capacity

1.	 Develop enabling policy and define institutional arrangements and functions for service authorities and
  rural service providers. Specifically:

  •	 Assign functions for postconstruction support to and monitoring of rural service providers and technical
     support to local governments, in line with decentralization policy

  •	 Define clearly the roles and responsibilities of different tiers of sub-national government
  •	 Formalize (a wider range of) management models in policies and develop policies for integration of rural
     areas under service areas of existing utility companies
2.	 Develop systems with sustainable funding flows for postconstruction support and technical assistance to
  rural service providers, including:

  •	 Technical and financial support, especially with respect to major repairs of rural water assets
  •	 Management and institutional support to ensure that (community-based) service providers keep functioning
  •	 Monitoring mechanisms to ensure that postconstruction support is effectively delivered by designated
     technical assistance providers or local governments


Financing

3.	 Adopt a financing policy and implement a tariff guideline for rural water that distinguishes the different
  life cycle cost elements of the full cost of service provision, with:

  •	 Different segments (geography, management model) having a different level of cost recovery through
     tariffs—that is, the full costs are funded through a different mix of taxes, transfers, and tariffs

  •	 Identification of sources of funds and responsibility for major repairs, capital maintenance, and asset
     replacement, combined with ring-fencing mechanisms (for example, maintenance funds, earmarking taxes)

  •	 Social pricing for the most vulnerable groups to ensure affordability

                                                                                                    box continues next page

       BOX ES.2.   Policy Priorities to Improve the Sustainability of Rural Service Provision (continued)


       Asset management

       4.	 Formalize asset ownership through legal frameworks and support service authorities—when assigned as
         asset holders—in the management of assets, through:

         •	 Asset inventories and asset condition assessments on a regular basis
         •	 Capacity building measures using asset management tools, and the gradual introduction of medium-term
            asset management plans


       Water resources management

       5.	 Strengthen representation of rural drinking water users’ interests in catchment and local water ­management
         platforms, especially in water scarce areas, through:

         •	 Participation of service authorities and service providers in local water management bodies
         •	 Programs to support service providers to engage in catchment protection and water safety planning

       Monitoring and regulatory oversight

       6.	 Develop a comprehensive monitoring system for rural water services, and allocate resources for its ­operation
         and usage to inform planning and strengthen regulatory oversight. Such a system would:

         •	 Include a basic set of indicators to monitor service levels, functionality and water facility condition
         •	 Be gradually expanded to monitor service provider performance and effectiveness of service authority or
            technical assistance providers

         •	 Be used to strengthen regulatory oversight in terms of adherence to service level standards, compliance
            with drinking water, and tariff-setting in line with guidelines

xxx   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Chapter 1   Introduction
            Global Challenges Facing the Rural Water Sector
            While first time access under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has seen impressive
            results, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) pose a triple challenge: expanding to uni-
            versal access, improving, and sustaining service levels. Much progress has been made glob-
            ally in terms of access to improved1 water supply, and the target for the water MDG was met
            with significant investments in the rural water sector, estimated to be in the order of
            US$50 billion between 1990 and 2008 (Carter and Lockwood, 2011). Globally, the proportion
            of people with access to piped water on premises went up from 44 percent to 58 percent
            (JMP 2015). When examining these successes carefully, a more nuanced and complex picture
            emerges. In 2015, 663 million people still lacked improved drinking water sources, eight out
            of 10 people without access live in rural areas, and access remains skewed toward the richer
            quintiles in many countries. The recently issued baseline for the SDGs states that 844 million
            people in 2015 remain without access to basic water services, and estimates that 2.1 billion
            without safely managed drinking water services, the large majority of those living in rural
            areas (WHO and UNICEF 2017). Although first time access in rural areas has seen remarkable
            improvements (see figure 1.1), including access to piped water supply in some regions,
            sustaining this access is under threat. This is manifested by high rates of hardware failure,
            poor performance of service providers and low levels of services (Moriarty et al. 2013).
              Failure by governments and development partners to ensure access to improved water
            supplies in rural areas is, to a large extent, the result of inadequate investment and planning
            to deliver infrastructure where it is needed. However, it also results from the inability to
            ensure that once infrastructure has been put in place, services continue to be delivered
            effectively. As argued by Whaley and Cleaver (2017), in relative terms the longer-term sus-
            tainability took second place to achieving targets for coverage.
              Empirical evidence from various reports indicates that in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
            30 to 40 percent of handpumps, the predominant type of water infrastructure in SSA, are
            not functioning (RWSN 2010; Duti 2012). Data from four SSA countries show that 20 to
            25 percent of handpumps are abandoned in the first year of installation. Data on piped
            water scheme functionality is scarce, partly related to the fact that “functionality” is not
            adequate to capture service levels delivered by this type of infrastructure. However,
            reports indicate that piped services can also quickly fall into disrepair. In Tanzania,
            for  example, where most communal water points are based on piped networks, nearly
            40 percent of water points were not functional in 2016 according to the latest government
            water point mapping dataset.2 A national survey in 2015 in Nigeria found that over half of
            all water points and schemes were not functioning, of which 25 to 30 percent failed in the
            first year (World Bank 2017a).3

                                           If water quality is taken in to account, the achievement of the MDG for water is likely to be
                                         revised downwards (Bain et al. 2012). Onda et al. (2012) estimate that some 18% of people
                                         accessing improved sources, as defined by the JMP, use water with significant bacteriologi-
                                         cal pollution risks. Although the study does not differentiate between urban and rural areas,
                                         it is likely that these risks are higher in rural areas, where treatment and disinfection of water
                                         supplies are often very limited or non-existent.
                                           With the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) for water and sanitation,
                                         reducing the inequality between urban and rural populations is now a priority. Goal 6.1 is to
                                         “achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all” by 2030.
                                         The proposed indicator for SDG 6.1 implies higher levels of service, defined as “safely man-
                                         aged drinking water,” meeting priority water quality parameters, being accessible on house-
                                         hold premises with reliable hours of supply and affordable to all.
                                           The SDGs imply that a shift in policies and resource allocation is increasingly urgent,
                                         going beyond infrastructure delivery and addressing the longer-term sustainable man-
                                         agement and financing of operations and maintenance (O&M), capital maintenance, and
                                         rehabilitation to ensure that adequate service levels continue over time. Such a shift
                                         needs to respond to the well-documented capacity gaps for rural water service delivery,
                                         which are often exacerbated by incomplete decentralization processes (Bakalian et al.
                                         2009; Van Ginneken et al. 2011).

  The impressive gains from the MDG era remain fragile and at risk. For many countries, the
triple challenge is therefore to reach the remaining unserved population groups, to improve
service levels, and to sustain existing and future services.
  Changing demographics and urbanization are differentiating service demands,
compounding the challenge of sustainable service delivery. Progress toward SDG 6.1 will
­
continue to be shaped by the context of economic growth and demographic changes
­
across  countries, such as accelerating rates of urbanization, the growth of settlements
with peri-urban characteristics, and outmigration from rural areas, often leaving the most
­
vulnerable behind. According to the United Nations Development Program, by 2050, about
70 percent of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas, of which half will be
in urban centers with less than half a million inhabitants (UNDP 2011). Cities are expanding
into peri-urban and sometimes enclosing rural areas, further blurring the lines between
‘urban’ and ‘rural’. This trend will continue to generate higher and more differentiated
demands for water services. On the one hand, users in rural growth centers and small towns
are increasingly demanding services similar to those in urban areas: piped supplies into the
home providing more water, of better quality, and with a reliable supply. In rural areas,
such demand for higher levels of services can also be observed, driven by both domestic
and small-scale productive needs. As economies grow and service level aspirations
increase, users are increasingly willing to pay for higher levels of service. Willingness to pay
for private connections and for large improvements in service provision were found to be
higher than for incremental changes in service levels (Van Houtven et al. 2017). On the
other hand, there is, and will remain for many years, a significant segment of the poorest
households living in remote dispersed settlements for which community-managed point
source supplies will likely be the only viable solution in the medium to long term.
  At the same time, in urban and rural areas, people are practicing self-supply, for exam-
ple by developing private wells or rainwater harvesting to complement inadequate com-
munal or utility services, or are resorting to self-supply in the absence of any public
service provision. Changing geographic and climatic conditions, pollution of water
sources, and unregulated use such as in agriculture, are putting pressure on quality and
quantity of water resources. As a result, increasing water scarcity is compounding the
challenge to deliver sustainable water supply services, especially to vulnerable rural
population groups (Lockwood and Smits 2015).
  The changing rural landscape, higher service level aspirations of rural populations, and
the sector’s poor track record on functionality and the SDGs requirements, evidently require
a more effective and sustainable rural service delivery approach than witnessed thus far.
  A rethinking of the service delivery approach is needed, recognizing the enabling envi-
ronment beyond the community level and the need for support structures for service
­
providers. The issue of the sustainability of rural service provision is not new, and has
received widespread sector attention since the international decade on water and sanita-
tion from 1980–90. Paradigms toward rural water service delivery evolved over time with

                                                progressing insights (see figure 1.2). In the early 1990s, the failure of supply-driven top-
                                                down implementation of rural water supply schemes was recognized, and a growing
                                                consensus emerged that interventions needed to be “demand responsive.” This entailed
                                                ­
                                                that, especially during the implementation phase, interventions needed to include com-
                                                munity participation, community contribution toward capital and O&M costs, and an
                                                overall reduced dependence on higher levels of government (Sara and Katz 1997). The
                                                Demand-Responsive Approach (DRA) was elaborated in the 1990s, and progress was made
                                                in ensuring that communities take ownership of their water supply systems and that
                                                technologies are in line with the needs and capacities of users. The DRA approach evolved
                                                as its limitations became clear and the need for ongoing technical, institutional and
                                                financial support to community organizations was identified.
                                                   A review of the World Bank’s program on rural water supply in India articulated the need
                                                for institutional linkages between local governments and communities, embedded in a
                                                decentralized mandate for service delivery (World Bank 2012). A rigorous analysis of the
                                                sustainability and performance of “demand responsive” versus “supply-driven” water
                                                schemes in Kerala revealed that demand responsive schemes were more successful on
                                                all  elements of comparison: service levels, consumer satisfaction, O&M and overall
                                                performance. However, it also concluded that more attention is still needed to create
                                                stronger  community-based service providers and institutions to provide operational and
                                                financial support to schemes when needed (Andres et al. 2017).

4                                               Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
  Since the early 2000s, more emphasis has been placed on providing ongoing support to
rural service providers — this is commonly referred to as post construction support, and is
often provided by various entities of government (Lockwood 2002). Whaley and Cleaver
(2017) review a large volume of literature that underscores the need for such regularized
and structured support to community-based service providers, which goes beyond ad hoc
technical assistance to increase the ability of community-based service providers to fulfil
administration and O&M functions. The 2000s also witnessed the emergence of so-called
professionalized service delivery, moving away from solely voluntary-based community
arrangements to a diversification of service delivery models, including various forms of
private sector involvement in rural and small town service delivery. With the increasing
demand for higher service levels and the development of piped systems in rural areas,
there is a growing recognition that governments’ role encompasses a much wider range of
responsibilities than infrastructure provision and support during the implementation
phase (Smits and Lockwood, 2015). Since the 2010s, the rural water paradigm emphasizes
the importance of including wider systems of governance, including a national enabling
environment and political economy aspects, a life cycle cost approach, and the importance
of institutions in support of a diverse range of service providers. In seeking solutions for
more sustainable service delivery, it remains critical to appreciate the complex and hetero-
geneous characteristics of rural water supply and the intricacies of local socio-political and
technical contexts.
  Recognizing the evolution of the rural water sector beyond the Demand Responsive
Approach, the emergence of various management models, the identified need for ongoing
government support to rural service providers, and the critical role of enabling institutions
and policies beyond the community level, the added value of this assessment lies in:

•	 The development of a comprehensive analytical framework that can be used to analyze
  and operationalize a more sustainable service delivery approach for rural water supply

•	 The rich set cases and good practices from the 16 countries informing the global body of
  “knowledge in implementation”

•	 The formulation of recommendations and policy directions to enhance sustainability of
  rural services within different sector development and rural contexts


Objectives and Scope of the Assessment
The scope of this study is focused on the conditions or factors that are likely to have a
bearing on the long-term sustainability of the service delivery approach in the countries
selected for this study. This assessment does not explicitly focus on the planning, design,
and implementation phase of developing water supply facilities, which are equally criti-
cal in predicting short-term functionality rates. Aspects such as adequate community
participation in start-up and implementation, technically sound feasibility studies and




Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models                            5
    designs, adequate drilling practices, sound water resources yield assessment, and qual-
    ity construction and procurement of materials, when addressed poorly, explain a large
    part of the high failure rates of water schemes within the first one or two years of opera-
    tion. For example, in Nigeria, in the first year of operation, factors that can be controlled
    in the design, operations, and implementation stages explained 65 percent of water point
    failures (Andres et al. 2017).
      Rather, this assessment analyzes the ongoing service delivery approach for rural water,
    using 16 countries as case studies. It aims to evaluate the conditions, challenges, and emerg-
    ing good practices that support sustainability, the current service delivery models, and the
    broader policy, institutional and regulatory environments in which the rural water sector
    operates.
      Thus, the objectives of this assessment were to:

    •	 Identify factors contributing to long-term sustainability of rural water supplies and orga-
      nize these in a comprehensive framework that can be used to analyze and operationalize
      sustainability of rural water service delivery

    •	 Identify, based on countries’ experiences, emerging good practices and common chal-
      lenges in building sector capacity and sustainable service delivery models

    •	 Provide, through analysis of country cases, prioritized policy directions to World Bank
      task teams, governments, and other practitioners to enhance the sustainability of the
      service delivery approach

      The scope of the study did not allow for primary data collection at the level of individ-
    ual water schemes within the 16 countries. In parallel, the World Bank has carried out a
    review to define metrics and indicators that describe and may predict the sustainability
    of rural water services, which could inform further primary research (World Bank, forth-
    coming 2018).4
      To reap the highest operational benefits of this global analysis, the study focused on 16
    countries with an existing or pipelined World Bank engagement in the rural water sector:
    Bangladesh, Benin, Brazil (the state of Ceará), China (Zhejiang and Shaanxi provinces),
    Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India (Punjab and Uttarakhand states), Indonesia, the Kyrgyz
    Republic, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Tanzania, and Vietnam. These coun-
    tries were deliberatively selected as a sample representing a range of geographies, socioeco-
    nomic indicators, level of aid dependency, progress toward universal access to water supply,
    prevailing types of water facilities, and government-led approaches to rural water supply
    service provision. As such, the countries do not present a random sample to be used for sta-
    tistical analysis, but rather a range of different contexts from which key insights are drawn.
      Based on country case analysis, individual country reports were developed with key find-
    ings and recommendations to inform short- and medium-term actions to help transition
    sectors to more advanced levels of sustainable service delivery and expand service delivery
    models. For each of the 16 countries, two-page summaries of all the country reports are

Structure of the Report
The rest of this report contains four further chapters, as follows:

•	 Chapter 2 describes the analytical framework of the study and methodological approaches
   used; this includes a description of the building blocks of sustainability (or conditions to
   enhance sustainability).

•	 Chapter 3 presents an overview of country contexts, for example, socioeconomic develop-
   ment, access to rural water supplies, water resources situation, institutional and policy
   frameworks based on country context; different population segments of rural service
   delivery are presented.

•	 Chapter 4 presents the main findings of progress against the building blocks of sustain­
   ability, highlighting good practices. It identifies persisting common challenges and
   promising directions for enhancing different service delivery models.

•	 Chapter 5 provides practical recommendations to improve rural water sustainability for
   each of the building blocks. It also presents a staged concept for sector development and
   proposes interventions to transition to advanced levels of sustainability for different rural
   service delivery contexts. It concludes with a set of policy directions.

  In addition:

•	 Appendix A presents the detailed study protocol.

•	 Appendix B includes the questions used to assess sustainability scores for sector and
   service delivery models.

•	 Appendix C presents an overview of key rural water demographic data in study countries.

•	 Appendix D summarizes national institutions responsible for water supply by their
   functions.

•	 Appendix E presents a typology of service delivery models found in the 16 countries.

•	 Appendix F describes current tariff guidelines and ranges of tariff levels.

•	 Appendix G includes country summaries for each of the 16 countries; country-​
                                                                               level

   reports.



Notes
1.	 Improved is defined as a drinking water source that by the nature of its construction adequately protects the source from
   outside contamination, particularly fecal matter. The report was prepared before the launch of the SDG baseline and thus
   refers to access to an improved source rather than the new definitions of “basic” and “safely managed” drinking water
   services.

Chapter 2   Conceptual Framework and Methodology
            Analytical Framework

            Definition of Underlying Concepts and Terminology
            The analytical framework of the study relies on key concepts pertaining to service delivery,
            which are presented in box 2.1. In addition, this study and the framework use the term “sys-
            tem” explicitly to refer to the entire ecosystem of institutions, policies, financing, decision-​
            making and regulation that needs to be in place at the level of the enabling environment, as
            opposed to a water supply scheme or facility.
              Sustainability and functionality are related but not the same.
              Although the term functionality is often used as a proxy for sustainability, the concepts are
            not synonymous. Functionality represents a snapshot in time, whilst sustainability is about
            the delivery of service over time (Carter and Ross 2016).1 Functionality is interpreted as a
            direct measure of the delivery of water, to agreed service levels, at individual water supply
            scheme level. However, the capacities, functions, and conditions necessary to ensure the
            effective provision of water services must exist not only at the level of service provision—
            community, small town and even household in the case of self-supply—but also at higher
            levels, which may vary according to country or regional contexts. The presence of such
            favorable conditions at various levels is an important step toward ensuring sustainability of
            services, but it is no guarantee as all elements need to be adequately financed and function-
            ing effectively.
              Therefore, the framework for analyzing the complex and interrelated factors for sustain-
            ability is done at three institutional levels:

            •	 National sector level.2 Those government institutions or agencies responsible for defining
              policy, legal, institutional, and financing frameworks that ensure capital investment fund-
              ing flows, coordination, planning, and regulatory functions.

            •	 Service authority level. Key functions of planning, contracting, monitoring and oversight,
              as well as support to service providers and potentially regulatory activities. These func-
              tions are typically carried out by local governments or deconcentrated branches of
              national ministries.

            •	 Service provider level. Entities responsible for the day-to-day provision of water supplies,
              including management, operation, billing, tariff collection, maintenance tasks, and in cer-
              tain contexts capital investments. In many countries, this is done by community commit-
              tees in rural areas; services can also be provided directly by local governments, central
              government agencies, private operators, NGOs, or in some cases regional or municipal
              utilities.

              (for example, pipe networks, reservoir tanks, boreholes and so on).

           •	 Rural water supply scheme. The physical facility and the soft components such as
              management, administration, and financing at the point of supply.

           •	 Rural water service delivery. National definitions for both rural populations and
              the rural water sector. Rural water may therefore refer to supplies both in remote
              rural areas as well as growth centers and small towns that fall under rural service
              provision according to sector institutional arrangements.

           •	 Service authority. The institution(s) with the legal mandate to ensure that water
              services are planned and delivered. Service authorities are usually, but not always,
              equated with local government, and are not necessarily involved in direct service
              delivery themselves (although they may be in some cases).

           •	 Service levels. Definitions and agreed norms regarding expected service levels,
              typically expressed as minimum quantities, by quality parameters, and aspects
              such as reliability, accessibility and in some cases affordability.

           •	 Sustainability of services. Water services that are continuous over time and
              which meet agreed service levels. The definition made by WaterAid UK—which
              itself builds on an earlier one by Abrams (1998)—is useful and considers
              sustainability as “whether or not (water services) continue to work and deliver
              benefits over time. No time limit is set on those continued services, behavior
              changes and outcomes. In other words, sustainability is about lasting benefits
              achieved through the continued enjoyment of water supply (and other) practices”
              (adapted from WaterAid 2011).

           •	 Service delivery model. The combination of management model at service delivery
              level (for example, community-based organizations, private, public utility, and so
              on) and the necessary vertical legal, policy, institutional, regulatory and financing
              frameworks that support these management structures and allow them to function
              effectively.




12   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
  At the service provider level, there are typically a number of relatively common approaches,
known as management models. Within each typology there can be variations and hybrids
depending on context. The most common models include:

•	 Community-based management. Where communities have been delegated responsibility
  to operate and manage water facilities; this option includes many variations, from purely
  voluntary committees, to those with systematic support, to those outsourcing tasks to
  individuals and even private companies, but where the community retains governance
  and oversight.

•	 Direct local government provision. Where local governments are non-corporatized service
  providers for rural communities and directly carry out these services; this is also some-
  times referred to as “direct municipal services (which may also include other services
  such as electricity)”; this model excludes municipal enterprises or corporations, which are
  classified under public utility provision.

•	 Public utility provision. Where a separate public entity is assigned and/or established,
  which may be at central, regional, or municipal level, to provide management of services
  for communities or small towns in their assigned service area, which can vary from larger
  regions to the territory of smaller municipalities. This group includes deconcentrated gov-
  ernment entities, government-owned utilities and parastatal companies operating on a
  more commercial basis.

•	 Private sector management. Where private operators either own water assets and manage
  the services, or have been delegated responsibility for operation and management of pub-
  licly owned water systems through public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements,
  increasingly under contract of local governments. PPPs may or may not involve private
  capital investment to build or extend assets.

•	 Supported self-supply. Where households, or small clusters of households, provide their
  own solutions to water supply; this form of management is most typical in highly dis-
  persed communities. This is still a common option in many developed countries for
  remote rural populations, as well as in countries where state provision through other
  management models has not reached very far or services are perceived to be inadequate.
  This study refers to “supported self-supply” when the approach is formally recognized by
  government and they have adopted programs of structured support to accelerate and
  improve service delivery under this model.

  These models may have different “labels” in different countries; there are also a number of
different hybrids or variants under this main taxonomy (see chapter 3). In this study, in a
given country, only management models were considered that were formally recognized by
government or are being tested at a relevant scale.
  The term service delivery model goes beyond the management model of the service
provider.

       The term service delivery models (SDM) is used to include not only the management
     model typology, but the full complement of factors and capacities that need to be in place at
     all levels, incorporating both “soft” components—policy, monitoring, institutional and regu-
     latory frameworks—and more tangible elements such as financing, maintenance regimes,
     human resources, and physical assets. Within this study, the sustainability of the SDM
     relates to the whole system being in place to ensure that water services last over time, for
     example, financing, capacity support at different levels, monitoring, and so on.

     Analytical Framework: the Five Building Blocks of Sustainability
     The analytical framework developed for this study derives primarily from previous research
     conducted under the Sustainable Services at Scale project, so called “Triple-S”3, which iden-
     tified 10 building blocks for sustainable rural water service delivery. The “systems approach”4
     adopted under Triple-S concluded that for sustainable water and sanitation service delivery,
     a number of building blocks need to be in place at sector level. The methodology that has
     resulted in the identification of these building blocks is described in Box 2.2.
       In this study, and based on consultation with various World Bank staff involved in the
     country studies, the Triple-S building blocks5 were condensed into four categories, namely
     institutional capacity, financing, asset management and monitoring and regulatory over-
     sight. In addition, in the context of growing recognition by governments of the challenges of
     water scarcity and the ability to provide water services in rural areas, the consultation con-
     firmed that water resources management and security would be included as a fifth building
     block of sustainability.6
       These five building blocks are presented in detail below:

     •	 Institutional capacity. Includes the assessment of enabling environment factors at national
       and sub-national levels, meaning clearly defined and implemented policies, strategies
       and delineation of roles, functions (for example, planning, policy making, regulation,
       budgeting, and investment) and effective coordination. The ability of service authorities
       to deliver on their mandates and organize effective technical, administrative, and institu-
       tional support to service providers is an important element of this building block. At ser-
       vice provider level, it considers the capacity of various organizations and entities,
       including community, public and private sectors, to manage day-to-day service delivery
       in an effective and sustainable manner.

     •	 Financing. Focuses on the assessment of initial capital investments, operation, and main-
       tenance costs, as well as indirect support costs, that is, for building and sustaining insti-
       tutional capacity, policy development, regulation and monitoring, and other key sector
       activities. Financing for rural water services has commonly been derived from a combi-
       nation of sources from the “3Ts,” namely tariffs, taxes, and transfers. In many aid-​
       dependent countries, rural water financing is dominated by transfers, especially for
       ­
       initial capital investment, with little or no allocation of funds from domestic sources
       (taxes) and a low expectation of financing sector costs through tariffs. It is increasingly

      BOX 2.2. Overview of Triple-S Research and 10 Building Blocks for Sustainable
      Water Supplies


      Under the Sustainable Services at Scale (Triple-S) research program funded by the Bill and
      Melinda Gates Foundation and implemented by IRC of the Netherlands and Aguaconsult
      of the UK, a study was conducted in 2009–10 to identify factors that contribute to or
      constrain the delivery of sustainable rural water services at scale. The study sought to
      identify incentives and barriers that shape the way in which sector institutions approach
      rural water services and was carried in a deliberate selection of 13 countries (Benin,
      Burkina Faso, Colombia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India (Gujarat, Maharashtra and
      Tamil Nadu), Mozambique, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uganda and the USA).

      The methodology followed a similar format across all countries, employing a
      combination of secondary data collection, such as document and literature reviews,
      and primary data collection by a team of experts through in-depth informant
      interviews and stakeholder group meetings. A consultation and validation process
      with sector stakeholders took place in the majority of countries.

      An analytical framework that conceptualized three institutional levels—national,
      intermediate (later named “service authority” level) and service provider—was used,
      where for each of these three levels the rural water sector was assessed against 18
      principles. These principles represent normative elements for service delivery, and
      were derived from earlier principle-based frameworks for rural water supply, such
      as by RWSN’s thematic group on community-based rural water supply. The empirical
      findings and analysis across the countries pointed to a number of inter-dependent
      building blocks, which the research team deemed critical to facilitate a shift towards
      the delivery of sustainable services, as follows:

      TABLE B2.2.1. Ten Building Blocks for Sustainable Service Provision as identified
      in Triple-S project
      Professionalization of community management      Support to service providers with technical,
      with policy embedding, adequate legal            admin, and institutional support to and monitoring
      frameworks; move away from voluntarism           of community and other service providers

      Recognition and promotion of alternative         Capacity support to local governments to enable
      service provider options beyond community        them to fulfil their roles (for example, planning,
      management model (self-supply, PPPs)             asset management, monitoring and regulation)

      Monitoring service delivery and sustainability   Asset management through systematic planning,
      with systems that track indicators of            inventory updates, and financial forecasting for
      functionality, performance, and service levels   assets with asset ownership clearly defined

      Harmonization and coordination among             Regulation of rural services and service
      development partners and government, and         providers with performance through mechanisms
      alignment with national policies and systems     appropriate for small rural operators

      Learning and adaptive management supported       Financing to cover all life cycle costs, especially
      at national and decentralized levels to enable   capital maintenance, support to service authorities
      the sector to adapt based on experience          and service providers, monitoring and regulation

       recognized that the sector needs to move toward more sustainable, blended financing
       modalities, where taxes and tariffs take a more prominent role and new sources could
       ideally be mobilized through commercial financing if the enabling environment is right.
       The building blocks also review whether mechanisms are put in place to allow tariffs and
       fees to be affordable to the most vulnerable population groups.

     •	 Asset management. Refers to a set of approaches and practices that collectively ensure the
       continued functioning of a water supply facility, and hence the services delivered by that
       facility. This is typically much less common in the rural sector than in urban water supply.
       Good asset management starts with sound development of the initial asset (that is, good
       design and quality assurance during construction) and clearly defined asset ownership.
       The assessment includes not only whether the technical know-how and engineering is in
       place, but the extent to which the systems and tools for asset management have been
       developed and whether core activities have been institutionalized at the appropriate
       levels within any given sector.

     •	 Water resources management and security. Looks not only at physical water resource avail-
       ability and quality, but also at the institutional links between those entities that manage
       watersheds and the service authorities and providers responsible for drinking water.
       Changes in land use, deforestation, and increasing climatic variability, matched with
       increasing pressures from growing population and industrial activities, all pose challenges
       to the perennial supply of water. Especially within the context of numerous rural water
       providers, adequate planning and design of infrastructure, factoring into account current
       and future potential water demands and resource availability as well as water safety plan-
       ning, are increasingly essential.

     •	 Monitoring and regulatory oversight. Assesses the extent to which sectors have success-
       fully established monitoring systems that can routinely collate relevant data about the
       quality of services and the performance of service providers. Critically, the assessment
       includes the extent to which information and outputs of a monitoring system are made
       available at different levels and are used to inform improved service delivery, gover-
       nance and learning. This building block also examines whether and how regulatory
       oversight is exercised to protect the interests of consumers and service providers,
       whether service standards and tariff guidelines are in place, and if support is available
       to use these. In rural settings, regulatory oversight can be achieved by mandating such
       a function to dedicated agencies or entities, or in the case of private sector service pro-
       vision through contracts.7

       The framework for analysis combines the three institutional levels with the five building
     blocks, as shown in figure 2.1. The framework also recognizes the importance of country-­
     specific factors relating to sector governance and general country context. All of these are
     important to consider when assessing the overall arrangements and performance of rural
     water service delivery.

                                    existing documentation, and primary data was collected through interviews. In all cases,
                                    the methodology included a desk review with the collection and analysis of available
                                    secondary data and grey literature reports.8

                                    The framework presented in figure 2.1 was used to structure data collection and analysis.
                                    This analysis was guided by a series of data collection tools focusing on each of the building
                                    blocks, as well as country context, sector organization and governance. The main entry
                                    points for analysis and data collection used in the application of the framework are given in
                                    appendix A. A mix of qualitative and quantitative data was used either from secondary
                                    sources or through interviews with key informants.
                                       To provide a snapshot assessment of each country’s progress in establishing the condi-
                                    tions for sustainable rural water services, a scoring is applied at two levels based on a set of
                                    four questions pertaining to each of the five building blocks, with questions detailed in
                                    appendix B. Firstly, the assessment considered progress realized at sector level and whether
                                    essential conditions for sustainability are in place in the enabling environment. Secondly,
                                    the study examined whether and how this progress is reflected at service delivery level,

            BOX 2.3. Scoring Definition for Sector Sustainability Score and Service Delivery
            Model Scores


            For each question, a score is given as follows:

            •	 0 = very limited conditions or elements in place, or no evidence of progress toward
                 the building block or performance of the service delivery model

            •	 1 = partial conditions in place or some evidence of progress toward the building
                 block or performance of the service delivery model

            •	 2 = most conditions or elements are in place and there is good evidence of
                 progress toward the building block or performance of the service delivery model

            Aggregate scoring is as follows:

            •	 Maximum possible score per building block at sector level and SDM level is
                 8 points

            •	 Scores are summed across all building blocks (country at SDM level) to give an
                 aggregate score with a maximum of 40 points

            •	 Traffic light scoring based on: 0–15 = red; 16–25 = yellow; 26–40 = green




     considering each of the formally established service delivery management models that
     were found in a country. Both at sector level and at service delivery level, for each question
     a possible score of “zero,” “one,” or “two” could be obtained, as indicated in box 2.3. Scores
     were then aggregated at country level for each building block and into a country sector
     sustainability score, as well as for each service delivery model (SDM) to allow for an analy-
     sis across management models to determine common trends, strengths, and weaknesses.9
       It should be noted that for the three larger federal countries (Brazil, China, and India)
     the analysis was carried out in one or two states or provinces, as in these countries the
     responsibility for rural water supply lies with the state or province. Therefore, scoring
     applies to these selected states or provinces only and not the entire country. However,
     some aspects of sector level scoring may reflect national policies and institutional
     arrangements. The scoring is based on available data through the data collection

methodology adopted. For quality assurance, all country working papers were reviewed
by World Bank staff operating at country level, as well as by the team members, coordi-
nating the multi-country assessment.10

Study Limitations
Given the scope, methodology, and resources available, an obvious limitation is that no direct
associations could be made between sustainability at scheme level, evidenced by primary
data collection, and the conditions that influence the sustainability of the entire ecosystem of
rural water services. This implies that, in the scoring assessment, sustainability is assumed to
be a function of the normative conditions as defined for each of the building blocks, while
recognizing that country contextual factors will influence the assessment. Once sustainabil-
ity metrics and indicator measurement are better defined (World Bank, forthcoming 2018),
follow-up research is suggested to include such primary data collection at user, water facility,
service provider, and service authority level. This would help strengthen the empirical evi-
                                                                        ­ssociated with
dence base to determine the critical sustainability conditions that are a
enhanced sustainability and service levels. In addition to a normative or principle-based
approach, as adopted under this multi-country assessment, political economy analysis, for
example, binding constraints diagnostics, can also help to improve our understanding of how
power relations in water governance influence sustainability outcomes.11
  Other considerations to bear in mind include:

•	 Although the use of the scoring method and reference to secondary data sources aims to
  make the assessment as objective as possible, there may be inherent bias as scoring to
  some extent depends on expert judgement.

•	 For the group of countries with desk studies only, there were limitations to the availability
  of comprehensive data or recent and relevant sector analysis, hindering the assessment of
  implementation of policies in practice.

•	 The sector enabling environment, as well as secondary data sources, are constantly evolv-
  ing; the assessment presents a snapshot in time (especially relevant for countries with
  high dynamics).

•	 For Brazil, China, and India, it proved challenging to completely isolate a sector assess-
  ment at state or province level from national level.

  Nevertheless, the added value of this assessment lies in the development of the analytical
framework to shape our understanding on progress by a range of countries toward the estab-
lishment of sound systems for long term sustainability of rural water services. The diverse
case studies and lessons learnt provide practitioners with practical insights into how to
operationalize the building blocks for sustainability and add to the global body of “knowl-
edge in implementation.” The recommended interventions and policy directions derived
from the case studies aim to help governments in other countries to put in place a more
sustainable service delivery approach.

     Notes
     	 1.	 As explained in Whaley and Cleaver (2017): On a day of inspection, a water point/scheme may be not functioning for one
          reason or another, but over the course of the time delivers a sustainable supply of water; on the other hand, a different
          water point may be functioning at the time of inspection, but is challenged by one or more fundamental physical or
          management-related faults, meaning its likelihood of delivering a sustainable supply of water is small.

     	 4.	 The concept of building blocks derives from similar experiences in health systems thinking (De Savigny and Adam 2009;
          WHO 2010). This approach starts from the recognition that in order to achieve sustainable delivery of health services, six
          building blocks of health systems need to be in place, such as finance, an information system, and health workforce,
          amongst others. These building blocks describe the elements of what needs to be in place to provide health services. How
          they are established and what specific forms they take varies across countries as they are shaped by country contexts,
          including available resources, both financial and human.

          WASH Bottleneck Analysis Tool, WaterAid’s sustainability framework, USAID’s Sustainability Index Tool and the FIETS

     	 9.	 Countries were scored based on their progress or lack of progress of the building blocks in an “absolute” manner, that is,
          without assessing this progress against development status or specific country contexts. An interesting finding is that,
          across the study countries, there is considerable variation in the progress on the building blocks for sustainable water
          services across countries with similar economic development status.

20   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Chapter 3   Context of Selected Country Cases
            Socioeconomics and Water Resources Situation
            The 16 countries present a wide range of socioeconomic contexts, in terms of income levels,
            aid dependency, rural population demographics, and water scarcity levels.
              Taking a broad overview at least three main groups can be identified, as illustrated
            in table 3.1.

            •	 The upper-middle income group, composed of Brazil and China, which have high levels of
              access to rural water services and high levels (over 55 percent) of access to piped services
              on premises.

            •	 The lower-middle income group, which includes Bangladesh, Ghana, the Kyrgyz
              Republic, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Morocco, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam, with low
              to medium levels of piped access from 1 to 40 percent. This group displays a high level
              of heterogeneity, with some countries having relatively low GNI per capita but high lev-
              els of piped access (that is, the Kyrgyz Republic and Nicaragua) or higher levels of GNI
              with little progress toward increasing piped access in rural areas, such as Bangladesh
              and Indonesia.

            •	 A third group of low-income countries consisting of Benin, Ethiopia, Haiti, Nepal, and
              Tanzania, with all—except for Nepal—having low access rates to piped supply (less than
              6 percent), and a GNI below US$2,600 per capita.

              Appendix C provides an overview of the demographics relating to rural populations in
            all 16 countries, including definitions of “urban” versus “rural,” absolute numbers, rural
            population shares, and growth rates. The economic contexts present opportunities for the
            development of sustainable rural water services, especially for middle-income countries
            such as Brazil and Morocco, and poses significant challenges for those at the lower end of
            the spectrum, such as Ethiopia and Haiti.
              Table 3.1 indicates the level of available renewable water resources, which can impact
            the service provision in rural areas. As per IWMI (2007) classification on water scarcity,1
            Brazil (Ceará), China (Shaanxi), India (Punjab) and the Kyrgyz Republic experience
            ­physical water scarcity and in these context, declining water resources are already directly
            affecting drinking water supply systems at significant scale. Most other countries are
            experiencing economic water scarcity, which, for example, means that storage or convey-
            ance capacity is inadequate to capture and allocate resources effectively and both
                                                                                      ­ ecessary.
            ­supply-side and demand-side water resources management measures would be n
            Countries may also have different degrees of vulnerability to extreme weather events such
            as floods and typhoons and other natural hazards that regularly damage water supply
            infrastructure and put further pressure on sustainability of service delivery, as in
            Bangladesh, Vietnam, Nepal, Haiti, and the Philippines.

                                                  Access, Service Levels, and Functionality of Rural Water
                                                  Driven by consumer demand and government aspirations, a transition from “improved
                                                  access” to “piped access” is taking place, although with a varying rate of change.
                                                    Table 3.1 indicates that while some countries have made significant progress in improving
                                                  access to rural water services including piped services, others still face challenges in
                                                  providing basic levels of service to a majority of the rural population (for example, in
                                                  ­
                                                  Tanzania, Haiti, and Ethiopia). Access to piped water services at household level remains
                                                  generally low in rural areas, except for Brazil, China, and the Kyrgyz Republic with

                                                  the rural population in China and Brazil, there are still many millions who do not have
                                                  access to such level of service. For several countries that are close to 100 percent improved

access in rural areas, the challenge is the transition from point source supplies to piped
supplies2 and improving the service levels in terms of quality and reliability. This transition
is driven by demand of users combined with government aspirations and the influence of
high-level decision makers. The Kyrgyz Republic, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Nepal, and
Morocco are pursuing such a transition, as well as Vietnam and India. Here, access to piped
services are also gaining ground, supported by national policies and targets. There is an
overall trend to move away from communal standposts to household—often metered—­
connections, although if water resource issues are not adequately addressed, supplies may
be inadequate to meet demand.
  The lack of access to piped supply does not necessarily mean that households have poor
service levels, particularly in terms of quantity and access. However, quality may be more at
risk, as in many countries households have opted for water on premises through household
solutions and self-supply such as rainwater harvesting and private wells (such as in
Bangladesh).
  Definitions of normative service standards for rural water supply are increasingly found,
which can facilitate better accountability if monitoring and regulatory oversight is in place.
  Service levels and the choice of technologies are driven by a combination of factors includ-
ing demand, policy, levels of investments, demographics, socioeconomic context and water
resources availability. Different technologies were found across the countries including
i) large piped network schemes, where urban networks connect rural areas, or in the form of
multi-village schemes; ii) small piped networks, typically serving a single village or a few
hamlets; iii) communal point water sources, such as handpumps and water kiosks; and
iv)  household point sources, including private wells and rainwater harvesting systems,
which are often used as complementary sources.
  Most countries have clearly defined normative service levels, sometimes even differenti-
ated by type of supply. This indicates a positive development for a number of r
                                                                              ­ easons. Firstly,
defining service levels lays the groundwork for accountability; that is to say, describing access
to services which citizens can expect as a (human) right. Secondly, it provides a benchmark
                                                               ­ etting out expected levels of
against which to hold service providers to account. By clearly s
service it is possible to monitor whether or not users are actually receiving these in practice.
How monitoring is carried out, and the success of building national monitoring and evalua-
tion (M&E) frameworks differs from country to country and a framework for regulatory over-
sight can enhance accountability relationships between users, service providers and the state
(section 4.5). The varying service levels across the country cases clearly illustrates that coun-
tries are facing different challenges in providing universal and sustainable service for all. The
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for water can help spur countries to understand how
their service standards correspond with the stringent definition of “safely managed drinking
water.” Findings on service standards are presented in box 3.1.
  Nationwide systems monitoring the functionality of water facilities face many limitations,
but are a work in progress in most countries.

           BOX 3.1.   Different Service Level Definitions across the Case Studies


           •	 Quantity. For handpumps, typically 20 liters per capita per day, and for piped
              schemes much higher (35–100 liters per capita per day). Standards tend to have
              an urban bias, leading to overdesign, which affects technical performance and
              continuity and financial performance in the long run.

           •	 Quality. All countries have national water quality standards, some of which reflect
              specific issues such as the acceptable level of arsenic as in Bangladesh and Nepal.
              In general, standards are not differentiated at national level between rural and
              urban populations and follow WHO standards.

           •	 Accessibility. A few countries define household connection as the minimum
              standard (Brazil and China), otherwise accessibility is defined by distance to the
              water point. This can vary significantly between countries (for example, in India
              and Nicaragua it is only 100 meters whereas in Ethiopia it is 1.5 kilometers);
              mountainous Nepal breaks down access by vertical as well as lateral distance.

           •	 Continuity. For piped supplies, it is normally stated as 24/7, with the exception of
              Bangladesh (eight hours per day), the Kyrgyz Republic (12 hours per day), and India
              (for example, eight hours per day, with certain states moving to 24/7.

           •	 Reliability. Some countries have specific norms for acceptable levels of downtime
              (particularly for hand pumps), such as Ghana and Ethiopia.




       Out of the 16 countries examined, 11 have set up—or are in the process of establishing—
     monitoring systems for the functionality of rural water supply schemes. Based on the data
     gathered, functionality rates of water schemes vary between 60 percent and 94 percent
     across countries (table 3.2). However, such figures should be considered with caution
     because:

     •	 Functionality, as generally used, is a binary concept that does not allow an adequate
       evaluation of service levels: for example, a scheme may be deemed functional even
       though it does not produce water as per its design capacity or up to the water quality
       requirements (non-functionality are less ambiguous, as there is no service provided).

     •	 Data on functionality is often partial and only concerns a selective sample of schemes,
       e.g., related to a project that is being closely monitored, as in Vietnam or Indonesia, or
       only related to a certain management model.

     •	 National averages may hide regional disparities. This is the case for Vietnam, for example,
       where functionality rates in remote and mountainous areas are far lower than national
       averages, estimated at 48 percent against the national average of 75 percent.

     •	 In the absence of common metrics for functionality, conclusions as to “high performers”
       against “low performers” in terms of functionality are difficult to draw.

  Despite the above limitations, non-functionality rates obtained for eleven countries
­
indicate that some countries face daunting challenges for sustaining services. Tanzania,
Nepal and the Kyrgyz Republic have non-functionality rates close to or equal to 40 percent
of rural water schemes3. As further discussed in section 4.5, nationwide monitoring systems
that go beyond functionality and include dimensions of service provider performance and
other metrics of sustainability are even harder to come by.


Institutional Arrangements

National Level Entities
In most countries, an institutional “home,” or nodal agency, for rural water supply is estab-
lished, however low political prioritization, lack of institutional coordination, and unassigned
mandates for service provider support and regulatory oversight are common.
  National level bodies responsible for different functions relating to rural water supply
were analyzed to determine their roles and responsibilities, including policy making,
capital investment, regulation, technical assistance, drinking water quality surveillance
and water resources management (including quality of source water). The findings are
presented in appendix D, summarizing which institution(s) are responsible across the
­
16 countries. In general, there is an adequate differentiation of roles and, in most cases,


Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models                                                             25
     there is either a ministry or other government agency assigned to lead the rural water
     sector. However, there are a number of important observations:

     •	 Not all countries have a dedicated “water services ministry.” In several middle-income
       countries, the responsibility for water supply falls within a ministry with broader man-
       dates such as housing, development, public works or cities. Although this may not
       necessarily be problematic, it could mean that the rural sub-sector specifically has a
       low political profile and low priority.

     •	 Some countries have gone through substantive sector reforms at national level (or state-
       level reforms) resulting in the separation of policy making and investment functions
       between national bodies (for example, Nicaragua and Indonesia); effective coordination
       mechanisms between national government bodies remain challenging.

     •	 Few countries have mandated regulatory oversight functions for rural water supply and
       smaller water operators to dedicated regulatory bodies (Brazil, Nicaragua, and the
       Philippines); some countries have delegated oversight to national or subnational entities
       (for example, Ghana and China).

     •	 Health ministries or other technical standard agencies are mostly mandated for water
       quality surveillance and de jure enforcement of compliance.

     •	 Technical assistance functions tend to be decentralized to local (or regional) level, or are
       not at all articulated as functions to any institution; in most cases they do not fall under
       the mandate of national level bodies.


     Service Authorities
     In the majority of countries, local governments are the service authorities or duty bearers for
     rural water supply. However, unclear assignment between different subnational levels and
     incomplete decentralization processes are hindering local governments in exercising their
     roles effectively.
       In most countries, but not all, the service authority is the local government, such as dis-
     trict, commune, governorate, or municipality, depending on the designation of the relevant
     local public administrative unit in the country. In some cases, service authorities are also
     asset holders, but again this varies from country to country. Service authority functions may
     also be shared—although often unclearly—between different administrative levels, for exam-
     ple, between provincial and district authorities, or between village and district levels,
     depending on the degree and form of decentralization.4 Specific functions, such as water
     quality monitoring, may be carried out by mandated deconcentrated entities. Table 3.3
     presents the service authorities across the case studies, including the average population
     ­
     size of a service authority, which can vary significantly. The level at which the service author-
     ity is defined is relevant, as it implies the extent to which financial and human resources may
     be available to execute its functions effectively. The atomization of local governments in
     some countries may thus undermine the capacity and effectiveness of service authorities.

                                                      The research found various private sector service provision models, ranging from

                         Different service delivery models are operating in different rural population segments,
                      each with distinct service levels and challenges.
                         While the community-based management model remains the dominant service delivery
                      model, a differentiation of service delivery models, based on local context was found. In
                      upper-middle income and higher income countries, an emerging trend toward urban
                      utilities integrating peri-urban and denser rural populations into their service areas was
                      ­
                      found (China, Morocco, the Philippines). Also aggregated management models, under

                      multi-village schemes). Private operators with delegated management for rural towns were
                      commonly found (Haiti, Bangladesh, Vietnam), sometimes including standalone smaller
                      systems in their service areas (for example, Benin). Service levels, service delivery models
                      and some common challenges for three main population segments are illustrated in

     Notes
     1.	 Physical scarcity is where water demand exceeds available renewable water resources, such that no further water resources
        can be developed without affecting other uses. Such scarcity differs from economic water scarcity, a situation in which
        available water resources exceed demand, but infrastructure and institutions are not able to harness those resources to
        meet demands. Scarcity is defined mostly at river basin scale, so within a country different degrees of scarcity can exist.

     2.	 Or actually, the challenge is to transition to universal “safely managed drinking water services” as per the new SDG defini-
        tions, which requires access at the household premises, as well as quality and reliability of supply.

     3.	 It should be mentioned that which schemes are included in the “universe” of schemes will be an important driver of the
        reported non-functionality rate. For example, in Kyrgyz Republic, many schemes were built in the 1950s and 1960s, and are
        beyond their economic lifespan, so non-functionality of these schemes is no surprise.

     4.	 The amount of power and authority transferred and the degree of autonomy of the decentralized units in performing
        their functions increases along the spectrum of centralized provision, deconcentration, delegation, and devolution
        (Boex 2015).

     5.	 The term community enterprise in the China context refers to a form of public-private partnership with companies holding
        a delegated management contract. It is typical for these companies to be established under the auspices of a government
        authority, but operating along commercial lines. Typically, the government retains ownership of the physical assets and
        sets performance and reporting standards for each company, which are expected to cover their operating expenses and in
        some cases to contribute to capital maintenance.

30   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Chapter 4   Emerging Good Practices for Sustainable Rural
            Water Service Delivery

            This chapter provides the main findings in terms of progress toward establishing the
            enabling environment for sustainable services at sector level and for the various service
            delivery models. It analyzes each of the five building blocks and highlights good perfor-
            mance and practices that have contributed to putting in place these building blocks. Where
            the assessment found common challenges, these are also presented. To frame the results,
            an overview of the findings across all countries is given in table 4.1, followed by five sec-
            tions, each unpacking one of the five building blocks. For each building block, a summary
            box is presented as well as two graphs, one representing sector and service delivery mod-
            els scores for each country, and a second graph showing sector score against country
            wealth (GNI per capita). This is to illustrate whether wealthier countries tend to be more

     economic development path.1 This chapter concludes with a summary of key findings and
     lessons that have been explored through the country case studies. Appendix G includes
     two-page summaries for each of the 16 country case studies and country working papers
     with detailed evidence of scoring are available upon request at AskWater@worldbank.org
       Table 4.1 presents the sustainability building block scores and total sector sustainability
     score across all countries,2 recognizing that sector governance and country context will have
     a bearing on the scores. Generally, institutional capacity has advanced furthest, with financ-
     ing and monitoring and regulatory oversight following. The relatively low scores for asset
     management indicate the novelty of the concept for rural water supplies in many countries.
     Low scores are also found for water resources management, except for Morocco and Ceará
     state in Brazil, both of which have a long tradition in water resources management. Total
     sustainability scores at sector level are high in Brazil, China, and Morocco, while countries
     that are more challenged in putting in place the building blocks for sustainability include
     Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Nepal.

     Box 4.1 summarizes key findings from the assessment for the institutional capacity

           BOX 4.1.   Key Findings of Institutional Capacity Building Block


           Good progress has been made, particularly at national level, to improve institutional
           capacity, and develop policies and decentralization frameworks to improve
           sustainable service delivery. Strong institutional capacity is found where rural water
           is a development priority, translating into clear mandates for national institutions to
           plan infrastructure development in consultation with local authorities, such as for
           Morocco, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Both Ethiopia and Benin
           have shown persistent sector leadership: Benin in reforming the rural water sector
           transitioning to professional private sector management models, and Ethiopia
           through the establishment of a sector wide approach, known as the One WASH
           National Program.

           In several countries, national programs moved beyond infrastructure provision
           and aim to support local governments in fulfilling their mandates for service
           provision. However, progress has been moderate in building capacity at lower tiers
           of government, at the service authority level, and across various types of service
           providers as evidenced in figure 4.1.

           Figure 4.2 indicates that there is no clear pattern in terms of the relationship between
           country wealth and progress in addressing institutional capacity. Putting in place

                                                                               box continues next page

                                                     sound institutional arrangements shows clear outliers, such as Ethiopia and Benin,
                                                     despite having low levels of GNI per capita (∼US$2,000 per capita) and on the other
                                                     hand, Philippines, challenged by institutional fragmentation despite a relatively high
                                                     GNI per capita (US$8,900).

                                                     A number of effective institutional arrangements were identified that hold promise
                                                     for improving service delivery. Providing structured post construction and monitoring
                                                     support to service providers was critical. Lessons from Indonesia, Benin, Brazil, India,
                                                     and Tanzania show this can be delivered through:

                                                     •	 Clearly defined, assigned and resourced local government functions

                                                     •	 Federated platforms/associations acting as technical assistance providers

                                                     •	 Higher tier public entities or utilities, well-funded and mandated to deliver
                                                          ongoing support to service providers

                                                     Another example of improving institutional capacity is aggregating communities to
                                                     make concession/lease contracts more attractive to private operators, combined
                                                     with the delivery of capacity building programs for private operators and service
                                                     authorities to effectively engage in such contracting.

framework, as well as the extent to which rural water is addressed in poverty reduction
plans, national strategic development plans, or through the integration in social invest-
ment programs, is further evidence of sector leadership. In Morocco, the impetus to rap-
idly expand rural water services led the government to assign the national utility ONEE
to take on this mandate. In Vietnam, the delivery of a large-scale government program,
the National Target Program3, was hosted with a dedicated office within the lead institu-
tion for the sector, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD). MARD
              technical assistance through its National Centre for Rural Water Supply
also provided ­
and Sanitation (NCERWASS), supporting provincial governments in planning and imple-
mentation. Ethiopia is another example of political leadership, through developing a
sector wide approach known as the One WASH National Program (OWNP).


Assignment of Post Construction Support and Monitoring of Service Providers

to local governments (at least in legal or policy terms, although not fully in p
ever, functions such as monitoring and regulatory oversight, as well as post construction
support to service providers, were found to be ill-defined or missing in many cases. National
programs have helped to build local government capacity to plan and implement rural water
infrastructure development. For example, programs in Punjab and Uttarakhand in India
were implemented through local government structures in line with  decentralization of
rural water responsibilities to Gram Panchayats to identify schemes, procure materials and
contractors, and ensure the works are carried out. Ongoing support is provided from higher
institutional levels, namely districts and state government, to strengthen GP and service
provider capacity. Similar experiences are found in Vietnam and Indonesia, where local gov-
ernments lead the planning process and are in charge of implementation. The Kyrgyz Repub-
lic has a clear and well-defined decentralization framework under which Ayl-Okmotus (local
self-government administrations) are responsible for ensuring service delivery. However,
they receive little or no guidance or support from the central ministry or its regional branches
for rural water, in large part due to chronic underfunding and lack of staff.
  In almost all countries, significant numbers of rural schemes exist with little to no over-
sight or without any form of support once infrastructure is in place. In the context of
decentralization, defining and assigning responsibilities to local service authorities for
post construction and monitoring support to service providers remains an area to be
addressed in many countries.
  In some countries, centralized agencies have yet to align with decentralization poli-
cies, maintaining a role in direct implementation rather than facilitating local govern-
ment in executing their mandates. In Nepal, for a certain period, district authorities
lacked elected officials and overall capacity to implement rural water services. The
Department of Water Supply and Sewerage, through its divisional offices, continued
implementation of water supply projects without district authorities’ involvement,


Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models                             35
     justified by their low capacity. The foreseen introduction of a federal structure will mod-
     ify support arrangements to local authorities and the extent of functional transfer. In
     Ghana, the Community Water and Sanitation Agency has a mandate to provide technical
     support and facilitation to the local government District Assemblies, as well as for
     resource mobilization. Due to the weak role of local government assemblies, the agency
     continues to be involved in direct implementation of investments. A review of functional
     assignment may be needed so that assigned roles are commensurate with capacities and
     resources of local government assemblies.
       In many countries, government institutions and local governments have yet to institution-
     alize their roles and responsibilities for service delivery beyond project implementation.
     While understandably project-based approaches are prominent in fragile contexts such as
     Haiti, even countries with strong capacity such as Ghana, Morocco, and Vietnam are facing
     common challenges in building adequate institutional arrangements to monitor services and
     support service providers. Positive examples of institutionalized local government support
     to service providers can be found in Punjab and Uttarakhand. Both states adopted a
                                                                       decentralized struc-
     sector-wide approach, so that—independent from the funding source—­
     tures and arrangements would be followed. In both states, the community management
     model has transitioned into a decentralized local government model, with Gram Panchayats
     delegating service provision to village water and sanitation committees.4



     Support to Service Providers Through Ongoing Training and Technical
     Assistance is Crucial, Although Often Underfunded
     At service delivery level, satisfactory institutional capacity is seen where service providers
     benefit from capacity building—through continuous training programs on technical and
     financial management—and when providers have access to ongoing support. Although most
     capital investment programs include an initial component of capacity building for service
     providers, some countries have made support for service providers a key component of rural
     programs. This is the case in Indonesia’s Community-based Water Supply and Sanitation
     program (Penyediaan Air Minum dan Sanitasi Berbasis Masyarakat, or PAMSIMAS), where
     targeted support is provided to community based organizations (CBOs) depending on their
     level of professionalization. In Benin, the government is actively pursuing training programs
     to develop private sector capacity to engage into concession contracts with local govern-
     ments (see box 4.3).
       Community-based service providers were found to be performing well when supported by
     larger, aggregated organizations (associations or federations) providing on-going technical
     assistance. In this professionalized community management model, activities that require
     economies of scale are carried out at a higher, or federated level, and those that can be done
     locally are done by the members. This type of tiered model was found in Ceará in Brazil in
     the Sistema Integrado de Saneamento Rural (SISAR) and to a lesser scale in Tanzania through
     the Water Services Facilities Trust model (see box 4.4).

      BOX 4.3.   Effective Initiatives to Build Service Providers’ Capacity


      In Indonesia, PAMSIMAS has introduced a grading system to assess community based
      organizations’ (CBOs’) professionalization level. This grading system initially classified
      CBOs into three categories, which enabled program implementers (districts and
      consultants) to tailor their support activities:

      •	 Growing CBOs. Newly formed CBOs require extensive support, such as
         organizational development, administrative support, training for members, and
         tariffs setting, for example.

      •	 Developed CBOs. Require some level of support, including training board members,
         on operations and O&M costs, planning and general administration.

      •	 Independent CBOs. Those able to sustain their operations without much support.

      In Tanzania, the World Bank has developed a water user committee (so-called COWSO)
      competency monitoring tool, adapted from the Indonesian experience. The tool is a
      checklist covering COWSOs’ competency and service provision over a range of areas. It
      provides a score, which can be used for benchmarking of performance between COWSOs,
      which introduces the potential to incentivize excellence, and can be used by civil
      society for advocacy purposes. By using a structured checklist, the tool identifies what
      the COWSO is not doing or where it lacks in capacity, and therefore not only provides
      guidance on what areas of support they need, but also provides form of aspirational
      roadmap for the COWSOs on the direction that they should be working toward.

      In Benin, a program of training to private operators was initiated as part of a pilot
      project funded by the World Bank, due to scale up in 2017. The program organized
      national workshops in different parts of the country to attract a large pool of private
      operators, and partnered with a local Business Development Service provider to
      develop a national training program for water operators, focusing on both technical
      and financial management. Operators that complete the program will obtain a
      certificate that will strengthen their profile when seeking commercial loans for
      investing in water schemes.

      In Uttarakhand (India), capacity building of the water committees (UWSSC) and Gram
      Panchayats was scaled up by adopting a sector-wide approach in 2006: the same
      approach to capacity building was followed independently of whether funds came from
      the World Bank loan, or from regular State and Central government funds. During project
      implementation, a series of bodies at block, district and state level provided support to
      Gram Panchayats (GPs) and Village Water and Sanitation Committees (VWSCs), and were
      strengthened in the process, including facilitating necessary mergers and coordination
      mechanism. The block, district and state bodies have now taken on their role in providing
      continuous post construction support, for example, through the deployment of a
      dedicated back-stopping agency for operation and maintenance (O&M) in Uttarakhand.

           BOX 4.4. Delivering Support to Community-Based Management Organizations
           through Larger Associations or Federations


           In Ceará (Brazil), the SISAR model builds on the strengths of community management,
           complemented by the possibility of professionalizing operators through a federation and
           the technical assistance from the state water supply company (CAGECE), resulting in
           performance improvements. The model engages three entities, with different, but clearly
           defined, tasks in service delivery:

           •	 The member associations are responsible for daily operations such as switching on
              pumps, local minor maintenance (for example, small leakage repairs), water meter
              reading and handing out water bills, as well as user awareness raising and hygiene
              promotion.

           •	 The Federation is responsible for major maintenance, water quality testing, billing
              and tariff collection, and small expansion works. It is split into eight regional units,
              which are responsible for monitoring, planning and organizing maintenance work.

           •	 CAGECE is responsible for supervising the implementation of new rural water
              systems or major rehabilitation works, thereby ensuring the technical quality of
              construction. In addition, CAGECE carries out performance monitoring of SISAR and
              delegates staff and equipment to SISAR units, and finally, it provides laboratory
              facilities, but these services are paid for by SISAR.

           A critical aspect of this model is the way in which in the financing of the costs are
           aggregated. The tariff structure includes clearly established guidelines to define which
           part of the tariff remains at member association level, and what part goes to the
           Federation level. Moreover, there is predictable public finance for replacement of major
           infrastructure components.

           In Tanzania, multiple COWSOs joined together to enable the centralization and
           professionalization of management of their water supply services. It is named locally
           as a “water services facilities trust.” Examples of this management model can be found
           in Hai and Siha districts, some of which had been in existence since the early 2000s.
           Within this model, village water schemes are overseen by a Board of Trustees. These
           boards in turn aggregate to form Water Trusts. For example, each village would have a
           water committee (COWSO) responsible for daily upkeep, resolving local conflicts, and
           processing connection applications. A representative from each water committee is a
           member of a wider multi-village board, and in turn members of the board represent a
           multi-board trust. A chairperson, vice and three other board members are elected from
           among the village and board representatives to form the executive board. The overall
           trust employs a manager, accountant, and technicians to run particular branches of the
           system. This aggregated, centralized model generally has higher administrative and
           technical capacity than in single-scheme COWSOs. Their larger revenue base also allows
           them to better absorb ‘shocks’, such as unexpected system failure, and access loans for
           network improvement or expansion.



38   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
  In several countries, national, regional, or local utilities are increasingly supplying water
to rural populations. A range of utility services in rural areas can be found from integrating a
few schemes as in the Philippines (Water Districts) or Vietnam (Joint Stock Companies) to
wide-spanning service provision in rural areas in Morocco (ONEE) or China (Water Affairs
Companies). Most of these utilities have sound technical capacity, enabling a higher service
level for rural populations. Although rural water services are less commercially attractive,
building on the capacity of larger urban or regional service providers is a promising avenue
to improve rural services.
  A critical challenge in building service provider capacity and monitoring their perfor-
mance is securing sustainable funding streams for execution of these functions, from local
governments and other sources. This is a critical gap in many countries, and even where
responsibility for financing these important tasks is clear, funding is frequently inade-
quate. For example, in Nicaragua the costs of providing technical assistance and support to
community organizations are supposed to be covered by municipal governments. However,
according to national data, current levels of expenditure are only a fraction of what is
needed and of 152 municipal water and sanitation units that were surveyed, 119 reported
not having an operational budget for technical assistance in the field of water supply.

           BOX 4.5.   Key Findings of Financing Building Block


           Good practices were found where countries planned capital investments in rural
           water services based on sector-wide approaches and where investments are
           systematically co-financed through national and local tax revenues, augmented with
           well-coordinated development partner transfers. Fixed percentages of community
           contribution to capital inlays are being replaced with a flexible approach, where
           household contributions are upheld but aligned with affordability levels.

           Driven by the access agenda, a common challenge remains implementation of
           sustainable financing mechanisms to cover recurrent costs, capital maintenance,
           and capital replacement, whether through tariffs, taxes, or transfers. Tariff policies
           remain urban-biased, ill-defined and not adequately tailored to rural contexts. The
           common approach is that local governments are called to the rescue upon scheme
           failure through an ad-hoc rather than a planned life cycle cost approach. Political
           prioritization of other sectors by service authorities further puts rural water schemes
           at risk.

           Tariff guidelines that accurately define and allocate responsibility for financing
           different life cycle costs emerge as good examples. The implementation of
           such guidelines can help operationalize policies at local level and overcome low
           willingness-to-charge by service authorities. Affordability constraints by rural
           households were not identified as a critical issue in the study countries.

           Other good practices identified to increase the financial sustainability of rural water
           services are:

           •	 Assessment of realistic demand for services and the tailoring of design standards
              to local conditions

           •	 Heavy investments in community mobilization and communications to accompany
              the transition to higher level services and metering

           •	 Diversifying management models to include private sector and utility models,
              which tend to be exposed to formalized regulatory oversight and enforceable tariff
              regimes

           •	 Addressing costs reductions through innovations such as solar pumping

           •	 Introduce result-based finance mechanisms to incentivize governments to focus on
              sustainability of rural water investments

     local governments contribute significantly to capital investments, typically a third of invest-
     ment requirements, in line with central government policy.  Ethiopia’s leadership has
     resulted in increased public expenditure from 0.41 percent of GDP in 2008–09 to 0.67 per-
     cent in 2011–12 and the establishment of a Consolidated WASH Account to bring together
     development partner financing.

     Community Contribution Remains Important but is Looked at More Flexibly
     With higher level of service requirements and the more challenging and often poorer com-
     munities left unserved, a dogmatic “5 to 10 percent community contribution” is being
     replaced with a flexible approach where household contributions are upheld as a principle,
     but aligned with affordability levels. While several countries have a policy for community
     contributions to capital investment6, in reality, such contributions were reported to be rela-
     tively minor. Guidelines are not strictly followed (for example, in Vietnam) or have been
     dropped (for example, in Ghana). In the context of World Bank support projects in Punjab
     and Uttarakhand, the percentage-wise contribution has changed to a fixed amount, at a level
     considered to be more affordable, similar to in the Kyrgyz Republic. In Nepal, with a strong
     tradition of community driven development, contributions of around 20 percent of the cap-
     ital cost are expected from households. This “self-help” approach has been acknowledged as
     a driver for Nepal’s progress in increasing access in rural areas.

     Financing Recurrent O&M Costs, Capital Maintenance and Capital Replacement
     Requires More Accurate Tariff Guidelines and Policy Frameworks
     Driven by the access agenda, financing strategies for rural water have mainly focused on
     capital investments, with less attention to adopting realistic approaches to finance recurrent
     costs, capital maintenance and replacement. Only seven of the 16 countries have a formal
     tariff policy pertaining to rural water supply services. In most countries, policies do not
     differentiate between urban and rural contexts and require “full cost recovery” as a blanket
     ­
     policy without further guidance on how operational, capital maintenance and capital
     replacement would be financed in rural contexts, or for different type of schemes in rural
     areas. Moreover, the definition and understanding of the commonly cited “full cost recov-
     ery” is often inaccurate and ambiguous.7 Countries with no national tariff policy include
     Brazil, Haiti, and Benin, although in the latter the Direction Générale de l’Eau provides guid-
     ing principles. The Kyrgyz Republic has just developed a national policy (2016), but it has yet
     to be applied.
       One challenge across several countries is to see policies translated into practice at local
     level. In particular, most countries lack detailed guidelines for setting tariffs at scheme level.
     As a result, only a few countries identify which specific costs are to be covered out of tariffs,
     and which will be covered out of taxes (or transfers). Without a clear framework that allo-
     cates financing responsibilities between service providers, service authorities or central
     government, based on the real costs of water provision, the common approach of “fix on
     failure” prevails. By contrast, in Brazil—in the absence of a national policy—a tariff guideline


42   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
has been established under the SISAR model. In this system, user tariffs are designed to
recover operation costs, costs for SISAR technical assistance agents, minor maintenance
costs and short life-span assets (for example, pumps), whereas funding for replacement of
distribution networks is expected to come from general state taxes.
  When tariffs are insufficient to meet costs, local governments tend to come to the rescue,
through an ad hoc rather than a planned life-cycle cost approach. Political prioritization
of  other sectors further erodes financial sustainability of rural water schemes. In the
Philippines, for example, Barangay (village) governments often subsidize O&M costs, as
revenues from tariffs are too low. In the Kyrgyz Republic, Ayl-Okmotus step in to cover
major repairs, although in an ad hoc manner. Competing priorities mean that water ser-
vices may not make it to the top of local governments’ agendas. Even when local govern-
ment funds are earmarked for sustaining water supplies, they may be used for more
politically “attractive” projects such as roads. In Vietnam, despite a comprehensive national
tariffs policy set by the Ministry of Finance, which recognizes the need to subsidize rural
water services—including for operational costs, where affordability is a constraint—its
application is limited by local governments’ reluctance to invest their own funds in rural
water services (see box 4.6).
  For most countries, the challenge remains to increase the willingness to charge by service
authorities and lift political resistance to such increases. This challenge is often rooted in
the absence of an oversight and support mechanism to assist service providers and author-
ities in calculating tariffs, and transparent processes to approve them (see section 4.5).




      BOX 4.6.   Vietnam’s Tariff Policy and its Implementation


      Vietnam has developed comprehensive guidelines for calculating full cost-recovery
      tariffs, that is, which take into account operations costs, the cost of capital, and
      asset depreciation. The tariff setting process involves a first step of validation by
      the ministries concerned to verify the calculations behind the proposed tariffs.
      Once validated, service providers propose the tariffs to provincial authorities, or the
      Provincial People Committees (PPCs) for their subsequent approval, which takes into
      account affordability constraints.

      Regardless, any tariff should be within the bracket set for rural areas—between
      D2,000 (US$0.08) and D11,000 (US$0.48) per cubic meter. If the tariffs required by
      the service provider to meet full cost recovery are above what would be considered
      affordable by the PPC (see Decree No. 117/2007/ND-CP), then PPCs must subsidize
      the difference between the social tariffs and the commercially viable tariffs. PPCs
      are required to disburse a subsidy to service providers to ensure that assets are
      adequately maintained. In practice, PPCs do not often implement the Decree, and
      there are no mechanisms to incentivize them to do differently.

     Nicaragua is a case in point, where municipalities often do not exercise their authority—and
     responsibility—to review and approve the tariffs set by water committees; the same is true of
     a significant number of District Assemblies in Ghana. In other cases, such as China and the
     Kyrgyz Republic, tariff setting is supposed to be formally regulated and approved by third-
     party government bodies, Anti-Monopoly Commission and Financing Bureaus respectively,
     but in practice political influence often results in suppressed tariffs.
       Willingness to charge was found to be especially critical in situations where service levels
     are transitioning from point-source or stand posts to piped networks with individual house
     connections. In these settings, community-based service providers are expected to profes-
     sionalize and perform at a higher level, or in some countries service provision is delegated to
     the private sector, where a predictable revenue stream through regulation by contract
     becomes indispensable.

     Affordability of Rural Water Services Does not Seem to be a Key Issue Based
     on the Current Rural Tariffs Levied
     The study found that tariff levels for rural services were affordable across most countries,
     even for the poor. Appendix F includes details of tariff policies, tariff ranges and estimates of
     affordability. For most countries, water tariff expenditures were in the range of one to three
     percent of monthly income of poor households, with Benin, Brazil, and Ghana showing
     slightly higher values, still within the 5 percent affordability bracket. A global body of
     evidence confirms that those who are not connected to public services are often paying the
     highest price for water services. In Ghana and Bangladesh, tariffs that have been set by
     ­
     service authorities or providers are often only partially paid or more likely not paid at all,
     with user contributions collected upon failure of a facility. In Benin, household connections
     were found to be more affordable for the poor than stand posts services (see box 4.7). Atten-
     tion is required to avoid large discrepancies between official tariffs—sanctioned by the ser-
     vice authority—and what customers pay at public stand posts, due to excessive mark-ups.


     A Multi-Pronged Long-Term Approach is Needed to Develop Financially
     Sustainable Service Delivery Models
     In the study countries, more advanced financing arrangements can be found for private sec-
     tor models and public utility management models (figure 4.3). These management models
     tend to have more comprehensive and enforceable tariff regimes that aid their ability to gen-
     erate revenues beyond operational costs, finance capital maintenance, and a part of asset
     replacement costs. In the absence of tariff guidelines for rural services, not many service
     authorities or service providers can source the full life cycle costs, or even have the capacity
     to determine these. Many countries face difficulties in even securing operational cost recov-
     ery, especially for (non-supported) community management models or direct government
     provision, eroding the sustainability of these models.
       In addition to unclear tariff policy and inadequate allocation of responsibilities between
     service providers and service authorities, low consumption levels were found to limit the

      BOX 4.7. Who Pays the Most: Households with Connections or Stand
      Post Customers?


      Rural water schemes can be an attractive source of additional revenues for operators.
      In Benin, for example, tariffs in rural areas are generally higher than in urban areas
      (where they are set at CFAF488 per cubic meter or US$0.78 per cubic meter).
      Those who pay the highest price are those who use communal stand posts (often
      fed through small piped water schemes) managed by fontainiers or water kiosks
      operators. Reported tariffs applied by water scheme operators to fontainiers vary
      between CFAF420 (US$0.7) per cubic meter to over CFAF800 (US$1.3) per cubic
      meter in some areas.

      However, tariffs that are applied at communal stand posts are three to four times
      higher than those applied by operators to the fontainiers. Commonly, a 20 litre bucket
      (often used by communities to fetch water at stand posts), is sold by fontainiers
      for CFAF25. This means that the tariff effectively disbursed by rural populations
      using stand posts is CFAF1250 per cubic meter (US$2), which is nearly double the
      average tariff applied for household connections (and the tariff paid by fontainiers).
      There is therefore a strong case for promoting household connections to support
      more affordable tariffs. Scaling-up higher service levels (that is, through household
      connections) requires adapting service delivery models to this new customer basis.
      For example, there may be a need to consider weekly bills before gradually moving to
      monthly bills so customers are gradually acquainted with the service delivery model.

revenue streams of rural water schemes. Low consumption is generally due to households’
easy access to alternative sources of water, combined with the low perceived benefit of using
improved sources. In some cases, affordability constraints can be at play. Consumption is
often low where households only have access to communal stand posts, as opposed to
household connections.
  Addressing willingness to pay for higher service levels and a transition to metered connec-
tions requires substantial efforts in community mobilization and communications. Without
significant investments in communications campaigns from the design phase (throughout
construction and until the early stages of operations), households may remain reluctant to
use the newly installed connections. In Vietnam, for example, it was found that many large
multi-commune schemes constructed under the World Bank-supported National Target
Program were functioning at sub-optimal levels due to very low consumption levels. High
switching costs—such as for in-house plumbing—may constitute additional barriers. In con-
trast, in Morocco, in programs led by the public utility ONEE, demand for household connec-
tions is carefully assessed through community mobilization activities and households

           BOX 4.8. The Role of Community Mobilization for Extending Household
           Connections in Morocco


           Community mobilization is at the heart of ONEE’s approach in rural areas.
           Communication activities to generate buy-in from the population, identify demand
           for services (and the level of services) and explain the benefit of projects, are
           embedded at all implementation steps from design to construction. These activities
           are led on the ground by facilitators deployed in each village where ONEE is looking
           to extend the network.

           A key objective of these activities is to identify the service levels required, and if
           they prefer household connections or whether communal stand posts would be
           sufficient to meet their demands. ONEE agrees to provide household connections
           only where 70 percent of the village population (douar) express such a demand
           and when communes are able to contribute toward financing 15 percent of required
           investments. In addition, households are required to pay the connection costs, set at
           DH3,500 (US$348) in rural areas. For households that are not able to disburse this
           sum upfront, a revolving fund has been set up to provide credit facilities.

           ONEE has developed a procedure to ensure that poor households are prioritized for
           accessing the credit facilities. All households are required to make a minimum deposit
           of DH1,000 (US$99), in two installments for their connection. The implementation
           of these procedures relies on significant investments in community mobilization to
           accompany populations in this transition toward increased levels of services.




     expressing demand for individual facilities are asked to make a substantial deposit toward
     covering installation costs (see box 4.8).
       Technical and financial viability of rural schemes can be enhanced if water demand and
     demographic trends are adequately assessed and design parameters are tailored to rural
     conditions. In China, facilities were found to be overdesigned—up to a factor of seven—due
     to application of urban-biased per capita water demand standards, combined with neglect
     of a strong demographic trend for rural out-migration. Other factors depressing water
     demand across countries in rural areas were taste preferences and elderly “left behind”
     populations not having adopted higher consumption hygiene behaviors. Low tariffs and
     low consumption, combined with overly costly infrastructure, negatively impacts viability
     both financially and technically due to low throughput, leading to maintenance and water
     quality issues.
       Where rural electrification is low and reliance on diesel inflicts high operational costs,
     switching to solar-powered systems may improve the financial sustainability of water
     schemes. Steps in this direction have been taken in Tanzania, where the World Bank is assist-
     ing the government in adopting solar energy at scale to reduce the operational and


46   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
maintenance costs of rural water supply schemes. Solar schemes may likely be more sustain-
able in the long term given fewer opportunities for systems to break down, provided theft
and vandalism is adequately prevented.
  Finally, to incentivize central and local governments to focus on the sustainability
of  rural water investments, results-based financing mechanisms are being introduced.
Vietnam is implementing a Program for Results World Bank loan, where disbursements are
linked to achievements of pre-determined targets, which are proxy measures of sustain-
ability (for example, professionalized management and cost-recovery levels). In Tanzania,
the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID) is supporting the government
with a Payment by Results scheme, with disbursements linked to i) bringing non-­functional
facilities back into operation, and ii) keeping facilities functioning in a given year. Such
approaches require the presence of accurate baseline data and robust monitoring systems
(see also section 4.5).


Asset Management
Box 4.9 summarizes the key findings from the asset management building block.




      BOX 4.9.   Key Findings of Asset Management Building Block


      Asset management is a relatively new concept in the rural water sector. Regardless
      of economic development (see figure 4.5), half of the countries still need to address
      basic issues, such as clarity around asset ownership, clearly defining responsibilities
      for capital maintenance and renewal, and carrying out first-time inventories or – as a
      start water point mapping exercises.

      Common challenges are de-facto practices conflicting with incomplete legal
      frameworks, and overlapping responsibilities at different levels of government
      that aid to the ambiguity in asset management responsibilities. Asset management
      of small water schemes, managed by communities or local governments is mostly
      absent. Better scores for asset management at service provider level are found in
      contexts with urban/regional utilities, private sector models, or multi-village schemes
      with aggregated, professionalized management arrangements, such as the case in
      Benin, China, India, Morocco, Nicaragua and Vietnam (figure 4.6).

      Ghana has made good progress to allow assets to be adequately maintained
      through: i) clear asset ownership, ii) allocation of responsibilities for different asset
      maintenance categories, iii) financing mechanisms, iv) asset management guidance
      documents. Some innovative financing mechanisms for capital maintenance of rural
      schemes are identified, such as through pooled fund arrangements, sourced from
      tariff revenues and local taxes (China, Ghana).

delegate the management and operation of individual schemes to a third-party entity.
Similarly, in Brazil, the Federal Constitution allocates the responsibility for water supply to
­
the municipalities and assets are retained under municipal ownership. Similar clarity was
found in Ghana. In China, asset ownership is clearly established by national guidelines and is
determined by which entities or agencies financed the schemes, allowing four possible sce-
narios including provisions for asset ownership transfers. Thus, asset ownership normally
stays with the service authority, which is responsible and better positioned to provide long-
term capital support for infrastructure expansion and major maintenance.
  In other countries, however, ambiguities on asset ownership remain. In India, for example,
there is no clarity in national guidelines regarding asset ownership, as rural water is a state
subject. As a result, asset owners are designated depending on the program or implementing
agency through which water schemes are constructed, as per state-level guidelines. Like-
wise, in Ethiopia there is still lack of clarity around asset ownership, and asset management
is not yet established as a commonplace approach in the rural water sub-sector, although
there have been recent national-scale efforts to develop inventories of water facilities.
  In some cases, ownership has de facto been given to community-based management orga-
nizations, in contradiction with existing legal frameworks for service provision. This is the
case in Indonesia, for example, where communities are made de facto owners of the assets,
when local governments are service authorities, that is, they are responsible for the provision
of water services. In some countries national legislation is conflicting, such as in Tanzania,
where the Water Supply and Sanitation Act (2009) state that community-based organizations,
so-called COWSOs, own water works, while the local government act designates local govern-
ments as service authorities. In Ethiopia, asset ownership is ill-defined, resulting in lack of
clarity for responsibilities with regards to asset maintenance and renewal. Communities are
de facto made responsible for operations, maintenance and asset renewal, although they
struggle to obtain any funds for asset maintenance or renewal from their village administra-
tions. In turn, village administrations consider assets to be owned by communities and are
reluctant to take on a greater share of the financing burden post construction.


Allocation of Responsibilities for Asset Management Needs Precision,
Especially when Several Levels of Governments are Involved
Even when asset ownership is well defined, the absence of formal delegation agreements creates
confusion over the allocation of asset maintenance responsibilities between service authorities
and service providers. Similarly to tariff setting guidelines, delegation agreements often lack
clarity on detailed categories for asset repairs and maintenance, specifically for “minor repairs,”
which should be financed and carried out by the service providers, and “major repairs,” which
are to be carried out by the service authority. This lack of detailed allocation of responsibilities is
found in situations without formal agreements, for example, between local governments and
community-based organizations, but also in cases with formal contractual arrangements, such
as poorly drafted lease contracts in Benin or unregulated concession contracts in Vietnam.

       Overlapping responsibilities at different levels of government in highly decentralized
     countries can also aid the ambiguity in asset management responsibilities. In the Philippines
     and Indonesia, where assets are owned by local governments, there are overlapping func-
     tions for the lowest two tiers of government, that is, village administrations and district
     authorities. Financial responsibility for asset maintenance and renewal has not been well
     assigned and requires clarification as part of territorial and governance reforms.


     Asset Inventory and Asset Management Tools are Key to Better Asset
     Management Practices
     Many countries have taken steps toward a comprehensive inventory of rural water assets,
     with associated capital value, such as Uttarakhand (India), Nicaragua, the Kyrgyz Republic,
     Vietnam, and Benin. Since 2016, Benin’s government has been scaling up the inventory of all
     rural and small-town piped water schemes, to optimize the conditions for delegation to pro-
     fessional operators, using a cloud-based platform and service (mWater). Other countries have
     carried out large-scale water point mapping such as Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Nepal, although
     such exercises should not be confused with detailed asset inventories. In the context of lim-
                                                                                       resourced
     ited financial capacity and a lack of prioritization for rural water supply, less-­
     governments may face difficulties in prioritizing the asset inventory and introduction of
     management practices without dedicated development partner support (see figure 4.6).
       There is little to no evidence that asset management of small water schemes, either man-
     aged by community-based organizations or local governments, has been institutionalized in
     rural water provision. As previously highlighted, most countries plan for rural water services
     in an ad hoc manner, often only responding as and when service failure occurs. Assets are
     normally maintained or replaced as “fix on failure.”
       Asset management practices of public utilities and private sector management models are
     more advanced. Where large national or regional utilities are involved in rural water supply,
     rural assets are treated similarly to other assets: for example, Morocco’s ONEE has a detailed
     inventory of all assets, including communal stand posts.
       Only two countries, China and Ghana, have a comprehensive framework for asset manage-
     ment. In Ghana, the government’s Community Water and Sanitation Agency has a well-­
     defined seven-step cycle as part of its guidance on infrastructure asset management (see
     figure 4.7). In China, large-scale utility urban providers serving rural populations have well
     established asset management practices. In both countries, there is clear differentiation
     between major and minor repairs and funding mechanisms are outlined, although due to
     financial constraints funding is not necessarily available.

     Financing of Capital Maintenance and Replacement is Happening through
     Capital Maintenance Funds, Although the Sustainability of these Funds Remains
     Challenging
     In several countries, part of the revenues feed into a capital maintenance fund. In Benin,
     service  providers, including for manually operated handpumps, pay part of their revenues,

                                                    The three northern regions of Ghana offer an example of the use of pooled funding
                                                    (sometimes also called mutualization of funds) to address capital maintenance needs.
                                                    The Association of Water and Sanitation Development Boards (AWSDB) was formed
                                                    in 1995 when the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) supported
                                                    an intervention to rehabilitate water systems for community management. CIDA
                                                    requested the communities to make upfront payment of six months’ operations and
                                                    maintenance as commitment fees. The funds were mobilized by the AWSDB and
                                                    deposited in a reserve fund. In addition, the AWSDB mobilized a 5 percent capital cost
                                                    contribution from 22 communities that were benefiting from water systems being
                                                    rehabilitated by the World Bank. The AWSDB advocated for the funds to be deposited
                                                    in the reserve fund and invested until completion of the rehabilitation works, when

           the funds were paid. The build-up of the reserve fund was supported through
           investment in short-term government treasury bills that yielded high returns, as
           interest rates were high at the time. Other sources of funds for the reserve fund were
           donations received from individuals and external support agencies. From 1998 to
           2003, the reserve fund was in the range of US$100,000 to 330,000 and the average
           interest rate 24 percent to 39 percent. The board members were obliged to purchase
           shares (unit trusts) as well as annual subscription fees. The funds that accrue from
           this fund are issued as loans with moderate interest to members who apply to
           fix their water systems whenever the cost for repair or replacement is beyond what
           they can afford on their own. In the event of a breakdown, a formal request is made
           by writing to the association. Afterwards, a team from the association assesses the
           situation and makes a recommendation to the executive committee.

           Initially, members were made to pay monthly contributions. However, over time,
           payments became irregular because some WSDBs are in remote areas where there are
           no rural banks to facilitate the payment of their contributions. As a result, frequency
           of payment was changed to quarterly. Some WSDBs do not pay on a regular basis,
           with the consequence that requests for financial assistance by some members who
           are in dire need may not be honored. A major challenge in administering the pooled
           funding is the high rate of defaults in payment due to the remote location of some of
           the water schemes, although the increase in the use of mobile phones for payment
           could help address this challenge. In addition, the association has not been able to
           address all the needs of the WSDBs due to limited funds from the contributions and,
           most importantly, because the fund is mainly used after system breakdowns and not
           for preventive maintenance.

           After implementing the scheme for some time, the AWSDB now faces several
           financial challenges, making it difficult to achieve its original aim. An NGO is currently
           providing the AWSDB with financial support to continue its operations.

     Water Resources Management
     Box 4.11 summarizes the key findings for the water resources management building block.

     Low Income Countries Struggle to Advance on Water Resources Management
     Practices
     Figure 4.8 shows that low-income countries seem to have advanced less in developing
     ­adequate water resources management practices conducive for sustaining rural water ­services,
     such as legislation frameworks, effective basin agencies, and local water management


52   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
                                BOX 4.11.       Key Findings Water Resources Management Building Block


                                Most countries have legal frameworks for water resources management that prioritize
                                allocation to the domestic water supply. However, water resources management
                                bodies at sub-basin or local levels remain weak in the majority of country studies.
                                Only in a few countries do sub-basin or local WRM bodies have rural drinking water
                                interests represented through rural service providers or service authorities.

                                Good practices in both policy and operations are seen in water-scarce environments,
                                such as Morocco and Ceará state in Brazil, both of which have a long tradition of
                                water resources management as they are driven by physical water scarcity. Other
                                examples of good practices have emerged, including:

                                •	 Proactive measures by the drinking water sector to recharge aquifers and set
                                       up aquifer management initiatives, and integrating catchment protection and
                                       management in rural water programs (India)

                                •	 Development of local-level planning initiatives to enhance collaboration among
                                       water users, local governments, communities and water resources management
                                       entities (Nepal)

                                Advanced practices such as water safety programming and vulnerability
                                assessments were only found within the context of urban utilities serving rural areas
                                (see figure 4.9). Adapting such approaches to a rural context with fragmented service
                                providers has thus far been challenging.

                                           Attention in Practice
                                           Most countries in the study have legal frameworks for water resources management that prior-
                                           itize allocation to the domestic water supply. The assessment reviewed the presence of legal
                                           frameworks and policies in place for the management of water resources, and the role of the
                                           drinking water supply in these. The drinking water supply generally has a priority to ensure
                                           water for human consumption, although this is rarely framed in the context of the human right
                                           to water.
                                             In most countries, water resources management bodies at sub-basin and at local levels
                                           are weak or non-existent. There are no or limited mechanisms for rural service providers or
                                           service authorities to influence planning, to represent rural water supply user interests,

and to protect critical sources for their drinking water needs. Although it is beyond the
scope of this study to determine if and what type of representational mechanisms would
have a positive impact on the sustainability of service delivery, this issue seems relevant in
contexts where rural water users are depending on overexploited and scarce groundwater
sources. Brazil, specifically the state of Ceará, and Morocco exhibited good practices, both
having a long tradition in water resources management as they are driven by physical water
scarcity. In Morocco, an integrated and long-term planning framework for water resource
allocation has been established, although executing adequate demand management prac-
tices remains challenging (for drinking water as well as productive activities). In Ceará
(Brazil), water resources management bodies are established at sub-basin level, in which
the rural drinking water sector is represented, and which can take decisions on allocation
of scarce water resources. However, such bodies and arrangements are not present in all
water-scarce countries. For example, despite suffering from groundwater over-abstraction
and depletion rates of 145 percent of available water, the state of Punjab in India has not
yet set up effective sub-basin and local water management bodies that can address these
challenges. The drinking water sector has witnessed a number of pro-active measures
though, such as recharge measures and local aquifer management initiatives, recogniz-
ing that significant reductions in water withdrawals will need to happen in other sectors,
notably irrigation.
  In several countries where water scarcity is not acute, less progress has been made
in  establishing water resources management bodies. Nicaragua is an example, where
the  national law makes provision for water resources management bodies at regional
level. However, no progress has yet been made in actually setting up such bodies.

Water Resources Management and Protection Measures at Local and
Service Provider Level are Piloted to Address Water Safety and Security of Rural
Populations
Several countries encourage or require drinking water service providers and authorities to
take water resources management measures. For example, in Nicaragua, the community-­
based service providers and municipalities are expected to undertake catchment protection
works, such as reforestation of upper catchments, or protecting local springs; these activi-
ties are then reflected as a performance indicator in the national monitoring system. In
Uttarakhand, the rural water program addresses catchment protection and management to
adequately protect local water sources and contribute to their sustainable use. Nepal’s expe-
rience shows how local level planning initiatives can enhance collaboration among water
users, local governments, communities, and water resources management entities to
develop multiple use water systems (see box 4.12). Advanced practices of water safety pro-
gramming, assessment on water resources vulnerability and yields for future expansions
were only found within the context of urban utilities serving rural areas, as this would be
part of their regular business practices.

           BOX 4.12.   Local Level Water Resources Management in Nepal


           In Nepal, there is considerable institutional fragmentation at the sector and basin
           level regarding water resources management, especially between governmental
           entities responsible for irrigation, hydropower, and water supply. Indeed, water
           allocation plays a considerable role in politics within Nepal and internationally
           between Nepal and, particularly, India. Despite this fragmentation, good examples of
           local-level planning and multiple use infrastructure development exist. In the Finnish
           government-supported Rural Village Water Resources Management Program, Village
           Development Committees, which are essentially sub-district rather than village level
           entities, are supported to develop water use master plans. These plans identify how
           the water resources within their area could be allocated, and how to ensure that
           water is allocated in an equitable manner—a key consideration in a country with
           strong ethnic and caste discrimination practices. Once the master plan is developed,
           flexible, multi-sectoral funding is provided, together with technical support, to assist
           communities in developing multiple-use water systems, often combining drinking
           water supply with micro-hydro schemes and, where possible, irrigation. Anecdotal
           findings from the program indicate communities are more willing to pay for, maintain
           and protect the source of systems from which they derive multiple benefits.

           BOX 4.13.   Key Findings Monitoring and Regulatory Oversight Building Block


           Monitoring is an area that has witnessed significant progress in many countries,
           although wealthier countries tend to have advanced more, such as China
           (for utilities and multi-village schemes), Morocco, India, the Philippines, and Nicaragua
           (see figure 4.10). Monitoring is receiving increasingly attention, with emerging national
           monitoring systems under development or improvement, for example in Ethiopia,
           Tanzania, and Ghana. Unsurprisingly, monitoring and regulation tend to be better
           organized for public utilities, and in some cases for private operators.

           A common challenge is to make the transition from a water point/scheme mapping
           exercise, executed every couple of years, towards a well-functioning and monitoring
           platform that is regularly updated. Another obstacle is central and local governments
           allocating sufficient and regular resources for nationwide monitoring. Challenges persist
           in the proactive use of monitoring outputs to take remedial actions, improve performance
           and inform programming. Good practices are nation (or state) wide systems, such as
           Nicaragua’s or Uttarkhand’s monitoring systems, which include indicators on functionality,

                                                                                 box continues next page

                               are in need of technical support to prevent (further) scheme failure (for example SIASAR).

                               Although most countries have defined service standards, regulatory oversight is still
                               nascent in many countries, especially in terms of the development of and adherence
                               to tariff guidelines. Emerging good practices promoting better oversight and
                               accountability for rural services are (figure 4.11):

                               •	 Philippines’ effort to register all small operators with a designated regulatory agency
                                      (NRWB), encouraging gradual compliance combined with capacity building on tariffs

                               •	 India’s (Punjab, Uttarakhand) social accountability measures, such as social audits in
                                      various stages of implementation and operation and grievance redressal mechanisms

                               •	 National governments delegating regulatory oversight to specific entities such as
                                      in China, Nicaragua, and Kyrgyz Republic, although political interference remains
                                      challenging

                               •	 Regulation through lease contracts for rural water supply in Benin, with a
                                      designated regulatory department and training on tariff calculation methods

                               The absence of regulatory oversight for the multitude of rural service providers implies
                               that service authorities often remain unaccountable, unless social accountability
                               mechanisms involving citizens in the monitoring of services are introduced.

                                     National Monitoring Systems are Evolving with Good Examples Including Performance
                                     and Sustainability Indicators, Going Beyond Binary Functionality
                                     Efficient monitoring systems are seen where rural water asset management is also well
                                     established. This is the case in Morocco and China. In Morocco, the national utility ONEE
                                     closely monitors the functionality of water points and other water schemes it has developed
                                     throughout the country.
                                       A few monitoring systems are moving beyond the binary concept of functionality to track
                                     broader indicators on service quality, including service providers’ performance. One notable
                                     case is the Rural Water and Sanitation Information System, or SIASAR, which is used in Nica-
                                     ragua and the State of Ceará, Brazil (box 4.14). While the World Bank has invested in the sys-
                                     tem’s development, national governments have ensured institutional embedding, covering
                                     the costs of staff and other recurrent costs. Similarly, Uttarakhand’s mechanical and electrical
                                                                                           wide approach supported by the World
                                     (M&E) system, developed as part of the state’s sector-­
                                     Bank, has a comprehensive scope, and serves both program implementation and ongoing ser-
                                     vice delivery stages and is under state-wide rollout.
                                       Increasingly, national programs or specific projects include indicators on sustainability,
                                     with  independent verification to  improve national monitoring  systems and transpar-
                                     ency. The Program for Results in Vietnam, for example, uses indicators related to the man-
                                     agement model, achieved connection rates, cost recovery, and non-revenue water. DfID’s

                                     ize national and local governments to focus on sustainability of services and improve their

      BOX 4.14. The Rural Water and Sanitation Information System or Sistema de
      Información de Agua y Saneamiento Rural (SIASAR)


      SIASAR is a mapping and monitoring system for rural water and sanitation, originally
      developed and applied in 2011 by the governments of Honduras, Panamá, and
      Nicaragua with support from the World Bank and other development partners. It was
      developed to assist water sector policymakers, practitioners, and national planners
      in monitoring the development and performance of rural water supply and sanitation
      services. SIASAR consists of a series of predefined parameters, which are used to
      calculate performance indicators of four elements:

      •	 The community, describing the water and sanitation coverage, including
         households and schools and health clinics in the community

      •	 The water supply system, describing the functioning of the system and the service
         levels provided

      •	 The service provider, describing the performance of the provider in its tasks of
         operation and maintenance

      •	 The technical assistance providers, describing the performance in providing
         technical assistance to service providers

      For each of these four elements, a score from A (very good) to D (very bad) is calculated
      based on the defined indicators. The data from SIASAR can be uploaded via phone
      or tablet to a central database, after which a desktop validation is undertaken by the
      system administrator. The data—both the individual indicator values and the overall
      scores—are publicly available via the SIASAR website, in the form of a map and
      underlying databases. In Nicaragua, a complete baseline of all communities, water
      systems and service providers was made in 2013. Data were collected with support from
      the New Social Emergency Investment Fund (Nuevo FISE) and municipalities. SIASAR is
      operational in 10 Latin American countries, including the state of Ceará (Brazil)




monitoring systems, as reporting systems were a condition for local governments to be
eligible under the program.
  In some cases, monitoring systems that started out as a project system have scaled up and
are developing into nationwide government-led monitoring systems. In Indonesia, the mon-
itoring system under the PAMSIMAS program is transitioning toward a national monitoring
system for rural water supply. In Uttarakhand (India), the Swajal Sector Information System,
which was initially set up to track progress in program implementation, evolved into a sys-
tem to monitor the performance and service delivery of all water supply schemes as part of
the state’s sector-wide approach.
  However, many countries still face significant challenges in establishing a comprehensive
national monitoring system. Common bottlenecks are i) a lack of accuracy due to


Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models                                  59
          reporting, typically on results and access, and ii) partial reporting, that is, not all parts
     over-­
     of the country are covered, data is not being transferred, and service quality and levels are
     missing. Discrepancies between JMP and government figures are common, due to different
     definitions, data sources and calculation methods8. With the SDGs, efforts to improve
     national monitoring systems are likely to be stepped up. The costs associated with establish-
     ing and, most crucially, the continuity of the monitoring efforts once operational at a national
     scale, are significant. Financial and human resources from central governments, service
     authorities, and continuous efforts by service providers are required, while the political
     value of such expenditures is often deemed low.

     Usage of Data from Monitoring Systems is Critical to Enhance Regulatory Oversight and
     Accountability
     Another common challenge is the actual use of data to inform analysis and decision making.
     In Nicaragua, where SIASAR data is publicly accessible, a recent review found that munici-
     palities were generally aware of the existence of the system, but struggled to use data in
     their municipal plans, and indicated bottlenecks in mobilizing resources to update the infor-
     mation on an annual basis (ONGAWA 2015).
       The limited use of available data to take remedial actions relates to the absence, in most
     countries, of institutions mandated with regulatory oversight. Evidence suggests that coun-
     tries have yet to fully institutionalize responsibilities for overseeing service delivery in rural
     areas beyond the implementation phase. Countries that have assigned regulatory oversight
     functions for rural service providers include (see also box 4.15):

     •	 The Philippines, where the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) is the regulatory
       body for the majority of smaller operators (that is, there is no distinction between rural
       and urban areas, but certain types of operators are assigned to various regulators)

     •	 Benin, which set up a Directorate for Public Drinking Water Services and Regulation
       in 2016

     •	 Nicaragua, where the Institute for Water Supply and Sewerage carries out administrative
       checks on the basic documents of water committees, but has little capacity for tariff
       reviews of rural providers

     •	 China, with its provincial Pricing Bureaus, assigned to execute economic regulation, and
       Provincial Water Bureaus, overseeing service performance and the administration of
       incentive schemes

     •	 The Kyrgyz Republic, where the Anti-Monopoly Commission is assigned to endorse tariff
       proposals, which are then approved by the local governments

       Limited capacity, constrained human and financial, of regulatory agencies and entities, as
     well as political influence to repress tariffs, are ongoing challenges.
       National governments often delegate regulatory oversight to service authorities, but de
     facto oversight is limited and service authorities often remain unaccountable. For example,

      BOX 4.15.   Examples of Regulatory Oversight for Rural Water Service Providers


      The Philippines: to increase NWRB’s capacity to effectively monitor and regulate
      service provision, a national survey of service providers was initiated in 2014, and its
      first results were published in 2015. NWRB developed a Listahang Tubig, or Water
      Register, which is a nationwide database and cloud-based system, where data on
      the countries’ utilities (including CBO-managed schemes) are made available to the
      public. The implementation of the Listahang Tubig was supported by a partnership
      among the NWRB, the Department for Local Government, and Local Water Utility
      Agency (LWUA). As of October 2, 2015, data had been collected from 22,844
      water service providers in 1,445 cities and municipalities (out of a total of 1,634)
      nationwide, representing an 88 percent participation rate. The basic profile of all
      water service providers is self-reported, and key performance indicators (KPIs) are
      self-rated by water utilities. The survey revealed that community-managed utilities
      are the most common type, representing 54 percent of water utilities in the country,
      but because of their small size, they serve only 6 percent of the population.

      China: the provincial government in Zhejiang province has set up a well-functioning
      incentive mechanism: this uses monitoring data and links it to an incentive program
      that provides small grants as a reward for well-performing operators and likewise
      penalizes poorly performing ones based on a range of criteria including system and
      staff management planning, procedures of O&M, and water quality monitoring.
      From data obtained from one district (Fuyang district, Hangzhou), 92.6 percent of
      providers were classified as either compliant or excellent and received a cash award
      (averaging around US$200 per operator), and the remaining 7 percent of providers
      were given a small fine.




in Ghana the Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies are tasked with overseeing
the performance of the community-based organizations, including auditing of accounts. In
practice, few MMDAs have the technical capacity, or incentives, to provide any kind of over-
sight, so this remains largely a theoretical function. The absence of oversight implies that
service authorities remain largely unaccountable for their mandates, unless social account-
ability mechanisms involving citizens in the monitoring of services are introduced at scale.
  Positive examples of improving accountability through complaint redressal exist in India.
An example is the Shikayat Nivarn Kendra (or SNK), a centralized complaint redressal sys-
tem undertaken as part of a good governance initiative in Punjab. Given the large numbers of
rural water supply schemes in operation in rural areas of the state, the Water Supply Depart-
ment found it difficult to monitor functionality and other aspects on a regular basis. To over-
come these challenges, the state government introduced various communication options to
report complaints (see box 4.16), which has proven successful in both responding to techni-
cal faults, but as importantly increasing consumer confidence in service provision.

           BOX 4.16.   Centralized Complaint Redressal System, Punjab State, India


           The Shikayat Nivarn Kendra (SNK) is an accountability mechanism using information
           technology. It operates on a 24 hour, seven day basis including holidays. The SNK was
           inaugurated in December 2009 and has been operational for over eight years. At the
           heart of the SNK is a combination of a toll-free telephone number, email and SMS
           system that consumers can use to lodge a complaint. Currently, the SNK has a reach
           in over 14,000 communities and covers a population of approximately 20 million.
           Complaints registered under the SNK are not closed until they are redressed. The SNK
           offers multiple language windows including Punjabi, Hindi or English with which to
           register complaints. On registration of the complaint, the names of officers relating
           to the complaint village appear on the screen and the complaint is forwarded to them
           through SMS and email for immediate action. The SNK stipulates set targets for the
           time it should take to resolve each type of complaint. The concerned officials are then
           expected to rectify or correct the problem within this period and to report back to
           SNK through the same phone or SMS platform. This then triggers a message to inform
           the person who raised the original complaint. In case the complaint is not rectified
           within the stipulated period, it is escalated to the next level of senior officer for their
           intervention after every 24 hours (that is, the. Superintending Engineer or Chief
           Engineer depending on the hierarchy).

           A total of 64,426 complaints were registered during 2009–17 and 94 percent
           (64,057) of these were attended to and resolved. In addition, the SNK has
           helped to improve employee performance and time-bound delivery of services
           in rural water supply. Information and awareness campaigns were used (press
           advertisements, TV channels and wall paintings) to promote the complaint
           redressal system and thereby improve the delivery of services. One very important
           consequence is that the SNK has enhanced consumer confidence amongst the
           rural public in their water supply services; direct accountability for the official
           responsible for performance has shown positive and quick results in terms of
           improving response times and fixing service faults.

     Gains in improved access under the MDGs only tell a partial story of success. Especially in
     view of the SDGs, rural water supply programs need to shift attention to addressing sustain-
     ability conditions at sector level.
       Reaching high levels of access to improved water sources is not necessarily associated
     with having adequate conditions for sustainability at sector level in place (see figure 4.12).
     This is particularly the case in Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nepal, the Kyrgyz

  Bangladesh, the Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, and Haiti are struggling to put in place conditions
for sustainability, which often stem from the broader political and governance context. For
example, the Kyrgyz Republic shares a common history with other central Asian states, where
due to decades of under investment after the collapse of the Soviet era, services have eroded
and institutional capacity and innovation have been limited. In 2016, the Kyrgyz Republic
announced a national rural water program, harnessing a high level of political support and
intending to improve service levels and address several of the bottlenecks identified in the
sustainability assessment. Haiti is witnessing decreasing access rates and its lowest overall
sustainability sector score is understandable, given its fragility and socioeconomic challenges,
which have been worsened by several recent large-scale natural disasters. Nepal is emerging
from a pronounced period of political unrest and transitioning into a federal system. This his-
tory has aided fragmentation in the sector, capacity gaps, and uncertainties in institutional
mandates. However, there has been considerable progress in harmonisation in the sector in
recent years, with the intention to develop ‘One WASH’ policy and legislation.


Lessons from Service Delivery Models

      BOX 4.17.   Key Findings from Service Delivery Models


      Table 4.2 illustrates to what extent sustainability conditions are met for various
      service delivery models across all countries. The public utility provision appears the
      most robust, with all of the building blocks furthest advanced. Introducing private
      sector provision provides an opportunity to improve the sustainability of services,
      despite mixed country experiences and often the modest scale of such models in any
      country.

      There is a wealth of experience with community-based management, present in all
      countries but Benin, and the sustainability of the model remains to be strengthened
      overall.

      Some countries, such Morocco, India, Indonesia, and Brazil, are leading
      efforts including various forms of aggregated management, embedding with
      decentralization, and through nationwide monitoring and systematic post
      construction support.

      Unsurprisingly, direct local government provision tends to perform poorly, especially
      in low capacity environments. Despite the various efforts to promote supported
      self-supply as a formal service delivery model—only present in Ethiopia—there is a
      remarkable lack of documentation, which would be critical to convince policy makers
      of the benefits of promoting this model for remote and dispersed communities.
      Lessons from each service delivery model are presented in the sections below.

  This support was delivered through i) well capacitated government entities or utilities, ii)

tions from ­
  Examples are the “Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan,” a designated state agency for official back-
stopping of Water Supply and Sanitation Committees, as well as the SISAR system in Ceará
and Tanzania’s Water Supply Facility Trust mechanism (see section 4.1). Good conditions,
although at a limited scale, for sustainability are also found if support is provided through
dedicated externally funded programs, which poses a problem for nationwide replication.
  The study found that CBMs responsible for distribution only, with government entities
responsible for bulk-supply, were scoring better on dimensions of sustainability.
  In Ghana, Water and Sanitation Management Teams (WSMTs) operate piped supplies
receiving water from the Ghana Water Company Limited. In Morocco, ONEE provides bulk
water to over 600 community-based associations and often provides technical support to
those managing distribution systems.


Direct Local Government Provision

Water supply units within local government administrations are not corporatized entities
and are neither able to operate along commercial lines nor able to ring fence water revenues
from general budgets. Tariff revenues cannot be protected, and incentives for performance
are weak as reliance on government subsidies continues.
  In some countries, the model is seen as an “interim” solution (for example, in Benin),
while in other countries, arrangements are permanent. Service authorities are reluctant to
delegate water scheme management to professional operators; they have no technical assis-
tance to set-up corporate municipal enterprises or joint stock companies, or lack incentives
and clear guidance or regulations to delegate services to private operators (for example,
Vietnam).
  Central governments can support direct government provision in several ways, such as
technical assistance for i) project preparation to ensure demand-responsive schemes;
ii)  setting tariffs and improving financing arrangements between water units and other
parts of local government; iii) legal support to transition to other management models.


Public Utility Provision

Public utility provision for rural water was found to exhibit the best conditions for sus­
tainability, although it is not widely applied. It is present in only three of the 16 countries:
China, Morocco, and the Philippines. Public utilities are involved in the management of large
multi-village piped water, in small towns or in growing urban centres, where rural popula-
tions have been integrated into the urban utility’s service area. They tend to show

     professional management of rural water assets, are staffed with more qualified personnel,
     have better financial capacity and access to funding, and are subject to monitoring and
     regulation.
       The rural water sector does not present attractive commercial revenue opportunities for
     utilities. Mandatory service mandates in rural areas, combined with access to subsidies to
     integrate rural areas, are used as incentives for utilities to expand services.
       In Morocco, ONEE was officially mandated by the central government to service rural areas
     and mobilize funds to expand and manage rural water services. In China, city or county pub-
     lic utilities are required by government shareholders to integrate rural populations within
     their service areas, with governments allocating subsidies for investments and capital main-
     tenance to support the utilities’ viability to reach these areas.
       Where access to rural water services is a high political priority due to persistent inequali-
     ties, considerations of financial returns become secondary compared with the wider eco-
     nomic and social benefits.
       As of 2016, ONEE had extended water services through large piped water schemes, supply-
     ing public stand posts and small village-level distribution systems in over 400 rural centres.
     This expansion saw a significant capital investment. US$1.2 billion has been invested in rural
     and small town water supply since the mid-1990s, including US$346 million mobilized from
     local commercial banks. However, in 2015, ONEE’s revenues from rural water services only
     covered 41 percent of the full cost of service provision. Similarly, in China, expanding Water
     Affairs Companies services to rural areas has put a significant strain on the financial viability
     of their operations.
       Integrating rural areas under the expanding service areas of public utilities comes with
     challenges, such as mobilizing human resources for asset maintenance, and extending bill-
     ing and collection services and monitoring to remote areas.
       In Morocco, ONEE is testing various approaches to address these challenges, including local
     micro-enterprises for asset maintenance and private sector partnerships for the management
     of village-level distribution networks, while ONEE retains control of the bulk water supply.


     Private Sector Provision

     This model holds promising and diverse arrangements for sustainable rural water services,
     and consistently scores well on financing and to some extent also on asset management and
     monitoring. Private sector participation was found through a range of contractual mecha-
     nisms from build operate and transfer (BOT) (as in Bangladesh), to joint stock companies
     with public and private shareholders (as in Vietnam) and lease and concession contracts
     (as in Benin). In China, “community enterprises,” operating on a commercial basis are man-
     aging multi-village schemes (box 4.18). In addition to improving the financial performance
     of schemes, private investment and in some cases commercial loans can be mobilized (as in
     Benin and Vietnam), although in Bangladesh contracts requiring private equity investments
     proved difficult to implement (box 4.19).

      BOX 4.18. Private “Community Enterprise” Model, Bin County, Shaanxi
      Province, China


      Bin County has a total rural population of around 244,000 scattered over 237
      villages previously served by very small individual schemes. Over the last 20 years,
      the government has rationalized these under 14 multi-village schemes operated by
      so-called Water Management Stations, comprising community enterprise companies
      established under the auspices of the County Water Resource Bureau (CWRB), but
      operating along commercial lines. On average, each enterprise employs seven staff
      who are responsible for all aspects of O&M, minor repairs, and tariff collection.

      The county government retains ownership of the physical assets and sets
      performance and reporting standards for each company, which are expected to cover
      their operating expenses and to retain a small quota (Y0.20 or US$0.03) on each
      cubic meter of water sold as a reserve fund to pay for future capital maintenance.
      In the case of the two water management stations visited for the study, each was
      generating a small surplus based on a flat rate tariff of Y3.9 (US$0.58 cents) per cubic
      meter on metered household connections. As it is a relatively dry area relying on
      deep groundwater, the majority of households pay, although water consumption is
      still low.

      In addition to setting up these community enterprises, the CWRB has also established
      an umbrella entity, known as the General Water Management Station, with 11 staff
      who are responsible for supporting and monitoring the work of the 14 multi-village
      schemes; monitoring their monthly reporting; providing refresher trainings; helping
      to review and get tariff adjustments approved; and helping with more complicated
      repairs. The cost of staffing and operating the General Station was put at some
      Y500,000 (or around US$75,000) per year. Lastly, the county pays the Bin County
      urban water affairs company Y300,000 (US$44,750) per year to carry out monthly
      water quality testing for the 14 multi-village schemes using its in-house team of
      technicians and laboratory.




      BOX 4.19.    Challenges to Private Equity Investment in Bangladesh


      The World Bank-supported Bangladesh Rural Water Supply Project piloted private
      sector involvement through 21 village piped water schemes, designed to serve
      over 100,000 people. The project set out to demonstrate that rural piped water
      supply schemes involving partnerships between community and local private
      sector could leverage private financing and lead to efficient long-term operations

                                                                         box continues next page

           by local operators. Private sponsors were responsible for designing, building and
           operating drinking water supply schemes for a period of 18 years under a capital
           investment sharing ratio of 70:20:10 (70 percent project: 20 percent sponsor:
           10 percent community). Following the completion of the project in 2010, annual
           benchmarking has been supported to understand the performance challenges and
           the sustainability of these schemes. At the end of 2014, an evaluation found the
           following results using the benchmarking data:

           •	 15 schemes were functioning, two were partly functioning and four were shut
              down

           •	 11 schemes were operated and maintained in a satisfactory condition

           •	 Eight schemes were operating at a profit but only three were likely to provide a
              satisfactory return on equity

           •	 No schemes had the potential to offer a return on investment

           Lessons from the evaluation include the significant challenges associated with the
           financial viability of high quality privately operated and maintained water supply
           schemes; the higher than expected costs for potential investors; challenges with
           tariff collection; unpredictable local politics, and the lack of professional and
           entrepreneurial capacity to successfully operate and manage schemes once built.
           Upstream measures to improve the Bangladesh enabling environment for rural
           services, and specifically to lift private sector constraints, need to be addressed for
           the model to mature.

       Successful experiences with private sector participation emerged from a long-term engage-
     ment, funded by governments and development partners.
       In several countries, this included i) strengthening the legal and institutional framework
     for private sector participation; ii) contract design for a careful allocation of risk and ensur-
     ing sufficient financial incentives for the private operator; iii) capacity building for service
     authorities in tendering and contract oversight, and iv) capacity building for private opera-
     tors on technical and managerial aspects of service delivery.
       A blended finance approach was common, ensuring that public subsidies were sufficient
     to leverage private investment. A good practice in Benin and Morocco was that subsidies
     were disbursed in a result-based manner after independent verification.
       Private sector models still operate at small scale or are in the process of scaling up.
     Critical barriers and capacity gaps need to be addressed to realize the full potential of this
     management model.




70   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
  In December 2016, Benin launched the scaling up of the subsidized concession model, and
ONEE in Morocco is launching the tender of several service-type contracts for rural water
supply provision. Although the lack of commercial viability in rural areas is indeed a hinder-
ing factor for scaling-up private sector models, it is equally important to address upstream
legal and policy gaps, support due diligence of investment projects, provide transaction sup-
port and technical assistance to national level and service authorities, and build the capacity
of private operators.


Supported Self-Supply

Ethiopia was the only country with a formally recognized supported self-supply program.
It  seeks to standardize approaches and technologies, establishes local providers, reaches
households though communications, and facilitates a learning network.
  In several other countries, supported self-supply is a de facto model, receiving limited sup-
port from national entities and service authorities. In Vietnam, self-supply is increasingly
recognized as a service delivery model for hard to reach communities, and some local govern-
ments carry out communication campaigns for household water treatment and storage. In
Brazil, rainwater harvesting programs for individual or small groups of households were
active for over a decade but without much documentation. They do reflect a recognition that
in dispersed settings, communal water supply systems may not be feasible. In Bangladesh,
where some two-thirds of the rural population is using individual supplies, there is not yet a
formalized or structured support in place at any scale, despite the pressing need to improve
water quality.
  Despite the various efforts to promote supported self-supply as a formal service delivery
model, there is a remarkable lack of documentation with the experiences of such programs,
which would be critical to convince policy makers of the benefits of promoting this for
remote and dispersed communities.

72   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Chapter 5   Recommendations and Policy Directions

            Building on the analysis of the country cases, and emerging good practices, this chapter sets
            out a number of practical recommendations for improving the sustainability of rural water
            services, organized around the five building blocks. It is based on the premise that it is good
            practice to advance the sector-level building blocks, and that measures are required to
            support all three institutional levels: national, service authority and service provider level
            (section 5.1).
              At the same time, it is important to recognize that sectors are at different stages of devel-
            opment and that resources and opportunities will vary, sometimes greatly, between coun-
            tries. Moreover, interventions will need to be tailored to the different segments of the rural
            water market, in order to improve the sustainability of relevant service delivery models.
            Section 5.2 thus proposes priority interventions for countries to advance to more mature
            stages of rural water sector development and concludes with a set of key policy directions
            for governments to consider.


            Recommendations for Each of the Building Blocks of Sustainability
            As presented in the analytical framework for this study (section 2.1), the five building blocks
            for sustainability represent ideal or optimum conditions for services to last beyond the first
            few years after infrastructure delivery. While some countries have a number of these condi-
            tions in place, for others, establishing the building blocks will require adopting lengthy
            reforms in the sector.
              The five building blocks of sustainability can be used as an entry point to carry out a diag-
            nostic of a country’s rural water sector, and in doing so to reveal areas that would require
            intervention. Which specific areas should be addressed with the highest priority, and in
            what sequencing, will depend on the country context and needs, as well as the willingness
            and appetite for change of the leading institutions in the sector. Gradual but persistent inter-
            ventions will be needed, and less wealthy countries may need to prioritize building blocks.
            Based on the analysis of the individual building blocks, there is evidence to suggest that
            even low income countries can make substantial progress on institutional capacity, financ-
            ing, and asset management while, in the face of competing priorities, robust monitoring
            systems should be emphasized, with more sophisticated regulatory oversight to be devel-
            oped in later stages. The level of water insecurity is likely to influence the extent to which
            local water resources management practices can feasibly be prioritized in low resource and
            capacity countries.
              Rooted in the rich experiences that were uncovered through the country case studies, the
            tables below present possible interventions for each of the building blocks, considering each
            of the three institutional levels:1 national enabling environment, service authority, and ser-
            vice provider. Interventions should be identified and designed based on an in-depth diag-
            nostic of service delivery models present in the country.

     Strengthening Institutional Capacity in Rural Water Service Delivery
     To develop capacities across all levels of the rural water sector, a starting point is creating
     clarity on institutional mandates as well as the formal recognition—and if relevant the
     diversification—of management models. Adequate support systems will have to be put in
     place for service authorities and service providers. If the predominant model is community-​
     based provision, post construction support arrangements can take various shapes, for
     example, by a public utility, state or provincial level entity, local government if there is
     capacity to provide such support, or by fostering the federation of community-based man-
     agement entities so that members can receive adequate support. Diversification of manage-
     ment models can be followed as a deliberate strategy, for example, by considering integrating
     rural areas within existing urban utility service boundaries (physically connecting villages or
     subsuming smaller standalone systems under the utility’s management). If possible, support
     for private sector providers to enter the market where this is viable (including with support
     of targeted subsidies) is recommended. This will require a well-developed enabling environ-
     ment, and structuring of contracts on a commercially attractive scale. Table 5.1 includes a
     number of recommendations to strengthen institutional capacities in the rural sector.

     Improving the Financial Sustainability of Rural Water Services
     A starting point to enhance financial sustainability is to break down the different costs across
     the life cycle of service delivery and assess which elements can realistically be covered
     through tariffs, and which will require financing from taxes or transfers. For services to be

sustainable all costs must eventually be covered, but not necessarily all via tariffs. While the
policy position in many countries is “full cost recovery through tariffs” without distinguish-
ing between urban or rural areas, it is recommended that this position is to be revisited and
nuanced. Precise language is thus needed in tariff policies and guidelines, and flexibility for
cost recovery approaches and pro-poor measures is advisable for different rural contexts
(for example, remote villages versus rural small towns). The needed clarity on responsibili-
ties and funding sources for minor and major maintenance, asset renewal, as well as expan-
sion or new schemes would best be reflected in a national financing strategy for the sector
that also includes rural areas. Table 5.2 summarizes recommended actions to improve the
financial sustainability for rural water services.

Improving Asset Management
Asset management is a complex task that considers the different life spans, maintenance
regimes and design requirements of infrastructure, particularly for piped schemes. Recognizing
this complexity, the allocation of responsibilities for asset management between service
authorities and service providers is a critical first step. Depending on the country context, for
systems under community management this task may best be executed at service authority
level, be carried out by an aggregated body, or outsourced to a qualified third party. For private
sector models, operators may bear responsibility (depending on contractual arrangements)
and require adequate oversight by the service authority to ensure asset management is carried
out effectively. Table 5.3 provides recommendations for asset management.

 National            •	 Identify investment needs and develop investment plan for the rural water sector

                     •	 Dedicate national funds (taxes, transfers) in support of service authorities

                     •	 Set up a national tariff policy for rural water supply, with cost recovery provisions for
                       different contexts and pro-poor measures

                     •	 Explore innovative mechanisms to finance capital maintenance, for example, options such
                       as pooled funding and insurance schemes

                     •	 Improve public-private partnership (PPP) framework to attract private actors in the rural
                       water sector

 Service authority   •	 Support service authorities in preparing realistic plans, budgets, with multiple funding
                       sources for capital costs, recurrent costs, asset maintenance (if the latter is assigned)

                     •	 Where possible introduce earmarking for financing major repairs and asset maintenance -
                       and if necessary in extremely poor contexts for operation and maintenance (O&M), to
                       ensure predictability

 Service provider    •	 Ensure that tariffs at local level are set based on relevant policy and guidelines, taking into
                       account operational costs and requirements for asset maintenance and renewal

                     •	 Where feasible, support service providers to access commercial finance by strengthening
                       their technical, financial and commercial capacity, support project preparation including
                       due diligence

                  •	 Support service authorities to sign agreements or contracts with service providers that:

                    •	 specify asset ownership

                    •	 define responsibilities for maintenance and replacement regimes (distinguishing between
                       minor and major repairs)

      provider      asset management plans

                  •	 Build capacity of service providers to implement agreements and execute their asset management
                    plan. This is to make sure that revenues and subsidies (if available) for capital maintenance cover all
                    O&M costs including major repairs (and generate profits for private operators).



     Strengthening Water Resources Management Practices
     The development of integrated water resources management is a long-term and political
     process in many countries. Neither national drinking water agencies, nor service authori-
     ties and rural service providers may have much influence on this trajectory. However,
     a  stronger focus on local level water management initiatives to address water security
     for  rural water supplies, especially in groundwater reliant areas, is thus recommended.
     Table 5.4 indicates practical recommendations.

     Establishing Monitoring and Regulatory Oversight
     It should be stressed that regulatory oversight can only be phased in once robust monitoring
     systems are in place. As a first step, regulatory oversight can be achieved through monitor-
     ing of compliance to service level standards, including water quality standards, and issuing
     tariff guidelines for rural water. This needs to be accompanied by capacity building to ensure
     that tariff levels are following rural water tariff guidelines. More formalized oversight for
     rural services can be achieved in the long term through assigning economic regulatory func-
     tions to (sub-) national entities, or through expanding the mandate of national regulators,
     when feasible. Table 5.5 includes recommendations.

     Future Policy Directions
     Interventions Must Vary Based on Sector Development Stage and Population Segment
     As the speed and appetite for reform and sector capacity vary from a country to another,
     the pathway toward sustainability must likewise be flexible and adopted in an incremental
     manner. Figure 5.1 shows a “ladder” of three levels, illustrating how incremental progress
     can be achieved from basic, to intermediate, to an advanced stage of the development of the
     rural water sector in a given country.
       This overall sector development trajectory needs to be put in the context of a changing
     landscape of rural service delivery, as elaborated in section 3.3 (figure 3.2). Countries will see
     different population segments develop at different paces, namely i) remote dispersed popu-
     lations, ii) rural villages and growth centers, and iii) peri-urban and small towns. With the
     adoption of the SDGs and the focus on equity and universal access, country governments
     have committed themselves to simultaneously address the challenges across all segments
     and leave no-one behind.
       Nevertheless, the biggest leap for many lower and lower-middle income country govern-
     ments will be to respond to the demand for higher service levels from a growing middle
     class, and transition to metered household connections. The country cases showed that
     aggregation of rural service delivery can result in economies of scale, scope, and more
     professional provision, either through public utilities, private sector operators, or federated
     community-based service providers. Of equal importance is the aggregation of technical
     support functions to service providers, especially for complex tasks such as major repairs
     and rehabilitation. Case studies showed that these aggregated service delivery models
     often were facilitated by an increase in public funds, for both capital maintenance and insti-
     tutional support.
       The country cases indicate that for improving sustainability, future policies will require
     that a range of rural providers will be more effectively supported and monitored. This needs
     to entail increasing financing for technical support functions, through tariffs and more pre-
     dictable public funding, and by providing incentives and guidelines for local governments.
     Service authorities may also delegate services in such contexts to the private sector, provided
     that public funds are available to make such contracts attractive.
       However, a challenge for all countries, including for upper-middle economies, is to develop
     adequate service delivery models for remote and dispersed rural populations, who continue
     to rely on either poorly supported community-based management or self-supply. Without
     new approaches to respond to the changing nature of rural water service delivery, there is a
     danger that remote and dispersed rural populations will be left with stagnating service lev-
     els, whilst denser agglomerations will benefit from professionalized service provision mod-
     els, through expanding utilities or aggregated management models serving multi-village
     schemes or multiple standalone schemes. While self-supply is a de-facto model in all
     countries, governments could formally adopt supported self-supply for remote and dis-
     persed populations with a focus on improving water quality aspects. This could entail direct

                             segments in order to transition from basic to intermediate and from intermediate to an

                 Key Policy Directions
                 Returning to the importance of the five building blocks for rural water sustainability,
                 box 5.1 summarizes a number of policy directions that governments—with the support of
                 development partners—are encouraged to take on to improve the sustainability of rural
                 services. A key message underpinning these policy recommendations is that national gov-
                 ernments need to continue to play a major role and cannot discharge state responsibilities for
                 essential services to rural-based citizens, communities, and weakly funded, low-capacity
                 local governments. National governments are required to step up their engagement in policy,




BOX 5.1.   Policy Priorities to Improve the Sustainability of Rural Service Provision


Institutional capacity

1.	 Develop enabling policy and define institutional arrangements and functions for service authorities and
  rural service providers. Specifically:

  •	 Assign functions for postconstruction support to and monitoring of rural service providers and technical
     support to local governments, in line with decentralization policy

  •	 Define clearly the roles and responsibilities of different tiers of sub-national government
  •	 Formalize (a wider range of) management models in policies and develop policies for integration of rural
     areas under service areas of existing utility companies
2.	 Develop systems with sustainable funding flows for postconstruction support and technical assistance to
  rural service providers, including:

  •	 Technical and financial support, especially with respect to major repairs of rural water assets
  •	 Management and institutional support to ensure that (community-based) service providers keep functioning
  •	 Monitoring mechanisms to ensure that postconstruction support is effectively delivered by designated
     technical assistance providers or local governments


Financing

3.	 Adopt a financing policy and implement a tariff guideline for rural water that distinguishes the different
  life cycle cost elements of the full cost of service provision, with:

  •	 Different segments (geography, management model) having a different level of cost recovery through
     tariffs—that is, the full costs are funded through a different mix of taxes, transfers, and tariffs

  •	 Identification of sources of funds and responsibility for major repairs, capital maintenance, and asset
     replacement, combined with ring-fencing mechanisms (for example, maintenance funds, earmarking taxes)

  •	 Social pricing for the most vulnerable groups to ensure affordability

                                                                                                    box continues next page

     BOX 5.1.   Policy Priorities to Improve the Sustainability of Rural Service Provision (continued)


     Asset management

     4.	 Formalize asset ownership through legal frameworks and support service authorities—when assigned as
       asset holders—in the management of assets, through:

       •	 Asset inventories and asset condition assessments on a regular basis
       •	 Capacity building measures using asset management tools, and the gradual introduction of medium-term
          asset management plans


     Water resources management

     5.	 Strengthen representation of rural drinking water users’ interests in catchment and local water ­management
       platforms, especially in water scarce areas, through:

       •	 Participation of service authorities and service providers in local water management bodies
       •	 Programs to support service providers to engage in catchment protection and water safety planning

     Monitoring and regulatory oversight

     6.	 Develop a comprehensive monitoring system for rural water services, and allocate resources for its ­operation
       and usage to inform planning and strengthen regulatory oversight. Such a system would:

       •	 Include a basic set of indicators to monitor service levels, functionality and water facility condition
       •	 Be gradually expanded to monitor service provider performance and effectiveness of service authority or
          technical assistance providers

       •	 Be used to strengthen regulatory oversight in terms of adherence to service level standards, compliance
          with drinking water, and tariff-setting in line with guidelines




                     financing, and technical support domains, to make a dent in the triple challenge of  rural
                     service provision: i) serve the unserved, ii) improve service levels, and iii) sustain existing
                     and future services


                     Knowledge Gaps
                     As documented in the case studies, solutions do exist for improving the sustainability of
                     rural water services. However, the following knowledge gaps remain:

                     •	 Developing a better understanding on how to monitor sustainability of rural water ser-
                        vices, what metrics and measurement to deploy and at what level: functionality and per-
                        formance of the water facility, service levels received, as well as the performance of
                        service providers and service authorities.


82                   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
•	 Generating rigorous evidence through primary data collection on which determinants
   and conditions have the most critical impact on long-term service outcomes.

•	 Understanding the cost of failing services; for example, what are the avoided damages by
   having well-functioning post construction support services, combined with monitoring
   and effective regulatory oversight?

•	 Research and experimentation with innovative mechanisms to finance capital mainte-
   nance and replacement costs, including pooled funding arrangements and insurance
   schemes to cover major repairs and capital maintenance. A first step would be to carry out
   an in-depth documentation of successful experiences in both developed as well as devel-
   oping countries.

•	 Further research into the effectiveness of supported self-supply models, understanding
   the costs and benefits and the extent to which water quality concerns can be minimized.

•	 Better understanding what local or (sub-) basin integrated water resources management
   policies and practices can have a demonstrable positive impact on long-term sustainabil-
   ity of water supply.

•	 Further research into cost-effective and sustainable fecal sludge management and waste-
   water treatment solutions in small towns and peri-urban areas, drawing on the experience
   of upper middle-income and European countries.



Note
1.	 The assessment indicated that national level capacities may well be ahead of local level, and vice versa shortcomings at the
   local level can be the result of gaps in legislation or policy at national level.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 Clear institutional mandates for different tiers of government exist, but are not implemented; in particular,
         DPHE continues to mix roles in both technical support to UPs and direct service provision. This contradicts
         decentralization policy and negatively affects long-term capacity building of UPs as service authorities.

       •	 Challenges remain in terms of accountability and capacity to carry out some functions, particularly for long-term
         support and monitoring of service delivery and standards.

       •	 DPHE faces challenges in staffing capacity and lack of budget for mobilization; likewise, UPs, as service
         authorities, have limited capacity and struggle in the role of coordination and planning at local levels.

       •	 Service providers have the capacity to operate simple handpump systems, but struggle with more complex
         schemes and management requirements such as piped systems and alternative technologies.

       Financing

       •	 A phased sector development plan exists, but suffers from shortfalls in capital investment budget.

       •	 Considerable private investment largely through household self-supply.

       •	 Tariff calculation structures are based on sound principles for piped schemes, but are not systematically
         implemented, are interpreted differently and not regulated, allowing political influence to keep levels down;
         tariffs seldom include capital maintenance provisions (aside from public-private partnership (PPP) examples).

       •	 Tariffs charged vary widely, and are estimated to range from 0.32 percent to 5.19 percent of poor household
         income. There are considerations for the poor, through tariff categories and cross subsidies under a few models.

       Asset management

       •	 Although the UP has the right to transfer assets or delegate management of water facility assets, actual legal
         ownership of rural water schemes is still unclear in legislation.

       •	 DPHE has no special provision for emergency repairs of point source supplies, but some for piped systems; piped
         systems have no provisions for capital maintenance and replacement (depreciation fund).

       •	 There is no systematic or institutionalized approach to asset management established, many schemes adopt a
         “fix on failure” approach, and lack tools, capacity, and knowledge to carry out asset management.

       •	 There is very strong private sector capacity for supply chains, although skilled maintenance service providers are
         not as common, or can be prohibitively expensive for complex repairs.

       Water resources management and security

       •	 Bangladesh has considerable water resources, but has challenges with groundwater quality (including
         widespread arsenic and saline intrusion); infrastructure is vulnerable to frequent natural hazards.

       •	 Institutional arrangements for water resources management (WRM) are complex, especially in legal frameworks
         for abstraction, which leads to uncontrolled abstraction for multiple uses.

       •	 There are limited linkages between macro-level WRM planning and local government institutions.

       •	 Water safety planning at local level has been established for some time and is being scaled up; a new Water
         Safety Framework was established in 2011.




110   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
 Monitoring and regulation

 •	 There is weak and fragmented sector monitoring, leading to poor distribution of water points and planning.

 •	 There is no comprehensive functional monitoring system for rural water, despite efforts to establish MIS
   in DPHE.

 •	 There is no systematic monitoring of the huge number of households using self-supply schemes (one off tube-
   well mapping); local capacity for data collection of UPs and DPHE is limited. There is no systematic use of data
   at a local level.

 •	 There is inadequate water quality monitoring considering the absolute number of sources and high risks
   to quality.

 •	 Currently there is no independent regulator or economic (tariff) regulator, but legislation has been drafted to
   address this. UP capacity constraints limit their ability to undertake the proposed regulatory functions.



Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level

•	 Community management scores poorly, facing challenges including low tariff revenue
  and disintegration of committees over time. However, farmer cooperatives fare relatively
  better, partly due to diversification of income (agriculture). Self-supply—although most
  prevalent—is unsupported.

•	 The UP management model suffers from poor willingness to pay for local government
  services, variable technical capacities, political influence, and challenges to ring fencing
  revenues for O&M.

•	 The PPP model scores highest, but is at pilot scale and faces challenges: political influence
  on tariffs, low willingness to pay, variable technical capacities, poor cost recovery, a lack
  of interest from the private sector.



Lessons Learned from Country Experience

•	 There is an interesting example of multiple use systems through the Farmers’ Cooperative,
  in which individual scheme management benefits from external training and capacity
  building initiatives, the availability of a micro credit fund, and technical back-up
  support.

•	 The PPP model involved co-financing private capital, and resulted in mixed success in the
  pilot by the government and World Bank; however, some schemes were well performing
  and show promise, especially those located nearer to urban areas and in areas with poor
  water quality, where there is strong demand for piped water services and strong technical
  performance among operators.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 The strategy for rural water services clearly defines responsibilities for all actors in the sector.

      •	 The establishment of a Directorate for Public Drinking Water and Regulation in 2016 marked a collective
        recognition of the need to organize and regulate rural water services.

      •	 Sustained efforts to decentralize responsibilities for water services and to build the capacity of municipalities are
        ongoing to enable these communes to fulfil their role as a service authority.

      Financing

      •	 Public funds for rural water are allocated based on a sector-wide programmatic approach, which prioritizes
        investments.

      •	 Up until 2016, most public funds allocated to rural water supply came from donor grant funding; the country
        contracted a US$68 million concessional loan with the World Bank for 2017–22, of which US$33 million will be
        allocated to the rural water sub-sector.

      •	 Subsidies and results-based financing have been introduced to incentivize operators to connect households to
        small-scale piped water schemes under concession-type contracts.

      •	 Reported tariffs applied by operators vary between FCFA 420–800 per cubic meter (US$0.68– 1.3 per cubic
        meter). Based on the national standard of 20 liters per capita per day, and the US$1.90 per day PPP international
        poverty line, this represents between 0.7 percent and 1.4 percent of a poor family’s income.; however, tariffs
        applied at communal water points (which are mostly used by poor households) are much higher and poorly
        regulated.

      Asset management

      •	 The 1999 law on decentralization clearly identifies communes as owners of rural water assets.

      •	 The country has started a major initiative to map all small-scale piped water schemes.

      •	 The redevance (lease or concession charge) system ensures that a proportion of funds remain available to invest
        in capital maintenance; however, there is little clarity on how communes use these funds.

      Water resources management

      •	 Benin has only started setting up institutions and a mandate to implement integrated water resources
        management; the sector currently lacks the financial and human resources to make integrated water resources
        management a reality.

      •	 There is no mechanism in place to issue water abstraction permits.

      Monitoring and regulation

      •	 The sector has taken the initiative to create a regulatory authority within the Direction Générale de l’Eau;
        however, this regulatory unit is yet to be effective and none of the water scheme operators are adequately
        regulated.

      •	 Several tools have been tested to monitor access levels and piped water scheme management; the mWater
        platform appears to be the most efficient of these and its application by communes is currently in the scaling-up
        phase, although operators can be reluctant to share performance reports.

      •	 Despite national standards, water quality is not adequately monitored or controlled by communes.



      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
      •	 Private management under lease contracts is affected by poor capacity (translated into
         limited technical and managerial knowledge, as well as inadequate support systems to
         reinforce these capacities) and unsuitable financing arrangements (mainly poor revenues
         due to low consumption and lack of clarity on responsibilities for financing repairs).



114   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
•	 Inadequate water resources management practices are a common feature across all ser-
  vice delivery models (that is, lack of representation at basin level, watershed protection).

•	 The subsidized-concession model introduced with support from World Bank clarifies
  institutional responsibilities for operation and maintenance. It incentivizes private opera-
  tors to contribute to capital investments. The successful tender of these contracts was the
  result of long-term capacity building delivered both to private operators and to public
  institutions.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Clarity on asset ownership facilitates the delegation of water schemes.

•	 Asset inventories (mapping and capital value) are essential for the sustainable manage-
  ment of water schemes and for successful delegation arrangements.

•	 Designing contracts that balance the risk between the private sector and public authorities
  requires sound project preparation with due diligence on financial viability, technical fea-
  sibility and legal requirements, all of which require adequate time and funding support.

•	 Building the capacity of operators should be integrated into programs for the rural
  water sector.

•	 As the sector professionalizes and local governments delegate the management of water
  supply schemes, viable solutions for regulating operator performance should be
  introduced.

•	 There is potential to increase the coverage of piped water supply onto premises in rural
  areas (including in low income contexts) through results-based financing that incentivizes
  private operators and reduces connection costs for households.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 The institutional framework for rural water supply is well defined, with clear separation of roles and functions
         between different levels, both at federal and state levels.

       •	 SISAR represents an important innovation in the institutional capacity for community management: the model
         builds on the strengths of community management, complemented by the possibility to professionalize through
         a federation and the technical assistance of CAGECE, the state water supply company, resulting in performance
         improvements.

       •	 However, there is no institutional framework for the isolated community organizations or any structured form of
         support for them. The limited data available shows that these associations operate largely informally and do not
         have capacity or access to financial resources and technical support.

       Financing

       •	 PLANSAB presents detailed estimates for investment requirements for expansion and replacement of rural water
         schemes and necessary support measures; this also contains specifications for the various states, including
         Ceará.

       •	 Current spending on capital investments for rural water is in line with those estimates for investment; however,
         rural water supply receives a relatively small share of total water sector investments.

       •	 Self-supply makes up a large share of total capital investments in the sector nationally. Although there are no
         specific figures for Ceará, it can be expected that the proportion is relatively high, as the northeastern states are
         the focus of various programs of support to self-supply.

       •	 Little data exists to assess adequacy of tariffs to cover operation and maintenance costs, but SISAR tariff data
         are available, showing these are between US$6 to 11 per household per month, which would be well within
         affordability ranges, compared to a US$1.90 PPP poverty line level.

       Asset management

       •	 Asset ownership and the possibility to delegate O&M operation and maintenance tasks to delegated service
         providers is clearly defined.

       •	 There is no specific framework for establishing or updating asset inventories, but in most service delivery
         models, much of the data on rural assets should be available.

       Water resources management

       •	 The institutional model water for water resources management in Ceará is seen as a strong example in following
         Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) principles.

       •	 Despite the strong development of IWRM practices, different types of water systems have a fragile water
         security situation due to climatic variability and demand.

       Monitoring and regulation

       •	 There is a clear regulatory framework, whereby municipalities can identify a regulating body, which is the state-
         level regulator in most cases. The regulatory body differs per type of service provider, with community-based
         service providers often remaining unregulated.

       •	 Monitoring performance of service providers is done at federal level through SNIS, but this covers only part of
         rural areas.

       •	 In absence of a national rural water supply monitoring system, Ceará has started using its own rural water
         monitoring system, by adopting the (Rural Water and Sanitation Information System (Sistema de Información de
         Agua y Saneamiento Rural or SIASAR) developed by the World Bank in Central America.




118   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level

•	 The SISAR model represents an important innovation to improve institutional capacity of
  community management, by complementing community management with the possibil-
  ity to professionalize through a federation, and to provide technical assistance via
  CAGECE, the state water supply company, resulting in performance improvements.

•	 Isolated community organizations are probably the most common form of rural service
  provision, however little data exist on their performance. The little data available shows
  that these organizations lack capacity or frameworks to address issues such as asset man-
  agement, financing, support and monitoring.



Lessons Learned from Country Experience

•	 SISAR has achieved significant scale in Ceará (and other states). Recent policy changes
  should provide the basis for expanding it further, by providing a stronger institutional
  backing and mandate for scale up; SISAR also shows good potential for asset manage-
  ment, whereby responsibilities (including for funding of works) are very well detailed and
  defined between local associations, the Federation of associations and the state govern-
  ment in the case of SISAR.

•	 As a monitoring system, SIASAR holds great potential for rural water supply, as it includes
  parameters on service delivery as well as service provider performance and is a means to
  create an asset registry, which can be readily updated.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 There are clear institutional roles and technical capacity for developing new water supply infrastructure.

      •	 The capacity to operate, administer and maintain larger networks (public utility) and multi-village schemes
        (community enterprises or direct county provision) is well developed.

      •	 There are technical and financial management weaknesses in the community management entities; capacity is
        further weakened by gaps in institutional responsibilities support to these schemes, lack of assigned resources for
        dispersed rural areas, and poorly defined mandates across different agencies.

      Financing

      •	 The majority of investment is from public financing (taxes) provided at central, provincial and local (service
        authority) level; larger utilities are able to access repayable financing using assets as collateral; local governments
        invest directly in water supply assets.

      •	 Tariffs for larger utility managed and multi-village schemes cover operating costs and generate (some) surplus for
        capital maintenance; large capital improvement projects are still financed from public sources.

      •	 There are major challenges for cost recovery for smaller schemes, which suffer from over-design, low user
        demand, and a low revenue base, as well as poor economies of scale. Tariff increases to even cover O&M faces
        (political and popular) resistance, even though tariffs are generally affordable at between 0.36 percent and 0.51
        percent of average rural household income in Zhejiang and within acceptable levels for Shaanxi (2.5 percent to
        2.8 percent).

      Asset management

      •	 Asset ownership is clearly defined and adhered to; ownership is determined by source of investment.

      •	 Ongoing management of assets, updating inventories, and replacement is carried out effectively for larger-scale
        schemes, which are professionally managed and can meet on-going O&M costs.

      •	 Community-managed schemes commonly have no proactive asset management planning, often “fixing on failure”;
        in these cases, public finance is the last resort for system replacement, upgrading or extension.

      Water resources management and security

      •	 Water resources management and safety planning guidelines are well defined in regulations and fall under the
        same agency as drinking water. However, there is some fragmentation between the Ministry of Water Resources
        and Ministry of Land and Resources.

      •	 There is limited technical support and oversight for catchment management in more remote rural areas and for
        the small isolated schemes.

      •	 Due to excessive pollution and contamination by industrial and agricultural practices, as well as lack of
        wastewater treatment in some areas, water quality remains a major concern for all populations.

      Monitoring and regulation

      •	 Performance evaluations are increasingly being used to assess rural water schemes to allow for decision-making
        and resource allocation by provincial and lower levels of government.

      •	 Larger schemes carry out daily monitoring for proactive maintenance and operational decision making.

      •	 Water quality monitoring is often not done for smaller rural schemes, although recent investment programs to
        boost county-level rural drinking water surveillance and build water safety centers should improve this situation
        in the medium term.

      •	 There is no independent regulator, but larger utilities have established customer complaints mechanisms.

      •	 The process for tariff setting and review is well regulated for larger networked systems, although political
        influences can make it difficult to raise tariffs, especially for smaller community enterprises.




122   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level

•	 China is making proactive efforts to aggregate individual rural schemes into multi-village
  networks and expand urban utility networks to serve rural peripheries. These economies
  of scale allow for more professionalized management and reduce the number of individ-
  ual schemes and service providers that the service authorities need to support, visit and
  monitor.

•	 Smaller-scale community-managed schemes struggle with changing rural demographics
  (negative growth), low revenue streams, and lack of long-term support to resolve techni-
  cal issues; water quality monitoring is of particular concern.



Lessons Learned from Country Experience

•	 Establishment of multi-village schemes, with support from the World Bank, has provided
  evidence that it is possible to generate small surpluses and cover full operating costs when
  schemes are placed under one management entity and run on commercial lines.

•	 City or county utilities can be incentivized to integrate rural populations within their ser-
  vice areas, even where rural consumers are more costly to reach and may generate less
  tariff income, with government allocating funds for investments and capital maintenance
  to support commercial viability.

•	 The provincial government in Zhejiang province has set up a well-functioning incentive
  mechanism: it uses monitoring data and links this to an incentive program that provides
  small grants as a reward for well-performing operators, and likewise penalizes poorly per-
  forming ones based on a range of criteria including system and staff management plan-
  ning, procedures of O&M, and water quality monitoring.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 There is a well-structured institutional setup for rural water spanning federal, regional and Woreda levels, with
         clear leadership role for the Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity (MoWIE).

       •	 The National WASH Coordination Office provides a framework to link water, health, education, and finance
         sectors in WASH.

       •	 WASH coordination structures at regional and national levels have been established under the One WASH
         National Program, but remain “young” institutions.

       •	 There are inter-ministerial coordination challenges; the national steering committee was dormant until
         early 2016.

       •	 The Consolidated WASH Account financing and interventions provide substantial capacity building support
         through a range of interventions to Woreda WASH teams; however, these have been largely one-off events
         rather than a systematic program support.

       Financing

       •	 There is a large gap between available financing and what is required to meet the goals (so far standing at only
         62 percent funded in its first phase), including for rural water.

       •	 Budget utilization rates are low in rural water (61 percent) compared to other sub-sectors such as urban water
         (88 percent) and institutional WASH (70 percent).

       •	 Sector financing remains complex, but well delineated, with four possible funding channels and different
         financing modalities associated with four different service delivery models.

       •	 There is limited attention to financing other, non-capital investment cost components or life cycle costs.

       •	 Efforts to scale up and implement self-supply acceleration approaches to build supply and demand for such
         investments have begun recently, but are poorly understood.

       Asset management

       •	 National and regional WASH inventories have been undertaken, but these are one-off exercises and are not
         regularly updated except in Tigray.

       •	 Asset management and ownership is not yet established as an approach in the rural water sub-sector.

       •	 A new strategic framework for O&M of rural water schemes has been developed and is supported by extensive
         new manuals and training materials, but does not include a systematic approach to planned asset management.

       Water resources management

       •	 Water resources management initiatives are small scale and focused on local surface water issues; agriculture
         and the rural water supply sector are not integrated.

       •	 Industrialization and rising agricultural water demands and pollution can be expected to increasingly impact
         on rural water supplies, but there is a lack of practical tools and experience in dealing with water resources
         conflicts.

       •	 Water safety planning is a recognized approach in key policies, but it needs to be integrated and scaled up to
         become effective.




126   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
 Monitoring and regulation

 •	 Monitoring is largely limited to tracking access or usage of rural water supplies, with complementary data also
   available from regular nationally representative household surveys.

 •	 The national database is not effectively updated and used, although there is a planned rollout of the WASH M&E
   MIS, and a repeat of the national inventory.

 •	 There is a gap in regular service delivery monitoring to assess performance (going beyond access) with respect
   to issues like the quantity and quality of water supplied, as well as functionality.

 •	 Significant efforts have been made to pilot sustainability assessments of rural water interventions recently, but
   these have not been institutionalized to date.

 •	 There is no independent regulator of rural water services, which is a barrier to consumer and service provider
   accountability; regulatory functions provided by local government are weak at best.



Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 Human resource capacity at the Woreda level and below is a critical constraint to sustain-
  ing rural water services, in both public and private sectors (there is a shortfall of some
  40 percent in technical cadres).

•	 Community management structures are weak and there is a lack of capacity to provide
  post construction support to service providers, except in the case of specific donor-funded
  programs.

•	 Despite all regions having issued proclamations related to WASHCO legislation, most
  WASHCOs are not yet legally recognized, limiting their powers, although this is expected
  to improve in coming years.



Lessons Learned from Country Experience

•	 Strong political leadership and commitment has been key to establishing the OWNP,
  which provides a strategic framework for coordination and harmonization of investments
  and approaches; this progress now needs to be pushed down to lower levels of
  government.

•	 The Community Managed Projects, funded by Finnish donor support, have demonstrated
  effective ways of decentralizing funds for project implementation to communities and
  include a very strong capacity building component for community management. This
  model has strong results, with functionality rates reported at or above around 90 percent;
  but there are questions about the costs of scaling up this approach, which currently only
  serves around 10 percent of Woredas in Ethiopia.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 Government has established and developed frameworks and institutions for the rural water sector, but there
        is still a gap between de jure and de facto situations; a national strategy exists, and most stakeholders are now
        adopting this and aligning accordingly.

      •	 National and regional capacity in the CWSA is strong; however, it requires a change management process to
        address its role and to clarify the interface engagement with MMDAs.

      •	 The capacity of MMDAs is improving; nevertheless, gaps remain in systematic follow-up for community
        management providers.

      •	 Tensions often exist between CWSA and MMDAs over mandate and roles, and the decentralization policy for rural
        water functions may need to be revisited to assign asset management responsibility to an entity with higher level
        capacities, as found with the MMDAs.

      Financing

      •	 Channels for funding flows are relatively well defined, but sector financing for rural water continues to be erratic
        and unpredictable, although funding has diversified and there is likely sufficient to cover capital investment
        requirements in the short term.

      •	 Financing for the long-term recurrent costs of rural water supply, including for direct service delivery support and
        capital maintenance, are much less certain and are not properly defined.

      •	 Tariffs are mostly linked to consumption, but for a significant number of hand pumps, no tariff is paid (49
        percent); rates are generally set at affordable levels for most rural households (at between 1.7–3.5 percent of
        average income (all but the most extreme poor are between about 2.7–5.3 percent).

      Asset management

      •	 Asset ownership is clearly identified in policy as resting with the MMDAs (local government); however, this is not
        always translated in practice to district government “ownership,” as MMDAs do not have rural and small town
        water supply assets registered in their books.

      •	 Asset management in the rural water sector is recognized as an important process and is referred to in key sector
        documents and guidelines.

      •	 Management capacity of small rural schemes lacks the necessary skills and economies of scale to perform asset
        management effectively; in larger more complex schemes (small towns) there is no clear focal point or host to
        manage a decision-making framework for asset management.




130   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Water resources management

•	 Policy and institutional frameworks are in place, but government leadership is weak and integrated planning is
  largely absent at the decentralised level; integrated management and river basin management is in place, but has
  not effectively addressed local level water resources management.

•	 The CWSA has developed guidelines for water safety planning and has included water safety planning indicators,
  but operationalization is lacking; water quality remains as a key concern in rural areas.

Monitoring and regulation

•	 The sector has strong policies for monitoring and regulation, however, application of these in practice is still in
  the early stages, and monitoring is not applied systematically.

•	 There is movement toward putting in place a monitoring system at national and district level for the rural sub-
  sector; this large-scale pilot needs to be aligned with the new Sector Information System installed in 2016.

•	 Regulatory responsibility for rural water supply has been clarified and is divided between MMDAs and CWSA,
  with the latter responsible for standards and design of systems, with MMDAs responsible for oversight. A change
  program within CWSA has started; most MMDAs lack the capacity or will to provide oversight and regulate
  services.



Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 Service delivery models are well defined, but the capacity of WSMTs remains weak, with
   limited capacity for follow-up by MMDAs, particularly for point source schemes.

•	 The community management model has not been very effective in ensuring adequate
   reinvestment of operating revenues into financing capital maintenance and replacement.

•	 All service delivery models score low on asset management, water resources management
   and monitoring, all of which have frameworks in place but lack operationalization.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Construction of more complex, large-scale rural piped schemes (including multi-village
   schemes) has successfully increased service levels, but these are managed by WSMTs that
   lack professionalized management and face challenges with financing, cost recovery, and
   operation and maintenance and governance issues.

•	 The Community Water and Sanitation Agency has a well-defined and practical seven-step
   cycle as part of its guidance to local government on infrastructure asset management.

•	 There has been positive, albeit limited, experience with private operators managing fran-
   chised schemes based on the kiosk model; 65 so-called “safe water stations” currently
   serve over 200,000 people. Although water quality is high, the unit cost of water sold is far
   higher than other community or urban utility managed models (being some two to four
   times more expensive per cubic meter.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 Significant progress has been achieved in establishing institutions to oversee rural water supply. However,
        DINEPA’s planning capacity remains weak; there is currently no baseline of water services, limiting the capacity to
        plan, set objectives, and coordinate interventions.

      •	 The establishment of local technicians (known as TEPACs) at departmental level has greatly improved DINEPA’s
        capacity to oversee services and support service providers. However, the TEPACs have no legal status (as of
        September 2016).

      •	 Communes have no established functions with relation to water services, which diminishes their status of service
        authorities.

      Financing

      •	 The sector is almost completely dependent on aid financing through international transfers, which is largely
        carried out on a project-based approach, with little donor harmonization.

      •	 DINEPA and development partners have stepped up efforts to prepare a consolidated budget for the water sector
        and provide a common financing framework.

      •	 Willingness to pay for water services is very low due to mistrust and perceptions that services should be free of
        charge; willingness to charge also reflects these attitudes and is generally low.

      •	 There is no tariff policy, rather tariffs are usually agreed between operators and communes, with little to no
        consideration for cost recovery. Most operators charge a flat monthly fee, regardless of consumption levels.
        Contributions were found to range between US$1 and US$2 per household per month, representing 1.8 percent
        and 3.5 percent of a poor household’s income (as per the US$1.9 per day poverty line).

      Asset management

      •	 The Loi Cadre specifies that all water assets belong to the state (represented by DINEPA); in practice, this
        ownership is not well known by all actors and conflicts can result from this confusion.

      •	 DINEPA’s regional representations have no asset inventory.

      •	 Water assets are particularly vulnerable in the context of Haiti’s topographic, climatic and environmental
        conditions.

      Water resources management

      •	 The Ministry of Environment is the lead institution according to the law, but it is not currently fulfilling its
        functions; there is no mechanism to regulate water abstraction.

      •	 There are no approaches in place for integrated water resources management and watershed management.
        Activities are initiated locally, with no guidance or monitoring from institutions responsible for water resources.

      Monitoring and regulation

      •	 DINEPA has set up a performance monitoring system for rural piped water schemes that gathers operational and
        financial data (the so-called Système des Indicateurs de Performance (SIP). The SIP enables data collection, but no
        remedial action, nor is there data verification.

      •	 Despite the cholera epidemic, the Ministry of Health is not monitoring drinking water quality, which is a
        major gap.

      •	 DINEPA has set up a distribution system for free water treatment equipment (so-called Hypo-Klor 24). However,
        the system is not efficient as many remote rural areas are not reached and the service is irregular.

      •	 DINEPA has set up a water quality control system, the so-called “SIS-KLOR” system; lack of funds (and ownership
        within DINEPA) is threatening to derail these activities.




134   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 CAEPAs receive little support from DINEPA, whether upstream (prior to the delegation of
  the scheme) or downstream throughout their operations: for example, CAEPAs are not
  provided with tools for managing schemes, whether operational toolkits or tools for com-
  mercial management (customer database, billing templates, and so on).

•	 Private operators appear to perform better, mainly because pilots in which they are intro-
  duced include substantial training and monitoring components; the World Bank is sup-
  porting private operators in introducing metered connections for improved operational
  and financial management.

•	 The lack of willingness to pay affects water service viability across all service delivery
  models.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Despite significant challenges, Haiti exhibits certain innovations in approaches to rural
  water services. The SIP monitoring system is a good example of a tool to track and monitor
  operator performance and can provide the basis for better regulation.

•	 DINEPA has also introduced innovative systems for water treatment and water quality
  control; making these systems work more efficiently will require strong buy-in and greater
  harmonization among donors.

•	 The World Bank program initiated in 2015 includes several interventions to strengthen
  sustainability in the rural water sector, including the training of service providers,
  strengthening DINEPA’s capacity to oversee services at local level, and the development
  of a sector-wide approach to funding interventions.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 Through a number of World Bank-supported programs carried out within the framework of a sector-wide
        approach, functional decentralization of rural water supply took place in both states, reaching furthest in
        Uttarakhand. The sustainability evaluation exercise in Uttarakhand shows evidence of institutional capacity.

      •	 This has resulted in GPs and GPWSCs responsible for service delivery, supported by a cascading tier of institutions
        at block, district, and state level, primarily during project implementation, but increasingly in the long-term
        service delivery phase (including for post construction support).

      •	 This has been accompanied by a capacity building program, as well as a reform process of the state Departments
        of Water Supply and Sanitation, to change them from implementers to facilitators.

      •	 The institutional capacity of the GPWSCs in Punjab is fairly well developed, as 74 percent of the PRWSSP funds
        were managed by GPWSCs; UWSSC have well-developed capacity, supported by state-level agency.

      •	 Concerns still exist regarding the staffing for the technical assistance role, particularly in Punjab.

      Financing

      •	 There is a well-established financial framework that defines contributions of the national government and states
        for the rural water supply sector, breaking this down by expenditure item.

      •	 Reasonably good insight exists into current investments both at national and state level, but not for the need to
        reach government-set targets for the recent higher levels of services.

      •	 Capital costs are generally funded through public funds from central and state government, without provision
        for GPs to make contributions. Communities usually contribute through a small fixed amount, with provisions for
        specified vulnerable groups, as a contribution to the assets.

      •	 States define the overall tariff structure and VWSC defines the specifics at scheme level. These are generally to
        cover operation and minor maintenance costs. Even though tariffs are generally insufficient for full depreciation
        and replacement costs, these levels of cost recovery mark an important step forward compared to the previously
        provision of free water under centralized arrangements.

      •	 The NRDWP guidelines state that affordability for vulnerable groups needs to be considered. This is firstly defined
        in terms of contribution to capital costs, which is lower for specific vulnerable groups. In Uttarakhand, provision is
        made for state subsidies to O&M costs in schemes where O&M costs are deemed unaffordable.

      Asset management

      •	 There is no explicit clarity on asset ownership in national guidelines, though it is generally assumed that it lies
        with GP or VWSC; in Uttarakhand and Punjab, this the GP due to the decentralization program.

      •	 Asset inventories are incipient across India; whereas Punjab has made some advances, Uttarakhand has developed
        a sector MIS system that includes an inventory of assets and their costs.

      •	 Asset management is assumed in the first instance to entail minor maintenance by VWSCs, for which specific
        manuals and guidelines exist, both from the NRDWP and at state level.

      •	 For major maintenance, repairs and replacements, state governments are expected to contribute financially
        under the assumption that there is capacity for asset management at state level; In Uttarakhand, UJS – a separate
        entity - has been assigned as professional back-up support.




138   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Water resources management

•	 Water resources management is a state responsibility guided by national policy and with monitoring and technical
  support.

•	 The institutional framework for water resources management at state level is weak, particularly for the regulation
  of groundwater use.

•	 Improving source sustainability is a key part of rural water supply programs, particularly through measures such
  as local groundwater recharge and catchment protection works.

•	 In the states most affected by overuse of groundwater, the impact of such measures will remain limited, as
  addressing root causes must be done in other sectors (for example, agriculture).

Monitoring and regulation

•	 The national monitoring system mainly focuses on coverage and tracking progress in the increase of coverage, and
  not on service delivery monitoring.

•	 In Punjab, there are several monitoring and information systems that, taken together, provide a good basis for
  service delivery monitoring; the information system in Uttarakhand is geared toward monitoring project cycle
  implementation of the SWAp, and is intended to also be used for monitoring ongoing service delivery.

•	 Social accountability mechanisms are effectively implemented during project implementation; oversight of
  ongoing service provision is clear, with sufficient separation between the GP and UWSSC or GPWSC.



Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 The main model is village-based management models, which are employed in similar
   ways in both states (PWSC in Punjab and the UWSSC in Uttarakhand); in both states, con-
   ditions and capacities are in place at the level of the VWSCs, although to a greater extent
   in Uttarakhand, by building up capacities at the State, District and local (GP/Village)
   levels.

•	 Gaps exist mainly regarding monitoring and oversight of ongoing service delivery and the
   effectiveness of local water resources management measures.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 The Sector Wide Approach has provided a useful and relevant framework for decentraliza-
   tion of service delivery, as it ensures the same set of roles and responsibilities and the
   same approach toward institutional capacity building irrespective of the funding source.

•	 The financial framework makes it clear that recovery of all the life cycle costs through
   tariffs is not feasible, particularly the costs of major repairs and replacements; mainte-
   nance funds are set-up with state and GP funds.

•	 The Swajal Sector Information System in Uttarakhand provides an example that includes
   both data on project implementation progress as well as monitoring service delivery, with
   the latter in scale-up.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 Decentralization has allocated clear responsibilities for rural water services in terms of policy formulation,
        planning, monitoring, technical support, and services oversight, especially between central government
        institutions, provinces, and districts. As a result, local governments are increasingly taking ownership of rural
        water services, especially for planning and implementing infrastructure development.

      •	 Further decentralization and allocation of roles and responsibilities between district and village governments is
        still not clearly defined, particularly for covering capital maintenance costs.

      •	 Successive government-led programs have included substantial funds for building the capacity of rural water
        service providers: PAMSIMAS has allocated between 19 percent and 28 percent of overall funds to software
        activities (excluding implementation support) since 2006.

      •	 Many CBOs still lack the technical capacity to manage schemes adequately.

      Financing

      •	 The national program for rural water supply, or PAMSIMAS, is financed through a mix of domestic funds (including
        from local governments) and international transfers; the program has proven successful in leveraging funds
        needed to develop rural water supply infrastructure.

      •	 Local government expenditure on rural water supply remains below expected levels, although there is an
        increasing trend; this includes recurring costs related to support activities and monitoring.

      •	 For most CBOs, the tariffs in place can just about cover operating costs; only a small percentage are able to apply
        full cost-recovering tariffs (only 10 percent of schemes developed under PAMSIMAS apply full cost-recovery
        tariffs).

      •	 Tariff charges represent 0.4 percent and 1.6 percent of a poor household’s income (40 liters per capita per day
        consumed by a household with six members on average); this remains within the affordability bracket (based on a
        US$1.90 per day income).

      Asset management

      •	 There is no national framework or law to clearly ascribe asset ownership: in practice, asset ownership varies
        depending on the source of funds or the project that has supported construction of the assets.

      •	 The handover process is not necessarily accompanied by an inventory or registry of assets.

      •	 In a context where most CBOs are unable to plan and carry out investments, districts are stepping in to finance
        large repairs and rehabilitations, but on a “fix on failure” basis.

      •	 As these activities are not considered to be part of core district functions, they are not planned and budgeted by
        district institutions based on assets lifecycle, but rather only on an ad hoc basis.

      •	 The formation of village enterprises, whereby the village government and the CBO jointly own assets (in a joint
        stock company model), presents one approach for ensuring continuous funding for asset maintenance; another
        option under discussion is to further professionalize CBOs (formal BPSPAMs) to take on this role.

      Water resources management

      •	 National and basin-level institutions have been established to ensure integrated water resources management
        (IWRM), but there is overlap of institutional responsibilities. While several institutions are mandated for water
        resources management, few have adequate monitoring and enforcement tools.

      •	 The scrapping in 2015 of the Water Act (2004) coincided with a period of rising water insecurity due to
        groundwater over-abstraction and pollution, droughts and floods. Despite these challenges, the sector lacks
        coordination, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.

      •	 At local level, some programs are incentivizing service providers to protect water catchments.




142   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Monitoring and regulation

•	 A national monitoring system for the sector was developed (NAWASIS Info), but has not been effectively adopted
  by government agencies and local governments.

•	 The monitoring system for the PAMSIMAS program includes sustainability indicators, such as institutional capacity
  to manage water schemes and the financial performance of service providers; it is now being scaled up nationally.

•	 In practice, districts have limited capacity to monitor and enforce service level standards for all water schemes,
  due to lack of resources allocated to these activities.



Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 The CBO model, when monitored and supported by targeted interventions, has generally
   performed well, as demonstrated by the fact that at least 10 percent of villages that bene-
   fited from the PAMSIMAS program apply full cost-recovery tariffs and 80 percent are able
   to maintain functional water schemes.

•	 The challenge, however, is to address the limited financial capacity of CBOs to manage
   schemes for capital maintenance and extending rural water infrastructure to respond to
   increasing demand.

•	 Unclear asset ownership and an over-reliance on CBOs for service delivery has resulted in
   local governments making little to no provision for capital maintenance over time.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Community-based management can be transformed into a sustainable service delivery
   model, if adequately supported.

•	 The country has developed a comprehensive support system for CBOs, in the form of
   PAMSIMAS, based on an assessment of CBO capacity and level of competency. Where
   local governments have been active in providing guidance and support, CBOs’ perfor-
   mance has improved.

•	 Clear arrangements, including through a formal delegation process, between CBOs and
   service authorities are needed to ensure that funds are allocated to capital maintenance
   and monitoring. Some new models are emerging, such as village enterprises.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 Strong legal frameworks for decentralization; however, there are many practical challenges especially around
         capacity of local government to support service providers.

       •	 A new national program on rural water was recently launched, attracting support from various development
         partners.

       •	 DDWSWD and other sector institutions are chronically underfunded and have shortfalls in staffing.

       •	 The majority of CDWUUs lack both management and technical capacity and are often financially unviable.

       •	 There are limited vocational training opportunities, or incentives, causing challenges in retaining skilled staff.

       Financing

       •	 There are high capital costs due to low population densities and the cold climate requiring engineering
         measures.

       •	 DDWSWD has virtually no operational budget apart from salaries and overheads to fulfil its functions.

       •	 Public sector financing for capital investment has increased from a very low base in recent years. Major IFIs
         (World Bank, Islamic Development Bank (IsDB)) were brought into the sector under the National Rural Water
         program with a focus on capital investment, capacity building, monitoring and sector reforms.

       •	 Despite a clear fiscal decentralization policy, fiscal transfers to AOs are very limited and local government
         suffers from considerable resource constraints.

       •	 Tariffs are commonly low and collection rates are challenging; only around one quarter of CDWUUs are able to
         meet the recurrent costs of operating schemes.

       •	 Tariff setting can be politicized at the local level, though there are reforms under way intended to improve this
         situation. Mechanisms are in place to protect poorer consumers, but these could be strengthened.

       •	 The national average tariff level was reported to be US$1.30 per household in 2012 ($0.32 per capita) per
         month. The share of household expenditure was on average only 0.3 percent for the poorest deciles (UNDP
         2014).

       Asset management

       •	 Asset ownership is clearly defined and sits with the AOs, which have authority to delegate operation and
         administration of schemes. However, few service providers or authorities practice any form of planned asset
         management. Around one third of facilities require rebuilding completely, and a further 26 percent need major
         rehabilitation; much infrastructure is antiquated and poorly performing, with relatively high losses.

       •	 In practice, preventative maintenance practices are limited, with no institutionalized systems for asset
         management in place. Service agreements do not routinely specify the division of responsibility between service
         providers and authorities for minor and major repairs.

       •	 Rural areas often lack access to professionally skilled people, engineers or specialized equipment.

       Water resources management and security

       •	 There is good availability and quality of water resources despite some local issues of quality and security.

       •	 There is a clear legislative framework, but procedures are not always followed due to financing constraints;
         water governance is weak, and planned reforms put in place several years ago have yet to be realized.




146   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
 Monitoring and regulation

 •	 A nationwide inventory of water supply schemes was carried out in 2013, but has not been updated since.

 •	 Whilst decentralized offices of DDWSWD have knowledge of the general status of schemes, there is no
   consolidated data available on service quality or performance of service providers.

 •	 An established system for water quality monitoring exists, but is not applied regularly due to a lack of financing;

 •	 There is no regular analysis or sharing of data (through Joint Sector Review processes or similar) to inform
   sector or local level decision making.

 •	 There is no formal regulator. Tariff setting is the responsibility of the Anti-Monopoly Commission. Consumers
   and service providers can appeal to the AO for arbitration if needed, although the process is often politicized.



Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 The community management model in the Kyrgyz Republic is often inadequate to provide
  the level of service required and receives limited support; this is reflected in relatively
  poor scoring.

•	 The CDWUU model suffers from weak capacity and poor financial viability, without struc-
  tured support, and tariff regulation.

•	 Physical dispersion of communities and high costs of pipe laying mean interconnecting
  schemes are not viable; however, aggregation under one overall management model
  (combining multiple CDWUUs) could allow for more professionalized management with
  economies of scale.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Frameworks for decentralization without the associated fiscal transfer present challenges;
  however, users are willing to pay based on historically high service standards. The area-
  based aggregation model is a promising solution to improve services, but is yet to be fully
  tested.

•	 In contexts where there is a strong history of free services, and political interference in
  tariff setting, considerable efforts are needed to build users’ willingness to pay, as well as
  service provider and authorities’ willingness to charge and protect tariff decisions from
  political influence.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 Responsibilities between sector actors (including national and local level institutions) are well defined, especially
        for project implementation; where municipalities have limited capacity to increase access to services and ensure
        provision, they can delegate these responsibilities to the public utility ONEE.

      •	 ONEE is mandated to increase access to rural water supplies and places a strong focus on sustainability, having
        created specific internal units and at local levels to address the challenges of rural water supply; for example,
        ONEE is piloting contract modalities with private operators to maintain rural water infrastructure and ensure
        service standards in villages.

      •	 Although there is limited data on rural municipalities that manage water schemes directly, informal reports
        indicate they often lack capacity to manage schemes sustainably and lack technical support.

      Financing

      •	 Investments in the rural water sector are based on a national planning process, which identifies investment needs
        and priority areas in coordination with local governments.

      •	 Funding for sector investments is predominantly via domestic financing (including local commercial banks) and
        international transfers, mainly loans from development partners, including the World Bank).

      •	 Local governments are also contributing to financing infrastructure development, especially where there is
        demand for household connections (which require distribution networks).

      •	 Tariff setting in rural areas is not based on cost recovery and is subject to political interference; as a result, they
        are affordable, including for the poorest, representing some 2 percent of a poor household’s income

      Asset management

      •	 There is clarity over asset ownership and responsibility for asset maintenance.

      •	 Where ONEE is the service provider or the service authority (through delegation), the utility applies asset
        management practices as in urban areas: assets are inventoried, mapped, and investments planned based on their
        life cycle.

      •	 Data on asset management carried out by municipal service providers is scarce, but informal reports indicate that
        it is not always adequate.

      Water resources management

      •	 As a water scarce country, Morocco has put in place strong legal instruments and national institutions to enable
        integrated water resources management.

      •	 Rural areas have been particularly affected by the depletion of water resources. ONEE’s model of a regional
        production and distribution infrastructure addresses the issue of scarce water resources, although it comes with
        high capital costs.

      Monitoring and regulation

      •	 There is a discrepancy between the national figures as suggested by ONEE (over 90 percent) and the JMP (65
        percent) for access levels. This suggests that some rural populations may be using alternative (unimproved)
        sources of drinking water despite access to infrastructure for improved water supplies.

      •	 Although ONEE’s activities are well monitored and regulated (through a contract with the government), other
        service providers—municipalities, in particular—are poorly regulated.



      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
      •	 Non-corporatized municipal provision appears to suffer from inadequate financing (par-
         ticularly for recurrent costs and asset maintenance) and lack of monitoring and
         regulation.



150   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
•	 ONEE’s “project structurant” model, whereby investments are carried out as part of large-
  scale regional water production and distribution infrastructure, limits CBOs’ responsibili-
  ties to managing small village-level distribution networks. ONEE also provides technical
  assistance to improve CBO management skills, although the utility has not always been
  able to offer this assistance at scale.

•	 Where ONEE ensures direct service provision, services are professionalized with ade-
  quate billing and collection practices.

•	 Private sector provision is only at a pilot stage, except where caretakers are in charge of
  communal water points (bornes-fontaines). Service contracts appear to be working well.
  However, concession-type contracts have proven more difficult to implement, especially
  in contexts where municipalities are expected to contribute to capital investments but
  delay disbursements.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 The clear mandate given to a well-performing national utility (ONEE) to extend access to
  rural areas has resulted in improved service levels and sustainability of investments.

•	 The supported community management model, where CBOs are limited to managing dis-
  tribution networks only and ONEE retains water production responsibilities, has proven
  an adequate solution for low capacity CBOs.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 This is a historically fragmented sector with various modalities for implementing initial capital works; roles for
         monitoring and training and post construction support to WSUCs are poorly defined and not done.

       •	 There have been significant sector level efforts to strengthen harmonization; for example, drafting a sector
         development plan, joint sector reviews and strengthening coordination platforms.

       •	 There are shortfalls in DDC and DoLIDAR capacity for rural water supply activities, although efforts are under
         way to address these.

       Financing

       •	 Overall sector funding is increasing, and the new sector development plan aims to strengthen budget tracking
         and investigate alternative financing options, including maximizing domestic investments.

       •	 Timeliness, predictability and adequacy of funding to DDCs and WSSDOs leads to delayed, rushed, or (most
         commonly) drawn-out implementation of capital works.

       •	 Actual allocation of sector budgets for maintenance is well below the 20 percent level stipulated in policy.

       •	 WSUCs are rarely provided with guidance on tariff setting, and levels charged vary widely and are poorly
         documented.

       Asset management

       •	 Asset management is a new concept; it is referenced in the strategic plan but not operationalized.

       •	 The national database of water schemes developed under the National Mapping Information project is a
         potential first step toward an asset inventory, but the process of updating needs improvement.

       •	 Asset ownership and thresholds of responsibility for financing maintenance costs are poorly defined between
         the service authority and WSUCs. WSUCs rarely develop maintenance plans.

       Water resources management

       •	 Institutional silos prevent operationalizing integrated water resources management, particularly at national
         level. District WRM committees have limited capacity and data on which to make allocations.

       •	 Hydrological monitoring and water quality surveillance is relatively limited and sporadic.

       •	 Good examples of local level planning and multiple-use programming exist (for example, the Rural Village Water
         Resource Management project).

       •	 Only 68 percent of schemes provide year-round water supply; many are operated with intermittent supply,
         risking water quality. Despite this, there is a drive to upgrade gravity systems for domestic connections, which
         may increase per capita demand.

       Monitoring and regulation

       •	 Nepal now has joint sector reviews and sector performance reports, and is increasing budget tracking.

       •	 Aside from the NMIP system inventory, there is no sector-wide M&E or MIS system, nor sector indicator
         framework being used currently. In 2011–12 there were efforts to establish a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
         Monitoring and Evaluation Unit and operationalize the RWSS sector M&E system. The draft sector development
         plan addresses this, and some work has started to improve the situation.

       •	 Roles and responsibilities are unclear for monitoring and regulation of WSUCs, with limited systematic
         monitoring activities. Monitoring of capital works varies considerably, leading to some quality issues.



      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
      •	 There are numerous modalities and approaches for undertaking initial capital works and
        training for rural water operators, but only one model of ongoing service management




154   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
  (community management). Despite challenges to sustainability in this model, testing
  alternative models in rural areas appears limited to non-existent.

•	 The CBM model is even applied in towns to operate relatively large and complex schemes.
  While the WSUCs employ maintenance workers, contracting out maintenance or manage-
  ment to the private sector is uncommon. No examples were found of alternative CBM
  models, such as aggregation or multi-village schemes. The role of the Federation of WSUCs
  (FEDWASUN) in strengthening its member’s capacity is under-utilized.

•	 Various models for district-level support to WSUCs are being piloted, including World
  Bank-funded programs, however there is currently no single model ready for scaling.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Even where sector silos exist between national and regional agencies, community-based
  water resources planning and support for multiple-use programming can bring positive
  results.

•	 Targets and objectives for upgrading piped systems from stand posts to domestic connec-
  tions needs to be implemented pragmatically, considering projections of source yields,
  avoiding intermittent supply in the network, and ensuring this does not compromise
  access for the poorest to at least a basic level of service.

•	 Bottom-up planning and demand-driven processes can unlock significant levels of com-
  munity financing for capital works; this trend is reflected in Nepal’s impressive progress in
  expanding first time access.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 The lead national entity for rural water service delivery is FISE, which has a well-elaborated project cycle
         approach for infrastructure development and capacity building of CAPS.

       •	 Municipalities are designated as service authorities, with responsibilities in planning and co-financing of
         infrastructure, as well as providing technical assistance and registration support to CAPS through designated
         UMAS. Their capacity is limited but growing, with significant effort having gone into strengthening their capacity
         in recent years.

       Financing

       •	 There is only partial insight into the investment needs to reach coverage targets and strengthen sector capacity;
         as a result, the sector cannot fully assess financing gaps for rural water supply.

       •	 The regulations and guidelines for covering recurrent costs through tariffs in rural areas are inadequate to
         establish financially sustainable services. CAPS can set their own tariffs, but these are generally too low to meet
         all life cycle costs such as operation, minor maintenance costs, replacement and upgrading.

       •	 Median tariffs fall well within generally agreed affordability bandwidths. But the fact that each CAPS can set its
         own tariff does not allow for any cross-subsidies between urban and rural areas, or within rural communities;
         indirect subsidies exist, but only through tax exemptions.

       Asset management

       •	 There are adequate legal frameworks for asset ownership; however, clearer roles for CAPS and the government
         concerning responsibility for asset management need to be defined. Efforts are under way to specify the
         responsibilities for financing major replacements and rehabilitation in particular.

       •	 The national information system for water and sanitation (SIASAR) contains a detailed inventory of the assets at
         the level of each CAPS.

       •	 Given the generally low to moderate capacity of CAPS, actual asset management practice is limited and
         inadequate.

       Water resources management

       •	 The importance of water resources management for sustainable water supplies is recognised in legal frameworks
         and the institutional setup, but efforts for management of water resources at basin level are limited.

       •	 Municipalities and CAPS also have mandates for local water resources protection, and these are generally
         fulfilled.

       Monitoring and regulation

       •	 The country has a strong monitoring system in the form of SIASAR, which is based on service delivery indicators,
         and covers the entire country.

       •	 There is growing institutional capacity at UMAS level to update SIASAR and use it for planning, technical
         assistance and other purposes.

       •	 Regulation of CAPS is very weak, due to lack of clear tariff regulations, performance indicators, and formal
         accountability mechanisms.



      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
      •	 Of the various service delivery models in rural Nicaragua, community management is by
        far the most common. The law on CAPS has given an important impetus to formalizing
        community management.

      •	 The service delivery model explicitly considers the need for municipal and national gov-
        ernment to increasingly provide CAPS with financial support.



158   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
•	 The actual capacity for community management is low to moderate, with very limited
  degrees of professionalization (for example, around asset management practices or regu-
  lation of the CAPS).

•	 Applying the current CAPS model as a blanket approach across all rural areas of the coun-
  try is not likely to lead to sustainable service delivery at scale, as it does not account for
  the different needs and capacities required to manage different types of water supply sys-
  tems, ranging from hand pumps to motorized pumping schemes.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 The law on CAPS has been a very important legal framework, as it establishes a legal man-
  date to the CAPS, but also specifies the role of municipalities in supporting them.

•	 Having dedicated UMAs as units at municipal level for providing technical assistance has
  proved to be important.

•	 The SIASAR monitoring system is a very important innovation, not only in terms of how it
  monitors service delivery indicators, but, also in providing a de facto inventory of all water
  supply assets in the country.

•	 CAPS are encouraged and requested to undertake local water resources management
  activities, such as catchment protection, which is happening across a reasonable percent-
  age of the CAPS.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
      Institutional capacity

      •	 The absence of a lead agency for the water sector hampers provision of targeted and coordinated support to
        LGUs and service providers, but reforms are under way.

      •	 Since the start of the Salintubig national program for water supply in 2011, LGUs have been given a greater role
        in planning, financing and monitoring rural water services. However, mechanisms to hold LGUs accountable for
        rural water services are still required to ensure that LGUs’ involvement extends beyond the lifetime of centrally
        led programs.

      •	 Responsibility for water services has been decentralized to barangays, although in practice municipal
        governments retain oversight over services, especially at construction stage. These overlaps in responsibilities
        may cause barangays to neglect their responsibilities for water services.

      Financing

      •	 Public funds are channeled to the rural water sector through a national program (Salintubig). However,
        investment requirements to reach universal access by 2025 far outstrip current levels of investment.

      •	 Salintubig has incentivized municipalities’ contribution to financing infrastructure.

      •	 Despite regulatory guidelines, tariffs do not cover full cost recovery across all service providers.

      •	 Tariffs are generally low due to unwillingness to charge (and to pay); only a few schemes operate in a financially
        sustainable manner.

      •	 Tariff expenditure represents between 0.5 percent and 1 percent of a poor household’s income (based on the
        US$1.90 per day income per capita, a consumption of 40 liters per capita per day in a household of six).

      Asset management

      •	 Assets ownership is not clearly defined and the hand-over is not accompanied by adequate inventories.

      •	 There are no specific agreements between municipalities, barangays and service providers on financing
        responsibilities toward maintenance and repairs (minor or major).

      •	 Provision of funds for asset rehabilitation and repair is ad hoc, leading to disruptions in services.

      •	 For most schemes, tariffs do not include depreciation costs, and financing arrangements do not include specific
        provision for asset renewal or expansion.

      Water resources management

      •	 The country recognizes the importance of integrated water resources management; however, the fragmented
        institutional framework is a constraint for sustainable water resource development.

      •	 Service authorities and users are not represented in water resources management coordination platforms.

      •	 There has been (slow) progress in setting up participatory approaches to watershed management.

      Monitoring and regulation

      •	 Several central government agencies are involved in monitoring and regulation, creating some overlaps.

      •	 Municipal governments do not seem to monitor service provision on a routine basis and do not hold barangays
        accountable for service quality and financial decisions (including tariffs and operational subsidies).

      •	 A national monitoring and regulatory framework for service provision in rural areas and small towns is
        established. A water registry is compiled for all types of service providers, with performance indicators. This
        initiative supports the “light-touch” regulation tailored to various providers, encouraging gradual compliance.

      •	 The NWRB (the regulator for smaller piped systems) hosts a program of accredited technical assistance providers
        to support smaller service providers to improve capacity and comply with regulatory requirements; despite self-
        contributions from providers, financing for scale-up remains a bottleneck.




162   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
•	 BWSAs and RWSAs are generally ill-equipped to ensure continuous services or manage
  network extensions. There are no systems in place to systematically train service provid-
  ers in operation of schemes. Barangays provide funds for repairs and capital maintenance
  on a “fix on failure” basis.

•	 LGU-run schemes apply low tariffs (close to CBO-managed schemes) and receive less tech-
  nical support from central institutions.

•	 Water districts have stronger technical capacity than LGUs and CBOs, but few are involved
  in rural water supply services; better incentives are needed for water districts to extend
  their services into less densely populated areas.

•	 More data is needed to better assess the private operator service delivery model. However,
  some reports indicate good performance on financing and asset management aspects.

•	 Lessons Learned from Country Experience

•	 The Listahang Tubig (a national survey of water operators’ performance) provides a good
  example for countries looking to strengthen their regulatory framework for rural water
  services.

•	 A promising and emerging service delivery model is the association of small rural service
  providers with larger, urban utilities.

•	 The accredited technical service provider program, which connects small water utilities
  with technical experts to give them advice toward professionalization of operations for
  improved services, has produced encouraging results.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 LGAs suffer from widespread gaps in staffing, technical and operational capacities. National and regional
         structures are oriented to provide LGAs support, and water sector development programs include efforts to
         address these, with the exception of LGA recurrent budgets to achieve mandates.

       •	 The COWSOs’ capacity is a widespread challenge, including the quality of initial training and ongoing support,
         which negatively impacts sustainability. Private sector participation is promoted by policy; however, capacity can
         be weak with limited initiatives in practice.

       Financing

       •	 A sectorwide basket fund is in place and sector funding absorption capacity has improved over recent years.

       •	 The major increase in sector funding is not matched by proportional increases in allocation for LGA recurrent
         budgets or maintenance. There are uncertainties in responsibility for financing capital maintenance and
         expansion; tariffs are inadequate and LGAs do not consistently budget for these investments.

       •	 Guidance to COWSOs regarding tariff setting is not widespread, but is improving.

       •	 Tariffs are highly variable. Based on 40 liters per capita per day for a household size of six persons it represents
         1–4.6 percent of a poor household’s income at US$1.90 per capita per day. However, studies state it can be as
         high as 28 percent for certain schemes (Fonseca 2016), and in contrast is often too low to cover operation and
         maintenance (O&M) costs (Nathan Inc. 2016).

       Asset management

       •	 Asset management is a relatively new concept in Tanzania. The Sustainability Strategy (2015) mentions the need
         to develop an asset management strategy, but this is yet to be realized.

       •	 The water point mapping exercise has mapped nearly all rural water points in the country and is a first step
         toward developing a nationwide asset registry, and there are measures in place to develop operation and
         maintenance plans at COWSO and district levels.

       •	 The planned Centres of Excellences are envisioned as bringing maintenance services closer to communities, but
         are yet to be established and business models and financial sustainability are undecided.

       Water resources management

       •	 Water resource availability per capita is rapidly reducing, and around 15 percent of water sources are seasonal.

       •	 WRM institutions have been established from national to local level, but experience capacity challenges.

       •	 Improvements in national hydrological monitoring is not matched with systematic hydrological and water quality
         surveillance at the water supply level.

       Monitoring and regulation

       •	 The sector has developed a management information system, uses results based monitoring and reporting, and
         together with the financial reporting software this has helped to improve transparency.

       •	 There have been uncertainties regarding the roles and responsibilities of LGAs for monitoring of COWSOs, and
         no formal protocols have been established. The monitoring and accountability framework arguably promotes
         upwards accountability, with less emphasis on ensuring community monitoring.



      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level

      •	 The example of the Water Service Facility Trust managing multiple COWSOs brings econ-
        omies of scale, with anecdotal evidence of professionalized community management.




166   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
•	 Shifting from the traditional village water committees to more legally autonomous
  COWSOs helps improve the ability to ring fence funds for the water schemes and contract
  the private sector for specific services.

•	 Private sector participation (PSP) is promoted in policy, but is relatively limited to date;
  the main focus is on management, with few examples of private capital investment in
  infrastructure. There are plans to educate communities in the benefits of PSP and advice
  on contract stipulations.



Lessons Learned from Country Experience

•	 DfID’s piloting of Payment by Results for reimbursing government activities in rural water
  requires and incentivizes the government to strengthen its own monitoring, reporting,
  and data processes.

•	 Helping service providers transition from diesel and grid to solar power pumping reduces
  O&M costs, hence improving the affordability and financial viability of schemes. However,
  promotion of solar needs to be matched with the development of maintenance services
  and supply chains.

•	 Local planning of WASH investments does not necessarily equate to equitable planning.
  Improving sector data (such as water point mapping) could allow objective decision mak-
  ing and involvement of civil society in the local planning process.

•	 The COWSO competency checklist developed by the World Bank provides a good opportu-
  nity for more structured monitoring, capacity assessment, and support to community
  management structures. It also allows benchmarking of service providers, creating
  healthy competition to excel.

      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Sector Level
       Institutional capacity

       •	 The country has developed a robust institutional system to implement the National Target Program for rural
         water (so-called NTP), with strong support systems at different institutional levels of project implementation.
         However, NTP3 for Rural Water has ended, and rural water will be integrated with wider poverty reduction and
         rural development programs.

       •	 This above change will require a redefinition of institutional responsibilities to ensure the sustainability of
         progress achieved, particularly to monitor and support service providers.

       •	 Although PCERWASS are mandated to build community capacity, due to the lack of capacity in these provincial
         centers, many communities receive little or no assistance.

       Financing

       •	 The NTP made rural water supply a development priority and provided an efficient instrument to attract,
         increase and channel funds to a sector that had previously been neglected.

       •	 Local planning processes do not take into account support or capacity building activities and the need to involve
         communities in a bottom-up approach to ensure the uptake of improved services.

       •	 There is an over-reliance on public funds, especially central government funds, with little revenues generated
         from tariffs or funding allocated from locally generated sources.

       •	 There is a clearly defined tariff policy, which takes into account full cost recovery and optional subsidies to
         service providers. However, PPCs fail to implement the policy (and channel subsidies to service providers) when
         required to ensure financial viability.

       •	 Tariffs levels are affordable but often below operational cost recovery. Tariffs were found to be around D5,000
         per cubic meter (US$0.22 per cubic meter). Based on a consumption of 40 liters per capita per day, a household
         of six would pay US$1.5 per month or 2.8 percent of income of a household living on US$1.90 per day.

       Asset management

       •	 The country is in the process of establishing an asset management framework, with the Ministry of Finance
         leading efforts to register and estimate the capital value of publicly funded water assets.

       •	 The current system in place for financing capital maintenance is not effective, increasing the risk that water
         schemes will degrade and fall into disrepair through lack of planned (capital) maintenance.

       Water resources management

       •	 Good progress has been made in establishing the legal and policy frameworks for water resources management
         to address issues of water availability and quality.

       •	 However, there is a lack of coordination between government agencies and inadequate information sharing,
         particularly regarding monitoring of water quality.

       Monitoring and regulation

       •	 A national monitoring system is in place to track access to water services and functionality, operating under
         NTP3; the future transition of the monitoring system is unclear.

       •	 Data is not always updated or accurate: some PPCs fail to allocate budgets for monitoring.

       •	 The current monitoring framework is inadequate for monitoring service levels and operator performance.



      Key Evidence Points from the Assessment at Service Provider Level
      •	 NCERWASS estimates that 25 percent of community-managed schemes are not functional,
        or functioning below capacity. Some training is provided to communities before handing
        over, but ongoing post construction support is non-existent. Service levels are not moni-
        tored. Most community-managed schemes do not apply tariffs, or apply very low ones.



170   Sustainability Assessment of Rural Water Service Delivery Models
•	 PCERWASS are generally equipped with well-trained staff, but staffing numbers are lim-
   ited for monitoring, post construction support, and carrying out communication cam-
   paigns. In their role as service provider, they raise limited revenue from tariffs and are not
   well able to ring fence tariff income. Tariffs are usually below operating cost recovery, and
   far from full cost recovery.

•	 Privately managed schemes exhibit better financial performance. However, the enabling
   environment remains unattractive for scaling up private sector participation. In particu-
   lar, PPCs do not always implement the national policy with regard to tariff subsidies,
   which creates uncertainty on revenue streams. Regulatory oversight for adequate PPP
   procurement and performance monitoring is absent.


Lessons Learned from Country Experience
•	 Funding for the sector has been channeled through a national investment plan combining
   financing from national government, local government, and donors (NTP3).

•	 The national tariff policy takes into account full cost recovery and includes subsidy mech-
   anisms to be provided to operators where full cost recovery tariffs cannot be applied;
   implementation, however, does not follow policy.

•	 A results-based financing program (supported by the World Bank) is incentivizing provin-
   cial governments to focus more on financial sustainability and operational efficiency.


Note
1.	 With the new federal structure in place, this institutional set-up is expected to change, with more devolution of authority
   and responsibility for providing water supply services to the provincial and local government (municipalities and village
   council) levels.
