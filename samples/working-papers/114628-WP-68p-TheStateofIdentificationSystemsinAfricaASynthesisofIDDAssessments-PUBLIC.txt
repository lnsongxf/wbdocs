              ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
              This report was prepared by Julia Clark on behalf of the Identification for
              Development (ID4D) initiative, the World Bank Group’s cross-departmental effort
              to support progress towards identification systems using 21st century solutions.

              The findings in the report are based on detailed assessments of identification
              systems (IMSAs) in 17 countries—Botswana, Chad, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire,
              the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia,
              Madagascar, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and
              Zambia—that were conducted between 2015 and 2016 as part of the ID4D
              initiative. As a result, the information presented here represents a snapshot of
              identification systems in these countries at the time the reports were written, and
              may not reflect recent developments.

              This summary report relies heavily on the teams that conducted the individual
              assessments, as well as the many local officials and professionals whose
              expertise informed their analysis. Specifically, the report would not have been
              possible without the work of the authors and contributors to the IMSAs, including
              Joseph Atick (Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, DRC, Liberia, Morocco, Rwanda, Sierra Leone),
              Vasumathi Anandan (Kenya), Heriniaina Andrianasy (Madagascar), Diego Angel-
              Urdinola (Moroc-co), Kenabetsho Bainame (Botswana), Nathalie Tchoumba
              Bitnga (Cameroon), Motsholathebe Bowe-lo (Botswana), Dorothee Chen
              (Morocco), Ndoe Dir (Cameroon), Fatima El Kadiri (Morocco), Jean Ferry (Guinea),
              Alan Gelb (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania), Mia Harbitz (Madagascar, Namibia), Diane
              Hubbard (Namibia), Linda C. Kasonde (Zambia), Mpho Keetile (Botswana), Anne-
              Lucie Lefebvre (Madagascar), Neo Corneliah Lepang (Botswana), Marc Lixi
              (Guinea), Kannan Navaneetham (Botswana), Azedine Ouerghi (Côte d’Ivoire),
              Robert Palacios (Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Morocco), Krish-na Pidatala (Namibia,
              Tanzania, Zambia), Ariel Pino (Morocco), Serai Daniel Rakgoasi (Botswana),
              Antsanirina Ramanantsoa (Madagascar), Manuel Salazar (Cameroon), Zaid
              Safdar (Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone), Arleen Cannata Seed (Kenya), Jaap van
              der Straaten (Cameroon, Zambia), Emily Weedon (Cameroon), and Matthias Witt
              (Madagascar).

              Furthermore, this report benefitted greatly from the input of Robert Palacios,
              Alan Gelb and Jonathan Marskell, under the supervision of Vyjayanti Desai, and
              from the support and guidance of the ID4D team, including Matthias Witt and
              Kamya Chandra.

Glossary                                                        1

Autonomous                                        In the context of government administration, an entity legally entitled to
                                                  administrative and budgetary self-rule within the executive branch of the
                                                  government, but outside of the line ministries.


Civil register                                    The repository of loose-leaf files, ledger books, electronic files, or any
                                                  other official files or database set up for the universal, continuous, and
                                                  permanent recording—in accordance with established procedures—of
                                                  each type of vital event and its associated data for the population of a
                                                  defined area (e.g., county, district, municipality, or parish).


 Credential                                       A mechanism, process, device or document that vouches for the identity
                                                  of a person through some method of trust and authentication. Examples
                                                  include birth certificates, national ID cards, digital and mobile certificates,
                                                  unique ID numbers, etc.


Deduplication                                     A specialized data compression technique for eliminating duplicate copies
                                                  of repeating data. Biometric data—including fingerprints and iris scans—is
                                                  commonly used to deduplicate identities and establish uniqueness.


Digital identity                                  A set of electronically captured and stored attributes and credentials that
                                                  can uniquely identify a person that individualize a person in a computer-
                                                  based environment.


Electronic identification                         An credential used to identify and authenticate an individual in a
                                                  digital environment. Generally, a smartcard that contains a contact- or
(eID)                                             contactless chip.



Foundational                                      Identification system created for general public administration and
                                                  identification—including civil registries, national IDs, and national
identification system                             population registers—which may serve as the basis for a wide variety
                                                  of public and private transactions, services, and derivative identity
                                                  credentials. Common examples include national IDs, civil registers, and
                                                  population registers.


Functional identification                         Identification system created in response to a demand for a particular
                                                  service or transaction, and may issue identity credentials such as voter IDs,
system                                            health and insurance records, bank cards, etc. These may be commonly
                                                  accepted for broader identification purposes, but may not always bestow
                                                  legal identity.

Glossary
Identification                     The determination of identity and recognition of who a person is; the
                                   action or process of determining what a thing is; or the recognition of a
                                   thing as being what it is.


Identification/identity            Systems—including databases, credentials, and the processes,
                                   procedures, and infrastructure to create and manage them—that register
system                             and identify individuals for a general or specific purpose.


Identity                           A unique set of features and characteristics that individualize a person,
                                   including biographical and biometric attributes.


Interoperability                   The ability of information systems and procedures to share or authenticate
                                   data and enable the exchange of information and knowledge among
                                   them.


National population                A register of every unique individual that has the right to reside in the
                                   country (citizens, adult, children, resident foreigners, diaspora, and
register (NPR)                     refugees).
                                   	

Legal identification               Identification systems that provide government-recognized credentials
                                   (e.g., identifying numbers, cards, digital certificates, etc.) that can be used
system                             as proof of identity. Legal identification need not be linked with nationality
                                   or citizenship, and may encompass both foundational and functional
                                   systems.


Social register	                   Databases that contain socioeconomic data on the population—at
                                   the individual and/or household level—for the purpose of unifying the
                                   targeting and distribution of social programs, such as social safety nets
                                   and pensions.


Unique identity number             A number—normally based on biometric identification—that uniquely
                                   identifies an individual for their lifetime and can be used to link an identity
(UIN)
                                   across databases and systems in both the public and private sector.

•	   Technology: The technology used for identity
     enrollment, credentialing, and authentication
     varies by country, as do methods of data storage
     and levels of system security. A majority of
     countries still have paper-based civil registers,
     while most civil identity systems are electronic
     and use biometric technology to de-duplicate
     individuals. Most have adopted plastic cards and
     smartcards with advanced security features,
     although a few maintain paper-based ID cards.
     And although a few countries allow service
     providers     (including    government     ministries,
     banks, etc.) to authenticate credentials against a
     central database, almost none have developed
     infrastructure     to      securely      authenticate
     individuals    using    biometrics,     despite   the
     existence of smartcards that are capable of
     performing this function. Only a few countries
     store and manage their data according to
     international best practices to protect against
     theft or unintentional data loss.

     Many WBG projects involve the creation or use
     of identification systems for functional programs,
     including for social protection programs, pension
     and civil service reforms, and financial inclusion.
     These projects can be an important instrument
     to boost demand for identification and—where
     creating foundational systems is not feasible
     in the short-term—create functional identity
     systems that reinforce or lay the groundwork for
     modern foundational identification systems in
     the future.

•	   Investment in foundational identity systems.
     The WBG can continue to play a direct role in
     supporting the development of robust and
     inclusive foundational identification systems.
     This may involve investment in modernizing and
     integrating data systems, including digitization
     of records, ICT equipment and infrastructure,
     staffing   and   training,   setting   up   enabling
     agencies such as Data Ombudsman offices, etc.

21 Fees for functional ID systems like passports and driver’s licenses are often higher than for foundational IDs. While these fees may serve as a
channel for revenue generation to cross-subsidize foundational services, they also present opportunities for rent-seeking by driving up prices,
and may therefore create extra barriers for inclusion. In DRC, for example, the new biometric passport is one of the most expensive in the world
at a cost of US$ 185 dollars (Le Monde 2017). Given an estimated GDP per capita of US$ 456 in 2015 (World Bank Databank), this fee is likely to
be unaffordable for a majority of individuals.
22 Botswana is an exception to this, where an online system allows health workers to register the birth with the DCNR and then deliver
certificates to the mother before she leaves the hospital. The same process exists for death certificates when death occurs at a hospital.
23 Charging fees for IDs may not always be a significant barrier to inclusion where IDs are valued and demand is significant. In Chad, for
example, the fee for an NID is 4000 FCFA (US$ 6.6, the equivalent of 3-day income for the average person). While this cost is relatively high,
the IMSA reports that it does not appear to deter many people from registering, as IDs are seen as essential for everyday life. In parallel, where
demand for birth registration is low, a majority of people seem content to pay the late birth registration fee of 2000-5000 FCFA rather that
register their child on time for free. Still, given that ID coverage in Chad is approximately 30-40 percent of the adult population, it is likely that
these costs are too high for some.

34 Morocco is an example of a country with a decentralized, paper-based register system with stringent controls on the ledgers that record civil
events. The ledger books have numbered pages and are sealed each year to prevent future tampering and revisions. Instead of permanent birth
certificates, local registrars issue certified copies of the birth act upon request, which are only valid for three months and cost approximately US$
0.25. However, while this system provides for relatively robust registers, it cannot control the forgery of the birth acts themselves.

their work and therefor have an incentive to make money on the side. Individuals who face high fees for obtaining documents may find it more
cost effective to buy a forgery. In Cameroon, for example, a counterfeit birth certificate reportedly costs between FCFA 3,000 (US$ 6) and FCFC
10,000, (US$ 21), which may be less than the fees and transaction costs associated with registering a late birth, which can reach approximately

     identification systems. As the WBG continues
     to engage in these programs, it can play an
     important role in creating functional identity
     systems that reinforce or lay the groundwork
     for foundational identity systems and build the
     capacity of functional agencies to manage data
     and take advantage of central identity system—
     rather than building stand-alone, duplicative
     systems for program administration. In addition,
     linking    foundational      identity   systems   with
     benefits programs supported by the Bank may
     also increase demand for identity services.

•	   Investment in foundational identity systems.
     The WBG can continue to play a direct role in
     supporting the development of robust and
     inclusive foundational identification systems.
     This may involve investment in modernizing and
     integrating data systems, including digitization
     of records, ICT equipment and infrastructure,
     staffing   and   training,    setting    up   enabling
     agencies such as Data Ombudsman offices, etc.
