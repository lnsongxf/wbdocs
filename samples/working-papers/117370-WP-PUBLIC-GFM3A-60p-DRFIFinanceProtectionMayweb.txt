and economic disruption together with available economic
data. Even crude estimates can be useful for illustrating the
potential economic impact of disasters in the policy dialogue

as well as relative to gross domestic product (GDP) and

     Box 1: Damage vs. loss
     International organizations and governments increasingly follow a standard methodology when estimating the
     economic impact of major disasters. This methodology was originally developed by the United Nations Economic
     Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean in the 1970s and was subsequently refined by the European
     Union, World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme. The methodology underpins Post-Disaster
     Needs Assessments and involves detailed examinations of the impacts and consequences of major disasters.

     The definitions used in PDNAs are as follows:


     •	 Damage is the replacement value of physical assets wholly or partly destroyed, built to the same standards
        that prevailed prior to the disaster.
     •	 Losses are the foregone economic flows resulting from the temporary absence of the damaged assets and/or
        due to any other disruption of economic activity caused by the disaster.

may be felt particularly acutely, even if funding gap analyses can be difficult
to conduct at that level due to data constraints.

3.4. Funding gap estimates based on
hypothetical events with varying return periods


If statistical estimates of the impact of past disasters with
varying return periods are available, an analysis of funding
gaps associated with events of different return periods
should also be presented. A simple graphical presentation
of the post-disaster emergency funding gap for events with
varying return periods (i.e., with different probability of
occurrence) is illustrated in figure 3. Both short-term and
long-term funding gaps associated with events of varying
return periods should be presented if possible.

The questions listed below can be addressed (separately)                               for post-disaster response, including contingency
both to central and local governments. The link between                                budgets, reserves, and/or insurance at any scale?21
central and local governments in the financing of disaster
relief, early recovery, and reconstruction should be carefully                     e.	 If yes to question d, how well developed are
discussed in meetings with government counterparts.                                     these arrangements (e.g., country is investigating
                                                                                        options, country is developing reserve funds,

20. This does not mean, however, that the questions should be directed
exclusively at those three agencies. Depending on the context, some of
the questions could also be directed at entities such as the central bank or
securities regulator.                                                          21. See section B3 for information on disaster risk finance instruments.

It may be the case that total population and GDP statistics are
available for a shorter time period than the available data points.
For example, disaster events could be recorded from 1963 but
total population or GDP statistics available only from 1990.
In such a case, the user may choose to ignore the earlier data
points for which no population or GDP statistics are available
(the data points between 1963 and 1989 in the example above)
and remove them from the data series. The resulting series of
new data points is called the scaled data series.

stakeholders to acknowledge and take responsibility for their

A government may be reluctant to disclose its explicit
contingent liabilities because of concerns regarding long-
term confidence in the country’s economy. However, if
the government releases information on its disaster risk
financing strategy along with information on explicit
contingent liabilities, it can assuage concerns and limit
adverse market reactions.

Governments may be more circumspect about disclosing
implicit disaster-related contingent liabilities, as such
disclosure may create or exacerbate moral hazard. While it
is important for fiscal planners to take the likely absorption
of implicit contingent liabilities into account when assessing
disaster-associated fiscal risk, they may prefer not to disclose
this information.

Annex VI: Example
of information on
contingent liabilities
due to disaster found in
public documents
The text below (box 2) is taken from the IMF’s July
2016 Article IV consultation report on St. Vincent and
the Grenadines. The report provides no disaggregated
information on past fiscal costs due to explicit and implicit
disaster-related contingent liabilities. However, it mentions
that about three-quarters of annual damages from disasters
have been the responsibility of the government in the past.
It also mentions that average annual damages from disasters
triggered by natural hazards are equivalent to 1.2 percent of
GDP. From these two facts, we can infer that, on average,
the government has faced annual fiscal costs associated with
disaster reconstruction of around 0.9 percent of GDP, with
additional humanitarian response costs roughly equivalent
to an additional 0.2 to 0.3 percent of GDP.
