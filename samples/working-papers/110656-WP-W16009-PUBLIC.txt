      About the High Level Panel for Water
      This document was prepared in support of the High Level Panel
      on Water and its call to action on the water-related Sustainable
      Development Goals. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
      will require governments, societies, and the private sector to change
      the way they use and manage water. To accelerate this transformation,
      the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and World Bank
      Group President Jim Yong Kim have convened a High Level Panel
      on Water. The Panel, which consists of 11 sitting heads of state and
      government and a special advisor, aims to provide the leadership
      required to champion a comprehensive, inclusive and collaborative
      way of developing and managing water resources, and improving
      water and sanitation related services. For more, visit https://

Executive Summary
This report provides data and insights on the role of grant funding and concessional financ-
ing in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal for water (SDG 6, known as the water
SDG). These sources of funding are collectively referred to in this report as aid flows to the
water sector. This report was prepared as an input into the High-Level Panel on Water.
  Data analysis was conducted using two main databases on aid to the water sector. The
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Assistance Committee (OECD/
DAC) database is the most comprehensive, while the WASHfunders.org database provides
complementary data on aid from philanthropic organizations. These databases were com-
plemented by an inventory of the main institutions providing aid to the water sector, as well
as interviews with selected providers of aid to the water sector, including leading multilat-
eral development banks (MDBs), bilateral donor agencies, and international nongovern-
mental organizations (NGOs). This analysis provides the basis for recommendations on how
to improve the aid architecture to the water sector and mobilize financing to achieve the
water SDG.


Analysis of Aid Flows: Main Findings
Official development finance (ODF) to the water sector comprises of concessional (official
development assistance, or ODA) and nonconcessional financing (referred to as other official
flows, or OOF). As per the OECD/DAC definitions, ODA comes in the form of grants and con-
cessional loans provided by official agencies on concessional terms. Loans are deemed to be
concessional when the financial flows contain a minimum grant element of 25 percent, cal-
culated at a discount rate of 10 percent. Development banks typically adapt their lending
terms to countries’ circumstances and make concessional loans through a “soft-lending”
window (such as the International Development Association) and nonconcessional loans
through a “hard-lending” window (such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development). While concessional loans count as ODA, nonconcessional loans would be
included in total ODF but not in total ODA.
  ODF to water nearly tripled between 2003 and 2014, rising from an annual allocation of $6
billion in 2003 to close to $18 billion in 2014. This increase coincided with the implementa-
tion of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the International Water Decade
adopted by the United Nations, which ran from 2005 to 2015. This response is in keeping
with the appeal to international financiers made by the Camdessus Report of 2003 to double
the annual flows of financing to water (World Panel on Financing Water Infrastructure 2003).
Between 2010 and 2014, 42 percent of ODF funds in the water sector was allocated as loans,
28 percent as grants, and 29 percent as nonconcessional loans. Equity and other “grant-like”
financing represented only minuscule amounts. Grants from philanthropies also remained
at fairly low levels: at their highest reported level, they accounted for less than 2 percent of
total ODA to water.




Aid Flows to the Water Sector                                                                xiii
        ODA to the water sector also nearly doubled from 1995 to 2014, rising from $6.8 billion
      to $12.9 billion per year (in constant 2014 prices). ODA for water did not keep pace with the
      growth in ODA for all sectors combined, however, which increased from $42 billion in
      1995 to $140 billion in 2014. While water ODA grew by 90 percent during this period, over-
      all ODA increased by more than 230 percent. The water sector has historically attracted
      smaller amounts of ODA than other social sectors, including education, health, popula-
      tion planning, and government and civil society. The sector has lagged relative to other
      social sectors.
        ODF for water is primarily targeted to water supply and sanitation activities as opposed to
      irrigation or water resources management (WRM). From 1995 to 2014, WSS received approx-
      imately 57 percent of all water sector ODA commitments and 52 percent of nonconcessional
      financing from MDBs. This was consistent with the MDG focus on WSS. Irrigation and hydro-
      power made up most of the balance. WSS had a higher proportion of grants than loans (with
      31 percent provided through grants). In contrast, 82 percent of irrigation development
      finance came in the form of loans (both concessional and nonconcessional).
        In terms of geographic distribution, Sub-Saharan Africa and South and Central Asia have
      been the largest recipient regions of ODA for water over the 20-year period, with 29 percent
      and 25 percent of ODA respectively. More than 70 percent of the funds are channeled through
      the public sector and only 1 percent represent support through public-private partnerships.
      Funding has overwhelming supported projects: 91 percent versus 5 percent for core contri-
      butions and pooled programs, 3 percent for budget support, and 1 percent for technical
      assistance.
        The largest bilateral funders from 1995 to 2014 were Japan (with an average annual ODA
      contribution of $1.3 billion), Germany (averaging $711 million), and the United States (aver-
      aging $494 million). Other significant funders included France, the Netherlands, Spain, and
      the United Kingdom.
        ODF for the sector is mainly channelled via multilateral agencies, whose share of total
      flows has increased significantly since 2003. The largest multilateral funders were the
      World Bank Group, with its soft-lending window, IDA (the International Development
      Association), topping the list with $920 million per year on average between 1995 and 2014,
      and its “hard-lending” window, IBRD (the International Bank for Reconstruction and
      Development) committing an average of $1.86 billion per year in loans to middle-income
      and low-income countries. Other significant multilateral funders for ODA included the
      institutions of the European Union, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Funds, and
      the African Development Fund of the African Development Bank (AfDB). With respect to
      nonconcessional funding, IADB (Inter-American Development Bank) and ADB have played
      major roles, with $0.81 billion and $0.61 billion annual lending commitments over the 1995–
      2014 period.
        Nontrade guarantees from MDBs have been a relatively small portion of MDBs’ portfolios.
      Overall, the total cumulative commitment from 2000 to 2013 for guarantees was $37 billion,


xiv   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
or about 4.5 percent of the MDBs’ total lending. This number effectively doubled between
2004 and 2012/13, which is an encouraging trend. However, the vast majority of these guar-
antees were for the banking and financial services sector, with minimal use of this instru-
ment in the infrastructure sector. Unfortunately, no breakdown for water-related investments
is available. The World Bank is currently the MDB that makes the greatest use of guarantees.
It recently agreed to double its portfolio of guarantees from 2017 to 2020.
     While international climate finance has risen sharply, the water sector has captured only a
modest proportion of that funding to date.1 An analysis of seven of the major MDBs shows
that from 2011 to 2014 their annual commitments to climate finance varied between $23 bil-
lion and $28 billion (ADB et al. 2016). The World Bank and the European Investment Bank
have been the largest contributors. In 2015, seven MDBs committed $25 billion to climate
finance, of which 80 percent was for mitigation, with the remainder allocated to adaptation.
Of the amount assigned to adaptation finance, water and wastewater management received
27 percent of the financing, or $1.32 billion.
     This report identifies main challenges in the way development finance for the sector is
managed at present and offers recommendations. These are summarized in table ES.1.

xvi   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
Chapter 1   Introduction
            1.1. Report Objectives
            The main objective of this report is to provide data and insights on the role of grant funding
            and concessional financing in meeting the Sustainable Development Goal for water (SDG 6,
            known as the water SDG). These sources of funding are collectively referred to in this report
            as aid flows to the water sector. This report was prepared as an input into the High-Level
            Panel on Water.1
              Data analysis underlying the report was conducted using two main databases on aid to
            the water sector. The OECD Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) database is
            the most comprehensive, while the WASHfunders.org database provides complemen-
            tary data on aid from philanthropic organizations. 2 These databases were complemented
            by an inventory of the main institutions providing aid to the water sector and interviews
            with selected providers of aid to the water sector, including leading multilateral devel-
            opment banks (MDBs), bilateral donor agencies, and international nongovernmental
            organizations (NGOs). This analysis provides the basis for recommendations on how to
            improve the aid architecture to the water sector and mobilize financing to achieve the
            water SDG.


            1.2. Methodology and Data Sources
            The main data source used for aid flow data analysis is OECD/DAC’s Common Reporting
            System (CRS), which groups together all the major bilateral and multilateral development
            financing agencies. It is supported by the OECD Paris-based Secretariat, which collects stan-
            dardized data on flows of official development finance (ODF), as defined in box 1.1.
              Data on aid flows was collected for the entire water sector, based on the definition that
            underlines the water Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 6). The DAC database combines
            water and sanitation as well as water resource management into a single aggregate code,
            while agricultural water use, hydroelectric power, and flood protection are found under
            other aggregate codes. This report has disaggregated and reaggregated the data to relate
            flows more closely to the broad definition of the water sector that underlines SDG 6, to
            include water and sanitation services (WASH), water resources management (WRM), and
            other uses of water for agriculture, energy, and flood protection. Overall policy and admin-
            istrative management, which can be applied across these sectors, is also included as a sepa-
            rate subsector in the broader water sector.
              Data from the DAC database was extracted over a 20-year period, with a specific focus on
            commitments expressed in constant U.S. dollars pegged to 2014 values. Parts of this report
            conducted analysis based on shorter time scales, including subsectoral assessments, type of
            flows, and channels for ODA, to reflect when the DAC started tracking such data.




            Aid Flows to the Water Sector                                                               1
    Box 1.1.   Key Terms Used in this Report


    Water sector is defined in this report as the broad spectrum of water activities that relate to
    the Sustainable Development Goal for water (SDG 6), including water supply, sanitation and
    hygiene services (WASH), water resources management (WRM), irrigation, hydropower, and
    activities involved in water policy making, administration and management. Further
    information is provided in appendix A.

    Official development assistance (ODA) is defined by the OECD as grants and loans provided
    by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies
    on concessional terms. Loans are deemed to be concessional or “soft” by the OECD/DAC
    when they meet the concessionality criteria, which is that the financial flow contains a
    minimum grant element of 25 percent, calculated at a discount rate of 10 percent. This
    means that only loans from MDB’s “soft windows”— such as the World Bank Group’s
    International Development Association (IDA) or the African Development Bank Group’s
    African Development Fund (ADF)—count as ODA.

    Other official flows (OOF) are defined by the OECD as official sector transactions that do not
    meet ODA criteria. OOF include grants to developing countries for representational or
    essentially commercial purposes; official bilateral transactions intended to promote
    development, but that have a grant element of less than 25 percent; and official bilateral
    transactions, whatever their grant element, that are primarily aimed at facilitating exports.
    Multilateral development bank funding via nonconcessional or “hard” windows—such as the
    World Bank Group’s International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)—is also
    recorded as OOF.

    Official development finance (ODF) is defined by the OECD as the sum of bilateral ODA,
    concessional aid, and nonconcessional resources from multilateral sources, and bilateral OOFs
    made available for reasons unrelated to trade.

    Aid flows are defined in this report as the sum of ODF and grant financing from nonofficial
    sources, such as philanthropic organizations and NGOs. These are also referred to as
    “development finance.”




      The analysis covers all aspects of ODF, as defined by the OECD. All different types of grant
    funding and concessional financing (grants, soft loans, guarantees) are included in the
    ­
    analysis. In particular, information was gathered on other official flows (OOF), which cap-
    tures lending from multilateral development banks that is not “concessional” according to
    the OECD definition, even though such loans may be offered at below-­
                                                                        market rates.
      An additional data source, the WASHfunders.org database, was used to track nonofficial
    aid flows, and specifically philanthropic finance. WASHfunders.org describes itself as
    “a one stop shop for funding and needs-related data and information for donors, policy-
    makers, and other stakeholders interested in water, sanitation, and hygiene.” It was


2   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
developed by the Foundation Center, with seed funding from the Conrad N. Hilton
Foundation and additional support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the
Rockefeller Foundation, and the Howard G. Buffett Foundation. WASHfunders.org
aims  to facilitate better collaboration and more strategic decision making among
funders and seeks to raise awareness about water among donors. This database contains
data on philanthropic funding flows to the water sector from 2001. It considers a mix of
DAC and other unique codes with data provided using current dollars only, as reflected in
this report.
  Next, this study drew up a rapid inventory of the main institutions that actually or poten-
tially provide grants and concessional financing to the water sector. This helped identify
development banks, bilateral donors, international agencies, climate finance institutions,
philanthropic foundations, NGOs, and other institutions that offer knowledge and techni-
cal  support relevant to international water development. This inventory, presented in
appendix B, does not pretend to be comprehensive. However, it already includes more than
225 institutions that contribute financing, technical assistance, or both, to the water sector
in developing countries. The list includes close to 30 MDBs and six bilateral development
banks, 31 national aid agencies, 8 international organizations, 56 NGOs, 35 philanthropies,
and 14 climate investment funds. The list of philanthropies active in the water sector main-
tained by WASHfunders.org includes 479 organizations (not all of which have been included
in this study), to which should be added domestic NGOs or localities and local governments
in developed countries that contribute through decentralized cooperation mechanisms.
This wide array highlights the significant degree of fragmentation in terms of sources of
support to the sector.
  Out of this long list, 11 institutions were consulted to gain additional insights on their cur-
rent approaches to financing, existing constraints, and future strategies to meet the SDGs.
These institutions are all significant players in the sector and were selected to be representa-
tive of the three broad categories of institutions that provide aid to the sector, including
MDBs and agencies (ADB, AfDB, EIB, World Bank, UNICEF), bilateral development agencies
(AFD, DFID, SIDA, DGIS, USAID), and recipients of philanthropic investment (WaterAid).



1.3. Report Structure
The report starts by giving a global-level account of the scale of aid flows (chapter 2). It then
examines how this financing is allocated (chapter 3) and who provides development financ-
ing to the water sector (chapter 4). Key challenges for improving the use of such develop-
ment financing in the water sector are identified as a basis for formulating a set of key
recommendations for the development finance community (chapter 5).

Chapter 2   Aid to Water: How Much and What Type?

            This section provides a global-level account of the scale of aid flows and of the main financ-

            2.1. Official Development Finance for Water Has Tripled in the
            Last Decade
            The admonition in the Camdessus report to “double aid flows” to the sector in the next decade
            has been achieved. Shortly after the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were articu-
            lated, the World Panel on Financing Water Infrastructure (referred to as the  “Camdessus
            Panel,” after its chairman) was formed to identify what was needed to mobilize financing for
            investments and recurrent expenditure in the water sector. The panel presented its report to
            the 3rd World Water Forum (WWF) held in Kyoto, Japan (World Panel on Financing Water
            Infrastructure 2003). The report was one of the first comprehensive investigations into a
            wide range of financing options for water and sanitation. Its extensive list of recommenda-
            tions (90 in total) tackled the need for improved governance, tariff reforms, sector planning,
            and using tax funding for official development assistance (ODA) in a more catalytic way to
            ­
            facilitate more private finance. The report called for doubling all financial flows to the
            water sector from all sources, including official development finance and private finance.
              Official development finance (ODF) to water nearly tripled between 2003 and 2014, rising
            from an annual allocation of $6 billion in 2003 to close to $18 billion in 2014. This increase
            coincided with the implementation of the MDGs and the International Water Decade
            adopted by the United Nations, which ran from 2005 to 2015. It came against the backdrop
            of a previous decline in aid between 1995 and 2003, however. If considering the full 20-year
            period, ODF less than doubled, as it rose from $10 billion per year in 1995 to $18 billion in
            2014, after peaking at $20 billion in 2012.
              Such trends show that real efforts have been made by the global development finance
            ­
            community, which significantly helped the world meet the MDG for water. Yet now is not
            the time to relent on such efforts. The financing requirements associated with meeting the
            Sustainable Development Goal for water (SDG 6) are much greater than those associated with
            the MDG. They also span all aspects of the water sector, as opposed to focusing specifically on
            expanding access to water and sanitation services.

            the same level of concessionality. Given existing OECD procedures, the value of concessional

                                                     financing was less than $150,000 over the 20-year period, and was focused on water, sanita-
                                                     tion, and hygiene (WASH). Equity investments attracted $757 million over the 20-year
                                                     period, primarily allocated to WASH and hydroelectric power plants.

                                                     allocated to project-type interventions. For the remainder, 5 percent was allocated to core

                                                     to experts and technical assistance. Only a negligible amount was allocated for debt

Chapter 4   Who Provides Aid to the Water Sector?

            This section provides further insights on where aid to the water sector is coming from,
            focusing on the institutions that are leading in this area. There is no shortage of potential
            sources of finance for water in all its various forms, and there is great diversity and choice in
            what is being offered. The associated downside is the high level of fragmentation for aid
            flows to the sector, which can create difficulties in coordinating the overall aid effort, given
            differing approaches and priorities of different providers. From the perspective of aid recip-
            ients, this adds to the transaction costs of identifying and accessing aid sources, given that
            each of these sources has its own criteria and procedures.
              The overall picture of long-term growth in official development assistance (ODA) for water,
            with strong annual fluctuations (as presented in section 2) is confirmed by the experiences
            of individual donor agencies and multilateral development banks (MDBs). In both large and
            small institutions, “lumpy” investments can produce serious year-to-year fluctuations.
            However, certain long-term trends can be discerned, including the growth of multilateral
            funding to the sector.

            4.1. Funding via Bilaterals Accounts for the Bulk of ODA Funding to
            the Sector
            The 27 member countries of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development
            (OECD) that make up the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) group of funders con-
            tributed 66 percent of all ODA financing to the water sector over a 20-year period, from 1995
            to 2014.1 However, as multilaterals have stepped up their involvement, bilateral commit-
            ments as a share of total ODA commitments has reduced over the period, to reach 46 percent
            in 2014. The volume allocated via bilateral funders has remained fairly constant in the last
            decade, averaging around $6 billion per year. The top 10 DAC bilateral funders are ranked
            as  illustrated in table 4.1. The largest bilateral funders from 1995 to 2014 were Japan

                                                             A specific factor that has driven reductions in ODA for water for several European aid agen-
                                                           cies (DGIS, SIDA, etc.) in recent years is that parts of their overall aid budgets have been
                                                           reallocated to fund the settlement of migrants in their countries. All sectors, including water,
                                                           have been affected. In SIDA’s case, however, funding that had been assigned to migrants has

now been reallocated to the aid budget. SIDA’s commitment to provide ODA at the level of 1
percent of its gross national income (GNI) also helps protect the agency from fluctuations in
its budget.
  ODA commitments by the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Australia have been
growing over time, and the United Kingdom has become the second largest funder to the
water sector just after Japan in terms of its annual contribution. The water programs of
the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID) have benefitted from the “rising
tide lifts all boats” effect of the department’s push to meet the 0.7 percent target in the
International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act of 2015, which was
met in 2015. The Republic of Korea has also rapidly stepped up its contribution to the water
sector in the last few years and is now one of the top 10 contributors.
  Given the OECD’s current practice of counting concessional loans at face value, these con-
tributions are not strictly comparable. Some bilateral agencies (such as DGIS, SIDA, USAID,
and DFID) operate mainly with grants, while others provide almost exclusively concessional
loans. Agence Française de Développement (AFD), for example, provides 90 percent of its
finance for water via loans. AFD also uses debt relief under its “C2D” scheme (Contrat de
Désendettement et de Développement), whereby a portion of the recipient country’s sav-
ings in debt servicing is earmarked for water projects. In 2015, C2D funding amounted to
approximately 4 percent of all AFD’s aid for water.
  In the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Switzerland, water consumers are also able
to contribute to aid for overseas water development through small surcharges to their water
bills. In the United Kingdom, WaterAid obtains income from a small surcharge that water
consumers may opt to add to their water bills. In France, according to the Oudin-Santini Law
of 2005, municipalities are empowered to remit 1 percent of the proceeds of water bills to
fund the overseas water programs of French nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). This
has been a growing source of decentralized cooperation funding and technical assistance,
which the United Nations has sought to promote as a new source of funding to be tapped for
the sector.
  The inclusion of data from non-DAC funders into the OECD DAC database began in 2009.
Currently, 16 non-OECD donor countries report to this database.2 Data are sparse, with only
three funders reporting flows to the water sector between 2009 and 2014. Total contribu-
tions from non-DAC members accounted for less than 1 percent of total reported ODA com-
mitments to water over the period, however. The top two non-DAC funders were the United
Arab Emirates and Kuwait, which each made a $108.5 million average commitment between
2009 and 2014.

some Europe-based philanthropies are also recently included, such as the Stone Family
Foundation and the IKEA Foundation.
  NGOs can also be significant contributors to the sector, but no database exists at present
that tracks their specific contributions over time. Some of these NGOs, such as WaterAid,
receive contributions from the general public, which helps smooth out fluctuations in allo-
cations made by official agencies, such as DFID, in the case of WaterAid.

     4.4. Constraints and Challenges Faced by Providers of Development
     Finance
     Participants in the more detailed review undertaken for this study reported a number of
     constraints and challenges affecting their programs in responding to the SDGs, including:

     •	 A potential mismatch between the policies and priorities toward water adopted by
        agencies and the priorities of host/recipient/borrowing countries, which have ultimate
        ownership of their country programs. Some agencies limit the number of sectors for aid at
        the country level. Water may not be selected as one of these if there is limited appetite at
        the country level.

     •	 Institutional bottlenecks at the level of recipient countries, especially when financing
        goes through subsovereign layers of national administrations. This is a particular problem
        in irrigation.

     •	 A shortage of financially viable and “bankable” projects. This has long been identified as
        a critical constraint for increasing financing of all types to the water sector.

     •	 The length of time involved in preparing, implementing, and disbursing funds for water
        projects. Water is widely viewed as “messy” and “troublesome” compared with other
        infrastructure sectors. Loan officers have easier ways of meeting their lending targets in
        other sectors. Specific subsectors have their own problems. Hydropower and other multi-
        purpose dams entail major efforts of environmental and social compliance, which often
        deters potential sponsors. Irrigation, a major sector for ADB, has its own intractable
        problems.

     •	 The shortcomings of the current business model based on lending to individual projects.
        This approach may not be appropriate and may not yield the “deal flow” needed to meet
        the future investment requirements of water. Future projects may need to be based on
        broad geographical and hydrological systems such as river basins or urban areas.

     •	 The need for cross-sectoral collaboration, for example, to work out the operational impli-
        cations of the energy/water/food nexus. This requires working across sectoral lines, which
        is often difficult, at the level of both the provider and the recipient of aid flows.

       A number of these reported issues are taken up in recommendations in the next section.

24   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
Chapter 5   Main Challenges and Recommendations

            This section identifies key challenges faced by providers of development financing for water
            and formulates recommendations to address them. These challenges will need to be
            addressed to improve the effectiveness of financing flows provided by development institu-
            tions to the water sector going forward and support the achievement of the Sustainable
            Development Goals (SDGs). A key objective would be to ensure that concessional finance is
            used in a more catalytic manner to leverage commercial finance. Challenges and recommen-
            dations are summarized in table 5.1.


            5.1. Increase Volumes of Aid to the Water Sector
            Main challenges
            Although development financing to the water sector has increased significantly over the
            last two decades, it has not kept up with increases in development financing to other ­sectors.
            Contributions from bilateral donors are at the mercy of political imperatives, in a context
            where there is significant competition over resources. Multilaterals have increased lending
            to the sector, both through their concessional and nonconcessional windows, but will need
            access to grant funding to maintain the concessionality of their lending going forward.
            Philanthropies, despite a good start, have recently slowed down their involvement.

            Recommendations
            Grants and concessional loans will remain important for creating the infrastructure and ser-
            vices necessary to meet the SDGs. These flows will need to be higher, more reliable from
            year to year, and better targeted to countries, population groups, and delivery models that
            promise maximum impact for scarce aid resources. The water sector would benefit from
            having larger and more reliable funding levels in future years. Doing so will call for continu-
            ing to increase the profile of water as a tool for addressing most major development
            issues, including climate change, food security, urban development, disaster risk manage-
            ment, environment, gender equality, health, and energy. Investing in water should therefore
            be seen as a critical ingredient for achieving all the SDGs, not only the water SDG.
              The role of existing platforms to catalyze political leadership in the sector, such as
            Sanitation and Water for All (SWA), should be bolstered. SWA is a global multistakeholder
            partnership to catalyze political leadership and improve accountability to achieve a sustain-
            able vision of sanitation, water, and hygiene for all. Through its working groups, it has
            defined four main “collaborative behaviors” for aid providers and aid recipients alike. It is
            also working on harmonizing monitoring, in addition to its main activities to sensitize
            key policymakers (sector ministers and finance ministers) about the needs of the water and
            sanitation sector. Similar platforms may be needed for the water sector at large, including
                                              management (WRM).

       Donor agencies should offer flexibility to their recipients in the choice between an outright
     grant and wrapping the same grant element into a concessional loan. Although many bilat-
     eral agencies operate mainly with grants, some make active use of soft loans, and others are
     considering greater use of soft loans. While the pressure to move from grants to soft loans is
     real, the type of funding required should be tailored to the country context, the potential
     implementation agencies, and the particulars of the use of funds. A “one-size-fits-all”
     approach may not be the best mechanism as the sector evolves from significant grant financ-
     ing to more commercial borrowing.


     5.2. Better Align Aid Financing Strategies with the Water SDG Challenges
     Main challenges
     Up to this point, the vast majority of aid flows for water have been provided to increase
     access to water and sanitation services. The adoption of the water SDG, which has a much
     broader scope than the water and sanitation MDGs, will call for reconsidering the balance of
     development financing between the water subsectors. Agencies have responded in various
     ways to the United Nation’s adoption of the SDGs in 2015. In most cases, agencies’ responses
     so far amount to a reinforcement of existing programs rather than radical new plans, though
     several agencies are preparing new strategies, which will be adopted soon. In many fund-
     ing agencies, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and other water subsectors are dealt
     with by different departments, and are reported under different expenditure lines. This can
     create silos, whereby strategies and operations for the different components of the water
     sector are planned in isolation of one another. MDBs can mobilize large amounts of both
     ­market-based and concessional financing for major infrastructure, including irrigation, mul-
     tipurpose dams, and coastal and flood protection. As a result, they have been more engaged
     in financing all aspects of the water sector than some of the leading bilateral agencies.
       Adoption of the SDGs has overlapped or coincided with major reorganisations in key mul-
     tilateral development banks (MDBs)—some of which preceded 2015. For example, the World
     Bank’s creation of the Water Global Practice in 2014 was an institutional response to the
     cross-cutting nature of water, which also better equips the Bank to respond to the several
     other SDGs in which water features. This global practice operates under a single management
     line and deals with the majority of water-related investments made by the World Bank, and
     reports them in a coherent manner. However, within the World Bank, a substantial percent-
     age of water-related investments are still managed by other practices (such as for agriculture
     and urban development). This is typical of other MDBs, as well. The new “High5” strategy of
     the African Development Bank (AfDB) groups the Bank’s programs thematically, with WASH,
     hydropower, and irrigation falling in separate thematic categories. AfDB places WASH in the
     “Quality of Life” program, while irrigation and hydropower fall in “Feed Africa” and “Light
     Up and Power Africa,” respectively. The Asian Development Bank (ADB), after a recent
     ­
     reorganization, places urban water in its Urban Development Division, in recognition of
     the overriding importance of urbanization in driving Asia’s water infrastructure needs.

26   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
  By contrast, most of the bilateral agencies reviewed in this study tend to focus mainly on
WASH, with other subsectors occupying a minor role in their portfolios. There are some
notable exceptions: certain bilateral agencies have a strong tradition of expertise in aspects
of WRM (for example, DGIS in flood protection and coastal zone management, and SIDA in
transboundary water management).

Recommendations
Increasing the level of financing for water subsectors other than WASH will be necessary, but
will likely be challenging. Funding WRM, developing the bulk infrastructure to supply water
to all users, and adapting irrigation systems all pose serious financial challenges. The magni-
tude of these financing challenges is not yet fully understood, partly because more emphasis
was placed on the WASH sector during the MDG era. Going forward, estimating the financing
needs of these other subsectors and identifying where development finance can play the
most catalytic role will be necessary.
  Financing for water above and beyond WASH will likely need to be bolstered in both bilateral
agencies and the MDBs. The case for investment in water security needs to be made much more
strongly, linking it to the SDGs and to adaptation to climate change. Such focus will be needed
to properly reflect the future pressure on water resources and the risks from climate change and
variability. The specific financing challenges of WRM, multipurpose infrastructure, irrigation,
and other water subsectors need to be acknowledged, and agencies need to be resourced to deal
with these. Ideally, this will be achieved without diminishing the very real investment needs to
                                                                 ­ nyone behind.
achieve universal coverage for WASH services and without leaving a
  Targeting of aid to the water sector could also be improved. While all agencies are commit-
ted to targeting populations whose water needs are most serious, the process of allocating
aid to water, or any other specific sector, is the product of various factors, which in combina-
tion can distort rational choices and frustrate “ideal” distributions. The choice of focus
countries for aid tends to be the result of political and historical factors. The priority each
agency gives to water is another complicating variable. Furthermore, a number of countries
with the greatest claim for aid (fragile and conflict-ridden states) are difficult for external
agencies to operate in, which increases risks when trying to deliver results. These difficulties
will need to be overcome to deliver on the SDG challenge to “leave no one behind.” The
explicit identification of priority countries, either by individual agencies or jointly by the
global community of water sector financiers, together with cofinancing and improved coop-
eration among agencies, will facilitate the achievement of such a goal.



5.3. Mobilize Additional Climate Finance
Main challenges
In recent years, new climate funds have been created, and existing MDBs and agencies
have adapted their programs to give increased support to climate resilience. However,
climate finance is currently dominated by the mitigation agenda, in which renewable

     tion—has attracted only minimal climate finance so far. For example, in 2015, seven MDBs
     committed $25 billion to climate finance, of which 80 percent was for mitigation, with the
     remaining balance allocated to adaptation. Of the amount assigned to adaptation finance,
     water and wastewater management received 27 percent of the financing, or $1.32 billion.

     Recommendations
     Sponsors of water projects and promoters of climate funds should redouble their efforts to
     increase water’s share of climate finance. Building climate resilience will need to become a
     significant driver for water investments, particularly for non-WASH investments. The water
     sector should therefore increase its rightful share of adaptation funding, to support the con-
     struction of new resilient infrastructure and services and retrofit existing structures.
       Water should also attract a much larger share of mitigation finance, given that the trans-
     port, distribution, treatment, and disposal of water are all energy intensive. Specific invest-
     ments, such as promoting energy efficiency in the water sector, loss reduction, the recovery
     of energy and heat from wastewater, as well as other activities with an impact on climate
     mitigation should attract a greater share of climate mitigation funding.
       The rise of climate finance as a category may create issues for tracking water finance, and
     introduces the risk of double-counting. Water is often a component of multisector (“inte-
     grated”) projects, and as such may get lost in another category, such as environment, agri-
     culture, or energy. With increased emphasis on climate finance, water projects may be
     “rebranded” in the future as “climate resilient” in order to meet agencies’ declared targets,
     which could result in an apparent decline in finance for “pure” water projects. There is also
     a risk of double-counting projects in both “water” and “climate resilient” categories.


     5.4. Address Fragmentation of Aid Flows to Water
     Main challenges
     There is a high level of fragmentation of aid flows to the water sector, with more than 200
     leading organizations providing funding to the sector. This increases the costs to individual
     agencies for project preparation and monitoring and can lead to wasted resources.
     To  address this well-known issue, bilateral and multilateral agencies are currently using
     several strategies. It will be important to draw lessons from those strategies going forward.
       Some bilateral agencies (SIDA, DFID, and DGIS) make substantial contributions to special-
     ized multilateral bodies (UNICEF, or WaterAid in the United Kingdom) as part of their deliv-
     ery of commitments to MDGs/SDGs. These specialized international agencies can offer well
     established programs and expertise, reaching into countries and situations that would be
     difficult to access for bilateral official agencies, especially those with limited resources.


28   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
  Many agencies practice cofinancing to some degree, where this includes seeking contribu-
tions from the domestic finances of the borrowing/host country as well as contributions from
other lenders and donors. One of the motives of cofinancing is to minimize the burden on aid
recipients and borrowers from the existence of a number of different bureaucratic processes
involved in having several different sources of the same aid or loan. There are also potential
savings for donors and lenders from having a division of labor and a single set of procedures.
For example, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has a long-standing policy of funding a
maximum of 50 percent of total project cost, and typically less than this. Leading European
development banks (EIB, AFD, and KFW) have signed up to the Mutual Reliance Initiative,
under which lead financiers are agreed for each project, and the other financiers abide by the
appraisals, due diligence, and procurement practices set by the lead agency. This coordina-
tion modality has been used in a number of water projects, combined with grants for project
preparation and institutional development from the European Union (EU). In addition, both
the World Bank and ADB are actively exploring the potential for cofinancing projects in sev-
eral countries with the newly established Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
  Combining public sources of grants and loans has been in widespread use for some time by
the institutions of the EU.1 For example, most of EIB’s loans to African, Caribbean, and Pacific
(ACP) countries are made in conjunction with European Commission (EC) grants to soften
the overall loan terms. The EIB, jointly with the EC, operates several facilities to combine
loans and grants, such as the Neighbourhood Investment Facility, the ACP/EU Water Facility,
and the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (EU-AITF). The African Development Bank’s
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) is also a large-scale example of a
multidonor platform, which channels disparate kinds of funding from several sources, and
whose programs target off-track and fragile states.
  For individual projects, blending funds from different sources, with different terms, is an
increasingly common feature of project finance, especially for large and complex infrastruc-
ture ventures with a number of different components, each needing specific types of finance.
The financing package for the Nam Theun 2 Dam in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, a
public-private partnership sponsored by the World Bank, ADB, and AFD, involved funding
from 27 different sources (though this is an extreme case, and normally many fewer funders
would be involved).


Recommendations
Mechanisms to cofinance projects and blend loans and grants should become much more
widespread and operate at scale. Although these platforms exist, cofinancing of projects to
share risk, reduce transaction costs, and use different types of funding for different purposes
should be increased. This will call for sharing information on projects under preparation and
for the development of standard procedures applicable across funders.
  Further analysis of facilities that combine grants and loans should be conducted, with a
view to removing constraints and identifying facilities with opportunities for expansion.


Aid Flows to the Water Sector                                                                29
     There is growing experience with the blending of concessional aid with commercial finance.
     Much of this happens at a project level, but there are also permanent blending facilities
     (“platforms”) such as in the EU aid institutions and the AfDB. Some of these have not been
     as widely used as anticipated because of various factors, including restrictive eligibility
     rules. Further research on these facilities would be useful.
       International providers of development finance should also support domestic providers
     of development finance, such as national development banks or water-specific financing
     facilities. From the viewpoint of financing water, there is a place for both dedicated and
     general purpose financing facilities. Water is currently largely financed by institutions
     with a broad remit to support a range of infrastructure and other sectors, and water is
     often marginalized within these. This can be true both for international development
     finance institutions and domestic ones. General purpose banks and funds should take
     specific steps to avoid marginalizing water, by setting targets or quotas for this sector, for
     example. Specialized water institutions, with professional and financial resources
     targeted solely to water matters, may in some cases stand a better chance of delivering
     the required funding for this sector (as the African Water Facility [AWF] is doing at the
     international level, for example, in the area of project preparation). On this basis, DGIS of
     the Netherlands is promoting the establishment of dedicated water financing facilities at
     both the national and international level, based on its experience with water banks in the
     Netherlands.


     5.5. Support Upstream Reforms and Better Project Preparation
     Main challenges
     A common challenge with water financing that has been cited over the years is the lack of
     “bankable projects.” One common response has been to assign more funding to project
     preparation and to set up project preparation facilities (PPFs) to increase the availability of
     sound, “bankable” projects.
       There is already a plethora of PPFs, some of them under-used. Each tends to have its own
     rules of eligibility and access, and the different procedures involved can inhibit their usage.
     The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa hosts a Project Preparation Facilities Network,
     containing, among others, IFC, DBSA, AWF, EWF, ADB’s WFPF, the World Bank, and the
     PIDG suite of facilities. Most MDBs have access to PPFs or have them in-house and are look-
     ing to increase their effectiveness. For example, ADB is taking steps to increase the effective-
     ness of its internal facilities for project preparation. One approach being taken by ADB is to
     provide technical assistance for a cluster of individual projects. Another is to finance project
     preparation and design through loans, as an incentive to the borrower to increase its com-
     mitment to implementation and reduce delays in the pipeline.
       In the AfDB, the AWF is an in-house PPF focused on the water sector that has demon-
     strated a high capacity for leveraging public and private investment. It claims to have gener-
     ated 40 euros in leveraged investment for every 1 euro invested, which has helped it earn the


30   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
accolade of “PPF of the Year” in Africa for 2015. The vast majority of this leveraged funding
came from other public financiers, such as the AfDB or other bilateral and MDBs. Despite
some early successes, the Facility has had difficulties in increasing its pipeline of bankable
projects and in mobilizing grant funding to fund its activities.
  Some of the key lessons emerging from the use of existing PPFs include

•	 In-house PPFs have a greater chance of being effectively used than external ones because
  they are more closely linked to operations.

•	 Capacity building is needed throughout all stages of project development and financing,
  but this is typically overlooked and unaccounted for.

•	 PPFs dedicated solely to water are more likely to promote water projects than multisec-
  toral facilities.

  Going beyond establishing the viability of a water project, all agencies recognize the
importance of strengthening the financial viability of service providers, in order to promote
efficient operation and sustainable funding. Only a limited number of development agencies
are actively working on specifically addressing such issues, however. Solutions for improv-
ing the financial viability of water service providers are well known, but are nonetheless
elusive. They include approaches to enhance revenues, such as tariff reforms, improved
billing and collections, greater internal efficiency and cost controls, reduced waste and
losses, and greater customer orientation. USAID’s Sustainable Water and Sanitation in Africa
(SUWASA) program specifically aimed to increase the financial viability of water utilities in
nine Sub-Saharan African countries through regulatory reform, better pricing and billing,
improved service efficiency, and creating access to private finance. USAID’s new program
(WASH-FIN) aims to continue the theme of promoting sustainable business models and
proven commercial approaches. The World Bank Water Global Practice is also actively work-
ing on developing utility turnaround strategies, in the context of broader approaches to
institutional development.


Recommendations
More donor attention and financing is needed to create viable project pipelines that can
attract additional financing of different types, including concessional, nonconcessional, and
commercial finance. Project preparation facilities (PPFs) can play an important role in this
regard, but priority for funding should be given to funds and PPFs with a good track record.
  Donors and MDBs should also ensure adequate funding for “upstream” policy and institu-
tional capacity building alongside support for project preparation funds. This will require
grant funding so as to lay the basis for stronger service providers, which in turn can build,
operate, and maintain more sustainable infrastructure.
  More attention needs to be paid to the underlying foundational issues of operational effi-
ciency and governance and regulatory transparency to improve creditworthiness. While
project preparation funds are important to boost the “deal flow” in water, the ultimate


Aid Flows to the Water Sector                                                              31
     bottleneck remains the poor financial viability of most public water sponsors and the
     projects they put forward. This is the primary cause of the limited reach of both conces-
     sional and commercial financing, and it is one of the key reasons why public-private
     partnerships in the water sector have been limited.
       Donors and MDBs have a critical role in providing technical assistance to improve the
     efficiency of service providers in order to create a cash flow for attracting repayable
     finance. One approach is to partner utilities with their peers; examples include ADB’s
     Water Operators Partnership and the African Water Utilities Partnership. Challenge funds
     (such as Dreampipe, funded by DFID) also have a role in promoting technical innovation,
     such as innovative finance for the reduction of non-revenue water losses. In the context of
     promoting efficiency, output-based aid can motivate speedy and efficient implementation
     by local providers, and reduce risks for local banks. This option has been extensively
     ­promoted by the World Bank through its Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA)
     facility.


     5.6. Use Development Finance More Effectively to Catalyze Private Finance
     Main challenges
     All agencies support the use of grants and concessional loans in principle to “crowd in”
     private finance to maximize the total financing brought in by official interventions. However,
     the risk of aid “crowding out” private flows is real, and was emphasized by practitioners
     interviewed for this study. Subsidized finance is too readily available from public sources.
     This risks substituting public funds for potential private finance in project financing
     structures. A further, overriding consideration stressed by some agencies is the risk of
     encouraging unsustainable debt accumulation in borrowing countries, particularly debt
     denominated in foreign currency. Leveraging domestic commercial finance could help
     address such challenges.
       A number of leveraging instruments exist, offered by both multilateral and bilateral aid
     donors. Some financial institutions offer financial guarantees to reduce the risk associated
     with investing in a water service provider (or project) and attract commercial finance.
     Despite the fact that guarantee instruments are available, practitioners report minor use of
     these guarantee instruments in the water sector. Additional findings on the use of financial
     guarantees in general and in the water sector are provided in appendix D.
       Another lever is the offer of equity (risk capital) to enable an institution or project author-
     ity to raise debt finance. Equity, especially the “patient” kind, is often the scarce factor in
     project financing. A number of bilateral and multilateral agencies (IFC, EIB, OPIC, CDC, AFD,
     and others listed in appendix B) can offer equity finance to institutions and projects to pro-
     vide a sound capital structure to enable the institution or project vehicle concerned to attract
     sufficient repayable finance. Some agencies (such as EIB) have the flexibility of converting
     loans into equity (risk capital) mid-project when the circumstances are appropriate, and
     have used this option in their water lending.


32   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
Recommendations
Concessional financing and grants should, to the greatest extent possible, be used to “crowd
in” other forms of finance for the sector, including commercial financing, through the use of
blended financial packages (combining concessional and commercial lending), guarantees,
and equity participations. This requires looking closely at the delivery models and technol-
ogies being used so that aid can be used to support sustainably run, public or privately
managed service providers. A recent report (Leigland, Trémolet, and Ikeda 2016) noted that
concessional financing would not be sufficient to fill the financing gap to reach the water
SDG and outlined the many potential benefits of leveraging commercial finance for the sec-
tor. Given the limited use of guarantees and other forms of credit enhancement mechanisms
in the sector, this report advocated a more tailored approach to the use of guarantees in the
sector depending on local financial market circumstances. It also advocated educating
financiers and borrowers on their use.
  MDBs should explore opportunities for increasing the use of guarantees and set targets to
increase their use (Ahluwalia, Summers, and Velasco 2016). Many MDBs and a number of
bilateral agencies offer guarantees and other risk-sharing products to improve the credit
standing of borrowers to enable them to attract more commercial finance. In general, the
uptake of these facilities has not been as large as initially anticipated. Moreover, relatively
few transactions have been done for water. Donors should indicate the feasibility of expand-
ing their loan guarantee products and identify the internal policy changes and other practical
measures needed to realize this goal.
  The role and use of credit enhancements supporting commercial finance should be inte-
grated in approaches to leverage commercial finance. There is no single approach to leverage
concessional finance or catalyze commercial finance. Each potential transaction must
accommodate a series of unique factors that make every potential project distinctive. More
focus is needed on evaluating the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. Enhancement
tools such as insurance and guarantees need to be more strategically used to improve the
viability of projects seeking to attract commercial finance.



5.7. Increase the Focus on Results
Main challenges
Nearly all agencies make estimations of the populations gaining access to WASH services
as an outcome of their programs and update these estimates annually. USAID is required
to do this by the Paul Simon Water for the World Act 2014 (OCW 2014) and other agencies
include these data in their annual reports. DGIS is starting to apply a “sustainability”
criterion to its programs, which means that it only includes systems that are independently
assessed as likely to last 15 years or more. However, the extent to which a results-­
orientation drives implementation and, ultimately results, varies quite considerably
within the sector.


Aid Flows to the Water Sector                                                               33
       There is a long and checkered history of donor agencies and MDBs attaching conditions
     (such as tariff covenants) to their lending programs for urban water, irrigation, hydropower,
     and other sectors. A succession of evaluation reports shows the challenges of enforcing
     politically difficult conditions on unwilling partners.
       This is the background to the rise of policy lending, in which agencies use their
     resources in a “systemic” manner to influence policy and institutional reforms across a
     broad front, taking a sufficiently long view of the reform process. This tends to be most
     effective for MDBs that are able to offer large financial packages, often in multiyear
     tranches. The World Bank has a number of such policy loans in water, which have been
     developed as Program for Results financing (PforR). ADB also has water policy loans in
     Armenia and India. Those in India aim at building capacity of government in financial
     management. ADB takes a long-term approach, often through 10-year multiyear tranche
     facilities to the relevant executing agency. In such vehicles, the achievement of policy
                governed by the capacity of the subsovereign body concerned (such as state
     reforms is ­
     irrigation agencies). Bilateral agencies such as DFID are also increasingly placing empha-
     sis on linking payment to results. DFID has selected competitively a number of large
     NGOs to implement WASH sector investments at scale, and links remuneration to the
     achievement of specific results.

     Recommendations
     Aid financing should to be linked to results to the extent possible. The use of policy lending
     instruments should be increased in the water sector, so as to emphasize the link between
     upstream policy reforms and improved results delivery.


     5.8. Improve the Tracking of Aid for Water and Exchange Information
     Main challenges
     Individual agencies do track their own results, but seldom evaluate their results and the
     costs of delivering such results in a systematic manner. DFID recently commissioned an
     analysis of the “value for money” of its water investments and is looking to apply such a
     methodology to the organizations that it funds. However, lack of reliable output and out-
     come data limited the usefulness of this assessment.
       The adoption of the SDGs and the growing realization of the need to support sustainabil-
     ity, build resilience, and strengthen institutions beyond delivering results on the ground will
     call for different approaches to results reporting. Some multilateral agencies such as the
     World Bank are in the process of adopting a multilayered results-tracking framework to track
     the impact that their investments are making on strengthening institutions or fostering
     inclusion in the water sector at large. Some of the reporting formats used by some agencies
     (including USAID and AFD) already provide a coherent presentation of all aspects related to
     the water sector (USAID 2015; AFD 2016). Some agencies (such as USAID) are preparing to
     report performance against new SDG metrics, although such metrics still need to be fully


34   Aid Flows to the Water Sector
agreed and defined by the international community. ADB reported annually on its progress
toward meeting the MDGs, and its last such report will be in 2016. Thereafter, it will report
on progress toward the SDGs, for which it is in discussion with the Global Water Partnership
for program support.
  Tracking of aid flows to the water sector is currently fragmented, which makes it difficult
to build an overall picture of how much aid is provided, by whom, and in what form, and to
understand where it is going and what for. Reviews of aid flows to the water sector are con-
ducted on a fairly regular basis by the OECD DAC, but such reviews do not involve the financ-
ing institutions, and therefore have a somewhat limited impact. Ad hoc reviews are also
conducted by NGOs such as WaterAid (WaterAid 2015) or by the World Health Organization/
Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS), which conducts
a survey of external support agencies every two years, in the context of the more extensive
GLAAS survey exercise targeted at recipient countries. These reviews have remained factual
but there is no forum to ensure that recommendations of such reviews are taken up for
improving aid delivery to the water sector. In addition, all such reviews have tended to focus
on the WASH sector, rather than the water sector.


Recommendations
Donor agencies and MDBs should move toward reporting their commitments and disburse-
ments across all water subsectors, not just WASH, so as to present a coherent overall picture
of the full breadth of investments needed for progress toward SDG 6. Agencies should agree
on the performance metrics for the SDGs and report annually on their progress toward
achieving them.
  Improvements in the manner in which concessional aid is measured and reported is
important in order to provide more accurate peer group comparisons, as well as to provide
stronger incentives for diversifying aid instruments that are better suited to actual
challenges. In particular, the treatment of guarantees will need to be reformed. Guarantees
­
are not routinely reported by the OECD’s DAC database at present. As a result, donor coun-
tries using these instruments do not receive due recognition for their “aid effort” (the
opportunity cost of providing the guarantee). Governments and agencies should fully sup-
port and feed into the new DAC initiative to systematically collect data on concessional aid
using the TOSSD (total official support for sustainable development) concept, which
includes guarantees and other risk-sharing products, as described in box 5.1.
  Finally, development finance agencies should consider the need for increased collabora-
tion in terms of consolidated sector reporting on aid flows to the sector. Multiple initiatives
have emerged in the area of climate finance reporting, which include the drafting of shared
methodologies and the publication of joint reports by development finance agencies.
Adopting such an approach in the water sector would facilitate joint understanding of trends
and agreement on future priorities.
  Table 5.1 below summarizes the main challenges and associated recommendations.


Aid Flows to the Water Sector                                                               35
     Box 5.1. Total Official Support for Sustainable Development: A New Concept for
     Measuring Aid


     Ministers of the member countries of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) agreed in
     December 2014 to carry out analytical work and consult broadly across the international com-
     munity to develop a new measurement framework to incentivize development finance from a
     wide variety of sources and actors in support of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals
     (SDGs). To this end, the new framework, provisionally entitled Total Official Support for Sus-
     tainable Development (TOSSD), would expand the current scope of statistical monitoring to
     include resources “beyond ODA” (official development assistance), including nonconcessional
     development finance and international public finance that leverages private resources through
     blending operations, risk mitigation schemes, and equity stakes. TOSSD could also include
     private finance that is invested along with and mobilized by official development finance
     interventions in developing countries. The full proposals for framing TOSSD are still under
     development.

                                                           •	 Undertake more collaborative and more regular “aid

Note: MDBs = multilateral development banks; SDGs = sustainable development goals; TOSSD = total official support for
sustainable development; WASH = water, sanitation, and hygiene.




Note
   European institutions refer to this practice as “blending.” However, in this report, the term “blending” is used as per the
1. 
     OECD definition, where blending consists of using concessional financing to catalyze commercial financing (WEF/OECD
     2015).

                                                    A recent report from the Climate Policy Initiative notes that “after levelling off in 2012, and declin-
                                                    ing in 2013, the amount of climate finance invested around the world in 2014 increased by 18%,
                                                    from $331 billion to an estimated $391 billion. Public climate finance is on the rise, with contribu-

                                                    from 2013 levels” (Buchner et al. 2015, 1). Development finance institutions committed
                                                         billion to climate finance in 2014, of which international agencies contributed $64 billion.

                                                       A report by seven of the major multilateral development banks shows that from 2011 to
                                                    2014, their total annual commitments to climate finance varied between $23 billion and
                                                    $28 billion, with no clear trend (ADB et al. 2016). This report was the fifth edition of a joint

                                             A number of climate funds use public financial resources to attract additional funds from

                                             climate-resilient and low-carbon development. However, a recent assessment of multilat-

                                               Estimates have been made of the additional funds raised in 2015 associated with the MDB’s
                                             own climate finance commitments. A methodology for these estimates was agreed by mem-
                                             bers of the International Development Finance Club (IDFC), which is a group of develop-
                                             ment banks of national and sub-regional origin spread across regions around the world with
                                             combined lending commitments of USD 636 billion in 2014. Additional funds come from

Box C .1.   Climate Finance Facilities within the World Bank Group


Within the World Bank Group, 15 climate-financing sources support climate change mitiga-
tion, adaptation, and disaster risk and resilience activities. These include the World Bank as an
implementing agency for international financing mechanisms such as the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), Green Climate Fund (GCF), and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), as well as
dedicated trust funds managed by the World Bank.

These funds provide grants and concessional financing to World Bank client-countries. Of
these, six identify mitigation and adaptation-related activities in the water sector to be eligi-
ble for financing. The major funding sources for climate change-related water sector projects
in the World Bank are the CIF funding window’s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR)
and Strategic Climate Fund (SCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), Special Climate
Change Fund (SCCF), Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF), and the Global Fund for Disaster
Recovery and Resilience (GFDRR). Within the water sector, examples of mitigation and adap-
tation projects include renewable energy and energy efficiency in water systems, wastewater
treatment, early warning systems, and groundwater and river basin management.




other MDBs, IDFC members, other international and domestic public sources, and private
funders. This group estimated that additional amounts from co-funding totaled $66.2 billion
in 2015 (ADB et al. 2016, 26).


Mobilizing Climate Finance: Prospects for the Water Sector
Current flows of climate finance from development agencies are still relatively small com-
pared to total concessional flows, but are set to rise. A number of MDBs have committed to
major increases in climate financing by 2020 in both absolute terms and relative to their
overall lending (ADB et al. 2016).
   The majority of these funds is committed to climate change mitigation; the share of water
is minor. However, the share of water is much larger for adaptation finance, which is likely
to become more important in both relative and absolute terms. Even for mitigation finance,
water projects are likely to gain ground relative to renewable energy and transport projects,
which currently dominate lending portfolios. This is particularly likely for energy efficiency
in water transmission and distribution, or energy and heat recovery from wastewater
treatment.

Appendix D   Trends in the Use of Financial Guarantees and
             Implications for the Water Sector

             Financial guarantees offered by external agents to promote development in the recipient or
             beneficiary country are not adequately measured or reported in international databases at
             present.1 There are both conceptual and practical reasons for this omission. The basis of the
             Development Assistance Committee (DAC) reporting system is actual financial flows,
             whereas guarantees represent a contingent liability to the guarantor, which may or may not
             result in an actual transfer. Until the guarantee is called upon to meet a loss, the “effort” or
             “sacrifice” it represents to the guarantor is difficult to measure, depending on the risk and
             likelihood of default, which is often subjective.
               A recent analysis of non-trade guarantees extended by a group of leading multinational
             development agencies (ADB, AfDB, IADB, IBRD, IDA, IFC, and MIGA) indicates a cumula-
             tive commitment over the period from 2001 to 2013 of $37 billion, which is equivalent to
             4.5 percent of total lending approved by these institutions (Humphrey and Prizzon 2014).
             The total annual volume of these guarantees rose over the period, from less than $2 billion
             in 2004 to more than $4 billion in 2012 and 2013, although such growth slowed down consid-
             erably in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis.


             Current Use of Financial Guarantees
             Recent surveys by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
             (OECD) have thrown light on the size of development guarantees extended by DAC donor
             governments and international financial institutions (IFIs) (Mirabile, Benn, and
             Sangaré  2013; Halvorsen-Quevedo and Mirabile 2014). The first survey showed that
             these instruments mobilized $15.3  billion from the private sector from 2009 to 2011.
             The  scale of resources mobilized through these guarantee schemes was modest in
             the  wider picture of development finance: in 2011, this was equivalent to 12 percent
             of  total country-programmable aid and less than 1 percent of international private
             financial flows. Guarantees were mainly used for banking and financial services.
             ­
             Infrastructure as a whole accounted for only $1.2 billion of the total for the survey
             period. There was no further disaggregation within this category to identify water proj-
             ects, but these amounts were likely very small by comparison with other infrastructure
             services.
               According to this OECD survey, 50 percent of the total amounts were mobilized by
             ­
             multilateral agencies, mostly by the World Bank’s MIGA, IBRD, and IFC, and the Islamic
             and African Development Banks. The most active bilateral users of guarantees were the
             United States (USAID/OPIC), France (AFD/PROPARCO), Austria, and Finland. The Private

     Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) was also active through its GuarantCo
     facility.
       A more recent OECD/DAC survey (Benn et al. 2016) updated these results and included
     syndicated loans and shares in collective investment vehicles (entities that allow inves-
     tors to pool their money and jointly invest in a portfolio of companies), as well as financial
     guarantees. The results are presented in table D.1.
       Over the three-year period for the survey (2012–14), the main multilateral providers of
     guarantees (by amounts mobilized) were MIGA, AFDB, PIDG, ADB and EBRD. The main
     bilateral suppliers were OPIC and USAID (United States), AFD (France), and SIDA (Sweden).
     The main recipients of guarantees were Turkey, Serbia, Pakistan, Côte d’Ivoire, Chile, Ghana,
     Jordan, Angola, Vietnam, Panama, Kenya, Nigeria, Cameroon and South Africa. PIDG, a
     donor-financed group formed to help overcome the obstacles to private sector involvement
     in infrastructure development in developing countries, has developed a suite of products to
     stimulate private sector participation in infrastructure, including through setting up
     GuarantCo, which guarantees local currency finance. This facility has not been very active in
     the water sector, however.
       Amongst the bilateral agencies, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)
     has made extensive use of political risk insurance, while in 2012–14, the U.S. Development
     Credit Authority (DCA) mobilized the largest amount of private finance by using financial
     guarantees, followed by AFD and SIDA. Between 1999 and 2014, DCA has used its 50 percent
     partial credit guarantee in 14 water transactions, leveraging over $194 million of private cap-
     ital. Its transactions have included partial credit guarantees for loans, pooled municipal
     bonds and microfinance. Despite these successes, water accounts for only a small part of
     DCA’s overall portfolio. SIDA has taken a step towards mainstreaming blending in its
     announcement of the formation of a Grant-Based Facility to fund infrastructure. The Facility
     targets climate and environmental programmers, including water and wastewater, and
     offers varying proportions of grant in conjunction with commercial loans from banks or
     other finance corporations. The Facility is supported by a tailored technical assistance
     program.
                                                                                   preferred
       Through syndicated loans, multilateral development banks (MDBs) share their ­
     creditor status with commercial lenders, typically with an “A and B loan” structure. In
     2012–14, syndications totaled $8.4 billion. The largest users (by amounts mobilized)

among international financial institutions were IFC, IADB, EBRD, ADB, PIDG and CAF,
and among bilateral institutions were FMO (Netherlands) and PROPARCO (France).
  Investment in collective investment vehicles amounted to $6.7 billion in the 2012–14 period.
The largest providers among MDBs were ADB, IFC, and EBRD, and among bilaterals were CDC
(United Kingdom), PROPARCO (France), IFU (Denmark) and KFW (Germany). Amongst the
MDBs, AFDB has created a new Africa50 fund, a structured credit vehicle, independent from
the Bank, with a separate balance sheet. With an equity base of $10 billion the fund hopes to
leverage $100 billion of private money for infrastructure, including water. UNICEF is also
attempting leverage of a different kind, offering its expertise to private producers of sanitary
ware to promote the greater use of safe sanitation in developing countries.
  Some institutions (EIB, IFC’s MCPP) issue junior subordinated debt, including “first loss”
bonds and other mezzanine finance.2 These products aim to enhance the status and appeal
of senior debt issued to support an institution or project by protecting these creditors from
the first impact of default.
  By sector, over the three-year period, $1.3 billion was mobilized from the private sector
through the use of such instruments for “water and sanitation.” Of this total, 71 percent ($731
million) was mobilized from guarantees, and the remaining 29 percent ($377 million) from
investment in collective investment vehicles. No syndicated loans were recorded in the
water sector during this period.


Potential Role of Guarantees Going Forward
A recent OECD working paper concludes that while “there is considerable potential to expand
the use of guarantees … several donors [have] yet to establish guarantee programs, while
those that do offer guarantees are expanding their use” (Mirabile, Benn, and Sangaré 2013, 5).
However, use of this instrument is still minor, particularly for water sector investments.
  As the most recent review notes, “multilateral Development Banks face a number of major
impediments to using guarantees more extensively, linked to their capital structure, finan-
cial and operational policies, and staff skill sets” (Humphrey and Prizzon 2014, 1).
  In the belief that greater transparency and consistency in reporting guarantees could
promote their further use, OECD’s DAC in 2013 stated that it “will consider a concrete pro-
­
posal for a regular data collection on guarantees to enable the quantification, at an interna-
tional level, of the resources made available (amount mobilized) to/in developing countries
through guarantee schemes, thereby valorizing the use of these instruments by donors”
(Mirabile, Benn, and Sangaré 2013, 15). This proposal was accepted by DAC Ministers in
December 2014, and work has begun to shift CRS reporting onto a new measurement
framework which includes guarantees, along with other financing resources not currently
­
­
c aptured in DAC’s annual reporting (Benn et al. 2016, 6).
  This impending change by OECD’s DAC promises to throw more light on this hith-
erto  opaque development instrument. However, the need to adequately account for
