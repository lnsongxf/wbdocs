EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report describes enrollment into the cohorts for protocol 1 for the Evaluation of the National
Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South Africa Using Routinely Collected Data. The
study is evaluating short-term and long-term effects of five interventions being implemented by the
National Department of Health (NDoH) in South Africa to improve adherence to HIV care and
chronic disease care in general: Fast track initiation counselling, decentralized medicine delivery,
adherence clubs, early patient tracing and enhanced adherence counselling. The study uses a
randomized evaluation design to compare sites where the intervention was rolled out with sites
where it was not. After completing data enhancement activities at each of the 24 sites (12
intervention and 12 control sites in 4 provinces in South Africa), the teams began enrollment into 7
study cohorts (5 HIV intervention evaluation cohorts and 2 TB, hypertension and diabetes (TBHD)
observational cohorts).

Enrollment began on 20 June 2016 and is on track to complete by end of October 2016 for the HIV
cohorts while enrollment for the TBHD cohorts is ongoing (with expected completion by December
2016). The team faced several challenges to completing enrollment, including delays in the rollout
of the interventions within the sites and deviations from the interventions described in the
guidelines, inability to access registers of patients who received the interventions, variation in the
ways the interventions were implemented, implementation of decentralized medicine delivery in
control sites and changes to the interventions caused by a concurrent NDoH strategy to “decant”
stable patients from HIV care sites. The team adapted to these conditions by working with the
World Bank and NDoH co- principal investigators and developing strategies to ensure data
collection could commence. These included changing the timing of enrollment, working with NDoH
and the implementing partners to ensure rollout of the interventions and adapting the analytic
approach to deal with the changes to the counterfactual created by the rollout of decentralized
medicine delivery in control sites. Once enrollment began it was fairly smooth for all cohorts with
the exception of adherence clubs and early tracing which took longer for sites to rollout. Enrollment
was uneven in time and by province, but eventually all sites were on track to complete enrolling the
appropriate number of subjects.

Enrollment is now completing for the HIV cohorts and passive follow up has now begun for patients
through monitoring data collection systems (TIER.net and NHLS) and patient files for study
outcomes as work shifts to focus on protocol 2 where qualitative data will be collected to
supplement the quantitative analyses that will result from protocol 1.

       BACKGROUND
For antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and treatments for other chronic diseases to be effective,
patients must remain in care for longer periods of time, initiate treatment as early as allowed under
prevailing guidelines, consistently achieve high levels of adherence to their treatment regimen and,
as a result, exhibit low and stable monitoring test results and/or treatment completion. In the case
of HIV, treatment is lifelong and requires consistent, nearly complete adherence to sustain an
undetectable viral load. Numerous studies and reviews have indicated that retention in care and
adherence to ART in South Africa are sub-optimal and pose a serious threat to the long-term
success of the national HIV response. Although there is less evidence on hand, these same problems
almost certainly also pertain to tuberculosis (TB), for which treatment completion and cure rates
do not approach global targets and to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), for which almost no
treatment adherence data are available.

To address this challenge, in 2014 the NDOH developed the “National Adherence Guidelines for
Chronic Diseases (HIV, TB and NCDs).” The guidelines address the provision of a minimum package
of interventions to increase linkage to care, retention in care, and adherence to treatment. The
minimum package of interventions includes five interventions that are being evaluated under this
study: 1) fast track initiation counseling (FTIC); 2) enhanced adherence counseling for unstable
patients (EAC); 3) adherence clubs (AC); 4) decentralized medicine delivery (DMD); and 5) early
tracing of all missed appointments to improve retention in care (TRIC). The study is a matched
cluster randomized study in 24 clinics, 12 of which receive early implementation of the minimum
package and 12 delay implementation and serve as control sites. Clinics were matched on clinic
characteristics: total remaining on ART, clinic size, setting, location and viral suppression.




       STUDY AIM AND OBJECTIVES
The overall aims of this study are to assess the impact of a subset of the National Adherence
Guidelines’ minimum package of interventions on HIV patients’ treatment outcomes at public
sector clinics; estimate the costs of the interventions; and describe the cascade of care for TB,
hypertension, and diabetes at these same clinics.

The study has 8 specific aims which are detailed in the two study protocols entitled “Evaluation of
the National Department of Health's National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South
Africa Using Routinely Collected Data” and “Process Evaluation of the National Department of
Health's National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South Africa”. The objectives are:

EVALUATION OF THE NDOH’S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA



    ► Among HIV-infected patients newly eligible for antiretroviral therapy, evaluate the impact of
       Fast Track Treatment Initiation Counselling on initiation and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients who are stable on antiretroviral therapy, evaluate the impact of
       Adherence Clubs on ART adherence and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients who are stable on antiretroviral therapy, evaluate the impact of
       Decentralized Medicine delivery on ART adherence and viral suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients who have poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy, evaluate
       the impact of Enhanced Adherence Counselling on treatment adherence and viral
       suppression.

    ► Among HIV-infected patients in antiretroviral therapy programs who miss a scheduled
       appointment by 5 days or more, evaluate the impact of Early Patient Tracing on retention in
       care.

    ► For each clinic included in the study, evaluate the overall impact of the Adherence Guidelines
       on patient outcomes.

    ► Estimate the incremental and total cost of each of the interventions listed above compared to
       standard of care.

    ► Describe the current status of the cascade of care and adherence to treatment for
       tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes, for the purpose of tailoring the minimum package
       of interventions to these conditions in the national rollout.




        PURPOSE OF THE REPORT
The purpose of this report is to describe the process and current progress with enrollment for
protocol 1 which is on track to be completed for the HIV cohorts by end of October and is ongoing
for the TB, Hypertension and Diabetes cohorts. As part of this report we will describe the data
sources used to collect baseline information on the cohorts and give an overview of the study sites
based on the data collected at the sites. We will then review the eligibility criteria for each of the
cohorts and describe the methodology used to identify eligible subjects for each cohort. Finally, we
will review the enrollment within each cohort and describe the cohort in terms of basic clinical and
demographic characteristics of each.

       ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
For all cohorts, we set up general inclusion criteria designed to focus the study on non-pregnant
adults. All cohorts followed these criteria, including the TBHD cohorts. Below we describe the
general inclusion and exclusion criteria which applied to all cohorts within the study.

4.1 General inclusion/Exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria

   ► ≥ 18 years old

   ► Meet the inclusion criteria for one or more of the cohorts


Exclusion criteria

   ► Not resident in the facility’s catchment area

   ► Recorded intention to transfer care to a different facility within 12 months

   ► Pregnant and eligible for PMTCT

4.2 Cohort specific inclusion/exclusion criteria
Within each cohort, specific inclusion/exclusion criteria were set to allow enrollment of
appropriate subjects. The enrollment criteria followed the December 2014 national guidelines for
HIV care and ART and November 2015 National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Disease (HIV, TB
and NCDs) with some updates based on the August 2016 version of the Guidelines. Below we
describe inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to each cohort.

Cohort 1: Fast track treatment initiation inclusion criteria (Patients newly eligible for ART)

   ► Determined to be eligible to start ART under prevailing national guidelines (CD4 count <
       500, WHO Stage 3 or 4 condition, no TB or cryptococcal meningitis)
Cohorts 2 and 3: Adherence clubs or decentralized medicine delivery (Patients stable on
ART)

   ► On same ART treatment regimen for at least 12 months

   ► Most recent viral load taken in past 3 months

   ► Two consecutive viral loads undetectable (<400 copies/ml3)




                                                                                                    3
EVALUATION OF THE NDOH’S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA



Cohort 4: Enhanced adherence counseling (Patients on ART with poor adherence)

    ► On first line ART for at least 3 months

    ► Poor adherence as indicated by an elevated viral load (>400 copies/ml3)

Cohort 5: Early patient tracing (Patients lost from ART programs)

    ► Initiated ART

    ► Fail to return for a scheduled appointment within 5 to 90 days from their appointment date

Cohort 6: TBHD cohort (Tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes patients)

    ► Screened for or diagnosed with TB or hypertension within the last month, or diabetes within
       last 6 months

    ► Does not have existing TB, hypertension (diagnosed more than 1 month ago) or diabetes
       (diagnosed more than 6 months ago)
In the section below on exclusions we describe the reasons, for each cohort, that patients did not
meet the eligibility criteria.




        OVERVIEW OF STUDY SITES
The study is being conducted at 24 primary health care clinics (PHCs) in South Africa. In
consultation with the NDoH, the study team chose six clinics from one district each in Gauteng,
KwaZulu Natal, Limpopo, and North West Provinces giving a total of 24 sites. These provinces were
chosen because in most cases they are high HIV burden provinces with high burden districts and
high volume clinics.

Each site was required to meet the following criteria: 1) It had to be a high volume site as defined
by having its Total Remaining on ART (TROA) being above 1000 patients; 2) It could not already be
a National Health Insurance pilot site; 3) It had to be generating computerized TIER.net Phase 2 (all
HIV patient data captured electronically including back capture of historical data) which is essential
for the evaluation outcomes; and 4) It could not be participating in any other adherence-related
studies or pilots. Sites were chosen so that they could be matched with another site within a district
roughly on TROA, proportion of patients virally suppressed, setting (rural/urban/formal/informal)
and location (sites near each other).

After choosing the 12 pairs of sites (24 total), NDoH, World Bank, Boston University and HE2RO
randomly allocated one site in each pair to be an intervention site and one pair to be a control site.
Table 1 below describes the study populations at each facility using data from TIER.net and DHIS on
patients who were active in care (i.e. had visited the clinic within the last four months) and who

As can be seen from the table above, the sites are very different in terms of geographic location, size
and number of eligible subjects within each of the intervention cohorts. The number of subjects
eligible for each intervention between June 1-30th of 2016 shows that for most cohorts and sites, a
sufficient number of subjects become eligible to allow site specific enrollment to complete within a
four month period though variation exists. For cohorts like ACs and DMD, the numbers eligible in
June 2016 are quite large, allowing full enrollment to be completed quite quickly if required, while

the EAC cohort shows few new eligible subjects, particularly in uThungulu and parts of Mopani and
Ekurhuleni.




        ENROLLMENT
6.1 Methods for identifying eligible individuals
In both intervention and control sites, the study team needed to identify patients eligible for
enrollment into the study. In control sites, this necessitated finding subjects who would have been
eligible for the interventions if they had been at an intervention site. This could be achieved using
TIER.net data. At intervention sites, this necessitated finding patients who actually got the
interventions. In some case, registers were able to show us who got the interventions and who did
not within an intervention site. In other cases we had to develop alternative methods to identify the
cohorts.

An exception to this was the enrollment in control sites for the DMD cohorts and the adherence
clubs. As control sites needed to identify a group of patients who were eligible for these
interventions and because the eligibility criteria for these two cohorts were the same, we needed to
ensure we did not enrol the same patients into two cohorts at a control site and we needed to
ensure we had roughly balanced patient characteristics within each cohort. To accomplish this, we
identified eligible patients at the sites and randomly allocated them to one of the two cohorts to
attempt to create the balance on predictors of the outcomes.

6.2 Intervention Sites
At intervention sites identifying individuals who were eligible for specific interventions and
received the interventions was achieved using one of three approaches described below. The aim
was, as far as possible, to spread enrollment into each cohort over the enrollment period (June to
October).

Recent TIER.Net dispatches from each facility were used to produce lists of patients who met
eligibility criteria for each specific HIV cohort. These lists were produced for each cohort prior to
each facility visit during the enrollment period. If the list of eligible patients was long, patients were
randomly selected from each list to produce a shortened list of eligible individuals. If there were
only a few eligible individuals on the initial list, all patients remained on the list. The final password
protected ‘Cohort creation list’ was sent to the Provincial study coordinators by the Data Manager
along with targets for visit enrollment for each cohort. Then one of three approaches was used:

    1. List to Register approach. At intervention sites, cohort creation lists were compared
       against intervention specific registers (e.g., FTIC register, AC register, etc.) to identify which


6
                                                                                   FIRST ENROLLMENT REPORT



         patients had received the intervention. Provincial teams checked each patient on the cohort
         creation list until they identified the target number of cohort patients to be enrolled.
    2. List to File approach. In some cases where intervention registers were absent or
       incomplete, cohort creation lists were used to find patient files to find evidence that the
       patient had received the intervention e.g. record of specific AGL counselling sessions,
       presence of a patient adherence plan, etc. This was the approach which was used in later
       rounds of recruitment and was mainly used to complete enrollment of FTIC and EAC
       cohorts, predominantly in Ekurhuleni.
    3. Direct from Register approach. If patients on the cohort creation list could not be found
       using the List to Register approach then (rather than using the cohort creation lists to
       identify eligible patients), patients were instead identified directly from the intervention
       specific registers and their file numbers noted and found.
Regardless of the method by which eligible patients receiving the intervention were identified,
patient files were reviewed and information extracted using the electronic CRF to confirm that
these patients did in fact meet all eligibility criteria for that intervention cohort (including receipt of
the intervention).

6.3 Control sites
At controls sites, cohort creation lists of eligible individuals were created in the same way as
described above from TIER.net data and sent to the provincial teams. Each cohort list was then
reviewed and files for each patient were found until the cohort enrollment target was achieved (i.e.,
all patients enrolled in the cohorts at control sites were found using the List to File approach). Files
were then reviewed and information extracted using the electronic case report form (CRF) to
confirm eligibility.

6.4 Cohort Specific Enrollment
Below we describe the approach to identifying eligible patients for each of the cohorts. For all
cohorts at both intervention and control sites we first produced cohort lists from the most recent
TIER dispatch for each facility identifying patients who were:

   ► Active in care (visit within last 124 days and no record that patient had “died”, “lost to follow
       up” or “transferred/moved out”

   ► Over 18 years of age

   ► Pregnancy status at last visit did not equal “Pregnant”

We then followed specific procedures for each cohort as described below.




                                                                                                          7

        Cohort 1: Fast track treatment initiation (Patients newly eligible for ART)
Cohort lists were refined using TIER.net to select patients who met the general inclusion criteria.
We then proceeded differently for intervention and control subjects. Control subjects were
identified and enrolled using the ‘List to file’ approach. Patient files for eligible patients were found
and screened using the electronic CRF to ensure FTIC eligibility criteria were met. As with
intervention subjects, once eligibility had been confirmed an FTIC barcode was assigned and the
patient enrolled.

For intervention subjects, we first used a ‘List to register’ approach then a ‘Direct from register’
then the ‘List to file’ approach. In some facilities (predominantly in Ekurhuleni) FTIC registers were
absent or inadequately completed, hence a ‘List to file’ approach was used. Eligible files were
reviewed for evidence of FTIC counselling sessions recorded on clinical stationery and/or presence
of a completed or partially completed AGL Patient Adherence Plan on the patient file. All selected
files were then screened using the electronic CRF to confirm patients’ FTIC eligibility criteria that
could not be verified through TIER.net (i.e., resident in the facility catchment area, no intention to
transfer to another facility, no cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis at ART initiation). All patients who
screened as eligible for the FTIC cohort and as receiving the intervention were assigned an FTIC
barcode and followed.

In total 79% of eligible patients enrolled in the FTIC cohort were identified through either the ‘List
to register’ or ‘List to file’ approach, while 21% were identified direct from register.

        Cohorts 2: Adherence clubs (Patients stable on ART)
Cohort lists were refined using TIER.net data to select patients who met the general inclusion
criteria. Control subjects were identified and enrolled using the ‘List to file’ approach and patient
files screened to ensure all AC eligibility criteria were met. Given the implementation of DMD at
some control sites, further checks were made to ensure that selected patients were not currently
receiving their medication through DMD. If these criteria were met the patient was enrolled and an
AC barcode assigned.

For intervention subjects, first a ‘List to register’ approach was used to identify patients recorded
on the facility AC register(s). If the AC target number could not be enrolled then the ‘Direct from
register’ approach was used to identify and find AC patient files. A ‘List to file’ approach was not
used for this cohort. Eligible patient files were screened using the electronic CRF to confirm
patients’ eligibility including confirmation of enrollment in an AC, and ensuring that patients had no
record of picking up their medications separately from a DMD pick-up-point. All patients who
eligible for the AC cohort and as receiving the intervention were assigned an AC barcode.

In total 76% of eligible patients enrolled in the AC cohort were identified through the ‘List to
register’ approach and 24% were identified direct from register.

        Cohorts 3: Decentralized medicine delivery (Patients stable on ART)
For DMD, cohort lists were further refined as per AC, although it was not possible to confirm
enrollment into DMD using TIER.net data. Control DMD subjects were enrolled from any site that
was not implementing DMD during the enrollment period (June-October) irrespective of
randomization. Control subjects were identified and enrolled using the ‘List to file’ approach.
Patient files were found and screened to ensure DMD eligibility. Given the enrollment of control
DMD subjects at some of the intervention sites further checks were made to ensure that selected
cohort patients were not enrolled in an AC. Assuming all criteria were met the patient was enrolled
and a DMD barcode assigned.

For intervention subjects (enrolled at any site currently implementing DMD irrespective of
randomization), the ‘List to register’ approach was used to identify patients recorded on DMD
register(s) as having been decanted to a DMD (CCMDD/CDU) medicine pick up point. The relevant
patient file numbers were recorded and those patient files found. If the DMD target number could
not be enrolled then the ‘Direct from register’ approach was used and patient files found. As with
AC, a ‘List to file’ approach was not used for this cohort at DMD intervention sites. Patient files were
then screened using the electronic CRF to confirm patients’ eligibility including confirmation that
the patient was not also enrolled in an AC. Eligible patients were enrolled and assigned a DMD
barcode.

In total 49% of eligible patients enrolled in the DMD cohort at DMD intervention facilities were
identified through the ‘List to register’ approach; 51% were identified direct from register.
As noted, DMD was unexpectedly implemented during the enrollment period at many sites. At those
intervention sites where DMD was unexpectedly implemented during the enrollment period and
patients were transferred by the facility from AC to DMD, any patient in the AC cohort who was
transferred to DMD was then replaced in the AC cohort. At control sites where DMD was
unexpectedly implemented during the enrollment period, we checked the IDs of all patients
enrolled in the AC cohort and replaced any patient in that cohort who was now receiving DMD.

        Cohort 4: Enhanced adherence counseling (patients on ART with poor
        adherence)
For EAC cohort lists were first refined using TIER.net. Control subjects were then identified and
enrolled using only the ‘List to file’ approach. Once eligibility had been confirmed the patient was
enrolled and an EAC barcode assigned.

For intervention subjects, first a ‘List to register’ approach was used to identify patients on the
facility EAC register(s) and to find those patient files. If the EAC target could not be enrolled then
the ‘Direct from register’ approach was used. In some intervention facilities where EAC registers
were absent or inadequately completed (predominantly Ekurhuleni) the ‘List to file’ approach was
used. Patient files were found and reviewed to see if there was any evidence of EAC counselling
sessions recorded and/or presence of a completed or partially completed or updated AGL Patient

Adherence Plan on the patient file. All patients who screened as eligible for the EAC cohort were
enrolled and assigned an EAC barcode.

In total 51% of eligible patients enrolled in the EAC cohort were identified through either the ‘List
to register’ or ‘List to file’ approach, while 49% were identified direct from register.

        Cohort 5: Early patient tracing (Patients lost from ART programs)
For TRIC, cohort lists were again refined for this cohort using TIER. Control subjects were identified
and enrolled using just the ‘List to file’ approach. Eligible files were screened using the electronic
CRF to ensure that patients had in fact missed an appointment by 5-90 days as indicated on TIER
(sometimes a backlog in TIER data entry could have resulted in patients being identified as having
missed a visit when in fact they had not). Once eligibility was confirmed a TRIC barcode was
assigned.

For intervention subjects, initially a ‘List to register’ approach was used to identify patients from
the TRIC registers who needed tracing or who had been traced. The relevant patient files were then
found. If the TRIC target number could not be enrolled then the ‘Direct from register’ approach was
used to identify TRIC eligible patients and their patient files.

In some facilities (particularly Mopani and uThungulu), TRIC registers were not held by the facility
but by implementing partners and/or WBOT teams. Information on these registers was not sent
back to the facility or shared between stakeholders. This was discussed with both the facilities,
district management and support partners and led to delays in enrolling this cohort at some
intervention sites. In order to complete enrollment at these sites, visits are now being made to
partner offices and meetings with WBOT teams organized in order to gain access to the registers
and tracing information. This is similar to the ‘Direct from register’ approach although can require
review of several different registers in order to identify patients. The names and file numbers (if
recorded) of patients recorded on these lists are then noted and taken back to the facility by the
team and these patient files found. The ‘List to file’ approach was not used at intervention sites for
this cohort. Patient files were screened to confirm eligibility (including confirmation that they had
missed a scheduled appointment by 5-90 days). Assuming patients screened as eligible they were
enrolled and assigned a TRIC barcode.

In total 46% of eligible patients enrolled in the AC cohort were identified through the ‘List to
register’ approach while 54% were identified direct from register.

        Cohort 6: TBHD cohort (Tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes patients)
TBHD screening cohort (Cohort 6A)

At each facility visit the study team reviewed patient files from the previous or current day to
exclude patients <18 years and pregnant women. All of those who remain are eligible for the TBHD
screening cohort (Group A) and baseline data is extracted from their files using the electronic CRF.
This is repeated until 100 patients eligible for Group A have been identified.

Once patient information is captured it is reviewed by the research team to determine the status of
each patient:

   ► Not eligible (i.e., not screened for TB, hypertension or diabetes; no evidence of TB,
      hypertension or diabetes/no known disease/screened negative; prevalent case of TB or
      hypertension (diagnosed more than 1 month ago), prevalent case of diabetes (diagnosed
      more than 6 months ago), MDR or XDR TB)

   ► Screened positive for TB (at last visit)

   ► Screened positive for hypertension (at last visit)

   ► Screened positive for diabetes (at last visit)

   ► Newly diagnosed with TB (in last month)

   ► Newly diagnosed with hypertension (in last month)

   ► Newly diagnosed with diabetes (in last 6 months)

The Data Manager then returns a list of file numbers of all patients who have screened positive for
TBHD to the provincial teams and these files are found and marked with a barcode label to signify
their enrollment in the TBHD screening cohort.

TBHD diagnosed cohort (Cohort 6B)

There are three ways in which patients are identified as eligible for the TBHD diagnosed cohort and
enrolled:

   1. Patients from the TBHD screening cohort who are diagnosed with TB, hypertension or
      diabetes during the TBHD cohort enrollment period (June-December 2016) are then eligible
      for inclusion in Cohort 6B. These file numbers are confirmed by the Data Manager and then
      be marked with a Cohort 6B (TBHD Diagnosed) barcode label.
    2. Cases of TB and hypertension diagnosed within the last month of the site visit, or diabetes
       cases within the last 6 months of the site visit that were identified during the creation of
       Cohort 6A are also eligible. These are identified by the Data Manager from the baseline CRF
       data previously collected. A list of file numbers is then returned to the provincial teams so
       that patient files can be marked with a Cohort 6B barcode label.
    3. TB patients (diagnosed after May 2016) are identified from the TB suspect register or the
       TB register, and hypertension (diagnosed after May 2016) and diabetes patients
       (diagnosed after Jan 2016) are identified from the PHC tick register. File numbers are
       noted and patient files pulled to verify these patients have been diagnosed within the
       required time period. If eligibility is confirmed files are marked with the Cohort 6B barcode
       label.




                                                                                                   11
EVALUATION OF THE NDOH’S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA



The process of identification of eligible patients for Cohort 6B will be repeated until Cohort 6B
includes approximately: 35 newly diagnosed TB patients, 35 newly diagnosed hypertension
patients and 35 newly diagnosed diabetic patients.

6.5 Enrollment process/Identification of cohorts
While enrollment generally went smoothly after initiation of enrollment procedures began on June
20th, 2016 the team did identify some barriers to completing the process, and in some cases,
starting the enrollment process. This was often cohort specific, with sites having difficulty enrolling
into one or two of the cohorts, while the others were able to enrol without problem. Barriers for
each cohort, therefore required different solutions.

The main barriers to enrollment fall into four general categories: 1) delays in implementation at the
sites and delays in implementation per specifications of the adherence guidelines; 2) changes in
rollout of the intervention due to the pressure to “decant” patients; 3) incomplete or not used
registers for the interventions; and 4) delay in enrollment at control sites due to delays in
implementation of the interventions at intervention sites. Below we discuss each issue as it arose
and what our strategies were for alleviating the problem.

Delays in Implementation or not implemented as per AGL

The main barrier to enrollment was delays in the implementation of the rollout of some of the
interventions as per the AGL. The most commonly delayed interventions were decentralized
medicine delivery and ACs. This largely occurred as it took some sites more time to determine
which patients would be appropriate for each of the interventions and for the sites to decide how to
organize these approaches. These mainly affected sites in Gauteng province, though this also was
seen in uThungulu. Some of the delay in implementing ACs in uThungulu was also associated with
existing implementation of pre-AGL models in the district and the need to change the approach to
align with the adherence guidelines as new clubs were created. Due to delays at King Dinizulu we
made the decision to enrol patients into the AC cohort from any club established after June 2016. In
Mopani, delays implementing TRIC as per the guidelines has also been a barrier to cohort
enrollment as TRIC has tended to focus on patients who have defaulted rather than those who have
missed appointments. As the BU/HE2RO team are not service providers, we were not able to exert
much influence on the timing of the rollout or supporting implementation of the interventions as
per the adherence guidelines. Instead we kept in close contact with the treatment sites, the support
partners and our contacts in government to discuss progress on the rollout. Ultimately all
interventions were rolled out and enrollment was able to begin at all sites with a few exceptions. By
mid-October, these include ACs in Motsamai and Buchanana and TRIC in Giyani and King Dinizulu.

Changes in Implementation

Another challenge the team faced around enrollment stemmed from changes made to the
interventions within the sites. First, in many sites, pressure to decant as many patients as possible
meant that patients who were initially designated to be in ACs were then moved to DMD and spaced

                                                                                FIRST ENROLLMENT REPORT



fast lane appointments (in Mopani). This was a challenge for the study team as we had to ensure
that subjects enrolled in the intervention sites actually got the interventions for the cohort they
were enrolled in.

Second, at the same time as our enrollment was beginning there was a strong push to implement
DMD in as many sites as possible, again in order to meet the targets for the government decanting
strategy. This led to control sites being slated to rollout this intervention as well as the other
decanting interventions (ACs and Spaced Fast Lane appointments) despite previous commitments
to delay the rollout of other AGL interventions. To attempt solve this problem and minimize the
delay in enrollment of the full cohort, the team worked with the World Bank and NDoH PIs but
were not successful in delaying the implementation of the DMD intervention at control sites.
Instead we agreed to investigate alternative analytic options for how to deal with this issue. These
are currently under consideration. So far the evaluation team does appear to have managed to
encourage delaying any further implementation of the other decanting strategies at control sites.

Incomplete Registers for Interventions

While in most cases, our data enhancement plans allowed us to work with sites to ensure improved
record keeping and data recording, not all sites had the capacity to use the registers for
documenting who got the interventions. This issue occurred most often with early patient tracing
particularly in Mopani, as this intervention was largely managed by the implementing partners who
kept their own records, often not at the treatment site. In Ekurhuleni, the shortage of Lay
Counsellor staff resulted in inadequate completion of FTIC and EAC registers as counsellors were
short staffed and felt they had insufficient time to complete the registers as well. Where patients
who got the intervention could not be identified directly through registers at the sites, the study
team worked closely with the treatment support partners to ensure access to the registers in order
to identify a suitable intervention cohort. For example, we have worked with Anova, Casipo and
WBOTs in Mopani to solve these issues. In Ekurhuleni we have tried to encourage register
completion at each visit to sites where there is a problem with EAC or FTIC registers.

Delay in control sites due to delays in intervention sites

Our initial desire was to ensure that a matched pair of intervention and control sites enrolled
roughly concurrently to limit the influence of any secular trends. These should be minimal in
general but if possible it was our preferred approach and at most of the sites we were able to
achieve this. At some sites however, delay in implementation of the interventions meant we
delayed the enrollment at both the intervention and control site within the pair. Eventually we took
the decision that we needed to continue with enrollment and did not wait until the interventions
were completely rolled out (e.g. AC and EAC at Motsamai, Tamaho, Buchanana and Ntambanana).
Thus at these sites we enrolled the control site first and then the intervention site once the
intervention were rolled out. In addition while we had always intended not to enrol the initial
group of patients who got the interventions (as we wanted to give the sites some “learning time”)
this was not possible if the interventions were delayed and therefore, in discussions with the World

Ekurhuleni and Buchanana in KZN.




           REVIEW OF SAMPLE SIZE
Total sample size for the study was estimated to be 2,880 subjects in the five intervention cohorts
and 4,800 in the TBHD cohort, for a total sample size of 6,680. The table below shows the sample
size that was estimated to be required for each cohort. We determined each sample size to be
sufficient to measure the short term outcome for that cohort. For all the cohorts except the TBHD
cohort, calculations assumed a site-clustered design with the clinic as the cluster and 24 clusters
evenly randomized between intervention and comparison groups. They also assumed a coefficient
of variation of 0.1, 80% power; and an alpha of 0.05. In table 2 below we describe the remaining
assumptions behind the sample size for each cohort.

We note that we are currently in discussion to determine whether we should increase the overall
sample size to account for ineligible subjects, changes at the sites and any other differences from
anticipated data collection (i.e. subjects who got two interventions when they should have gotten
only one). This will be particularly important for the DMD cohort where Central Chronic Medicine
Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) has been rolled out at many facilities. It may also affect the
ACs where enrollment is more challenging because patients who started on an AC may be pushed
into CCMDD. The general consensus is that we should increase the maximum allowable sample size
by 20% in each cohort. While we would not need to enroll the additional subjects, this would allow
us the flexibility to do so if we find our number of ineligible subjects is higher than we anticipated
or if too many subjects started in an intervention like ACs but then were moved to DMD.

8.2 Enrollment by cohort
The team has tracked enrollment into each cohort over time to ensure progress towards our
sample size targets and to ensure we did not exceed our total sample size allowed. Table 4 below


                                                                                                                                      15
EVALUATION OF THE NDOH’S NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA

October 6th. The table is also stratified by treatment facility and district.

8.3 Enrollment over time
While each site was required to recruit the same number of subjects per cohort, due to logistical
constraints at some sites and, more commonly, due to delays in implementation of the
interventions at the sites, enrollment was not evenly distributed across time with some cohorts
enrolling faster than others. Figure 1a-g below demonstrate this for the six cohorts.

These figures show that the FTIC, AC and DMD cohorts have been the fastest to enrol, reaching
targets in about 16 weeks. While enrollment has been largely steady week on week in these
cohorts, enrollment accelerated between week 8 and 9 for the AC and DMD cohorts. This
acceleration was largely due to enrollment at control sites in pairs where enrollment of the cohort
at the intervention site was delayed and resolution of some register issues that had previously
delayed enrollment. Each of these cohorts required screening more subjects than we ultimately
enrolled. Subjects who were not eligible are described below.

The EAC and TRIC cohorts took longer, although they should be complete by 20 weeks. The most
prominent reasons that enrollment was slower for these cohorts was related to: 1) these
interventions not being implemented to AGL specifications (e.g. focussing EAC on defaulters rather
than unsuppressed patients, or only tracing pre-ART or patients who had defaulted rather than
those who had early or late missed appointments); and 2) incomplete or unavailable registers at
intervention sites. We also noted that for the TRIC cohort, a larger number of patients who were
screened were found to be ineligible compared to other cohorts. This was due in large part to the
intervention not being delivered as per the AGL specifications.

As anticipated, the TB, Hypertension and Diabetes cohorts are taking the longest. We have currently
identified 1375 (57%) subjects as eligible for enrollment into the TBHD screening cohort and 307
(13%) subjects as eligible for enrollment into the TBHD diagnosed cohort. However as described in
the previous ‘Enrollment’ section we have not yet initiated cohort enrollment via the third method
for the TBHD diagnosed cohort but will be able to do this retrospectively once it is initiated. We
anticipate that enrollment of these two cohorts will be completed by end February 2016.

8.4 Enrollment by facility/district
In addition to variation in enrollment over time by cohort, we also encountered variation in
enrollment by site and province. While overall all five intervention cohorts have completed or are
nearing completion of enrollment within each cohort, Figure 2 shows that enrollment was uneven
with facilities in North West province enrolling fastest and Limpopo and KZN taking somewhat
longer. This was largely due to delays in being able to enrol for one or more cohorts because of
implementation or register issues. Figure 3 shows enrollment by cohort and district.

Figure 3 below shows enrollment into each cohort within each district. Note that the large
difference between 6A and 6B cohort numbers in Mopani is due to only having screening
information for TB patients (for hypertension and diabetes cases, no records are created until
patients are diagnosed). Because the third route of detecting the diagnosed patients has not been
implemented yet, the number of diagnosed patients in Figure 3 only contains those Mopani patients
diagnosed TB positive who were identified from those screened. This will change as we implement
the 3rd method of identifying diagnosed patients.

8.5 Ineligible Patients
Through the course of enrollment, some subjects have been identified who have been ineligible for
enrollment following file review. Below in Table 5 we describe the number of ineligible subjects per
cohort. The most common reason for not being eligible was a patient not actually receiving the
intervention they were eligible for. For all cohorts, missing files was between 8 and 13% of reasons
for exclusions.

          COHORT DESCRIPTIVES
Baseline data has been collected on each of the enrolled cohorts. Data come from TIER.net and
patient files and have been entered into an electronic database for descriptive analysis in STATA.
Below in Table 6 we describe the cohorts in terms of their baseline characteristics, both overall and
by intervention arm.

The FTIC cohort participants are mostly under age 40 (64%). As with most ART clinics, the cohort is
more likely to be female (59%) though slightly less than the 66% we typically see. The cohort is
also barely above the initiation threshold when the ART program started (<200) with an average of
230 cells/ml3 at ART initiation. Despite being sick, there was no TB in this cohort by design. For
FTIC, the intervention and controls cohorts were largely balanced on baseline characteristics with
only minor differences between groups, much like what would be expected in a moderate sized
individually randomized trial.

For the adherence clubs, about half of patients were under age 40 (55%) and nearly 75% were
female, slightly more than what we typically see enrolling on ART (66%). These patients were
somewhat healthier at ART initiation than those in the FTIC cohort at an average of 270 cells, but
with a wide range. The intervention and control cohorts were similar with respect to most variables
(age, sex and log viral load at time of eligibility) though the control cohort was somewhat healthier
at ART initiation (287 vs. 249).

The DMD cohort also had roughly half of the patients below age 40 (51%) and had many more
females (71%) than males. The cohort was also similar to the Adherence Clubs cohort with respect
to baseline ART initiation CD4 count (268 cells). The intervention and control cohorts were well
balanced with respect to sex and age but there were some imbalances in CD4 count at ART
initiation and log viral load at eligibility.

Note: * Time between last VL and enrollment. It is thought that patients are only enrolled at their next visit unless there is a
specific intervention at the site to follow up patients with high VL (if the patient is only returning every other month to pick up
medication then these times seem reasonable, as the EAC SOP says “an EAC identified file should trigger referral for EAC as soon
as the patient comes back to the facility”). It is possible that an EAC patient may be contacted in between telling them they need
EAC but this is not recorded.

The EAC cohort was very evenly divided between those below and above 40 (50%) but slightly
fewer females than in the DMD cohort (60%). The cohort was quite sick at ART initiation with an
average CD4 count below 200 cells/ml3 (152). The cohort was eligible for the intervention for an
average of 49 days at enrollment. The intervention and control cohorts were well balanced with
respect to age and sex and baseline TB. There were small differences in CD4 count (168 vs 137
cells/ml3). Log viral load was also somewhat different and lower in the control cohort.

Note: * Likely that patients are only enrolled at their next time between last missed visit and enrollment (visit can be missed by
up to 90 days). The patients need to be eligible for tracing from May through October. Therefore if someone missed a scheduled
visit in February, they would be eligible for tracing through May, and only enrolled in October, resulting in 243 days between
missed visit and enrollment.

The TRIC cohort was also very evenly divided between those below and above 40 (51%) and nearly
exactly what we expect for female at 63%. As with previous cohorts they were again quite sick at
ART initiation with an average CD4 count of 205 cells/ml3, though higher than the EAC cohort. The
cohort was eligible for the intervention for an average of 35 days at enrollment (=is days between
last missed visit and enrollment to the cohort, not time between missed visit and tracing attempt).
The intervention and control cohorts were well balanced with respect to CD4 at ART initiation and
log viral load. However they did show some differences, with younger patients in the intervention
cohort and the intervention cohort being eligible for the intervention substantially longer than the
control cohort (29 vs. 79).

Overall the TBHD cohort was older than the previous cohorts (only 39% under age 39) but their sex
distribution looked exactly like an ART cohort, suggesting that ART cohorts are much like the
general population of patients seeking care at a PHC. TB screening was common in this cohort (with
67% receiving TB screening at last visit) with only 9% getting hypertension screening and only 2%
receiving diabetes screening. Among all patients, 81% had no diagnosed condition at last visit,
while 11% had hypertension diagnosed, 2% had diabetes diagnosed and 3% had TB diagnosed.




         FOLLOW UP PROCESSES
With the HIV cohorts now nearing completion of enrollment, we will continue to follow up patients
through passive record review while continuing to work with the sites to maintain quality data and
to monitor data systems for study outcomes. The short term and long term outcomes are described
in Table 6 below.




                                                                                                 25

We will continue to monitor TIER.net and work with the sites to collect follow up data for patients
enrolled in the study. The Gantt chart below in Figure 4 show the timeline for follow up and
completion of data collection for protocol 1.

Data collection for short term endpoint for FTIC

The short term outcome for FTIC requires a 30 day follow up for each patient to assess the
percentage who initiate ART. FTIC follow up occurs through TIER.net through identification of the
initiation visit with verification through patient registers if needed. FTIC follow up has been
completed for 74% of patients who have currently been enrolled. All subjects are expected to reach
a short term outcome by December 2016. At that point we will need to verify data against patient
files for any subjects with missing data in TIER (e.g. should a backlog occur) with an expected date
of having all short term outcomes by February 2017. Below are outcomes for the patients who have
reached a primary short term outcome for FTIC. Currently 86% of patients in intervention sites and
84% of patients in control sites initiated ART within 30 days of eligibility.

       CONCLUSIONS
Enrollment into the HIV cohorts is nearing completion (estimated by end of October, 2016) and
enrollment into the TBHD cohorts is ongoing and on track to complete by end of December 2016.
While there have been challenges to getting the cohort enrolled, including delays in implementation
of the interventions and changes to the way the interventions have been implemented, the team has
been able to enrol subjects into the cohorts. These challenges have been overcome through a
combination of support from the World Bank and NDoH PIs to working with the sites to ensure
accurate record keeping and access to registers. The cohorts are now entering the follow up phase
for the HIV cohorts and work will shift to a mix of maintaining control over the quality of the cohort
data, completing enrollment into the TBHD cohorts and to beginning protocol 2 where we will
collect largely qualitative data from patients and providers to better understand how the rollout is
occurring and the impacts that it is having.
