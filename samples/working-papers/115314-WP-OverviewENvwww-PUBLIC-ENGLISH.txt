  These window sizes are guidelines and can be reviewed according to demand. The remaining 22%
is estimated for overhead costs: the ECS Administrator; ‘ECS marketplace’ website; IAs; Evaluation
Committee; and internal costs of the Marshal’s Offices.

 These values show the contribution from public resources. The total size of the services contract
will be larger, e.g. the 12 500 PLN maximum for an operational voucher will yield a 25 000 PLN services
contract (@ 50% co-financing rate), and the 120 000 PLN maximum for a strategic voucher will yield
a 200 000 PLN services contract (@ 60% co-financing rate).

Note: Clerk assistants were eligible for a bonus of 20%–40% of base salary from October 24th
to November 30th. Nine clerk assistants participated. Payout depended on the number of cases closed.
Even though the registration division was overwhelmed with work during this part of the year,
significant output gains were achieved, both in comparison to output in September 2016 (2609 cases),
average monthly output in 2016 (2115 cases/month), as well as in relation to the actual output in the same
period in 2015 (2340–2766 cases). Staffing levels did not change significantly, with 10 adjudicating staff
and 10 assistants employed full-time in the registration division in 2015 and eight adjudicating staff (plus
0.1 FTE of one judge) as well as nine assistants + two support staff in 2016. In the last week of October,
the daily output increased by 60% after the introduction of the bonus (1283 cases closed in seven work
