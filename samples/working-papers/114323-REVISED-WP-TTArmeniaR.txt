Abstract

Background
At present, tobacco taxes in Armenia are among the lowest in Europe and Central Asia.
Global experience has shown that increasing taxes on tobacco is one of the most cost-
effective public health interventions. This is particularly relevant for Armenia, where
smoking is among the leading risk factors of mortality among the population.


Methods
We conducted an extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) to assess the health,
financial, and distributional consequences of increases in the excise tax on cigarettes
in Armenia. Specifically, we estimated (i) the number of premature tobacco-related
deaths averted, (ii) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures related to treatment of
tobacco-related disease averted, (iii) the number of averted poverty cases (number of
individuals falling below the national poverty line as a result of incurred OOP medical
expenditures for tobacco-related disease treatment), (iv) the number of averted
catastrophic health expenditures (individuals spending more than 10 percent of
their consumption expenditure on tobacco-related treatment), and (v) government
savings resulting from averted treatment costs for those eligible for the government-
funded basic benefits package. We simulated a hypothetical price hike leading to an
excise tax rate of 75 percent of the retail price of cigarettes, as recommended by the
World Health Organization, which would be fully passed onto the consumers (current
Armenian male smoking population). In addition, we conducted a series of stakeholder
interviews to gain a better understanding of how tobacco tax increases were placed
on the political agenda in Armenia


Results
Increased excise taxes on tobacco would bring large health and financial benefits to
Armenian households and be pro-poor: about 88,000 premature deaths, US$ 63 million
of OOP medical expenditures, 22,000 poverty cases, and 33,000 cases of catastrophic
health expenditures would be averted. Government savings on tobacco-related
treatment costs would amount to US$ 26 million. Half of the premature deaths and
27 percent of poverty cases averted would be concentrated among the bottom 40
percent of the population.

The findings from the qualitative analysis suggest that the accession to the Eurasian
Economic Union in 2015 and the fiscal constraints faced by the government created a
window of opportunity for tobacco taxation to be placed on the policy agenda.


Conclusions
ECEA can be an important tool and input for policy decisions. In the case of Armenia,
the ECEA findings point to the potentially largely pro-poor aspect of increased
tobacco taxation.

Introduction

Tobacco use is a leading risk factor for premature mortality. Today, almost
7 million premature deaths per year are attributed to tobacco use globally,
with almost 20 percent of those deaths occurring in Europe and Central Asia.
(1) This can result in substantial societal costs, as half of those who die of
tobacco-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are in the prime of their
productive years.(2) Recent estimates indicate that the total economic cost of
smoking, including health expenditures and productivity losses, amounted
to US$ 1436 billion in 2012 (approximately 1.8 percent of the world’s annual
GDP).(3)

Acknowledging the dire consequences of the tobacco epidemic, in 2003
the World Health Assembly adopted the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC),(4) which has since
been ratified by 180 countries. The FCTC recommends a multidimensional
approach to reducing smoking, including demand-side interventions, such
as tax measures on tobacco products.(4) In 2015, countries renewed their
commitment for the fight against tobacco by pledging to strengthen the
implementation of the FCTC under the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).(5)

Price measures have been at the forefront of the fight against tobacco.(6–10)
Evidence has shown that price is the key determinant of smoking uptake
and cessation, with numerous studies having found that price increases on
cigarettes are highly effective in reducing demand by inducing smokers to
quit and deterring non-smokers from initiating.(8) In addition, higher prices
also result in current smokers reducing the number of cigarettes smoked daily
and prevent ex-smokers from returning to smoking.(8,9) While tax hikes can
generate additional revenue for development financing, as stated in the 2015
Addis Ababa Action Agenda and endorsed by the United Nations as part of
the SDGs,(11) the main objective of tobacco taxes is to discourage product
use and, as a result, avert the adverse health consequences of smoking.

The WHO recommends that countries increase the excise tax rate on tobacco
products to 75 percent.(7,12) There are two types of excise taxes: specific and
ad valorem. A specific excise tax is a fixed monetary value per quantity (e.g.
per pack or kilogram of tobacco), while an ad valorem excise tax is levied as a

percentage of the value of tobacco products (e.g. per retail price).(8) Unlike
other types of taxes, such as value-added tax (VAT), high specific excise
taxes can narrow the price gap between the types of cigarette brands and
encourage cessation rather than substitution to lower-priced cigarettes as
a result of tax increases.(9,13) However, only 33 countries so far have raised
tobacco excise tax rates to the WHO-recommended rate of 75 percent.
(7) Opponents, particularly the tobacco industry, have used the potential
“regressivity” of excise taxes as an argument against further tax increases to
build coalitions in opposition to cigarette price increases.(14–16) According
to the argument, since the poor spend a larger proportion of their disposable
income on smoking than the rich, increases in cigarette taxes and prices
could disproportionately hurt the poor.(17) Other commonly cited arguments
against increasing tobacco taxes include lost government revenue, job losses,
smuggling, and political unpopularity with the voters.(6,9)

With the SDGs, many international agencies such as the World Bank, are
encouraging governments to adopt policies that would reduce poverty and
boost shared prosperity by improving the living standards of the bottom
40 percent of the population.(18) Achieving these goals implies that policy
recommendations pay special attention to the distributional impact of any
reform to ensure that the poorer populations are benefiting the most.

Armenia represents a fitting country to examine the distributional impact
of increased tobacco taxes. It is a lower middle-income country with almost
30 percent of its population living today below the national poverty line
of around 41,700 AMD per month (approximately US$100).(19) In recent
years, Armenia’s economy has been hard hit due to regional and global
economic conditions. With a public debt approaching almost 55 percent
of its gross domestic product (GDP) and fiscal revenues representing only
22 percent of its GDP, Armenia is currently facing significant fiscal pressures.
(20) Furthermore, smoking prevalence is high and tobacco use is one of
the leading risk factors for premature mortality.(1) Almost 26 percent of
Armenian adults smoke, largely the men (53 percent smoking prevalence
among males as opposed to 2 percent among females).(21) Prevalence of
smoking is particularly high among men in the second and third wealth
quintiles of whom almost 60 percent smoke compared to 49 percent in
the poorest quintile and 42 percent in the highest quintile.(22) In spite of
an explicit publicly funded health benefits package, out-of-pocket (OOP)

healthcare expenditures represent almost 54 percent of the country’s total
health spending,(23) and 9 percent of households incur catastrophic health
expenditures (spending more than 25 percent of their nonfood expenditures
on health).(24)

Armenia was the first among the former Soviet Union countries to adopt
and ratify the FCTC, which was shortly followed by the adoption, in March
2005, of a national law on “Restrictions on the sale, consumption, and use
of tobacco” and a state program to control tobacco use.(25) Despite these
initial moves, the government subsequently failed to act,(26) and Armenia
now ranks behind many other countries in the region, such as Ukraine, Russia,
and Georgia, on tobacco control efforts.(7) In particular, tax measures have
remained inadequate to reduce demand for tobacco: tax as a share of the
price of the most-sold cigarette brand constituted 34 percent in 2014 (17
percent excise tax and 17 percent VAT), with a mean price per cigarette
pack of around US$ 1.25.(27) In 2015, the Armenian government approved a
package of draft laws to revise its tax code, including a proposal to increase
tobacco taxes, in order to raise revenues.(28)

In this paper, we explored the potential distributional impact of increasing
tobacco taxes in Armenia. We applied extended cost-effectiveness analysis
(ECEA) methods (29–31) to assess the health, financial, and distributional
consequences among smokers (males only, and by individual consumption
quintile) of increases in cigarette taxes. We also conducted a series of
qualitative interviews with key stakeholders to examine the agenda-setting
discourse surrounding the recently proposed tobacco tax increases
in Armenia.

Methods

Modeling approach
ECEA has been developed for health policy assessment (29,30) and applied
to a wide array of policies including tobacco taxation.(31,32) ECEA intends
to explicitly examine the outcomes of policy in multiple domains: the health
benefits (e.g., premature deaths averted), the financial consequences for
individuals and households (e.g., OOP expenditures averted due to disease
treatment averted), the corresponding financial risk protection (e.g., cases
of medical impoverishment or catastrophic health expenditures averted),
and the distributional consequences among the population (e.g., per
socioeconomic group, geographical setting). In doing so, it goes beyond
traditional cost-effectiveness analysis in enabling quantification of the
financial risk protection and equity (distributional) benefits of policy.(30)

Previous studies modeling the impact of tobacco tax increases have
investigated their aggregate impact, but few have explored their
distributional consequences. In addition, such studies focused their analysis
primarily on health gains and often did not explore the smokers’ financial
consequences related to treatment of tobacco-related diseases. Here we
built on a previously developed ECEA model for examining increases in
tobacco taxes (31,41) to examine the premature deaths averted, the OOP
expenditures averted and financial risk protection provided, and their
distributions across socioeconomic groups among male smokers, by an
increase in the excise taxes on tobacco products in Armenia.

Using the baseline excise tax rate of 17 percent and an average price per
pack of 525 AMD (approximately US$ 1.25),(27) we applied ECEA to simulate
a price increase leading to the WHO-recommended excise tax rate of
75 percent.(7) We estimated that correspondingly the average price per
cigarette pack would increase by 45 percent (to 756 AMD or US$ 1.80). We
assessed distributional impact in terms of: (i) averted premature tobacco-
related deaths; (ii) averted OOP expenditures on tobacco-related disease
treatment; (iii) government savings resulting from averted tobacco-related
disease treatment costs for those eligible for the government-funded basic
benefits package; (iv) averted cases of medical impoverishment (number
of individuals falling below the national poverty line as a result of OOP

  tobacco-related treatment costs); and (iv) averted cases of catastrophic health
  expenditures (number of individuals spending more than 10 percent of their
  individual consumption on tobacco-related treatment costs) (Figure 1).

  In Armenia, smoking is largely concentrated among men: 53 percent of
  males smoke compared to 2 percent of females.(22) Hence, we restricted
  our analysis to the current male population only, which we divided into
  five-year age groups (age 0 to 84 and a single group for all men above 84)
  using population estimates from the World Bank’s Health, Nutrition, and
  Population Statistics database.(33) The population was subsequently divided
  into individual consumption quintiles, and the maximum consumption for
  each quintile was estimated using the 2014 Integrated Living Conditions
  Survey (ILCS).(24) We applied these consumption quintile cutoffs and the Gini
  index (estimated from the 2014 ILCS) to simulate an individual consumption
  distribution using a Gamma distribution.(34,35) Age- and quintile-specific
  smoking prevalence rates were used to calculate the total number of smokers
  per each age group and consumption quintile.

10 percent of the population was classified as poor using the lower poverty
line and about 2 percent of the population lived below the food poverty line.

catastrophic health expenditures: 20 percent and 40 percent of individual
consumption. Table 1 gathers all the input parameters used in the model.
All analyses were conducted using R software (R 3.3.2).

Stakeholder interviews
Following Bump and Reich (51), to gain a better understanding of the
circumstances in which the current tax hike was proposed, we also conducted
a series of interviews with Armenian stakeholders. We focused on the two
stages of the policy cycle: the initial placement on the policy agenda or
“agenda setting” and the technical design of the reform proposal.(52,53)

Qualitative data for this analysis were collected through semi-structured
interviews, as well as published and grey literature on Armenia’s tobacco
control efforts. We used a purposeful sampling approach to identify
interviewees by constructing a preliminary list of stakeholders prior to arriving
in Armenia based on a literature review of tobacco control efforts in Armenia.
The interviews were conducted in Yerevan in June 2016. Interviewees
included representatives from the Ministry of Health (n=3), international
organizations (n=3), health professionals (n=2), local non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) (n=2), and universities (n=1). In total, we interviewed
eleven individuals (Table 2), using a semi-structured interview guide,
although stakeholders were encouraged to talk generally about tobacco
control efforts in Armenia. Contemporaneous notes were taken during the
interviews, and content analysis was performed once all interviews were
completed to identify relevant themes to the research question. This work was
supplemented by information and data extracted from national surveys, news
releases, and published research relating to tobacco control in Armenia.
The Harvard Human Research Protection Program granted an exemption
for this study.

                           Distributional impact
                           Increasing the price of cigarettes by 45 percent would avert approximately
                           88,000 premature deaths among current estimated quitters and non-initiators
                           (Table 3). Half of the premature deaths averted would be concentrated
                           among the bottom two quintiles, with only 10 percent of deaths averted
                           from the richest quintile. This is largely driven by the higher price elasticity
                           among the poor (almost 2.6 times higher among the poorest than the richest
                           quintile). In the sensitivity analyses, when assuming a flat price elasticity of
                           -0.54 across all quintiles, unsurprisingly, while the total number of premature
                           deaths averted would remain similar at about 86,000, its distribution would
                           be more uniform across quintiles and in line with the quintile-specific
                           smoking rates. Almost 20 percent of deaths would be averted in the richest
                           quintile compared to 17 percent in the poorest quintile (Supplementary
                           webappendix, Table A.1).

There would also be substantial savings in OOP and government medical
spending. As a result of averted tobacco-related disease treatment costs
among those eligible for the BBP, the government would save a total of
approximately US$ 26 million. In addition, almost US$ 63 million of OOP
expenditures related to tobacco-related disease treatment would be averted
among those not covered by the BBP. Almost 37 percent of these OOP
savings would accrue to the bottom two quintiles, with an additional 30
percent accruing to the middle quintile in which fewer individuals were
eligible for the BBP. When we assumed a flat price elasticity by quintile, OOP
savings were slightly larger in magnitude (US$ 67 million), and almost 27
percent of those would accrue to the richest quintile compared to 28 percent
in the bottom two quintiles (Supplementary webappendix, Table A.1).

With a 45 percent tobacco price increase, almost 22,000 poverty cases
would be averted. Given that 30 percent of the population already lived
below the poverty line, no poverty cases would be averted among this
bottom 30 percent of the population. Almost 27 percent of the averted
poverty cases would accrue to the second poorest quintile and 14 percent
to the richest quintile. Testing the sensitivity to the poverty threshold retained
in the estimation, our results indicate that under a lower poverty line of about
US$ 948 per year, the number of poverty cases averted would slightly rise to
23,000; under the food poverty line of US$ 672 per year, 24,000 poverty cases
would be averted (Supplementary webappendix, Table A.2). Similarly, almost
33,000 cases of catastrophic health expenditures (defined as health spending
representing more than 10 percent of individual consumption) would
be averted.

Stakeholder interviews
Tobacco control efforts in Armenia have diminished after FCTC ratification.
(26) Despite the existence of FCTC-recommended policies, the government
has not been able to strengthen tobacco control measures, particularly
in relation to raising excise taxes on tobacco products. In our interviews,
all stakeholders emphasized that Armenia was the first among the former
Soviet Union countries to ratify the FCTC. The early push for tobacco control
measures in Armenia was largely attributed to former President Robert
Kocharyan, himself a non-smoker, who strongly advocated for the FCTC
implementation and encouraged other government members to quit
smoking. In the absence of a strong public supporter, the importance of
tobacco control measures subsided after Kocharyan left office in 2008. While

    Estimating the distributional impact of increasing taxes on tobacco products: In Armenia




the Ministry of Health was a proponent of stronger tobacco control measures,
particularly increased taxation, most interviewees suggested that it was not
a powerful player in discussions on fiscal policy. In addition, the tobacco
industry previously held a strong lobby in the Parliament, with several
former tobacco industry executives having served on the Parliamentary
Standing Committee on Financial Credit and Budgetary Affairs and Standing
Committee on Economic Affairs. This resulted in several draft laws on tobacco
control measures being recalled from the Parliament.

Economic pressures, however, presented a window of opportunity for an
overhaul of the existing tax system. In 2015, Armenia was facing continuing
fiscal constraints, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) supported measures to raise additional revenues.(20) In addition,
Armenia’s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015 resulted
in its own set of tax measures and regulations, including the mandated
harmonization of rates of excise duties on alcohol and tobacco products
over the next five years.(54,55) As a result, in October 2015, the government
approved a package of draft laws on the tax code, which placed tobacco
excise taxes on the government agenda. More specifically, the recently
amended and approved tax code mandates that excise rates for alcohol and
tobacco are to increase by 15 percent per year over 2017-2021, resulting in a
tobacco excise tax of 44 percent by 2021.(20)

Based on the discussions with key stakeholders and a literature review, it
became evident that unlike previous unsuccessful attempts, two important
contextual factors helped to garner support for the inclusion of higher excise
tobacco taxes in the new tax code: tobacco tax increases were included
alongside tax increases on other goods and services, including labor income
tax; and it was seen as an inevitable step for the harmonization of taxes in the
Eurasian Economic Union.

The design of the tax reforms in Armenia was based on two key principles:
the new tax system should enhance growth and equity; and it should
generate revenue to support fiscal consolidation and allow higher social and
capital expenditures.(20,56) In relation to tobacco excise taxes, the focus on
equity was particularly important. Based on the discussions with stakeholders,
regressivity appeared to be an important factor in delaying increased tobacco
taxes since FCTC ratification. To address the equity concerns, the World Bank
and the IMF provided technical assistance to simulate various scenarios




                                                                                          21
of proposed tax increases on various products, including tobacco.(20,56)
Experience from other countries, such as the Philippines, played an important
role in assuaging the regressivity concerns and allowing the Ministry of
Finance to move forward with the proposed changes.

Regressivity more so than any other commonly used argument against
tobacco taxation – such as loss of revenues or smuggling – was at the center
of the tobacco tax discussion. In several interviews, stakeholders stated
that Armenia had strong tax and customs administration systems. Tobacco
products, as other goods and imports, have holographic labels and unique
identification codes; and tax officers commonly make sample purchases to
scan and test the information provided on the products. This was argued to
be a strong deterrent to smuggling. In addition, two individuals interviewed
cited the ease of tobacco tax increases. Unlike other proposed tax changes,
the interviewees noted that tobacco and alcohol taxes were easier to enforce
and did not require any additional regulation. As a result, the higher tobacco
and alcohol taxes entered into force on January 1, 2017, while the remaining
changes to the budget code will be implemented in the following year.(20)

While several interviewees cited examples from the Philippines and Thailand,
where tobacco and alcohol taxes are earmarked for health, the possibility of
earmarking was not discussed at length, and few interviewees supported
this idea. Stakeholders cited the danger of setting a precedent, which would
result in other ministries and government agencies requesting their own
earmarked sources. In addition, one stakeholder cited the unsuccessful
attempt to earmark proceeds from a VAT on medicines for health in 2001
as a reason why earmarking tobacco taxes would not be a viable policy
in Armenia. Therefore, the discussion of earmarking was not pursued
extensively for tobacco taxes.

Tobacco tax was seen as an important measure to reduce consumption, but
all stakeholders emphasized that other FCTC measures should be enforced.
They stressed in particular the importance of raising public awareness
and enforcing smoke-free zones. Moreover, they indicated that while
they supported further tobacco tax increases, they believed that national
cessation support services (currently not available in Armenia) should follow
in order to realize the full benefits of higher prices for cigarettes.

Discussion

The ECEA results indicate that higher excise taxes on tobacco in Armenia
would avert large numbers of premature deaths and poverty cases. With a hike
to a 75 percent excise tax rate, 88,000 premature deaths, US$ 63 million of OOP
medical expenditures, 22,000 poverty cases (or 33,000 cases of catastrophic
health expenditures) would be averted. Because the poor are more sensitive to
price changes, the health benefits would be concentrated among the bottom
two consumption quintiles of the population. Given that a larger share of the
poor are eligible for the BBP and thus exempt from OOP payments, the benefits
of averted tobacco-related disease treatment costs would accrue to the middle
quintiles 3 and 4, less than 30 percent of whom are BBP-eligible. Government
savings on tobacco-related treatment costs for those BBP-eligible would
amount to US$ 26 million, which represents almost 12 percent of the annual
health budget (estimated at US$ 220 million in 2014).(23)

The fiscal constraints faced by the government and the accession to the
Eurasian Economic Union in 2015 mandated a comprehensive overhaul of
the existing tax policy and created a window of opportunity for tobacco tax
increases. While previous attempts to increase tobacco taxes were unsuccessful
in part due to veto power in the Parliament, the comprehensive nature of the
tax reform allowed tobacco measures to be included in the proposal. Despite
initial concerns about the regressivity of tobacco taxes, the findings from
stakeholder interviews suggested that experience from other countries and
simulations of the potential impact of such taxes on the poor were strong
arguments for raising tobacco taxes as part of the overall fiscal reform. Our case
study of Armenia presents evidence of what would be a successful attempt to
increase tobacco excise taxes as part of a broader reform of a governmental
tax system, yet the proposed excise tax of 44 percent (to be achieved by 2021)
remains well below WHO’s recommendations.

Nevertheless our analysis presents a number of limitations. First, we were
not able to calculate the price elasticity of demand for tobacco products
in Armenia, and our model was based on price elasticity estimates from
the Kyrgyz Republic. Yet, the Kyrgyz price elasticities fell within the range
of elasticities estimated in developing countries.(8) In addition, to test the
sensitivity of our findings to price elasticity assumptions, we also simulated
impact using a flat price elasticity across all quintiles. Second, we did not model
substitution effects of individuals switching to lower-priced cigarettes as a
result of price increases. However, unlike other types of taxes, high specific
excise taxes would narrow the price gap between the most and least expensive
cigarettes and encourage cessation rather than substitution to lower-priced




                                                                                           23
cigarettes as a result of tax increases.(9,13). Third, we assumed that a decline in
the intensity of smoking would not yield any health benefits: individuals who
would reduce their tobacco consumption and smoke fewer cigarettes per day as
a result of tax hike would not improve their health outcomes in our model; nor
did we model second-hand smoking. As a result, we are likely to underestimate
the full impact of higher tobacco taxes in our premature deaths and financial
risk protection findings. Fourth, in the absence of data on OOP expenditures per
disease, we used the BBP price list as a proxy for the incurred OOP expenditures.
Although this is the official government price for services in all government
facilities, there is some evidence of informal payments.(57) In addition, data
on pharmaceutical expenditures on medicines not covered by the BBP were
not available and hence could not be included. Our results thus are likely to
underestimate the expenditures related to tobacco-related disease treatment
and the number of poverty cases averted, since OOP medical expenditures are
likely to be higher than the established government fees for the BBP. Fifth, we
only included the cost of inpatient care, as we were not able to obtain detailed
data on utilization for each disease and associated costs at the primary health
care level. Primary care, however, is free for all citizens in Armenia. Therefore
individuals should not incur any OOP at the primary care level. Sixth, the health
and health-related financial benefits are modeled into the future (for the current
Armenian male population), when individuals are expected to face tobacco-
related diseases. Hence, there is wide uncertainty in our assumptions, as we
assume that key inputs (e.g., consumption, cost of medical services, utilization,
BBP coverage) remain the same. Seventh, we assumed that the excise tax would
be passed fully onto the consumer. Although this is a standard assumption in
tobacco tax modeling studies,(6,8) the empirical evidence is mixed,(8,58–61)
hence we may overestimate here the effect of increased excise taxes.

Our study contributes to the literature on tobacco taxation and the distributional
impact of higher cigarette prices and taxes. While the regressivity argument
has been commonly used against price increases and was perceived to be a
constraint to increase tobacco taxes in Armenia, similarly to other recent studies
we do not find evidence of higher tobacco prices necessarily disproportionately
burdening the poor. As recent studies have found, the higher responsiveness
to prices among the poor may shift the burden of incremental taxes to the rich,
thus making tobacco taxes more progressive.(31,32,62) Not only can higher
excise taxes reduce the number of deaths through smoking cessation,(63)
but they can also decrease potential OOP expenditures on treatment for
tobacco-related disease. Given the large costs associated with such treatment,
by encouraging smokers to quit or averting initiation, tobacco taxes can bring
substantial financial risk protection to individuals by preventing such OOP
medical expenditures altogether.(31)

    Estimating the distributional impact of increasing taxes on tobacco products: In Armenia




While the health benefits associated with smoking cessation have been well
established, this has not been necessarily enough to encourage countries to
raise tobacco taxes. Identifying the potential windows of opportunities (e.g.
fiscal constraints) has important policy implications and could enable a push
for higher tobacco taxes. As the global health community encourages the
use of fiscal policies to change behavior (e.g. tobacco taxes, sugar-sweetened
beverage taxes) in order to achieve public health gains, the sole public
health argument might be insufficient. The case of Armenia suggests that
governments could successfully increase tobacco taxes by including them
as part of broader fiscal reforms. While the proposal to raise excise taxes in
Armenia marks an important step, the proposed rate of 44 percent remains
well below the WHO recommendation. Concerted efforts need to be taken in
order to ensure that further tax increases are implemented and other tobacco
control measures are enacted according to the FCTC and best practices.

Table 1 presents the estimated elasticities. The overall price elasticity is -0.54.
This price elasticity is consistent with findings from other studies, which have
found elasticities ranging from -0.4 to -0.8.(8) Similarly to findings from other
studies,(8,32) we also found that price elasticities varied across quintiles, with
the poor more responsive to prices than the rich (elasticities of -0.74 and -0.28
in quintiles 1 and 5, respectively).
