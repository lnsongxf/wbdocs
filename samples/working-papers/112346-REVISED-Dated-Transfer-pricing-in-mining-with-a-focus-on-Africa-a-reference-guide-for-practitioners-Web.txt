     By Boubacar Bocoum


     The number of extractive resources rich countries has steadily increased over the past quarter of
     a century, particularly in the case of low- to middle-income countries. Some estimate that by 2030
     half of the global population living on less than two dollars a day will reside in extractive-driven
     countries. Capturing appropriate revenues from nonrenewable extractive resources is, therefore,
     of paramount importance for domestic income mobilization for developing countries, and a major
     potential source of poverty reduction and inclusive growth.

     Considerations required to enforce mineral contractual agreements, especially as they relate to
     taxes, royalties and other mineral revenue streams have received relatively less attention in the
     past. This is changing with increasing research and publications on the subject, including by the
     World Bank Group*1and its partners, together with other stakeholders.

     Specifically mining, which as an industry is broader and more diverse than oil and gas, has been
     expanding at a time when the multinational enterprises involved have been structuring their oper-
     ations in ways that result in a spread of their functions, assets and risks across multiple related
     entities located in different jurisdictions. This trend, which is especially prominent in Africa and
     in countries with similar economic circumstances, results in value-adding activities moving away
     from the countries hosting the mining operations. As a consequence, the volume of goods and ser-
     vices provided through cross-border transactions between related entities expands, and the price
     charged for them demands more attention and proper assessment for tax calculation.

     Many developing countries are yet to be fully equipped to deal with transfer pricing risks in general,
     and even less so for those associated with mineral commodities. This need for support motivated
     the World Bank Group (WBG), in cooperation with the International Mining for Development Cen-
     tre (IM4DC) of Australia and the Transfer Pricing Division of the South African Revenue Services
     (SARS), to develop this Guidebook to address how established transfer pricing principles for intra-
     group transactions could best be implemented in the context of the mining industry.

     This publication identifies typical mining functions and activities and their associated assets and
     risks, and those amenable to related party transactions and related transfer pricing risks; investigates
     key commodities mined in Africa profiling their transfer pricing risks; provides sources of informa-
     tion to assist tax auditors to deal with the scarcity of relevant comparables; and discusses audits,
     capacity building and institutional methodologies and approaches to enhance compliance with pay-
     ment of mineral taxes. It is a menu of options and possibilities that may be adapted to the individual
     circumstances of countries as they tackle their specific mining related transfer pricing challenges.

     While this Guidebook is comprehensive in suggesting solutions to mining transfer pricing issues,
     its main messages have also been captured in a spinoff report**2for stakeholders other than tax
     administration professionals interested in contributing to the discourse on extractive tax collection
     administration. This Guidebook has also been the basis for the development of specialised training
     modules to be delivered through regional workshops to public, private and civil society stakehold-
     ers interested in the topic.

Foreword



     T   he practice of transfer pricing is a multifaceted exercise drawing from the disciplines of account-
         ing, economics, law, and of course tax. Included in this Guidebook Transfer Pricing in Mining
     with Focus on Africa: A reference guide for practitioners is the observation that most mineral-rich Afri-
     can nations have or are in the process of developing a transfer pricing legislative framework, but
     effective enforcement of the rules is often lacking.

     The importance of the resources sector in Africa cannot be overstated. The African Natural
     Resources Center has estimated that Africa holds around 30% of the world’s known mineral
     reserves, together with significant levels of remaining global oil and gas reserves. In this context,
     unsurprisingly, many jurisdictions in Africa have identified effective transfer pricing regimes as a
     frontline tool to ensure they receive their ‘fair share’ of global tax revenues on the profits associated
     with the extraction and sale of mineral commodities by multinational enterprises (MNEs).

     Transfer pricing capability and specific mining industry knowledge have been identified as factors
     inhibiting enforcement efforts on the African continent. This Guidebook considers transfer pricing
     at both a theoretical and practical level, and the content can be considered to be ‘best in class’ in the
     context of current international practice and thinking.

     The content in the Guidebook is highly consistent with current work on transfer pricing at the
     OECD/G20 level. For example, the ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’ (BEPS) project has as its key
     objective the design of measures that lead to greater alignment between profit outcomes and the
     true economic contribution by entities in a given tax jurisdiction. With specific reference to transfer
     pricing, it is clear from the OECD guidance that transfer pricing analyses require careful examina-
     tion of the actual conditions agreed by the related parties together with a focus on their ‘economic
     substance’. The commentary in the Guidebook proceeds along these lines, while emphasizing the
     importance of a transfer pricing analysis grounded in a comprehensive economic and functional
     analysis.

     It is recognized that MNEs have significant scope to structure their global value chains in ways
     that are ‘tax efficient’ as part of their drive for commercial efficiency, and proper application of the
     arm’s length principle goes beyond merely pricing the actual conditions agreed by different parts
     of an MNE group. These considerations are addressed, as recognized in the Guidebook, by ensur-
     ing the ‘conditions’ surrounding a transaction make commercial sense and reflect conditions that
     would have been agreed on between independent parties operating at arm’s length.

     The Guidebook considers a number of topical issues in the transfer pricing arena. Three stand out
     as being of particular importance: the real assumption/allocation of risk; organizational structures
     common in the resources sector; and intra-group financing. All of these give rise to important ques-
     tions in relation to economic substance.

     Risk issues have been identified as part of the OECD/G20 BEPS Project as integral to transfer
     pricing analyses given that returns naturally follow risk. The ability of MNEs to ‘tax plan’ around
     the contractual assignment and reassignment of risk was noted in the Actions 8–10—2015 Final
     Reports Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes with Value Creation. The OECD has emphasized that this
     is an area where economic substance, expressed in terms of an entity’s financial capacity to assume
     the risk, together with an ability to exercise control over the risk, will be the basis for determin-
     ing the correct allocation of the risk for transfer pricing purposes. Included in the Guidebook is

    discussion and guidance on this issue in the context of a functional analysis and an understanding
    of the global value chain.

    Centralized ‘hubs’ are identified in the Guidebook as being commonplace in MNEs’ organiza-
    tional structures in the resources sector. Marketing hubs can take a variety of forms, but typically
    involve an intermediary acting as an agent or principal in relation to the procurement or sale of the
    mineral commodities. It is the Australian experience that these structures are common. Given the
    quantities of commodities that are sold through (or have their sale facilitated by) marketing hubs,
    the potential tax implications are significant. A key focus of the compliance effort is on ensuring
    the overall allocation of profit from major resource projects is reflective of the relative economic
    contribution made by each entity in the MNE value chain—emphasizing in particular the major
    source of value being the upstream producing asset. A focus on the economic substance together
    with questions regarding management and control of risk are highly relevant, as are questions in
    relation to whether or not independent parties would enter into the same or similar arrangements,
    and if so, the conditions they would have agreed. An important threshold question relates to the
    extent to which the marketing hub can in substance add value to the global group’s operations
    through influencing the price of the underlying commodity, the cost of production and transport,
    or the quantities that are sold.

    Intra-group financing is recognized as a key area of focus for transfer pricing, and difficult ques-
    tions (such as the extent to which the notion of ‘arm’s length conditions’ can include consideration
    of an entity’s capital structure) are frequently encountered. Included in the Guidebook are details
    in relation to the types of intra-group financing issues encountered in practice, together with a dis-
    cussion of the linkages between thin capitalization rules and transfer pricing.

    In summary, the Guidebook achieves the goal of providing a detailed analysis of both the theory
    and practice of transfer pricing in the mining sector. It includes useful industry information in rela-
    tion to the sector, extensive commentary and guidance on the application of the arm’s length prin-
    ciple, and a description of several current compliance ‘hot spots’ for revenue authorities globally.
    A transfer pricing analysis can be seen as daunting to tax officials not well versed in the practice,
    but the Guidebook represents a ‘how to’ manual to facilitate the effective enforcement of transfer
    pricing regimes across the African continent.

         T    he World Bank Group, led by the Energy and Extractives Global Practice, has been at the fore-
              front of offering advice on good practices, as well as on undertaking diagnostic visits and
         building capacity of developing countries on mineral tax administration. It has adopted a phased
         approach—wherein it undertakes research and disseminates findings through publication of the
         results which informs the development of training modules delivered through workshops. The
         first phase of work led to the publication of the sourcebook titled “How to Improve Mining Tax
         Administration and Collection Frameworks.”1 The document provides policy makers and other
         stakeholders with a framework to assess and process various types of royalties systems; principles
         of their administration including valuation points, costs deductibility, assessments and auditing;
         elements of mining specific components of corporate income tax; implications of some incentives
         and their possible impacts on tax payments; procedures for administering various types of pay-
         ments to Governments, human resources, institutional collaboration, coordination, and capacity
         building; and information sharing required to drive compliance of mining taxation payments. The
         work has been more focused on revenues accruing starting from the development stage and on
         informing strategies to drive compliance of payments while acknowledging governance is also a
         significant influencing factor.

         The need for a complementary study focusing on transfer pricing (TP), specifically in the context
         of mining in developing countries, was clearly identified by a number of reviews and workshops
         conducted by the World Bank Group (WBG) during phase one. This was later corroborated by a
         TP questionnaire administered to a large number of tax administrations in Africa,2 which indicated
         that while most administrations have in place or are in the processes of developing an adequate
         legislative basis to address TP issues, with a few exceptions, enforcement of TP rules to date has
         been modest or lacking all together. This state of affairs is attributable inter alia to the limited
         capacity of most tax administrations to deal with the complexity of TP issues in mining because
         of both a lack of specific TP expertise and of intimate knowledge of this industry sector, which is
         largely attributable to the current inadequacy of the resources that most African governments can
         direct to address this situation and access to relevant information from the taxpayers. This study
         has been conducted with cognizance of the G20/OECD’s BEPS Action Plan, the views expressed
         in the related discussion papers and industry’s comments, and its final recommendations released
         at the end of 2015.

         Of particular concern to developing countries is the current trend for multinational enterprises
         (MNEs) to fragment their mining operations in such a way that many functions, assets and risks
         are located across entities or hubs frequently resident in low-tax jurisdictions. MNEs generally
         contend that consolidation of specialized functions into hubs servicing their global operations is
         not driven primarily by tax-minimization considerations, but by the objective of achieving critical
         mass, proximity to customers, shipping and trade centers, and having research facilities in desir-
         able locations that optimize execution of their business activities. While in the final analysis MNEs
         exercise their discretion as to how they wish to structure their global business to achieve the best
         outcome for their shareholders, they must ensure that the degree to which the tax base of the source
         country is eroded as profit is shifted abroad is commensurate to the value actually added by their
         overseas subsidiaries.

    In some cases, fragmentation of the supply chain results in the mining subsidiary in the source
    country performing mostly routine functions utilizing primarily tangible assets, that is to say oper-
    ating as ‘contract miners’ do. By contrast, many of the specialized services are provided to the
    miner through cross-border transactions with related parties on the basis of TPs that are difficult to
    verify and audit and, therefore, open to interpretation and possible manipulation.

    It has also been widely recognized that developing countries are experiencing difficulty in apply-
    ing the OECD’s TP Guidelines and methodologies to verify industry’s compliance with the arm’s
    length principle because of the paucity of comparables with relevance to mining in the African
    context, an issue which is currently being reviewed under a G20 mandate by the OECD, WBG and
    IMF. The picture may be further complicated by the possible presence of double taxation agree-
    ments (DTAs) that in some cases may create opportunities for ‘treaty shopping’.

    Clearly no tax administration is in a position to systematically audit all areas of risk to government
    revenue. It was intended that this study should help most by focusing specifically on mapping
    the TP risk points at various stages of the mining supply chain with the objective of assisting in
    formulating effective strategies to prioritize the TP audit efforts and concentrate scarce resources
    and training toward financially significant high-risk transactions, while devising simplified meth-
    odologies to address routine low-risk transactions. To achieve this, a detailed functional analysis of
    all the activities involved in the mining value chain was carried out, including consideration of the
    typical assets and risks involved in them. In addition, an inventory of all the mining projects for
    major commodities in Africa was acquired and the various operations categorized in terms of their
    size/ore throughput and whether open pit or underground. On this basis a breakdown of the capi-
    tal and recurrent operating cost components for various types and sizes of mines was produced for
    the different commodities to get an idea of the magnitude of the cash flows involved in the various
    key functions and of the potential scale of and susceptibility to TP risks of the related transac-
    tions. This analysis, complemented by discussion of some illustrative case studies, not unexpect-
    edly highlighted that the main areas of risk in terms of government revenue are in the provision of
    marketing, finance, engineering and technical services and of insurance and legal services and, to
    a lesser degree, of routine corporate services.

    The study also considered the skills inventory and structural, procedural, internal and external
    communication options and strategies that would contribute to creating an effective and efficient
    tax administration in terms of its TP related activities in a developing country and advanced sug-
    gestions as to how to pursue them. Besides specific training initiatives, these included second-
    ing of external experts in tax administration to facilitate process improvement and knowledge
    transfer, greater co-operation and pooling of specialized transfer pricing resources between differ-
    ent jurisdictions, including the establishment of ad hoc or regional Multinational Transfer Pricing
    Units (MNTPU), in line with the OECD’s Tax Inspectors without Borders initiative, supported by
    well-constructed knowledge-sharing and e-learning platforms. In essence the main findings of the
    study as presented in this Guidebook are of practical relevance to the needs of tax practitioners in
    mineral-rich developing countries, assisting in their progressive development and implementa-
    tion of good TP policy, rules, systems and procedures aligned to the fundamental arm’s length
    principle.

          This publication presents the results of a study on transfer pricing (TP) with specific focus on min-
          ing in Africa commissioned in early 2014 by the World Bank Group (WBG) in partnership with the
          International Mining for Development Centre (IM4DC).3 The study, which was coordinated by the
          Centre for Exploration Targeting (CET)4 and benefitted from inputs from a range of other relevant
          organizations, represents a component of a more broadly based effort undertaken by the WBG and
          IM4DC to identify the needs of, and strengthen the mining taxation administration and collection
          frameworks and capacity of, mineral-rich tax jurisdictions in Africa as well as other developing
          countries.

          This reference guide is a part of the wider WBG engagement in supporting countries with Domes-
          tic Resource Mobilization (DRM) by protecting their tax base and has benefitted from effective
          collaboration with the International Finance Corporation,5 and with the South African Revenue
          Service (SARS). Because of its specific focus on the mining sector, this reference guide represents a
          valuable complement to the WBG’s more broadly based handbook on “Transfer Pricing and Devel-
          oping Economies” which is being published concurrently with it. References to relevant chapters of
          this handbook are provided for readers throughout the report.

          While mineral commodity prices have fallen significantly since their peak in 2012, lessening some-
          what the political pressure to reform and build administrative capacity in mining taxation, they
          will invariably recover in the medium term. It would be foolish not to recognize that mining will
          continue to be a cornerstone of economic development in Africa and, as a consequence, pressing on
          to resolve mineral taxation related issues is a matter of urgency.

          Phase III of the project has now been planned to cover the production of an abridged version of the
          handbook written for a less versant, broader audience with specialized tax matters and practical
          training materials to support future training workshops specifically focused on transfer pricing in
          mining to be delivered in Africa and elsewhere.


1.1  Needs Identification
          In response to concerns from African countries that their tax revenues from the mining sector did
          not adequately reflect recent increases in commodity prices and companies’ profits, in 2011 the
          WBG contracted the CET to conduct research and field reviews of the mining taxation policy and
          administrative procedures of a number of mineral-rich Sub-Saharan African countries. Co-funding

           tion is now used as the basis for workshops attended by senior tax practitioners from the Ministries
           of Finance and Mines of a large number of resource-rich countries.6 The workshops conducted to
           date in Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania and Ethiopia have proven invaluable in facilitating exchange
           and cross-fertilisation of ideas and in identifying pressing emerging mining taxation issues such
           as the high vulnerability of tax revenues to transfer mispricing in the mining sector. The UN’s
           Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA)7 estimated illicit financial outflows from Africa due to
           mispricing at USD50bn a year, echoing the African Development Bank that specifically identified
           “. . . inefficient taxation of extractive activities and the inability to fight abuses of TP by multina-
           tional enterprises . . .”8 as a significant cause of tax base erosion in developing countries.

           Research and capacity building in the area of transfer pricing in the mining sector is crucial, par-
           ticularly given its rapid growth in economic importance,9 its global nature and high technical and
           logistical complexity, and the prevalence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) as the main actors
           in the sector.

           It must be emphasised that the scope of this guidebook is limited to transfer pricing in mining
           and does not cover other forms of possible revenue leakages as, for instance, due to corruption
           in industry and government practices, trade misinvoicing,10 inappropriate tax incentives, fiscal
           regimes unattractive to FDI, inadequate mining tenement charges, company failures, etc.

           The trend has been for MNEs to fragment their supply chains through complex corporate struc-
           tures of subsidiaries, often registered in low-tax jurisdictions, process and/or market the mining
           products, and provide a range of services and assets to mining subsidiaries in developing coun-
           tries resulting in high volumes of cross-border transactions between related parties. This has the
           effect of shifting taxable income from the country where mining takes place to foreign jurisdictions.
           Some MNEs further reduced the total tax levied by the source country by locating their overseas
           subsidiaries in a manner that exploits existing networks of double taxation agreements (DTAs),
           limiting withholding tax rates. The challenge is for source countries to apply a treaty policy that
           is better aligned with their interests, including revision and cancellation of existing DTAs. While
           the substance and justification for these structures might be questionable, these tax minimisation
           strategies are nonetheless often legal.

           By contrast some MNEs that exploit opportunities for transfer mispricing by under­  charging for
           outbound supplies of mineral products and overpaying for inbound assets, services and finance
           provided by their subsidiaries to their mining operation further erode the tax base of the source
           country.

          It is widely recognised that administration of transfer pricing legislation11 and ensurance of com-
          pliance with the arm’s-length principle pose a significant challenge for developing countries in
          assessing whether the transfer prices used, that is to say the price imputed to goods and services
          transferred in transactions between related-parties, are in line with those that would have been
          agreed to by independent parties under comparable circumstances. These difficulties arise due
          inter alia to the current inadequate resourcing with consequent paucity of specialist auditing
          expertise in the tax authorities of many developing countries, and the general difficulty and cost in
          obtaining relevant information (OECD, 2014).12

          In the mining sector, these challenges are compounded by the relative complexity of the sector,
          which can involve high-value transactions often including hard-to-value intangibles and by a lack
          of comparable industry specific data, knowledge and experience within tax administrations.

          Erosion of the tax base of some developing countries is further aggravated by poorly conceived fis-
          cal incentives, particularly certain forms of tax holidays and generous capital and depletion allow-
          ances, which were provided in the past in an effort to attract FDI in mineral exploration and mining
          at times of lower commodity prices. These concessions were often made with inadequate under-
          standing of their potential long-term consequences and locked in by stability agreements which
          restrict the capacity of governments to realign their fiscal packages at times when rising commod-
          ity prices leverage companies’ profits well in excess of corresponding rises in government revenue.

          All these factors collectively place significant pressure on the administrative and resourcing capac-
          ity of many tax administrations, limiting their current capacity to adequately monitor and address
          transfer pricing risks, creating opportunities for TP mispricing.

          The action plan recommended by the OECD (2013)13 and the final reports (2015)14 to address base
          erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), particularly the revised chapters of the OECD TP Guidelines,
          and initiatives by the UN (2011)15 and other major international institutions besides the WBG, are
          initial steps in specifically addressing the unique characteristics of transfer pricing issues arising in
          the mining sector, which are critical in the context of developing countries.


1.2  Objectives and Nature of the Current Study
          The current study complements initiatives by the WBG and other international institutions, which
          deliver economy-wide technical assistance on the implementation and enforcement of transfer
          pricing legislation, by focusing specifically on the mining sector in mineral-rich developing coun-
          tries, particularly in Africa.

          The objective of the study was to fill some of the identified expertise gaps by specifically map-
          ping the key related party transactions and transfer pricing risks at various stages of the mining
          value-adding chain to formulate a practical framework to assist tax administrations in mineral-
          rich developing countries with prioritization of their transfer pricing audit efforts. The aim is to
          concentrate scarce resources and training toward financially significant high-risk transactions, i.e.,
          the more complex the arrangement with high cash flows, hard-to-value specialized expertise and


          11
            If a country has no transfer pricing legislation, it might be able to address TP issues relying on its domestic law
          (including any DTAs which may be in force) and on more general law arguments, such as substance over form, legal
          characteristics or even other tax outcomes available under their law (e.g., anti-avoidance). This does, however, risk
          coming at the cost of undermining the investment climate by reducing the predictability of tax administration.

            use of intangible assets. The use of simplified methodologies or preventative measures (such as
            legislative or practical safe harbors or advanced pricing agreements) may be considered to address
            routine or low-risk transactions. These measures are viewed as a way for tax administrations to
            manage the use of their own scarce resources and lower the compliance costs providing valuable
            certainty to miners. However, due to the complexity and time required to put such measures in
            place, the decision to adopt them would ultimately rest with individual jurisdictions and are infre-
            quently used in Africa.

            Finally, the study was also designed to identify and highlight critical capacity building and special-
            ized training needs in the area of transfer pricing in the African mining sector, and present possible
            strategies to effectively address their delivery.

            It was intended that the results of the study should be captured and presented in the form of this
            sourcebook, compiled with the aim to be a practical reference for tax officials in mineral-rich devel-
            oping countries, to assist them with the identification, prioritization and addressing of key transfer
            pricing risks, in support of their progressive development and implementation of good TP poli-
            cies, rules, systems and procedures in their countries aligned with the fundamental arm’s length
            principle (ALP).

            The study was initiated and supervised by Mr. Boubacar Bocoum of the WBG and technically
            directed by Prof. Pietro Guj of the CET. Although this study was co-ordinated by the CET, it made
            use of expertise and information provided by a number of participating organizations and individ-
            uals. These included, besides the WBG, the University of the Witwatersrand, tax authorities in key
            mineral economies (e.g., the Australian Tax Office [ATO] and the South African Revenue Services
            [SARS]), and mining taxation practitioners from both industry and accounting firms, particularly
            Transfer Pricing Associates (TPA).16


1.3  Structure of This Guidebook
            The Source Book opens with this Introductory chapter identifying the need for the study and the
            way it was conducted. This is followed by the main body of the book that includes three parts. Part
            A (The mining industry and transfer pricing) identifies what are the most common transfer pric-
            ing issues in mining in general and where they are likely to occur along the mining value chain.
            Part B (The mining industry in Africa and transfer pricing) considers the same issues specifically
            in the context of the main commodities currently mined in Africa. This part and its related appen-
            dices provide a comprehensive inventory of current mining operations in Africa and information
            about the revenue and cost structure of typical operations to help establish a methodology for the
            assessment and prioritisation of transfer pricing risks, supported by practical examples and case
            studies. Part C (Institutional and administrative capacity) then relates to the question of how to
            prioritise and address the issues covered in Parts A and B and discusses the resourcing, skills and
            organizational structures necessary to ensure that the arm’s length principle is successfully abided
            to. In more detail:

            Part A, The Mining Industry and Transfer Pricing:

                 ■■   Analyzes the nature of the mining cycle and the various stages of its value chain in general
                      terms from mineral exploration, through mining and processing to the marketing of its
                      final products.

        ■■   Maps the main activities carried out in each stage and the functional supplier-user rela-
             tionship between successive functions, as well as their likelihood of resulting in cross-
             border, related-party transactions involving TPs.
        ■■   Considers their characteristics (whether routine or complex), the tangible versus intan-
             gible assets/intellectual property content provided and the degree of risk borne by the
             parties as key factors in determining an appropriate TP.
        ■■   Analyzes this information with the aim of highlighting the main TP mispricing risk points
             in each of the mining stages to help concentrate auditing efforts, given the limited avail-
             able specialised expertise and resources, to high-value/high-risk transactions, identifying
             opportunities where procedural simplification may be achieved at low cost to revenue.
        ■■   Discusses the MNEs’ use of ‘hubs’, particularly for the provision of marketing, technical-
             scientific, financing and insurance services, and how this type of business structuring and
             the location of the relevant subsidiaries in carefully selected low-tax jurisdictions may min-
             imise an MNE’s total taxation at the consolidated level by shifting profits out of mineral-
             producing countries.

    Part B, The Mining Industry in Africa and Transfer Pricing:

        ■■   Discusses the economic importance and future potential of the mining industry in Africa
             in general.
        ■■   Reviews the current stage of legislative development and administrative enforcement of
             TP rules specifically in the context of developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, making
             use of both published information and responses to a comprehensive TP questionnaire
             administered to around twenty selected mineral-rich countries.
        ■■   Locates all current mining operations and advanced mining projects relating to the main
             mineral commodities in various African countries, and for each commodity, categorises
             them in terms of their size and type of mining method, as well as revenue and cost struc-
             tures/characteristics with a view of identifying activities involving large cash flows and
             potential risks to revenue. This background is presented in the form of a comprehensive
             database and extensive descriptions of the characteristics of individual commodity groups
             provided as appendices.
        ■■   Considers the main mineral products and the way they are typically marketed for each of
             the commodities.
        ■■   Illustrates with selected examples and case studies typical TP issues relevant to individual
             commodities with particular emphasis on their pricing and marketing.

    Part C, Institutional and Administrative Capacity:

        ■■   Provides a detailed explanation of the processes involved in industry risk profiling and
             audit case selection.
        ■■   Discusses the complexity and challenges in soliciting relevant and timely information and
             in achieving a successful and ideally cooperative taxpayer relationship, thus encouraging
             compliance.
        ■■   Considers the appropriate structuring and administrative and resourcing implications for
             African taxation authorities to be enabled to broadly audit industry’s compliance with the
             current and recently reviewed OECD Guidelines, following implementation of the BEPS
             Action Plan.
        ■■   Identifies capacity building and specialised training needs and strategies that could be
             implemented to progressively improve the prioritisation and effectiveness of TP audits.

    The book closes with a Discussion and Conclusions chapter which summarizes the results of the
    study and the main strategies identified as appropriate to improve industry’s compliance with
    sound TP principles and the capacity of tax authorities to carry out an adequate level of effective
    TP auditing, thus minimizing revenue leakages.

1.4  Outline of Transfer Pricing Principles and Methods
            Model tax conventions have been developed by both the OECD17 and by the United Nations18 to
            reduce the risk of double taxation and to allocate or share taxing rights between countries. These
            models address transfer pricing for tax purposes using the internationally accepted standard of the
            arm’s length principle, as set out in Article 9 (Associated Enterprises) by the OECD19 and in the
            UN Model Double Tax Convention. Accordingly, countries comply with these international obliga-
            tions by including the arm’s length principle in their domestic tax provisions dealing with related-
            party arrangements which authorize their tax administration to make transfer pricing adjustments,
            where necessary, to the tax payable by a company. In practice, MNEs have to determine the prof-
            its of their subsidiaries or permanent establishments (branches)20 as if each were an independent
            enterprise dealing at arm’s length.

            To harmonize international transfer pricing policies and practices, the OECD has developed
            and regularly updates its OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax
            Administrations (2010). These guidelines have been updated in line with the best practice recom-
            mendations contained in the OECD’s various BEPS 2015 Final Reports. In addition, in 2011 the
            UN complemented the OECD guidelines by issuing their UN Transfer Pricing Manual21 which
            provides methodologies to assist both industry and tax authorities in determining whether
            transfer prices adopted in related-party dealings are consistent with the arm’s length principle.

            Clarification and strengthening of the OECD Guidelines have occurred as a result of the BEPS 2015
            Final Report for Action 8–10.22 Significant revisions of the guidance for application of the arm’s
            length principle have been provided23 as well as revision of intangibles,24 low value-adding intra-
            group services25 and cost contribution arrangements.26 These revisions focus on three key areas:

                 ■■   Intangibles (Action 8),
                 ■■   Allocation of risks (Action 9),
                 ■■   Other high risk areas (Action 10), including continuation of scope for tax administrations
                      to not recognise or to modify transactions that are not commercially rational.27

            then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of

    Importantly, additions have been made to Chapter II of the OECD Guidelines specifically for the
    pricing of commodities28 and further work is to be undertaken to provide knowledge, best prac-
    tices and tools for commodity-rich countries.29

    The OECD Guidelines present five methods which are used to apply the arm’s length principle
    (see paras 2.12–2.55) including:

            ■■   Three traditional methods, i.e.:

    The Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method directly compares the price charged for prop-
    erty or services transferred in a controlled transaction to that charged in a comparable uncontrolled
    transaction under comparable circumstances where available.

    Adjustments may be needed to achieve comparability and five comparability factors30 are identi-
    fied in this regard (see para 1.36–1.63). The reliability of the CUP method is affected by the degree
    of accuracy of the adjustments made.

    The CUP method would generally be an appropriate transfer pricing method for commodities and
    reference may be made to comparable uncontrolled arrangements in certain circumstances (i.e.,
    where there is a price quoted in an international or domestic commodity exchange market).31

    The Resale price (RSP) method derives the price at which a product has been purchased from
    an associated enterprise by netting from the price at which it has been subsequently resold to an
    independent buyer an appropriate gross margin. This margin represents the amount which the
    reseller would seek to cover its selling and other operating expenses and, in light of the functions
    performed (taking into account assets used and risk assumed), make an appropriate profit. This
    method is most useful where applied to marketing operations.

    The Cost plus (CP) method applies an appropriate markup to the costs incurred by the supplier of
    property or services to an associated purchaser in a controlled transaction. The markup represents
    an appropriate profit in light of the functions performed and the market conditions. This method
    is most useful where semifinished goods are transferred or services provided between associated
    parties, under joint facility or long-term supply arrangements.

            ■■   And a further two transactional profit methods (see paras 2.56–2.149), i.e.:

    The Transactional net margin method (TNMM) examines the net profit that a taxpayer realises
    from a controlled transaction or aggregate transactions relative to an appropriate base (e.g., costs,
    sales, assets). It operates in a manner similar to the cost plus and resale price methods but requires
    the selection of the most appropriate net profit indicator and its weighting. TNMM is suitable for
    cases where one of the parties makes all/most the unique contributions involved in the controlled
    transaction.

    The Transactional profit split method (PSM) determines the division of the profit from a con-
    trolled transaction between associated enterprises on the basis of what independent enterprises
    would have agreed at arm’s length and expected to realise from engaging in the same transaction

           under the same conditions, not limited to price consideration. This method can offer a solution
           for highly integrated operations for which a one-sided method would not be appropriate and also
           be most appropriate where both parties make unique and valuable contributions to a transaction.
           Guidance to strengthen and clarify application of this method is being developed by the OECD
           during 2016 for release in 2017.32

           In practice, the level of information available is often inadequate to conduct a satisfactory com-
           parability analysis and some flexibility and the exercise of good judgment (see paras 2.68 and
           1.13) become necessary in reaching a reliable arm’s length estimate. To alleviate these constraints,
           many jurisdictions have been tightening up their legislative requirements for appropriate disclo-
           sure and contemporary documentation and further relief will be provided upon implementation
           of the BEPS country-by-country (CbC) reporting requirement, even though the latter is weakened
           by its lack of line items detail and by the limitation to companies with a gross turnover greater than
           US$750 million.

           The OECD33 has also considered, at the request of some developing nations, the use of the so-
           called ‘sixth method’ which makes mandatory use of publicly quoted prices for commodities on
           their shipment date to a related party. This method, initially employed in Argentina, has now been
           adopted by most South American countries and by India.34 The OECD recognises its primary ben-
           efit in providing a clear and certain benchmark for transactions between related parties but is con-
           cerned about it resulting in non-arm’s length prices where excessive divergence may arise between
           the conditions of the actual transactions and the publically quoted prices. The OECD indicates that
           the method may be considered an appropriate anti-avoidance approach depending on the extent of
           the risk, likelihood of tax avoidance and practical difficulties in applying the arm’s length principle
           given information or capacity constraints for transactions involving jurisdictions with low or zero
           tax rates and counterparties that perform only very limited functions.

           Adherence to the OECD Guidelines should result in MNEs’ subsidiaries or branches35 having
           clearly articulated policies that ensure that they comply with the arm’s-length principle, using
           the most appropriate of the five transfer pricing methods. Additionally they would be expected
           to maintain an adequate level of documentation (including contemporaneous documentation)
           relating to the setting of their transfer prices and to make it available to the tax administration as
           required. Many tax administrations also require information about the nature of the activities and
           value of related party transactions to be reported on an annual basis. This documentation is likely
           to include aspects of the new three tier reporting standards (master file, local file and country-by-
           country reporting) set out in the BEPS Final Report Action 6.

           Guidance on the application of the arm’s length principle and the use of transfer pricing methods
           and on undertaking a comparability analysis is provided in Chapter 4 of the general WBG hand-
           book on “Transfer Pricing and Developing Countries.”

              A subsidiary is a separate legal entity from the parent company, and a mining subsidiary will generally be a resi-
           dent of the host African country. A branch is an integral part of a non-resident entity—they are legally one and the
           same. Branches (also known as permanent establishments) are generally taxed by the host country on their profits
           attributable to the business operated in that country. Transfer pricing by a branch in relation to its dealings with
           other parts of the entity or with other related entities, is generally subject to the arm’s length principle (either under
           relevant domestic law and/or the Business Profits article of a relevant DTA).

1.5  Transfer Pricing Is Only One Aspect of a Multifaceted Problem
          Administrative complexity is compounded by the need to achieve a smooth interface between
          domestic transfer pricing legislation and administrative practices, and compliance with the arm’s
          length principle (ALP) and the five transfer pricing methodologies presented in the OECD Guide-
          lines. This must often take place against a background of other complex to administer, domestic
          legislation (e.g., thin capitalization, controlled foreign corporations (CFC) and withholding taxes
          (WHT) for dividends, services, interest and royalty payments remitted to nonresidents) and double
          taxation agreements (DTAs). WHT can play an effective role in protecting revenue in develop-
          ing countries where TP legislation and administrative capacity is in most cases inadequate. Afri-
          can countries, which generally are capital importers and exporters of mineral commodities, may
          need to be cautious about creating DTA networks with developed countries as the related benefits
          may not be adequate compensation for their foregoing potentially significant taxing rights. This
          may explain why Mongolia and Argentina, for instance, cancelled some of their DTAs that they
          believed were being misused. It also explains why MNEs favour the establishment of DTAs as an
          investment incentive, purportedly to avoid double taxation, even though most developed coun-
          tries avoid double taxation by credit or exemption provisions in their domestic legislation. As the
          economy of a country develops and diversifies, the benefits of entering into a DTA may overcome
          its drawbacks providing greater certainty for investors and promoting a fairer arm’s length alloca-
          tion of taxable income.

          The complexity of administering some of these arrangements can impose a significant burden on
          the current administrative and resourcing capacity of many developing countries, particularly
          in Africa. The administrative challenge is exacerbated by the general scarcity within many tax
          authorities of technical knowledge about mining processes and related cost structures, commodity
          pricing structures and the key value drivers in the mining supply/value chain of individual com-
          modities. This is further exacerbated by the paucity of relevant domestic comparables, the high
          cost of subscribing to comparables databases, and difficulty in adapting them for use in developing
          countries. Things are also not helped by the unwillingness of some taxpayers to provide adequate
          information within an effective timeframe and the difficulty in obtaining data from offshore juris-
          dictions regarding some of the selected tested entity’s foreign related party transactions. Nego-
          tiation of Exchange of Information (EOI) agreements with the countries of residence of relevant
          MNEs’ subsidiaries and/or, deeming rules to apply where information is not provided, may prove
          effective in overcoming some of these issues.

          Against this background it makes sense for any future strategy contemplated by international
          capacity building institutions, such as the OECD, to be based on introducing TP rules that are clear,
          as simple as possible to apply and likely to be adopted by African jurisdictions—identifying and
          taking into account general gaps in terms of critical taxation administrative skills and resourcing
          in those jurisdictions. This challenge and the need for simplification have been recognized by the
          United Nations (UN) (2011) in their “Transfer Pricing Practical Manual for Developing Countries”;
          by Euroaid in their recent (2012) report entitled “Transfer Pricing and Developing Countries” and
          more recently by the OECD (2014),36 which has focused on the specific issue of TP comparability
          data in the context of developing countries, an issue that has shaped the scope of their TP assis-
          tance and training offered to developing countries.

          Some jurisdictions, such as Brazil, China and India, have been making use of non-arm’s length
          methods such as the application of fixed margins to certain transactions where CUPs are not read-
          ily available and where other OECD methods have proved difficult or impractical to apply. A more
          radical position has also been expressed by the Independent Commission for the Reform of Inter-
          national Corporate Taxation, that in fact transfer pricing related problems in developing countries
          may prove to be insurmountable and that simpler and more innovative approaches, such as Global

            Formulary Apportionment (GFA), that are unrelated to the arm’s length principle may be needed.
            This view is backed by a large number of NGOs, some commentators and conceptually supported
            by the Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz among others.37 The GFA approach would
            allocate global profits of a MNE to its members in different countries on the basis of a predeter-
            mined and mechanistic formula. The OECD rejects the GFA approach38 and does not see it as a
            realistic alternative to the arm’s length principle as it would be difficult to implement, require enor-
            mous political and administrative complexity, give rise to risks of double taxation and non-taxation
            and because it is arbitrary and disregards market conditions and circumstances of the individual
            entities involved.

            Simplification and preemptive approaches adopted in the developed world include safe harbors,
            application of standard profit margins for designated low-risk routine services and the negotia-
            tion of advanced pricing agreements (APAs). The BEPS project specifically considered whether
            ‘special measures’, which would not necessarily comply with the ALP, should be applied given the
            difficulties encountered by some tax administrations and taxpayers in applying the arm’s length
            principle. However, the 2015 BEPS Final Reports emphasize the ongoing applicability of the ALP
            as opposed to ‘special measures’ other than the simplification measures referred to above. This
            conclusion does not preclude consideration and development of safe harbors and the negotiation
            of Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) (noting that these approaches do not avoid the analytical
            challenges to ensure there is compliance with the ALP), nor the provision of guidance to taxpayers
            on arrangements and outcomes that are considered to be ‘low risk’. These measures are the sub-
            ject of ongoing work on comparability by the OECD and WBG, and more guidance on the use of
            simplfication approaches is expected to be provided to developing countries in the relevant final
            report due in October 2016.

            Some African jurisdictions have reservations about implementing such measures. This is not sur-
            prising as while APAs may be effective, their negotiation may be complex and protracted and
            involve significant demands on available expertise in TP, which may be deployed on compliant
            taxpayers. For this reason APAs, although having significant merit, have very rarely been used to
            date in Africa.

            The OECD recognized the TP technical capacity problem and initiated, together with other major
            international institutions such as the IMF, the WBG, the EU, as well as individual country donors
            (e.g., Norway, Germany, Australia, etc.), a number of training and capacity-building initiatives as
            well as funding the provision of relevant expertise. An example is the joint program of the WBG
            tax team with the OECD and EU with their active involvement and experience in implementing
            transfer pricing legislation and, in particular, in building capacity in tax administrations, in more
            than 15 countries (including Kenya, Ghana and Ethiopia, amongst others in Africa) and with more
            than 10 other projects in the pipeline including with the East African Community (EAC) and the
            Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

            One challenge most developing countries face is the ability to employ, develop and retain transfer-
            pricing expertise. In this regard, developing countries need to be innovative and strategic. Through
            the implementation of targeted recruitment and structured training programs, some developing
            countries are making inroads in attracting, developing and retaining TP skills. Whilst the private
            sector may offer attractive remuneration, the public sector often offers job stability and security
            and greater work life balance. Training and development, including challenge and variety in work
            scope, within the public sector are also often a draw card, and tax administrations in developing
            countries need to leverage off all that they can offer to attract and retain TP resources.

           The Mining Industry and
                   Transfer Pricing

This section takes a general approach to identifying the most common transfer pricing issues asso-
ciated with mining and where they are likely to occur along the mining value-adding chain. It con-
siders the functions performed, the assets utilized and the risk borne by various entities in related
party transactions and how they should be taken into account in ensuring that the related transfer
prices comply with the arm’s length principle. This structured approach will provide an outline
of how tax administrations can identify ‘who’ should be looked at and ‘why’, and ‘how’ mining
taxable entities can be ranked in order of priority for investigation/auditing through the allocation
of scarce tax administration resources. The discussion will be supported by a number of relevant,
practical case studies and examples.

                                          The Mining Value Chain

          Transfer pricing has its basis on functional analysis, which examines the Functions performed,
          Assets utilized and Risks borne (FAR) by each of the related parties involved in intra-group trans-
          actions. The description of the mining industry value chain that follows is designed to provide a
          clear and specific context and understanding of the mining industry and to facilitate the detailed
          FAR analysis to be covered later in Chapter 3.


2.1  Mining Value Chain Analysis
          2.1.1  Stages of the mining cycle and degree of vertical integration and implications
          for transfer pricing
          Figure A.1 displays the typical stages in the mining value-adding chain from initial exploration to
          marketing of refined metals on terminal markets. In reality the activities and functions of relatively
          few mining companies, particularly in Africa, are fully vertically integrated within a single taxable
          entity.

          As shown in Figure A.1, the degree of integration within a single taxable entity depends, to a
          large degree, on the mineral products sold, with many mining companies producing and selling

                    in contestable markets or transferring to related entities, primarily abroad, intermediate mineral
                    products such as:

                        ■■   Crushed and screened ore with no or minimal beneficiation, e.g., bulk commodities such
                             as iron ore, coal, phosphate rock, etc.;
                        ■■   Mineral concentrates and other partially downstream processed, mineral products, e.g.,
                             base metals and nickel concentrates; as well as
                        ■■   Metals after smelting and refining.

                    It is at these different points of sale or transfer that profits taxable in the source country are
                    generated.

                    Even where a mining project is fully vertically integrated from the exploration stage to marketing
                    of its refined metals, it is unlikely that all inputs down the value-adding chain would be supplied
                    by internal functional units. Its production process would often involve customer-supplier transac-
                    tions with either:

                        ■■   Unrelated customers and suppliers, i.e., separate taxable entities not controlled by the
                             MNE, or
                        ■■   Related customers and suppliers, i.e., entities (either subsidiaries or branches) owned and
                             controlled by the same MNE which holds the mining project as shown in Figure A.2, or
                        ■■   A mixture of the two.

                    The various activities of a mining company include two types of functions:

                        ■■   Primary—these are all the functions relating to the exploration, mining and concentrating,

         ■■   Secondary—these include all the support functions not directly related to the discovery,
              extraction and disposal of mineral commodities such as corporate services (accounting,
              finance, marketing and technical support, HR, IT, insurance, legal, etc.).

    It is important to note that this breakup of functions relates to mining companies, not to interna-
    tional mining services firms which would display a different structure.

    The Board of an MNE generally concerns itself with matters of governance and the highest levels
    of managerial decisions delegating authority to the managers of various units ‘responsibility cen-
    tres’, determining their maximum span of control and the degree of responsibility and indepen-
    dent authority that managers will be allowed to exercise in line with the desired business strategy,
    model and structure.

    These considerations determine whether a responsibility centre is:

         ■■   An expenditure centre, performing highly creative, strategically or operationally necessary
              tasks, e.g., research and development (R&D), primarily for intra-group use;
         ■■   A cost centre, performing mostly core and non-core operational activities, managed by the
              principal entity, primarily for intra-group use;
         ■■   A revenue centre, performing mostly core, market/external customer driven activities,
              e.g., sales and distribution, designed to maximise quantities and/or price but unconcerned
              with cost of production;
         ■■   A profit centre, performing mostly core, market/external customer driven activities, with
              focus on profit contribution and quality, i.e., to optimise turnover, unit cost and revenue; or
         ■■   An investment centre, performing core, capital market/customer driven activities, primar-
              ily for shareholder or the MNE as whole, concerned with return on investment and on IP.

    A profit centre is given the highest degree of independent decision-making authority and is nor-
    mally accounted for on a stand-alone basis in terms of its individual contribution to the overall con-
    solidated corporate profit of the MNE. It is generally advantageous for MNEs to run their mining
    operations in developing countries as profit centres, generally registered as individual subsidiary
    companies in the host country.

    Situations where an MNE carries out its mining business in a developing country in its own right
    through a local mining branch are rare because most African countries generally require that indi-
    vidual mining projects be ring-fenced,39 i.e., each owned and operated by a mining-specific sub-
    sidiary of the MNE registered and taxable in the host country. The use of branches, even if allowed,
    is generally discouraged by highly differential rates of taxation, which may be a reflection of the
    limited network of DTAs in Africa.

    In the final analysis, the supply chain of any company selling its products into a contestable market
    (Figure A.2) also includes, besides the contributions from internal expenditure, cost and revenue
    centers, supplies from both unrelated and related suppliers, which in turn may be domiciled either
    domestically in the source country or more often abroad.

    2.1.2 
          customer-supplier transactions

    Management accountants value and attribute transfer prices to the goods and services supplied
    to internal customers, be it related cost, revenue or profit centers, to assess the performance of



     It must be pointed out that while ring-fencing is generally applied throughout the world in the context of mineral
    39

    royalties, it is not the norm in the context of corporate income tax (CIT) in the developed world where losses can
    generally be offset against taxable income produced by a related company.
16	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            individual responsibility centres. This is done to improve their productivity and as a consequence
            consolidated profits. For centres providing services that could be obtained at a more competitive
            price from an alternative external supplier, consideration would be given to their outsourcing or
            putting improvement measures in place to make them competitive.

            Thus, if fairly determined, transfer pricing merely represents a necessary and legitimate method
            to account for intra-company and related intra-group transactions. As a consequence, there should
            be no incentive to distort transfer prices purely in the context of management accounting within a
            single entity, but there may be in the context of cross-border transactions between different related
            parties of the same MNE, which as discussed below has potentially significant tax implications.
            For this reason management accounts are often a very useful source of information for revenue
            authorities and are worth requesting at an early stage as part of the transfer pricing analysis.


2.2  Typical Functions of the Mining Cycle
            2.2.1  General classification of related-party transactions in mining

            Figure A.3 displays the various stages of the mining value-adding chain from exploration to mar-
            keting of refined metals and shows how transactions with related parties may occur at any stage
            along the chain, subdividing them into the two categories of:

                 ■■   Outbound transfers of mineral products to a related party, and
                 ■■   Inbound and outbound transfers of goods and services from a related party, including:
                      •	 Financial services,
                      •	 Corporate and support services, and
                      •	 Tangible and intangible assets, and technical services involving proprietary know-
                         how, IP and R&D.

            It must be appreciated that transfer prices relating to the outbound transfer of mineral products to
            a related party not only affect the assessment of the taxable income of a project in the context of its
            corporate income and other tax liabilities, but they may also be of critical importance in determin-
            ing the value base to which mineral royalty rates are to be applied.

            The financial significance of some of the outbound and inbound transfers and transactions with
            related parties can be very high given the scale of the mining industry, making appropriate estima-
            tion of the related transfer prices a critical issue. The degree of risk to revenue arising from these
            estimations will range from relatively low for routine transactions where comparables are readily
            available to very high for more complex transactions involving the transfer of hard to value intan-
            gibles, both assets and specialized services involving proprietary technology, R&D and IP, patents
            and licenses, etc.

            2.2.2  Specific functions/activities involved at various stages of the mining value chain

            It is worth noting that companies involved in the production of different minerals may display dif-
            ferent levels of vertical integration from mining to processing to smelting and refining. Companies
            dealing with ‘new’ metals, such as aluminium, tend to be fully vertically integrated. For instance
            Comalco at one stage covered the full spectrum of activities from mining bauxite, to alumina pro-
            duction, smelting and refining and manufacturing of aluminium products, all the way to their
            retail sales. By contrast ‘old’ metals, like iron, traditionally tended to be highly stratified, with a
            clear distinction between miners and steel mills. A minority of originally integrated firms in recent
            years have formally separated their mining from their steel-making entities.

            It must also be appreciated that the significant capital investment necessary to establish down-
            stream smelting and refining capacity vertically integrated with an individual mining project may

               only be justified if the mineral resources are of outstanding size and quality, ensuring a long and
               secure project life. This, of course, is very seldom the case and the tendency has been for mining
               MNEs to pursue centralization of their processing capacity exploiting economies of scale by estab-
               lishing global or regional service hubs, rather than having a multitude of less efficient decentral-
               ized local plants. This trend is resented by the countries hosting the mining operations as they
               would like to see a greater number of jobs created within their territories. In the final analysis, there
               must be a valid business case to attract the necessary capital to the establishment of downstream
               processing in the source country.

               Each stage in the mining value-adding chain illustrated in Figure A.3 includes a series of typical
               functions/activities as illustrated below.

               2.2.2.1  Acquisition and exploration stage

               The objective of this stage is to discover a new mineral deposit and assess its potential to sup-
               port an economically viable mining operation. Under many jurisdictions exploration is defined
               as lasting from the initial prospecting and reconnaissance exploration of a site, through mineral
               discovery and resources delineation to the completion of a feasibility study, i.e., until a decision to
               proceed with the development of a mine is taken.
18	        Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


                  The stage commences with the process of companies applying for and of government allocating
                  the right to explore for and subsequently exploit any mineral deposit that may be discovered. The
                  process of issuing exploration and mining licenses/leases, as discussed below, generates various
                  degrees of government revenue and creates assets in the hands of specific entities within an MNE
                  group, not necessarily always in its mining subsidiary.

                  Exploration is a high-risk activity in the sense that many unsuccessful, individually low-cost but
                  collectively significantly expensive projects need to be undertaken before a mineral discovery is
                  made. It is a capital investment as undeducted exploration expenditure losses, in the form of geo-
                  logical information from surveys, drilling, etc., are capitalized as individual tangible projects and
                  intangible mining rights. Even in the event of a successful feasibility study being concluded, there
                  is still a greater than 10% risk that the project may not live up to expectations and may fail com-
                  mercially. Profits at the exploration stage are only derived by trading in or assigning the use of
                  these assets.

                  Figure A.4 diagrammatically shows the series of activities carried out during the acquisition and
                  exploration stage.

                  2.2.2.2  Mine construction and development stage

                  This stage lasts from when the decision to develop a mine is taken to the point where ore has
                  been exposed in readiness for mining extraction to start. All the mining assets necessary to extract
                  and process the ore, at a minimum to crushed and screened ore or concentrate, are constructed or
                  acquired and installed ready for use. In practice, some elements of construction and development
                  may continue for a period in parallel to mining after extraction has commenced. It is a capital
                  investment stage involving significant cash outflows to create the asset base and production capac-
                  ity for the future mining operation and related revenue/profit stream. Depending on the commod-
                  ity involved, the circumstances of the project and the generally high up-front capital investment,
                  this stage can be high risk and present opportunities for profit shifting through intra-group financ-

                  to interest deduction rules providing useful guidance on allocation to and control of risk by differ-
                  ent entities within an MNE and their financial capacity to assume the risk.

               2.2.2.3  Mining operations and concentration stage

               The objective of mining and concentration operations is to extract the ore and separate its valuable
               minerals from its gangue, exploiting their physical properties (Figure A.6).

               Bulk commodities, where the ore contains a high proportion of valuable minerals, are often sold
               in the form of crushed and screened ore after limited blending and/or beneficiation, e.g., iron ore
               and coking coal to steel mills, thermal coal to power stations, etc. Conveyance of bulk commodi-
               ties to markets may entail the use of dedicated transport and logistical infrastructure and related
               services. Assessing the arm’s length nature of the related transaction charges is one of the critical
               areas for tax administrations to address, and there are many cases where such prices have been
               considered excessive by tax authorities leading to disputes (see section 2.2.2.4 below).

               Where the proportion of valuable minerals in the ore is relatively low the ore must be concentrated,
               and the mine may sell or transfer concentrates and/or other intermediate mineral products to
               smelters and/or end-users. This is the case for most base metals, nickel and some precious met-
               als mines. As concentration reduces the volume of material to be transported, and as a result the
               related transportation costs, producers of concentrates generally rely on shared transport infra-
               structure and services. It is worth noting that some ore and/or concentrates can be stockpiled over
               a significant length of time (e.g., iron ore), while others oxidise (e.g., nickel concentrates) or are eas-
               ily contaminated (e.g., alumina). This will be discussed further when dealing with marketing hubs.

               Sometimes smelting and refining may be conducted on or near the mine site, in which case the
               integrated project may not require significant investment in transportation and logistical assets, or
               the related operations.

               Mining and concentration operations can be either integrated or carried out in the source country
               by separate, but often related, profit centers that would be individually taxed.

               2.2.2.4  Transportation stage: Trucking/railing, port and shipping

               With the exception of precious metals and gemstones, which are low-volume and high-value, most
               other mineral products may make use of specialized transport and logistics infrastructure as well

                                                                                              (see smelting & refining)




                  as outsourced transport services. This may include road or rail loading facilities, railways and
                  related rolling stock, ports with stockpiling, reclaiming, blending and shiploading facilities.

                  Some large bulk commodity producers may own and operate heavy rail and port facilities as part
                  of their assets, or they may be provided with transportation and logistics services by a separate
                  subsidiary of the same MNE. This subsidiary in turn may be fully dedicated to the mining project
                  or provide multiuser transport services to other mining operations in the region within the same
                  MNE and/or to unrelated third-party mining operations or other industry sectors. In these cases
                  the setting of the charges for the provision of services to various users, particularly their capital
                  components, may become complex.

                  In some cases mining companies have found it advantageous to dispose of their transport and
                  logistics assets and instead make use of services provided by third parties. Sometimes, however,
                  the disposal of the transport and logistics assets may be to a related party that is a member of the
                  same MNE group, which brings into play the use of transfer prices.

                  By contrast, sea freight is frequently provided by independent carriers rather than related parties,
                  with prices set in contestable markets. However, instances do exist where the MNE owns the ore
                  carriers through one of its subsidiaries and provides shipping services to its mining subsidiar-
                  ies. Similarly, cargo insurance may be provided by either an external insurer or through an entity
                  related to the mining company where use of an external insurer is hard or expensive to procure.

                  Figure A.7 diagrammatically shows the series of activities carried out in the context of mineral
                  transportation.

                  2.2.2.5  Smelting and refining stage

                  The objective of smelting and refining (SR) is to disaggregate minerals into their individual chemi-
                  cal components so that refined metals can be separated from unwanted elements for sale. This
                  stage produces refined metals, e.g., gold, refined copper, lead, zinc, nickel, etc., for transfer to mar-
                  keters and/or for direct sale into terminal commodity markets.

                  Vertical integration of dedicated smelting and refining facilities with upstream mining and concen-
                  trating activities within a mining company is only justifiable in the few instances where the mine
                  has extensive and generally high-grade mineral reserves, ensuring a long and uninterrupted mine-
                  life. As a consequence, concentrates are often sold to independent smelters that provide processing
                  services under the terms of smelting and refining contracts, generally drafted for common concen-
                  trates along traditionally well-established guidelines. However, as discussed later, prices may vary
                  widely as a function of the quality of the concentrates and of their credit and penalty metals.

                  Figure A.8 diagrammatically shows the series of activities carried out in the context of the smelting
                  and refining stage.

               2.2.2.6  Trading, marketing and sales functions

               The objective of this stage is to match demand and supply by bringing mineral products either
               to terminal markets or by arranging customer-specific sales into specialized, specification-driven
               niche markets, as illustrated in Figure A.9. Trading, marketing, distribution and sales functions
               can involve a range of activities, which may vary from routine processing of orders and invoices,
               customer communication and management (i.e., customer interface) to market research and com-
               petitor analysis; development and implementation of marketing strategy and pricing policy; and
               sorting, packaging and arranging of transportation and shipping of the finished products. Depend-
               ing on the product, the reputation and market dominance of the producer, etc., may be that a pro-
               ducer of commodities will require a separate trading, marketing and sales function. There has been
               a trend for centralizing marketing, distribution and sales functions into offshore ‘marketing service
               centers’ or ‘marketing hubs’ servicing various members of a MNE group. This approach has been
               viewed by tax authorities as presenting high transfer pricing risk to revenue.




                     Chapter 2 Key Take-Away Points

                     It is critical that tax administrations
                          •	   Recognize the level of vertical integration and develop an in-depth knowledge of the functions
                               performed, assets used and risks assumed at the different stages of the mining value chain for
                               the various minerals mined in their country,
                          •	   Clearly distinguish between the functions that are typical of cost centres, from those that
                               would normally be part of a profit centre, and how much value is added by each of them,
                          •	   Identify which functions along the mining value chain are performed in the country by MNEs’
                               mining subsidiaries, relating to their outbound sales and transfers of mineral products to
                               related parties and which functions have been outsourced leading to the provision of goods
                               and services from both external and related parties.

       Typical Mining Industry Transactions
       Potentially Involving Transfer Pricing

          The starting point (acknowledged by the OECD at para. 1.11 in the TP Guidelines) is the recog-
          nition that .  .  . associated enterprises may engage in transactions that independent enterprises would
          not undertake. Questions of economic substance, particularly when evidence suggests a tension
          between economic substance and legal form, as well as the ability of various entities in the MNE
          value chain to manage and control risks, are the more difficult but legitimate challenges in transfer
          pricing ­analysis—a point acknowledged (and appropriately caveated) by the OECD. The strong
          guidance from the OECD is therefore that the starting point of the analysis must be the actual
          conditions agreed by the associated enterprises, and of how these are reflected in terms of the
          ‘economic substance’ of what each party is actually doing, and of how this in turn generates true
          economic contribution. The BEPS Action 8–10 Final Report re-enforces the importance of looking
          beyond mere contracts in undertaking a comparability analysis, placing emphasis on the accurate
          delineation of the transactions and the actual conditions and economically relevant circumstances.
          There are circumstances where it is appropriate for the analysis of economic substance to form the
          basis of whether the relevant transfer prices comply with the arm’s length principle, even if this is
          not consistent with the agreed legal form which may be supplemented or even disregarded.


    Primary and Secondary Functions in a Fully Vertically Integrated Base/Precious
3.1 
    Metals Producer
          This section deals with the ‘function’ aspect of the FAR (functions, assets and risks) analysis within
          the context of the mining value chain. As already pointed out functions can be categorized as
          primary, i.e., those associated directly with exploration, mining/processing and selling of min-
          eral commodities, and secondary, including a range of corporate services. Figure A.10 displays a
          stand-alone, ring-fenced, fully vertically integrated subsidiary of a MNE that performs most of
          the primary functions (green boxes) associated with the mining industry value chain all the way
          downstream to selling the product to customers, but receives some centralized engineering and
          technical and marketing support from a hub, presumably performing the role of a commissionaire
          or agent in exchange for a fee.

          The arrows connecting the various boxes in Figure A.10 represent the possible intra-company and
          intra-group transactions to which transfer prices may apply. In the example, these consist largely of
          routine and subordinately non-routine secondary functions (orange boxes) that the MNE provides,
          often on a shared basis, to its subsidiaries throughout the group. Shared secondary services that
          may be provided by the holding MNE head office, a separate service center or related subsidiary at
          any stage of the mining value chain may include:

              1.	 General management;
              2.	 Accounting and financial administration;
              3.	 Information technology services;
              4.	 Human resources services;

                    5.	 Legal services;
                    6.	 Captive insurance services; and
                    7.	 Treasury services, including:
                        a.	 loan financing transactions involving interest charges, and fees for loan origination and/
                            or loan management;
                        b.	 cash pooling;
                        c.	 financial guarantees to back bids, performance and safety/environmental rehabilitation
                            bonds etc.; and
                        d.	hedging.

               A detailed list of the most common functions likely to be performed by a related party at various
               stages of the mining value chain is provided in Appendix A.1.

               The income generated by the fully integrated mining company (delineated in red in Figure A.10) at
               the point where it sells its mineral products to an external customer, metal trader or directly into a
               contestable terminal market (e.g., London Metal Exchange (LME)) is taxable in the source country,
               after deduction of all allowable expenses including relevant transfer prices.

               Because of the relatively simple metallurgy, a high degree of vertical integration is typical of most
               gold mining subsidiaries of MNEs operating in Africa, where jurisdictions generally require the
               registration of a dedicated mining company to own and operate the mining assets, which is treated

            as an individual taxable entity in the source country. Most base metals mining operations in Africa,
            by contrast, tend to be vertically integrated mostly to the stage of producing concentrates and, to a
            lesser extent, all the way downstream to refined metal.

            As already mentioned and discussed later in more detail, when dealing with the issue of restruc-
            turing, in spite of strong efforts by governments to encourage as much as possible downstream
            processing and marketing to take place in the host country (i.e., ‘go local’), the tendency has been
            for MNEs to centralize (i.e., ‘go global’).

            Common examples of centralization are the establishment of marketing service centers or hubs and
            of smelting/refining facilities, which may handle mineral products from one or more of an MNE’s
            mines.


3.2  Assets Utilized and Created in Various Mining Functions
            We now move to the assets component of the FAR analysis to review how MNEs engage in busi-
            ness and risk management activities that generally, according to Huibregtse (2013), employ three
            categories of assets:40

                 ■■   A—Tangible assets,
                 ■■   B—Intangible assets, and
                 ■■   C—Non-intangible premiums such as “location specific advantages” or LSAs.

            Tangible assets—In the context of mining the majority of tangible assets (Category A) are likely
            to be located in the country hosting the mining operations, usually at the mine site, and are in
            most instances owned/controlled by the local mining subsidiary of the MNE. Tangible assets are
            generally individually capitalized at their historical cost (including installation and commission-
            ing charges) in the balance sheet of the company owning them, and depreciated over their useful
            lives at rates set by the tax legislation. Depending on their nature, some assets may be subject to
            occasional revaluation. Furthermore, as these are generally production-related assets, they tend to
            be primarily utilized in day-to-day operations and are therefore easily identified.

            The current economic or market value should, in theory, relate to the present value of the expected
            future net after-tax cash flows likely to be generated by each asset. In an ideal world, such a valua-
            tion would be relevant to establishing an appropriate transfer price, but experience shows that the
            actual value placed by the market on many assets may often be at variance with their NPVs. Thus,
            in the absence of a market-price comparable, such an approach would be subject to significant
            uncertainty and a high degree of subjectivity when used as a proxy for application of the arm’s
            length principle.

            In addition, mining companies may lease some items of plant and equipment from third parties,
            which could provide invaluable information in determining whether the leasing fees and other
            terms of leasing agreements with related parties comply with the arm’s length principle.

            Exploration and mining rights—Of fundamental importance is the right to explore for and subse-
            quently extract nonrenewable mineral resources, which in the majority of cases is granted by gov-
            ernment41 to private enterprises in the form of a prospecting, exploration, mining or retention lease.
            In most African countries government generally retains a small level of equity (of the order of 10%)
            in mineral projects. Mining tenements are generally awarded on a first-in-time basis or through
            the negotiation of mining contracts involving relatively modest application and annual rental fees,

            Intangibles.
            41
               Under most jurisdictions the minerals belong to the government who manages them to the benefit of its citizens.

    but potentially including significant obligations for companies to fund basic infrastructure or other
    public/community benefits. By contrast, petroleum resources, particularly in developing coun-
    tries, are more often largely held by national companies, which may explore/exploit them in joint
    venture with private enterprise or by means of contract of/for work or, if allocated to private
    enterprises, may involve significant upfront cash bids. Thus, in the case of minerals, most of the
    government revenue is derived from levying mineral royalties and corporate income tax and sub-
    ordinately from dividends.

    The exploration and development expenditure incurred on a mining project is capitalized as a
    tangible asset by the mining company. However when a mining project is bought, any premium
    paid in excess of its tangible value is capitalized in the balance sheet of the acquiring party as an
    intangible asset, a form of goodwill, often referred to as a ‘mining right’. To some degree this incor-
    porates the value of the resources which, unless acquired in a sale, would have not been capital-
    ized but would still have been the main determinant of the share value of the mining company as
    reflected on its stock market capitalization.

    Intangibles—Rather than focusing on accounting or legal definitions of intangibles, the thrust of a
    transfer pricing analysis in a case involving intangibles should be the determination of the condi-
    tions that would be agreed upon for their transfer or use between independent parties in a compa-
    rable transaction. Intangible “assets” may be utilized in the performance of specialized, nonroutine
    functions that normally also require unique specialized professional skills and expertise.

    Not all intangibles recognized for transfer pricing purposes are recognized for accounting pur-
    poses. To the extent that any intangible asset is recognized for accounting purposes, its “economic
    value,” as outlined by the OECD Chapter VI, may differ from the original financial accounting
    entry based on its historical acquisition cost.

    Other intangible values that are not captured in the balance sheet, but that tend to be captured in the
    overall market capitalization/value of the firm/entity may include unique technical, commercial
    and managerial skills of key executives and professionals within individual firms that, particularly at
    the exploration and development stages, are very highly valued by the stock brokering community.

    Intangibles, including some that may be hard to value for transfer pricing purposes, typically asso-
    ciated with the primary functions in the mining industry and which would generally be compen-
    sated for by margin markups, licenses and/or royalty payments include proprietary rights to:

         ■■   Exploration, production and other licenses and permits (e.g., mineral exploration and min-
              ing tenements, miscellaneous leases, surface and access rights, etc.) providing legal access
              to valuable mining reserves and resources unless held, as it is often the case, by the mining
              subsidiary in the host country;
         ■■   Intellectual property (IP) and patents covering inventions, innovative industrial methods,
              processes and prototypes, computer programs and databases, etc.;
         ■■   Specialised know-how and managerial expertise (e.g., of geosciences, mine design, devel-
              opment and construction, mining methods and metallurgical product and process technol-
              ogy, etc.) and R&D capabilities; and
         ■■   Specialised expertise and intelligence skills in identifying and satisfying unique customer
              requirements and specifications for minerals not commonly traded on terminal markets,
              thus creating value-in-use and capturing valuable niche markets, and related patents and
              trademarks, etc.

    The OECD has updated its transfer pricing guidelines for the use or transfer of intangibles as part
    of its BEPS action plan.42 This guidance on intangibles is to be applied in the wider context of new

                  guidance on accurately delineating the transaction and the analysis of risks.43 The guidance covers
                  a range of issues, including ensuring:44

                       ■■   Legal ownership does not determine the returns from intangibles;
                       ■■   Appropriate remuneration can be expected for associated enterprises performing impor-
                            tant value creating functions;
                       ■■   Parties assuming risks in relation to intangibles must exercise control over the risks;
                       ■■   Entitlement to profit or loss relating to differences between actual and expected profits
                            depend on who assumes the risk, the functions performed and whether arm’s length
                            remuneration would be an included profit sharing elements;
                       ■■   Only a risk-adjusted return is provided for those providing funding or assuming financial
                            risks;
                       ■■   If only funding is provided, the return should be no more than a risk-free return;
                       ■■   Expansion of when valuation techniques can be used; and
                       ■■   Rigorous analysis is required by taxpayers for hard-to-value intangibles.

                  In light of the complexity in reliably valuing intangibles the tax administration of a major, mineral-
                  rich jurisdiction in Africa has seen it fit to cap, with very rare exceptions, the related margins. This
                  approach was taken realizing that in some circumstances where high intangible values may exist
                  this would not comply with the arm’s length principle. In addition this jurisdiction also imposes
                  strict conditions on the export of IP and/or on payments relating to the use of IP previously
                  exported from the country.

                   Location specific advantages (LSAs)—The OECD45 consider that LSAs can be handled as compa-
                   rability factors with consideration to be given to whether they exist, the amount of any location
                   saving, the extent of any saving retained within the MNE and how they should be allocated or
                   passed on to independent customers or suppliers. Where LSAs are retained within the group and
                   there are local market comparables, comparability adjustments may not be required. However,
                   where this is not the case comparability adjustments may be required based on analysis of all the
                   relevant facts and circumstances.

                   LSAs are not capable of being owned or controlled by an entity. The OECD makes it clear that
                   LSAs, such as access to cheap labor, to markets and, by extension to abundant mineral resources
                   and more favorable mining and environmental regulatory regimes, are not considered intangibles.
                   They are comparability factors to be considered in transfer pricing analysis, when there are no rele-
                   vant domestic comparables. While similar outcomes might be achieved, the UN, in its 2013 updated
                   version of the “Manual on Transfer Pricing for Developing Countries,” recognizes the importance

            of special features, like location savings46 or location-specific advantages (Category C)47 in the con-
            text of transfer pricing, but treats them like an intangible asset worthy of a return. These features
            are seen as providing developing countries with bargaining power and transfer pricing as a mecha-
            nism for price negotiation. The allocation of the profits of a MNE from the UN standpoint should
            place a larger weight on the presence and operation of tangible assets/activities, with the sugges-
            tion that it should capture at least an equal proportion of the value of location specific advantages
            to that captured by intangible assets, i.e., the so-called 50/50 hypothesis. The UN believes this is
            a good way for developing countries to increase their tax base, which should be, according to the
            UN, a significant element for their economic and social development.

            A highly simplified example of how to make a comparability adjustment for “location specific
            advantages” to be applied to the group entities owning or controlling categories A and/or B assets
            is provided by Huibregtse’s48 (2013) comments on the 2013 OECD draft (See Box A.1). In reality, the
            allocation of location savings generally involves a number of detailed issues that make it a complex
            process open to interpretation.


3.3  Project, Market and Other Business Risks Typical of the Mining Industry
            This section deals with the ‘risk’ component of the FAR analysis and considers the nature of the
            risks that mining companies are likely to confront in carrying out their business activities. A clear
            understanding of which parties in the value chain are specifically, or de facto, carrying and manag-
            ing the various operational and financial risks is critical to assess whether they should be entitled
            to a larger of smaller share of the economic benefits generated by certain transactions, that is to
            say to establish a fair risk-return balance. The business risk discussed in this section includes the
            tax compliance risk, but is distinguished from the risk to government revenue that is discussed
            in Chapter 4. A clear understanding of business risk is critical in determining which TP method
            should be used to best reflect the arm’s length principle in establishing the magnitude of the rel-
            evant TP. The OECD Final Report for Actions 8–10 recognises that the economic notion that higher
            risks warrant higher anticipated returns made MNE groups pursue tax planning strategies based

            cost savings derived by a multinational company when it sets up its operations in a low-cost jurisdiction. Net cost
            savings are commonly realized through lower expenditure on items such as raw materials, labour, rent, transporta-
            tion and infrastructure even though additional expenses (so called dis-savings) may be incurred due to the reloca-
            tion, such as increased training costs in return for hiring less skilled labour. Market premium relates to the additional
            profit derived by a multinational company by operating in a jurisdiction with unique qualities impacting on the sale
            and demand of a service or product.”

               10.4.7 UN Transfer Pricing Manual for Developing Countries, 2013, 10.4.7.3, 10.4.7.5 “The main issue in transfer
            pricing is the quantification and allocation of location savings and location rents among the associated enterprises.
            Using an arm’s length pricing approach, the allocation of location savings and rents between associated enterprises
            should be made by reference to what independent parties would have agreed in comparable circumstances. The
            Indian transfer pricing administration believes it is possible to use the Profit Split Method to determine arm’s length
            allocation of location savings and rents in cases where comparable uncontrolled transactions are not available. In
            these circumstances, it is considered that the functional analysis of the parties to the transaction (functions per-
            formed, assets owned and risks assumed), and the bargaining power of the parties (which at arm’s length would
            be determined by the competitiveness of the market—availability of substitutes, cost structure, etc.) should both be
            considered appropriate factors. . . . Hypothetically, if an unrelated third party had to compensate another party to the
            transaction in a low-cost jurisdiction by an amount that was equal to the cost savings and location rents attributable
            to the location, there would be no incentive for the unrelated third party to relocate business to a low-cost jurisdic-
            tion. Thus, the arm’s length compensation for cost savings and location rents should be such that both parties would
            benefit from participating in the transaction. In other words, it should not be less than zero and yet not greater than
            the value of cost savings and locations rents combined. Moreover, it should also reflect an appropriate split of the
            cost savings and location rents between the parties.”

         Box A.1: Example of comparability adjustments for LSAs

         A French group entity produces goods for associated enterprises on the basis, for illustrative purposes,
         of a cost plus 10% compensation. The COGS is Euro 10 million. Moving production to a Chinese
         group company leads to recurring cost savings of Euro 3 million in COGS. Table a displays how the
         appropriate “location savings” can be calculated to compensate the Chinese group entity in relation to
         Category A, B and C assets.

    on contractual re-allocations of risk.49 It seeks to address this by providing that where a party can-
    not in fact exercise meaningful and specifically defined control over the risks, or does not have
    financial capacity to assume the risks, then the arm’s length principle means that the risk (and con-
    sequently profits) will not be allocated to them. The risks will be allocated to the party that actually
    exercises control and has the financial capacity to assume the risks. Accordingly, the revisions to
    Chapter 1 of the OECD TP guidelines reflects the clarification of the treatment of risk.50

    In the context of this study various risks have been grouped into the two main categories of exog-
    enous, i.e., external to the enterprise, and endogenous risks, i.e., inherent in the nature of the enter-
    prise and the type of activities/operations that it carries on.

    Exogenous risks include:

          ■■   Market risk consists of sales volume risk and price risk, which influence the revenues
               and therefore the profitability of a company. Sales volume risk occurs when there are fluc-
               tuations in the volumes sold due to increased competition in the marketplace, adverse
               demand conditions within the market, or the inability of the company to develop or main-
               tain markets or position products and services to targeted customers. Price risk occurs
               when there are fluctuations in the prices that can be charged to customers due to chang-
               ing demand-supply circumstances. Market risks also include competition from substitute
               commodities or changes incurred due to trends in culture or technology.
          ■■   Currency/foreign exchange risk—Changing foreign exchange rates may reduce revenue
               and the value of equity in foreign subsidiaries. Foreign exchange rate risk arises when a
               transaction takes place in more than one currency and the fluctuations in the exchange
               rates between the currencies result in losses.
          ■■   Social/political/sovereign/legal risk—During the exploration, development and operations
               processes, social or political risks may impede successful development of the mineral resources.
               At the limit, social unrest may result in the end of the operations. There may be extra costs
               incurred due to corruption. Changes in law may bring about plans for the “nationalization of

                      resources” or the declaration of conservation zones, which may affect the security of license
                      tenure. Changes in taxation may affect the financial viability of a mining operation.
                 ■■   Natural disaster risk—Earthquakes, floods, volcanic eruptions, etc., are natural disaster
                      factors that can put the mining operations in serious danger.
                 ■■   Environmental risk—Mining developments are allowed to proceed subject to a number of
                      environmental conditions. Quantum changes in legislation and regulations related to the
                      environment may significantly impact the commercial viability of a mining operation. This
                      is in addition to the pressure for organisations to behave in increasingly socially, ethically
                      and environmentally responsible ways brought about by growing societal expectations.

            Endogenous risks include:

                 ■■   Exploration risk—Different minerals present different levels of exploration risk. The prob-
                      ability of discovering some minerals, such as gold and certain base metals and nickel min-
                      erals, which are found in small concentrations as a proportion of the ore mass, in often
                      deep, steeply dipping, structurally complex geological terranes, may be very low (e.g.,
                      1/100 in greenfields and 2 to 4% in brownfields exploration). Discovery is easier for certain
                      bulk commodities (e.g., iron ore, coal, bauxite) where the useful minerals constitute a large
                      proportion of the ore and generally feature extensive, flattish and near surface ore bodies.
                      In this case economic feasibility is a function of grade and metallurgical quality of the ore
                      and of the deposits logistics.
                           This means that each successful mineral discovery is the culmination of exploration
                      programs carried out over several years, entailing a large number of unsuccessful projects.
                      In the majority of developing countries where exploration and mining projects are ring-
                      fenced for tax purposes, mining companies are generally not allowed to claim a deduction
                      for exploration costs incurred in unsuccessful projects against the income generated by
                      their mining operations, with the exception being exploration that has occurred within
                      their income-generating leases. This is not the case in most jurisdictions that tax income
                      at the consolidated level, where the losses incurred in unsuccessful exploration projects
                      are generally deductible from the taxable income of an associated company irrespective of
                      where exploration took place.
                 ■■   Operating/processing risk arises when the geological, structural/geomechanical and min-
                      eralogical natures of a mineral deposit make it difficult or unsafe to mine and/or results
                      in lower than expected mineral recoveries and/or higher capital and operating costs. This
                      risk can also arise where there is negligence or malicious harm caused by employees dur-
                      ing exploitation and mineral processing.
                 ■■   Capacity under-utilization and availability risk are present when circumstances lead to
                      less than full utilisation of a production asset.
                 ■■   Transportation risk arises when conditions prevent mineral products and other out-bound
                      and in-bound goods from being delivered safely, in a timely manner and in the best of
                      condition.
                 ■■   Inventory risk arises when there is the potential for losses associated with stocking and
                      carrying inventory. Losses include those due to declines in prices, adverse movements in
                      exchange rates, obsolescence, shrinkage, or market collapse.
                 ■■   Product liability risk arises when manufacturers, distributors, suppliers and others who
                      deliver mineral products to the market are held responsible for the injuries those products
                      may cause.
                 ■■   Customer credit risk arises when products are supplied or services performed for custom-
                      ers and the related payment is deferred to a later date or not made at all.

            Table A.2 shows an example of the type of risks that are likely to be borne by entities operating in
            the different stages of the mining value-adding chain. These risks are characteristic of the functions
            performed irrespective of the entity to which they may be allocated for delivery.

            A discussion and examples of the complexity of risk allocation will be provided later in the context
            of lending, when dealing with the determination and appropriateness of risk premiums used in set-
            ting the interest rate applicable to loans extended by MNEs to subsidiaries in developing countries.

                     India has questioned the degree to which risks, in general, are apportioned to foreign companies
                     in cases where a large proportion of business decisions and accountability for performance are
                     devolved to local subsidiaries. On this basis it argues that the distribution of profits should be
                     influenced more by the assets and personnel deployed to generate them rather than the risks borne
                     by the various parties.

                             •	   Tax authorities need to verify activities/functions that can be categorised as either primary or
                                  secondary, as well as where they are carried out.
                             •	   Identify those that are most likely to involve transactions between related parties.
                             •	   Clearly identify the resources, assets utilized and risks (both endogenous and exogenous)
                                  borne by different parties in the controlled transaction that are the main factors in establishing
                                  transfer prices.
                             •	   Mining assets may be tangible, which makes it relatively easy to identify, value and account
                                  for them, or intangible.
                             •	   Intangible assets are much harder to identify and particularly to value and account for; as a
                                  consequence determining an appropriate level of remuneration for their transfer or for services
                                  making use of them may be ambiguous and open to abuse, thus requiring rigorous analysis.

4.1  General Considerations
          In general terms, risk exposure is the product of the potential magnitude of an adverse outcome
          multiplied by its probability of occurrence. The approach taken in setting auditing priorities in
          the context of TP risk to revenue in mining should be similar, and targeting for auditing purposes
          should be conducted on the basis of three fundamental questions:

              ■■   Which are the mining operations with the largest turnover and what is the likelihood that
                   related companies may engage in undervaluing exported minerals and in other unwar-
                   ranted tax practices?
              ■■   Within a targeted mining operation, which activities entail the highest cash flows in
                   terms of:
                   •	 their gross revenues from mineral product transfers to and/or
                   •	 capital and operating expenses relating to the provision of services and assets from
                       related entities?
              ■■   How complex are the associated transactions and arrangements, such as the level of hard-
                   to-quantify intangible cost components, the complexity of the legal structures, and the
                   seemingly unwarranted fragmentation of the supply chain?

          The first two questions will be dealt with in detail at the level of different commodities and mine
          sizes in the African context in Part B. It should be recognized, however, that analyses carried out in
          Part B are based upon a number of assumptions pertaining to the quality and characteristics of an
          orebody. Variations in such characteristics in terms of the mining method employed or stripping
          ratio required may materially alter the figures computed and as a result, these analyses provide a
          general guide and do not replace the need for tax administrations to carry out detailed analysis at
          the country level first, and then at the level of individual mining operations.

          Data relevant to taxpayers population profiling can be gathered as part of a schedule to the com-
          pany tax return. This facilitates the identification of not just mining operations according to their
          turnover, but also according to reported profits, levels of intercompany borrowings, the type and
          significance of various related party dealings, and so on. While MNEs can and often do enter into a
          wider variety of intra-group arrangements than are found in the open market between independent
          parties, the nature of these dealings and the extent to which they deviate from the type of arrange-
          ments found in the open market can be one partial indicator of the compliance posture of the MNE.

          Revenue risk in this section is limited to that resulting from transfer mispricing only and does
          not consider other risks, such as from trade misinvoicing, corrupt government practices, industry

                                                    32
	                                                               Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	    33


    defaults, etc. As discussed in the already quoted 2016 UNCTAD report, trade misinvoicing occurs
    when the reported value of exports from one country (A) to a trading partner in another country
    (B), do not match. Under normal circumstances, the following equality should hold: Country B’s
    imports from country A = country A’s exports to country B + freight and insurance. Export under-
    invoicing and imports over-invoicing from/to a highly-taxing country has the effect to reduce the
    tax payable in the country. The UNCTAD report indicates that the revenue leakage attributable
    to misinvoicing in Africa may be significant, but the sources of information and the methodology
    used in generating the relevant estimates have been criticized by some reviewers. Contrary to
    transfer mispricing, the trading partners engaging in misinvoicing need not necessarily be related,
    but may be colluding. Clearly tax authorities and customs need to have good systems to check the
    quantity and quality of the minerals exported and whether all the goods and services claimed had
    actually been received.

    Aside from misinvoicing, it stands to reason that even small mispricing differences between trans-
    fer and at arm’s-length prices when occurring in the context of very large items of either revenue or
    expenses can result in significant tax leakages. The taxing authority should be alert to the presence
    of unusual transactions, anomalous cost structures and protracted low profitability or loss-making
    relative to peers,51 which should be viewed as a prominent indicator of transfer pricing risk, but
    need to be open to reasons for the losses and cannot automatically assume that they are related to
    transfer mispricing.

    It must also be stressed that an early step in terms of auditing must be to ensure that the services
    and/or assets were actually supplied. For example, instances where there appear to be prima facies
    evidence of inconsistencies both in the production volumes declared and in transfer prices having
    been set lower than the corresponding arm’s length prices are not uncommon, but are generally
    difficult to prove unless stringent physical controls are an integral part of the process of assessing
    the appropriateness of transfer prices.

    The third question, regarding the complexity of accurately estimating and auditing transfer prices
    in terms of their compliance with the arm’s length principle in many cross-border transactions,
    whether out- or in-bound, combined with the frequently inadequate transfer pricing auditing
    capacity in developing countries and special fiscal incentives that may have been provided to
    attract FDI, creates risks of either unintentional mispricing or even opportunities for misuse. The
    latter occurs when related companies deliberately underpay for out-bound mineral products from,
    and/or charge above-market prices for in-bound goods and services supplied to, related mining
    entities in developing countries. However, the mere fact that a transaction or arrangement is con-
    ducted between related parties does not per se make it necessarily prone to transfer mispricing or
    constitute a significant risk to revenue.

    The reality is that no tax authority, competent and well-resourced as it may be, will ever have the
    capacity to thoroughly audit all aspects of a complex mining operation. The public interest will
    be best served by directing scarce expertise and resources to a limited number of high-risk areas,
    while enforcing general compliance and simplification in the handling of routine transactions. Sys-
    tematic data collection (both quantitative and qualitative) by the tax authority is essential to its risk
    management. It also follows that different ‘treatment’ strategies should apply to different taxpay-
    ers on the basis of their risk profile and related ‘risk and consequence’ of noncompliance.



    51
      For instance, a 2008 audit by Grant Thornton (2008) revealed that there was an inexplicable increase in the operat-
    ing costs of a large African copper mining company and that the company presented consistent losses for approxi-
    mately 10 years, which it was alleged may indicate profit shifting to its holding company domiciled in Switzerland.
    Nonetheless, persistent loss-making may not always be symptomatic of TP mispricing as the Australian Taxation
    Office has found at the conclusion of their recent unsuccessful, and very costly, court case against SNF (Australia)
    Pty. Ltd. However the court decision ultimately swung on points of law rather than the ‘economic’ reasons under-
    pinning the sustained losses in the subsidiary.
34	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            Where a MNE has gone through a full global business restructuring and optimization process,
            which is further discussed in Chapter 5, many of the functions in the mining value chain may be
            located in foreign countries. At the limit this may leave the mining subsidiary to the extent that it
            may be reduced to merely perform a role akin to that of a contract miner. Unless the host country
            either imposes specific title conditions or provides economic incentives for certain functions to be
            undertaken in the country, new mining ventures may be structured in this way from the start, and
            pre-existing mining projects may have been progressively restructured to achieve an outcome that
            has limited high-value functions remaining in the host country. These structural arrangements may
            be legal, but to the extent that it may prove difficult for tax authorities to gather sufficient informa-
            tion to verify that the functions/activities performed in foreign jurisdictions were actually priced
            at arm’s length, they still constitute significant risks to tax revenue.

            An incentive to fragment the supply chain may also be created for non–cross-border transactions
            between related parties if a country establishes a Special Taxation Zone (STZ) within its boundaries.
            These arrangements, which are set up primarily to attract FDI, may encourage the establishment
            of downstream processing facilities for mineral products in STZs. An example exists in a Southern
            African country where a mining company decided to locate the smelting and refining facility to
            treat its lead-zinc concentrates output within an established STZ in the country. This decision would
            exempt any profit generated by the downstream processing activities from corporate income tax,
            which reflects the government’s objective of attracting investment and job creation to the STZ area.

            The OECD BEPS action items seek to deal with the excesses of such types of arrangements to
            ensure acceptable arm’s length outcomes prevail that reflect the “economic substance” of value-
            adding activities actually occurring in each jurisdiction, and also take into account links to other
            “value drivers.” These may include “significant people functions,” in other words the local pres-
            ence of people and decision makers in the host country. These initiatives, nevertheless, may still
            be somewhat ineffective due to difficulty in gathering and accessing relevant information so that
            informed audit findings can be arrived at. This constraint may impede relieving significant tax rev-
            enue risks in the absence of legislative pricing support, as for instance deeming and default prices.

            In this section and at a more detailed level in Part B, we will look at which activities entail the high-
            est cash flows in terms of:

                 ■■   Their gross revenues from mineral product sales or transfers; and/or
                 ■■   Capital and operating expenses relating to the provision of assets (including hard-to-­
                      quantify intangibles) and services from or the bearing of risk (captive insurance, hedging)
                      by related entities.

            Table A.3 highlights which of the more significant related party transactions (discussed in Chap-
            ter 3 and Appendix A.1) may present higher levels of risk to government revenue, as well as the
            mining stages in which they commonly take place.

            Reliable quantitative information on the extent of the relative importance of various sources of
            revenue risk in the mining context in Africa does not appear to exist and many claims relating to
            leakages appear to be circumstantial. None of the respondents to our TP questionnaire were in a
            position to venture even a qualitative guess. There is some evidence that marketing and financial
            services may rank the highest in terms of revenue risk, based on the magnitude of some recent
            corporate income tax and mineral royalty adjustments relating to marketing hubs in Singapore
            amounting to many hundreds of millions of dollars.

            Additional guidance on the use of risk criteria as part of the development of transfer pricing audit
            programs is provided in Chapter 8 of the WBG “Transfer Pricing and Developing Economies” handbook.

            Some of the transactions in Table A.3 involve the sale or lease of high-value assets, both tangible
            (e.g., mining and mineral processing plant and equipment) and intangible (e.g., exploration and

                  below when dealing with Engineering, Science and Technical hubs. The valuation of arm’s length
                  prices for technical and R&D services can also be extremely complex if they involve unique spe-
                  cialised scientific and technical know-how and/or tightly guarded patented or unprotected but
                  proprietary IP. The OECD’s BEPS Actions 8–10—2015 Final Report contains a detailed discussion
                  on TP issues relating to intangibles, including 29 highly useful illustrative examples.

                  The acquisition or creation of some of these assets by the mining subsidiary may have been funded
                  by related financial subsidiaries of the MNE, involving ongoing recurrent interest payments and
                  a range of related charges and fees. Although the level of debt in the funding structure and the
                  related interest payments and tax deductions may be subject to thin capitalisation and related
                  rules in the legislation, this area still contains significant ambiguity although much of it has been

                  through acquisition from the registered title holder by means of sale, lease, farm-in/out arrangements, bequeaths,
                  etc. In the case of acquisition, the value of the mining rights includes the capitalised value of any resource that may
                  be present.

            clarified in the OECD’s BEPS Action 4: 2015 Final Report. This is discussed in detail below in Sec-
            tion 4.2.6 when dealing with finance hubs.

            Of particular significance, given the magnitude of the related flows, are the transfers of fully or
            partially processed mineral products to related entities that either provide a marketing distribution
            or processing service, or that act as fully fledged traders/marketers and/or smelters that assume
            their ownership and bear the related risks, as discussed in detail below when dealing with market-
            ing hubs. Finally, transfer pricing issues may also arise in the way charges are applied for a range of
            administrative and corporate support services (e.g., financial services, HR, IT, etc., and insurance)
            provided by a related party generally the MNE’s head office.


4.2  Risks Arising in Mining Operations
            4.2.1  General considerations for the use of hubs for the supply of goods and services

            Service centers, frequently referred to as hubs, are often set up within MNEs where one member
            of the MNE group can provide services and/or property, including the transfer or licensing of
            intangible property, to other members of the group. Mining companies commonly use hubs for the
            provision of a range of services, including marketing (broadly defined to sometimes also include
            distribution and shipping); corporate services; engineering, science and technical; procurement
            and logistics; insurance; and finance that could have either been obtained from unrelated expert
            service providers (for example, legal and accounting services) or provided in-house within the
            mining subsidiary itself (for example, training of personnel, financial advice and internal auditing).
            An outline of these arrangements is set out in Chapter VII of the OECD guidelines.

            The structure used by MNEs for their service hubs varies considerably. In some cases significant
            services may be provided by the parent company; in other cases they may be provided by a cen-
            tralized or integrated group that focuses on a particular function (e.g., marketing) throughout the
            group or a region, or a combination of both (e.g., regional marketing hub). Individual related party
            subsidiaries may also be set up solely to provide services to a specific member of the MNE group,
            as opposed to cost contribution arrangements where members of a MNE jointly acquire or provide
            goods or services and allocate the costs and/or the benefits among members.

            Application of the arm’s length principle can be particularly difficult if the services and/or prop-
            erty supplied by related parties do not have parallels in transactions between unrelated parties
            resulting in an absence of valid comparables.

            The IMF has identified that some intra-group transactions may occur only because of the MNEs’
            ability to exploit cross-border tax differentials53 and provides a number of prominent examples of
            this tax-driven behavior, as for example:

                 ■■   Transfer of intangible assets, and
                 ■■   Risk transfer among affiliates where the transfer does not affect the risk borne by the MNE
                      group as a whole.

            The IMF54 suggests that such aggressive tax planning could be countered by:

                 ■■   Developing concrete guidance where it is lacking,
                 ■■   Repudiating perverse interpretations of the arm’s length principle, which may have
                      become commonplace and often tacitly accepted, such as condoning risk stripping and
                      other arrangements, and

         ■■   Adopting carefully designed safe harbours that apply a fixed markup to certain types of
              costs.

    The OECD has recently revised its transfer pricing guidelines for intra-group services55 and high-
    lights two main issues for the analysis:

         ■■   Whether the services have in fact been provided, and
         ■■   What the charge for such services should be for tax purposes, applying the arm’s length
              principle.

    The arm’s length principle only recognizes for tax purposes a charge for a service if the service pro-
    vides the company with economic or commercial value to enhance its commercial position. This can
    be determined by considering whether an independent enterprise in comparable circumstances:

         ■■   Would have been willing to pay a third party for the service, or
         ■■   Would have performed the activity in-house.

    If these criteria are not met, the transaction is not considered an intra-group service under the arm’s
    length principle and the related expenses should be disregarded for tax purposes. This situation
    is more likely to arise where one entity of the MNE group provides services across the group as a
    whole or to groups of members and it may be easily identified when charged out at a flat or pro-
    portionate rate. Care should be taken to ensure that intra-group services are:

         ■■   Not duplicate charges for services already provided by others or in-house.
         ■■   Do not include shareholder services such as coordinating activities like shareholder meet-
              ings, issuing of shares in the parent company, preparation for and satisfying reporting
              requirements associated with the consolidation of accounts and the costs of raising funds
              for common acquisitions by group members. These must be contrasted with services pro-
              vided specifically to a particular subsidiary, as for example, where services are provided
              to the mining company itself such as raising funds for acquisition of capital items by the
              mining company and detailed planning, procurement and construction of its mining proj-
              ect that would be regarded as providing financing and technical services respectively, as
              discussed in the following sections.
         ■■   Do not include charges for incidental benefits, such as a higher credit rating by reason of its
              affiliation alone (passive association). These may be contrasted with a higher credit rating
              being due to a guarantee (active association).

    The updated OECD transfer pricing guidelines includes a simplified charge mechanism to be used
    by tax administrations for low value adding intra-group services.56

    There are basically two methods that are used by hubs to charge-out their services:

         1.	 The direct charge method—this method is used where the services can be readily identified
             and is most frequently used where the hub provides services similar to those provided by
             independent parties. In such cases tax administrations would expect to see the CUP or cost
             plus methods used to establish an arm’s length price.
         2.	 The indirect charge method—this method is used where the services are not readily iden-
             tifiable, such as where they are incorporated into another transfer of property. Similarly,
             this method is used where costs are allocated and apportioned on some basis, as for exam-
             ple, where payroll services are charged on the basis of the respective number of personnel
             employed by the different subsidiaries of the MNE. This indirect method is frequently used

                     where services are shared centrally and the most appropriate arm’s length method may be
                     the transactional profit split method.

            Where MNEs have used the indirect charge method, tax administrations need to consider whether
            the allocation keys used are consistent with the arm’s length principle. This involves looking at the
            allocation keys from the perspective of both the service provider and the recipient, to determine
            whether it reflects a reasonable sharing that independent parties acting at arm’s length would have
            negotiated and agreed to on the basis of their respective bargaining powers.

            In practice, the issue of appropriate allocation keys have in the past been subjected to protracted
            audits, and often disputes between tax administrations and MNEs. Underlying these disputes is a
            difference of opinion as to what information should be kept by MNEs’ hubs to substantiate alloca-
            tion and apportionment. Tax administrations often consider that very detailed information about
            all aspects of the services should be provided, for example, hourly time sheets to identify what
            proportion of staff time is spent on different mining projects. MNEs maintain that such detail is
            unnecessary for their business purposes and imposes excessively onerous compliance costs.

            For the tax administration, the revenue return from such acrimonious audits and disputes is often
            not commensurate with the time and resources invested. In addition, these types of disputes tend
            to divert resources from work on higher-risk compliance areas. A cooperative approach should be
            promoted between the tax administration and the industry sector to consult and reach agreement
            on acceptable allocation keys for a range of commonly performed services. The publication of
            acceptable administrative safe harbors by a tax administration may in some cases lead to a more
            harmonious relationship and possibly greater efficiency for both the tax administration and the
            industry. This practice, although recommended by BEPS, is not necessarily acceptable by all tax
            administrations, as for instance South Africa, though championed as providing practical certainty
            by others, such as Australia.

            Similarly, some tax administrations have expressed the view that the use of APAs or administra-
            tive rulings on a case-by-case basis to cover payments by the mining company to a service hub for
            more unique or uncommon services may be premature in the African context at the current stage of
            development. There is no question that the process of putting an APA in place is resource and skill
            intensive as well as time consuming, which, in the majority of cases explains their poor acceptance
            in Africa.

            When considering an APA program, tax administrations need to decide as to whether to allow only
            unilateral, only bilateral, or both types of APAs. APAs have a number of important costs and the
            decision on their introduction should be based on a careful assessment of costs and benefits.

            To be effective, the more ‘up front’ approach of APAs should be accompanied by the provision of
            relevant information and include details about the information that is available and will be kept by
            the mining company to establish the basis of the allocation, and enable its verification when and if
            needed. Where such a ruling or other agreement is achieved between the tax administration and
            the mining company, it can remain in place without the need to be reviewed for several years unless
            there are material changes in the services provided or related business or market circumstances.

            Some service hubs may be organized on a regional basis as a holding company or headquarters
            company providing services to MNE enterprises in particular regions. These types of service hubs
            are rarely located in any of the countries that the subsidiaries they provide services to are located.

            Regional service hubs provide an opportunity for the tax administrations of relevant countries to
            co-operate in looking at the transfer pricing risks and develop a common application of the arm’s
            length principle. This can save time and effort for the tax administrations and also provide greater
            certainty and reduced cost of compliance for MNEs.

    4.2.2  Marketing hubs

    The term “global marketing centre” or “marketing hub” is commonly used by MNEs to cover a
    potentially broad range of functions and activities. These may encompass the provision of such ser-
    vices as marketing, sales, packaging and distribution, transportation/shipping, warehousing and
    related administrative functions to one or a number of mining and/or smelting/refining related
    entities within the same MNE group. The OECD refers to this type of arrangement as “shared ser-
    vice centres.” MNEs are free to establish hubs based on any of the above functions in isolation or
    under a different grouping that best suits their business objectives.

    Depending on the contractual arrangements, whether title is passed to it and the risk assumed,
    the role of a marketing hub may range from a mere marketing support function to that of a com-
    missionaire or commission agent, all the way to a fully-fledged marketer/distributor function.
    As discussed later in greater detail, it is worth noting that many mineral commodities destined
    to terminal markets (e.g., base and precious metals) are produced by mining companies at source
    in compliance with stringent quality and standards specifications, which significantly weakens
    the argument for compensation for marketing rather than for simple sales services. These issues
    become more complex when dealing with unusual mineral products (e.g., industrial minerals,
    gemstones and some types of metal concentrates) not normally traded on terminal markets.

    A clear understanding and determination of the functions actually performed by a marketing hub
    is critical in assessing the most appropriate approach for setting the related transfer prices.


    4.2.2.1  General characteristics of mineral products sales

    As the source of revenues for most mining companies is limited to the receipt from sales for their
    mineral products, it is critical for the tax administration in assessing whether the relevant transfer
    prices are set at arm’s length to have a good understanding of the way sales are conducted for dif-
    ferent commodities.

    As already discussed, depending on the mineral commodity, sales/transfers may involve a range
    of different mineral products along the downstream processing route, ranging from broken ore
    through intermediate products to various essentially smelted and/or refined metallic forms. For
    example, as discussed in greater depth in Part B, in the case of iron the bulk of trade is in ore (both
    lump and fines), beneficiated ore and magnetite concentrates, pellets and sinters, while copper
    is traded as concentrates, blister copper and cathode, with very limited tonnages of high-grade,
    direct-shipment ore, and gold is primarily sold as doré bars, an amalgam of gold and silver.

    Mineral products can be sold generally on a cost & freight (CFR) or on a cost, insurance and freight
    (CIF) basis at the port of destination, or on a free-on-board (FOB) basis at the port of origin, by
    means of:

        ■■   Spot sales or over the counter (OTS) sales to individual buyers, merchants or on termi-
             nal markets. An example of a spot sale agreement for the delivery of iron ore conducted
             through the Tianjin Bohai Commodity Exchange e-Spot-Trade facility is provided in
             Appendix A.2, with the main terms of this contract summarized in Box A.2.
        ■■   Off-take agreements, including take or pay, take and pay, and of various durations from
             short-term (typically one to three months) to longer-term (typically ranging from annual
             to multi-annual, and in exceptional circumstances over the life of the mine). Off-take con-
             tracts are designed to bring a degree of revenue stability to a project and are often entered
             into to facilitate securing project finance for the development of a project, and to signifi-
             cantly reduce the sales volume risk, but generally not the price volatility risk. Major con-
             tractual terms include:

      PRICE: Shall be the sum of the metal payments less the deductions as specified below:
      Metal payments will be averaged over the quotational period:
      Copper: 96.50% of the final copper content, subject to a minimum deduction of 1.0 unit paid for at
      the official London Metal Exchange cash settlement quotation for Grade A copper, as published in the
      Metal Bulletin in London in US Dollars.
      Silver: 90% of the final silver content, subject to a minimum deduction of 30 grams per dry metric ton,
      paid for at the London Bullion spot US Dollar quotation for silver, as published by the Metal Bulletin in
      London in cents.
      Gold: 90% of the final gold content, subject to a minimum deduction of 1 gram per dry metric ton, paid
      for at the mean of the London AM/PM US Dollar daily quotations for gold, as published in the Metal
      Bulletin in London.
      Deductions:
      Treatment and refining charges, including those for gold and silver, shall be agreed mutually between
      the Buyer and the Seller during the fourth quarter of each calendar year prior to the contractual year
      of shipment.
      QUOTATIONAL PERIOD agreed mutually between the Buyer and the Seller during the fourth quarter
      of each calendar year.
      PAYMENT shall be in US Dollars, by telegraphic transfer: 90% of the provisional invoice value paid,
      30 days following the presentation of a full set of shipping documents for each shipment and balance of
      10% paid promptly upon completion of all other formalities regarding the final agreed weights, assays
      and prices.
      TITLE within each shipment passes from the Seller to the Buyer upon his first provisional payment.
      RISK passes from the Seller to the Buyer when the Products pass over the ship’s rail at the port of
      loading.
      INSURANCE is covered by Buyer from the time risk passes from the Seller.




    CFR and/or CIF sales at the port of destination are the most common approach used for bulk com-
    modities such as iron ore, coal, alumina, etc.

    Other commodities products, such as base metals and nickel concentrates, raw metals (e.g., blister
    copper, nickel matte, doré, rough diamonds, etc.) have traditionally been sold/transferred on an
    FOB or CIF basis to independent or related smelters/refiners or marketers that then on-sell the
    products after undertaking activities such as blending, smelting, refining, grading, polishing and
    batching for distribution and sale to end users.

    In practice, a long-term supply agreement may involve quite a number of individual shipments,
    each covered by a quotation/price reference period. Each transaction may involve an initial pay-
    ment based on an estimated transfer price and subsequent monthly or quarterly pricing/profit rec-
    onciliations, following processing and subsequent sale of the mineral product to an unrelated buyer.
    This process may also bring consideration of exchange rate movements over the period into play.
42	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            For tax administrations, the observation of the actual price paid by an independent third party
            for equivalent products provides the best reference arm’s length price. If that arm’s length price
            is struck at the point of exit from the host jurisdiction, for example FOB at loading at the port of
            export, it will properly reflect the gross economic value added within the country. If the arm’s
            length price is struck at a later point, for example, at the point of transfer to a related party marketer
            domiciled in a foreign country, the proper reflection of the economic value for the host country can
            be calculated by netting back from the arm’s length price realised by the related marketing entity in
            the subsequent sale of the mineral product to a third party the costs of shipping, demurrage, insur-
            ance, etc., and an appropriate arm’s length compensation for the marketing and sales functions
            carried out by the related party. One difficulty experienced by tax administrations is that access to
            the sales invoice to the third party buyer of the mineral commodity is often not made available by
            the MNE’s marketing subsidiary.

            As already pointed out, an appropriate compensation should reflect whether the related party
            is just providing marketing/distributing services, or if it is a fully fledged marketer/distributor
            having taken ownership and in some cases physical possession of the minerals and bearing the
            associated risks. Direct experience has shown that in many cases the most suitable OECD method
            for calculating this margin should be the cost plus (CP) method. However, some marketing hubs
            have argued that in some cases their services included use of hard-to-value marketing IP, as in the
            case of some specialized minerals, the price of which is determined by meeting strict individual
            customers’ specifications in niche markets, and that, as a consequence, compensation should be
            based on a percentage of the gross value of sales. This approach is generally highly contested by tax
            administrations because it may give rise to excessive returns to the marketing hub (as evidenced by
            abnormally high profit ratios). Evidence of comparable independent marketers charging for their
            services on this basis is normally not readily obtainable.

            In addition, if the sale price of a mineral product to a shareholder is lower than the correspond-
            ing market price (shareholder’s discount), that discount should be analysed and, if unwarranted,
            added back to the realised price to truly reflect an arm’s length price. Shareholder’s discounts are
            often a feature of off-take agreements entered with significant subscribers of equity capital at the
            critical time when a mine is first developed/constructed or significantly expanded (see the West
            African Iron Ore Mine example in Box B.11).

            As a result, it is suggested that legislative deeming and/or default pricing provisions may be
            needed to provide the tax administration with an alternative way to approximate the arm’s length
            price in an efficient and timely way. In the case of sales, such legislative support might take the
            form of an approximation of the arm’s length price based, for example, on a weighted average of
            market quoted prices for commodities that satisfy stringent market standards, or where the quality
            of the commodity is variable, then on the use of normalising indexes (where available) over a speci-
            fied period of time. This approximation of the arm’s length price would then be used for transfer
            pricing purposes unless relevant information (i.e., the actual price paid by a third party purchaser
            of the commodity to a related entity offshore) is provided upon request, in a timely manner, in line
            with the prevailing legislation. This approach would ensure that undisclosed commissions taken
            by an interposed related party and not visible in the consolidated MNE’s accounts do not hinder
            the proper calculation of an arm’s length price for the tax administration of the host country. Docu-
            mentation requirements will be discussed in greater detail in Part C.

            New guidance dealing with commodity transactions has been added to the OECD transfer pricing
            guidelines (after para 2.16) as part of the BEPS final reports.57 This guidance:

                  ‘quoted price’.
                       A ‘quoted price’ must be used by unrelated parties as a reference to determine
                  prices in transactions between them. In this context, a ‘quoted price’ includes prices
                  obtained from recognised and transparent price reporting or statistical agencies, or
                  government price-setting agencies. The economically relevant characteristics must
                  also be ‘comparable’—these characteristics may include the physical features and
                  quality of the commodity, contractual terms, volumes, period, timing and terms of
                  delivery, transport, insurance and foreign currency terms. Price adjustments for rea-
                  sonable accuracy may be needed to ensure reliability of this method.

              Where the actual conduct between parties differs from that agreed between them, or where
              the pricing date or agreed pricing periods do not reflect what independent parties would
              have agreed to in the circumstances (taking into account industry practices), the pricing
              date may be deemed to be the date of shipment and the price will be the average quoted
              price on the date of shipment, subject to any appropriate adjustments.

    This new guidance for commodities is expected to greatly assist African countries to address some
    of the major transfer pricing risks in the mining sector. The guidance is to be supplemented through
    further work by the G20 Development Working Group.

    Where the interposed related party entity is located in a country with an effective exchange of
    an information article,59 opportunities should be explored for specific or spontaneous exchanges
    of information relating to contracts and pricing arrangements between the related party entity
    and the third party purchaser. This should form part of a systematic information collection pro-
    gram. In Africa, exchange of information between some tax treaty partner countries has tended
    to be limited, in part due to the paucity and ineffectiveness of the electronic information systems
    needed to facilitate audits in many of these countries. This situation, however, is rapidly changing
    creating an increased capacity for tax authorities to obtain the necessary information to identify,
    investigate and penalize non-compliant companies. Importantly, exchange of information provi-
    sions can be accessed without entering into a comprehensive bilateral double taxation agreement
    (DTA). The benefits of exchange of information mechanisms can be delivered by Tax Information
    Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), or by becoming a signatory to the OECD multilateral treaty60 on
    mutual administrative assistance in tax matters (see Box A.4). However, obtaining exchanges of
    information can be at times a lengthy, dragged out process.

    4.2.2.2  Transfer pricing issues relating to marketing hubs

    It was relatively early in the history of global business optimization for marketing and, in some
    cases, procurement functions to be moved from the mining entity to a foreign related party hub.
    Many mining subsidiaries now use a marketing hub entity created by the MNE in a foreign coun-
    try on the basis that it is closer to customers, trading centres and shipping/warehousing facilities,
    which generally are low-tax jurisdictions.61 In a minority of cases the marketing hub accepts physi-
    cal delivery of the mineral products and provides full warehousing, packaging and distribution
    services. However, it is more often that so-called ‘triangular’ transactions occur, often involving
    sales on the ‘high seas’ taking place as shown in Figure A.11. Under these circumstances the mar-
    keting company may be handling the customer liaison and the sales contractual arrangements, and
    may or may not take title. Sometimes the marketing hub also performs a shipping and insurance

    African countries signatories to the Convention are Cameroon, Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia.
    61
       This may not be obvious from the headline tax rate; for example, Luxembourg has a 30% company tax rate but
    agreements may be made with the government to reduce the tax down in some cases to 2.5%. Other jurisdictions, as
    for instance Singapore, engage in similar agreements or specific concessions.

                Box A.4: Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) and OECD Multilateral
                Convention

                Comprehensive bilateral double tax treaties are not necessary for international exchange of informa-
                tion. Mechanisms can be delivered by Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) and also by
                multilateral treaty. Signatory to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax
                Matters, which entered into force 1 June 2011 are the African countries of Cameroon, Ghana, Morocco,
                Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia.
                TIEAs address information exchange only and require exchange of ‘foreseeably relevant’ information.
                They follow a standard and fairly simple bilateral model that was developed by the OECD and non-
                member states. Consequently negotiations are often conducted by correspondence. Some change to
                revenue administration laws would be needed to enable a country to collect and exchange all relevant
                information, even if that information is not required for its own purposes or is held by a financial insti-
                tution. The information goes beyond financial information to information about ownership structures.
                There would also need to be rules to facilitate cooperation in tax investigations. There has been a
                rapid increase in numbers of TIEAs in recent years, which may also be entered into between regional
                countries.
                The OECD multilateral convention covers similar issues to the bilateral TIEA. There is some scope
                for countries to preserve their position on part of the multilateral convention. A country could quickly
                develop a network of information exchange with over 70 major countries, including all major trading
                and investment partners. The main advantage with the OECD multilateral convention is that a once-
                only investment in ratifying the multilateral convention is made. Similar changes to revenue administra-
                tion laws for TIEAs may also be required.

          ■■   Determining when during the ‘quotation period’ ownership of the mineral is actually
               transferred, which, given the volatility of commodity prices, may influence the applica-
               ble transfer price62 and adjustments for discrepancies in transport and other incidental
               expenses. These issues have been ameliorated by the recent revision of Chapter II of the
               TP Guidelines included in the 2015 BEPS Final Reports package on deemed pricing dates;

          ■■   Criteria for establishing marketing fees including the degree to which these services
               include the possible use of specialised proprietary IP and other intangibles; and
          ■■   Determination of payable grades, precious metals credits, penalties for impurities, etc.

    Some of these pricing issues will be discussed in greater detail in Part B, where specific detailed
    examples are provided for some individual mineral commodities.

    As already discussed, the functions performed by a marketing service provider may range from
    marketing support through to the role of commissionaire or marketing agent to that of a fully-
    fledged Marketing Hub (Figure A.12). Determination of which of the above roles is performed
    should be based on facts, as to whether the hub is fully resourced financially and physically to
    carry out the functions, assumes ownership and takes delivery of the minerals, and is in a position
    to bear and actually bears the related risks. Accordingly, the functions performed by the hub may
    or may not include any of the following:

          ■■   Marketing Services involving:
               •	 Engaging customers
               •	 Handling orders
               •	 Processing of related financial transactions
               •	 Providing support for the product marketed
               •	 Development of innovative marketing systems and strategies, particularly for those
                  mineral products that are not commonly traded in terminal markets, requiring specific
                  customer specifications.
          ■■   Shipping and Distribution Services involving:
               •	 Arranging chartering of ore carriers or other vessels and of possible transhipping
               •	 Warehousing and packaging products for shipping and distribution to customers




     The recently release OECD’s BEPS publication Aligning Transfer Pricing Outcomes to Value Creation, Actions 8–10—
    62

    2015 Final Reports specifically addresses this type of risk.

                      •	   Negotiating address commission,63 dead freight, bunkerage and demurrage64
                      •	   Providing for frequently captive freight insurance, as discussed later.

            As the list shows, the functions carried out by many foreign marketing hubs have changed over
            the years with a trend towards a broader range of services being provided. Many of the marketing
            hubs now claim to be adding greater economic value, which in their view justifies remuneration
            moving from a cost plus basis, which is typically associated with the functional profile of a cost
            centre, to one of the higher forms of remuneration typically associated with the functional profile
            of a profit centre. This is especially the case where the marketing hub takes physical (not just legal)
            ownership of the mineral product upon or after export and on-sells it to an end user.

            The fundamental question from a tax authority’s point of view relates to the extent to which the
            marketing hub can in substance add value to the value chain through influencing the price of the
            underlying commodity, the cost of production and transport, and/or the quantities that are sold.

            While it is true that marketing activities may add some value, the degree to which they will do so
            depends primarily, as shown in Table A.4, on the nature of the product sold. The value added will
            range from very low for sales of refined base and precious metals into terminal markets, where
            their stringent specifications are met primarily by the mining company’s operations at source, to
            high in the case of some specialty metals and some non-metallic industrial minerals where market-
            ing entails identifying and satisfying unique and stringent specifications set by potential customers
            on the basis of their value-in-use. The value added by marketing may be very high in the case of
            certain fancy gemstones (e.g., pink diamonds), the demand for which has been created by cleverly
            devised advertising campaigns and by a selective, by-invitation, approach to their tenders through
            high-fashion houses in New York and Paris. In essence, the amount of value added by the ‘market-
            ing’ functions is largely dependent on the nature of the different commodities handled and related
            technical complexity in meeting the market demands for quality.

            Contractual arrangements between the mining company and a related marketing hub may involve
            a change in ownership beyond the export point. The mining hub entity will also have contrac-
            tual arrangements in place covering sales of the product to unrelated parties. A question arises as
            to whether these contractual arrangements amount to the undertaking of a distribution function,
            especially where the mineral product is shipped directly from the host country to the foreign pur-
            chaser, that is to say sold on the “high seas” and is not off-loaded or repackaged in the country in
            which the marketing hub is located.

            Very high-value markups, in excess of 2.5% of the value of sales, have been reported65 in the case of
            iron ore and coal marketing hubs based in Singapore. In the case of one of the main Australian pro-
            ducers, high markups have generated an average of about $1 billion in revenue for the hub in recent
            years. This has been the subject of an inquiry resulting in AUD 522 million adjustments to the tax
            payable by the Australian entity and of AUD 288 million adjustment to its mineral royalty liability.

            This level of markup can lead to Berry ratios66 that vastly exceed those that may be expected by the
            largest majority of businesses, even high-end professional service providers. For example, Berry


            63
               This is a commission typically of the order of a few percentage points charged by the charterer to the owner of
            the vessel in addition to any commission charged by a possible shipping broker. The ship owner will tend to add
            these commissions to the shipping rate per tonne of cargo to be charged to the charterer. It is in effect a mechanism
            whereby charterers can direct moneys toward the cost of running their department, which in some instances may
            escape the attention of relevant tax authorities.
            64
               Demurrage at the port of export is generally accounted for as part of the operating cost, that at the port of destina-
            tion as part of the marketing/shipping cost.

            ratios as high as 6.5 have been observed, which means that profits were 650% the magnitude of
            operating costs.67 Such circumstances raise a number of issues about whether such arrangements
            are consistent with the arm’s length principle, including whether a mining company dealing at
            arm’s length with an independent party would have entered into an arrangement on the same
            terms and conditions. It would also be expected that with such a high Berry ratio of profitability
            the market would be very quickly contested, and third parties would be offering the same services
            at lower prices.

            Needless to say that this very high rate of profitability has been, and continues to be, strongly
            contested by the relevant tax authorities. In the case of one of the major bulk commodity produc-
            ers, this has led to adjustments amounting to many hundreds of millions of dollars in both tax and
            royalty payments. At the time of publication, these issues were still being resolved in the courts.

            It should be noted that Berry ratios are only an ‘indicator’, a risk filter of potential transfer pricing
            issues and they are not used by tax administrations to compute the arm’s length price in the risk
            assessment and audit phases. As such, Berry ratios should be used with some caution68 for high
            value professional services, such as with some mining service providers. They are also generally
            not useful as an indicator for nonroutine cases involving the use of high value intangibles.69 When
            used with such cautions in mind, Berry Ratios are a relatively simple detection risk filter that can
            be used across a large number of tax returns to quickly identify cases that might warrant further
            scrutiny and assurance via a more detailed risk assessment.

            When looking at marketing and related arrangements it is important to examine the contract
            between the miner and the marketing entity to identify the legal allocation of risk. The contract
            terms and conditions should then be compared to the economic reality, which is to say to the actual
            conditions established by the functional analysis.

            In addition, for the sake of transparency, it would be expected that the contract between the mar-
            keting entity and the independent purchaser of the mineral product should also be provided by the
            MNE and examined by the tax administration. However, MNEs’ subsidiaries often prevent these
            contracts being provided to the tax administration, arguing that they are not the legal holder of
            the information, and therefore unable to provide it. This is remarkable considering that the MNE
            parent company is the ultimate controller of all its subsidiaries activities including their flow of
            information and should be in a position, if it wanted, to disclose that information. In addition,
            it may claim that access to information should be restricted on the basis of its commercial and in
            confidence nature. It is suggested that such claims should also be rejected in the interests of trans-
            parency, as well as recognizing that tax administrations are usually bound by secrecy provisions
            from disclosing such information. The annual financial accounts of some of the entities constituting
            the marketing hub may, however, be publicly available in some of the jurisdictions70 in which they
            reside.

            Under some jurisdictions, the law includes deeming provisions or the ability to disregard the actual
            conditions agreed and replace them with ‘arm’s-length conditions’. In other words, the practice of
            transfer pricing is not limited to merely pricing the actual conditions agreed by the associated
            enterprises without regard to the surrounding questions in relation to whether or not they are
            conditions that independent parties acting in their own commercial interests would have agreed.
            Deeming provisions are also found in the mineral royalty legislation of some countries to address
            the determination of the value on which ad valorem mineral royalties should be levied. If companies

    fail to produce the actual sales invoices from marketing hubs to third parties, a process is triggered
    whereby the taxing authorities estimate and recommend to the relevant Ministers an alternative
    price for his/her determination leading to adjustments in the amount of royalty payable.

    The marketing contracts between related parties should be examined to determine whether they
    are consistent with the terms and conditions observed in unrelated party dealings, keeping in mind
    that some comparability adjustments may be necessary for possible differences if the unrelated
    sales are at the prevailing spot price. This would include looking at the hub’s ability to bear the risk
    and its ability to mitigate or control the related risk factors to determine whether the risk allocation
    implied in the contract is grounded in reality.71

    Some of the financial risks that should be considered are:

         1.	 Credit risk, which includes risk of nonpayment. In the context of mining some of the factors
             that would need to be looked at are:
             a.	 the likelihood of the nonpayment given the standing of the purchasers (especially as
                 many purchases, as for instance by Chinese purchasers, are State backed);
             b.	 what is done to mitigate the consequences, for instance by requiring the application of
                 advance payment or part payment, security and guarantees.
         2.	 Transport risk, which includes the risk for loss during shipping. In the context of mining
             products this risk is often dealt with by insurance, which may be through a related party
             captive insurer, which in turn, may be covered through reinsurance.
         3.	 Inventory risk, which involves the risk of carrying inventory when either demand slows or
             prices drop or both. This risk will arise only where the marketer is also a true distributor and
             maintains a stockpile.
         4.	 Human resource risk of losing key staff, which in turn may mean the loss of key clients.

    Box A.5 portrays the results of an audit recently conducted by SARS of a marketing hub conducting
    sales of mineral commodities on the high seas on behalf of a South African producer.

    To determine an appropriate arm’s length profit margin analysts are often confronted with having
    to choose within a range of relevant comparables, often displaying, as shown in Box A.5, signifi-
    cantly different values. Deciding upon which value within the range should be accepted/selected
    will be determined by taking into account the characteristics of the transaction, keeping in mind
    that in an uncontrolled transaction the bargaining power to negotiate a remuneration high in the
    range would have been greater for a party providing services involving significant use of tangible
    and intangible assets and the bearing of significant risk.

    In practice two approaches are generally adopted, which make use of the percentiles of the distri-
    bution of comparables values, and in particular:

         ■■   The median, i.e., 50th percentile or second quartile (Q2), that is to say the value where half
              of the comparable values per unit sold or transferred are lower and half higher. The median
              is a better measure than a simple arithmetic mean that may be distorted if the value distri-
              bution is skewed. This is the measure most commonly adopted by the tax administration
              in transfer pricing cases (where mispricing is alleged); or
         ■■   The inter-quartile range, i.e., selecting a value between the first quartile (Q1) (where 25%
              of values are lower) and the 3rd quartile (Q3) (where 75% of values are lower). The remu-
              neration is placed within the inter-quartile range based on the degree of asset utilization
              and risk bearing.

                Box A.5: Determination of whether a marketing hub performed the functions of a
                fully-fledged marketer or merely those of a sales agent or commissionaire

                The South African mining company that produces the commodities employs over a dozen thousand
                people, owns the related mining licenses and technology and arranges the logistics to convey its prod-
                uct to the export harbor. It also maintains a stockpile and bears the market risk, customer credit risk,
                foreign exchange risk, product liability risk, and inventory and quality risk.
                The mining company has developed strong relationships directly with 12 key, long-term supply custom-
                ers. Sales are carried out using a related marketing company registered in a low-tax foreign jurisdic-
                tion, which employs two managerial and two support staff. The marketing company handles customer
                relationships, markets the commodities and negotiates sales contracts, but bears limited or no risk. The
                marketing company sells both directly to third parties, in which case it charges 8% of the FOB value of
                sales, or outsources its functions to a third party agent that earns 3% of the FOB value.
                The marketing company justifies its transfer prices on the basis of an external benchmark for distribu-
                tion of metals with an arm’s length range of 1.32 to 16.36% and a median of 3.32%.
                The marketing company maintained that it performs the role of a full risk-taking marketer/distributor
                responsible for around 35% of the world’s demand for the specific commodity and as such performs a
                vital role in expanding the business of the entire group. However the facts and documentary evidence
                provided by the taxpayer to SARS indicate that for the last 20 years few additional customers were
                established beyond the original 12 key customers procured by the mining company. Yet, over a period
                of 10 years the marketing company received R 10 billion worth of profits justified on the basis of their
                claimed strategic and vital role in the supply chain and of the related risk borne.
                At the conclusion of the audit SARS took the view that:
                      •	   The marketing company in substance performed the functions of a marketing agent;
                      •	   Was not bearing the full risk; and
                      •	   The comparable data provided by the taxpayer were not reliable.




            The recommended methodology to calculate the median and first and third quartiles is illustrated
            in Box A.6. In general, it is easier to source comparables for routine functions making low use of
            intangibles (e.g., accounting) than for specialized nonroutine services involving a high level of pro-
            prietary IP and/or risk-bearing (e.g., engineering/process design) for which it would be more likely
            that possible comparables may be obtainable in the general field of research and development.

            Suggested questions that could be asked by the tax administration when undertaking a functional
            analysis of a marketing hub during the audit stage have been provided in Appendix A.4.

         Box A.6: How to calculate the percentiles and quartiles within a range of profit
         margin comparables

         Irrespective of whether the comparables relate to routine or nonroutine functions, there are a number
         of methods to calculate various percentiles including the quartiles of a sample. To the extent that ana-
         lysts will nowadays use computer spreadsheets to make the relevant calculations, the two methods
         described below are those underpinning the 2013 version of Microsoft Excel, i.e.:
              •	   A—Inclusive percentiles, which will be used if the number of members (N) in the sample is large
                   and values below the minimum and above the maximum are considered highly improbable,
                   that is to say that their cumulative probability distribution is zero and 100% respectively, and
              •	   B—Exclusive percentiles, which will be used if N is small and one may expect that values
                   below the minimum and above the maximum may occur, albeit with a relatively low level of
                   probability.
         It is assumed that the search for comparables in terms of arm’s length margins realized on the provision
         of a specific specialized technical service has yielded a number (N 5 7) of individually different values
         as listed in Table c, ranging between a minimum of 4.8% and a maximum of 14% of the total price of
         the transactions. Sometimes more than one member in the sample may have the same value.
         The process involves first sorting the comparable values in ascending order after which the ordinal
         ranking (n) for the required percentile P expressed as a proportion between 0 and 1 (i.e., the P for the
         first quartile (Q1) or 25th percentile is 0.25) can then be obtained from the following formulae:
              •	   Inclusive: n 5 P  (N 2 1) 1 1, and
              •	   Exclusive: n 5 P  (N 1 1).
         The value of the comparable corresponding to rank n can then either be read from the sorted list of
         values, or, if not a member of the sample, obtained by linear interpolation between the values of the
         closest two ranks either side of n. Depending on the number of members N and the method used, inter-
         polation may yield quartile values that may not be members of the original ordered list of comparables
         (see Q1 and Q3 in case A in Table c). For instance, given its fractional value of n 5 2.5, the interpolated
         value of Q1 will be the value of rank 2 (i.e., 5.3%) plus 0.5 times the difference between the value of rank
         3 minus that of rank 2 (i.e., 6.2% 2 5.3%), that is to say 5.3% 1 0.45% 5 5.75%.
         If, for any particular reason, one wishes for percentiles to be an actual member of the original ordered
         list then, as shown in Table c, the ordered rank n can be rounded. If the list has less than 100 members
         the values of some close percentiles will be the same.
         Furthermore, as N is uneven the 50th percentile (median) can be obtained directly from the value of
         rank 4 (i.e., 7.1%) in the ordered list. It will be noted that given N 5 7 the ordered rank ns obtained
         for Q1, Q2 and Q3 using the exclusive methodology are full integers (see case B of Table c) and no
         interpolation is in this case necessary. It will be noticed that the exclusive approach provides greater
         weighting for the extreme values of the sample thus broadening the inter-quartile range compared to
         that obtained using the inclusive approach. However, as the number of members (N) increases this dif-
         ference progressively narrows down and at the limit the results of the two methods converge.
         In conclusion a service entailing lower levels of asset utilization and risk-bearing should command a
         profit margin of 5.3% to 5.8%, while one utilizing higher levels and the assumption of higher risk would
         justify a margin of 10.0% to 11.5%, with attribution of profit margins for in-between cases requiring
         detailed individual functional analysis and a degree of case-to-case judgement.
                                                                                               Box continues on next page




    Key considerations from the perspective of the tax administration are whether the terms and condi-
    tions of the service provision are those that would be agreed to by independent parties, whether
    the provision of the services adds value to the subsidiary (i.e., whether benefits associated with the
    charge are not identifiable or the charge is for a duplicated service),72 and whether the transfer price
    charged is on an arm’s length basis.

            In general there should be evidence that the service has actually been provided, though in some
            cases a charge might be made for an ‘on call service’73 such as a retainer fee for a firm of lawyers,
            or for the use of a backup computer facility. In such circumstances the tax administration should
            ascertain whether the likelihood of calling on the service was too remote to warrant a fee being

    charged to the subsidiary. This might be checked by examining the frequency of use of the on call
    service over a period of time (e.g., over several years).74

    Where a direct charge (actual use) mechanism has been used in the allocation of corporate service
    fees the tax administration should ascertain and check the approach used, such as timesheets and
    internal invoicing, without overinvesting in such verification activity. Limited random samples are
    usually all that is required to verify the rigor of the direct charge control mechanism.

    Where an indirect charging mechanism is used, such as a cost allocation or apportionment method,
    the tax administration should ensure that the allocation key gives sufficient regard to the value
    of the service received (i.e., it makes sense) and the extent to which a comparable service would
    have been provided to and paid for by an independent enterprise.75 For example, merely allocating
    part of head office costs across to a mining subsidiary of the MNE on the basis of turnover would
    generally provide an insufficient nexus to an identifiable and reasonably foreseeable benefit in the
    subsidiary. However, allocating a portion of overall HR costs to a mining subsidiary on the basis
    of staff numbers or salary costs is probably an acceptable allocation key, provided the HR services
    being charged for are not duplicated in the subsidiary.

    Having identified and verified the charging mechanism for the various corporate services (the
    volume aspect), the tax administration then needs to verify that the prices charged are comparable
    with those that an independent provider would have charged (the price aspect).

    For routine corporate services the most appropriate transfer pricing method is likely to be cost-plus
    (e.g., cost plus a small margin of say 5% is not uncommon). However, the cost aspect should not be
    blindly accepted by a tax administration as, given a choice, the recipient of the service would not
    pay more for an internal service than it could pay for the same service in the open market. In such
    circumstances a CUP may be the most appropriate method of pricing the service, although, except
    for daily rates for similar professional services, the use of a CUP in the provision of inter-company
    services is not frequently observed in practice.

    If the MNE is using an alleged CUP that in effect generates a very high cost-plus outcome, the CUP
    is unlikely to have been the most appropriate transfer pricing method. Routine functions expect
    routine rates of return and should not be a significant profit centre for the MNE.

    It is on this basis that the OECD’s Actions 8–10—2015 Final Report recommends applying such 5%
    margin as a simplified measure for a wide category of non-core, intra-group services that command
    very limited profit markups. This provides a more consistent treatment for all taxpayers operating
    under similar circumstances, and reducing the need for resource-intensive in-depth audits, while
    limiting the risk of overcharging. Another example, is the US IRS section 482 regulations which
    use a similar approach in the so-called ‘Services Cost Method’ for low margin (less than 7%) ser-
    vices. Some countries, however, have indicated reluctance to adopt the simplified approach on the
    grounds that head office and management services can still constitute a potentially major source
    of profit shifting. In such instances the simplified approach could be applied in combination with
    appropriately set thresholds.

    For uncommon services involving a higher degree of expertise, the likelihood of identifying a CUP
    is more difficult, and the cost plus margin is likely to be somewhat greater. These services would
    often be more in the nature of technical or financial services that are discussed in the following
    sections.

54	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            In the African context, instances have been observed where the MNE’s head office and/or sub-
            sidiaries providing corporate services have been charging for them on the basis of a percentage of
            sales. This approach, which is equivalent to a mineral royalty, bears no relationship to the cost and/
            or value of the services provided and should not be accepted by the tax authority.

            If the service being charged for is in the nature of a contribution to the MNE’s R&D efforts, par-
            ticular care is needed by the tax administration. Court cases have established that mutual R&D
            funds may lack sufficient connection between the expense and the earning of income by the mining
            subsidiary. The allocation approach to R&D expenditure can therefore lack sufficient nexus to the
            provision of a reasonably identifiable benefit that an independent party would have been prepared
            to pay for. Where an R&D charge has been made, one would not expect to subsequently have to
            pay a royalty for use of the IP that may have been developed by that R&D program.

            4.2.4  Engineering, science and technical hub

            To achieve effective critical mass and operational efficiency, MNEs often consolidate most of their
            nonroutine and high value-adding specialized engineering, scientific, technical and R&D capabili-
            ties, as well as related intangibles assets, into one or more subsidiaries. In the case of R&D sub-
            sidiaries, they are generally located in countries where there is good research infrastructure, and
            where it is easier to attract and retain the required specialized technical skills. Not surprisingly, the
            decision as to where to locate some of these subsidiaries, constituting the Engineering, Science
            and Technical (EST) Hubs of the MNE, is also heavily influenced by fiscal considerations.

            Cost contribution arrangements are commonly entered into by parties involved in the joint devel-
            opment, production or obtaining of assets (both tangible and intangible) or services which are
            expected to create benefits for each of the parties. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines have
            recently been updated (Chapter VIII) as part of the BEPS Actions 8–10 for such arrangements76 to
            ensure that contributions to and the benefits that flow from such arrangements are valued on an
            arm’s length basis and the profits are not shifted away from the location where the value is created
            through economic activities performed. Cost contribution arrangements are more likely to occur in
            African mining countries with a long history of mining development (such as South Africa) rather
            than those at early stages of development. Where contribution has been made to the development
            of, for example, specialized mining know-how or IP, the arm’s length principle for such arrange-
            ments means that each participant would be entitled to receive benefits resulting from the activities
            of the arrangement without further cost, which are proportionate to their contribution. It would
            not be expected that arm’s length parties would agree to pay additional consideration in these
            circumstances.

    While the structure in Figure A.13 shows patents and other IP being held and managed in the EST
    hub, it would not be uncommon for IP associated with all functions to be held and managed from
    a separate hub within the MNE group. A separate IP hub may hold IP for the whole MNE or parts
    thereof (i.e., on a regional basis), and is likely to be located itself in a low tax jurisdiction with treaty
    benefits. In such circumstances, the EST hub may obtain certain (possibly limited) rights to use
    patents and other IP from the separate IP hub, which it may in turn embed into the cost of services
    provided to the Mining Co., or it may on-license the IP in its own right for use by the Mining Co.

    Mining companies in Africa are likely to have transactions with their related EST hubs that involve
    the transfer or use of intangibles. The OECD has recently revised its transfer pricing guidelines for
    intangibles (Chapter VI)77 ensuring that profits associated with the transfer and use of intangibles
    are appropriately allocated in accordance with value creation. Particularly relevant to the mining
    sector, are these guidelines:

          ■■   Provide a definition of intangibles for transfer pricing purposes—something that is capa-
               ble of being owned or controlled for use in commercial activities (but not a physical asset
               or a financial asset) where an independent party would compensate for its use or transfer
               if the transaction had occurred in comparable circumstances. This definition is not focused
               just on legal or accounting definitions.
          ■■   Do not allocate returns to the entity (which may include an EST hub) which merely owns
               the intangible asset; rather those returns are allocated to the MNE group entities (which
               may include the mining company in Africa) which perform important functions, control
               economically significant risks and contribute assets, as determined through the accurate
               delineation of the actual transaction.
          ■■   Permit the use of valuation techniques to estimate an arm’s length price when reliable
               comparable uncontrolled transactions cannot be identified, for example, the proper appli-
               cation of income based valuation techniques, especially those premised on calculation of
               discounted value of projected future income streams or cash flows derived from exploita-
               tion of the intangible.
          ■■   Permit tax administrations, in certain circumstances, to use ex poste outcomes as pre-
               sumptive evidence about the ex ante pricing arrangements for hard-to-value intangibles.

                      Hard-to-value-intangibles are those which, at the time of their transfer between related
                      parties, are difficult to predict as ultimate success as their future predictions as to income
                      and assumptions are highly uncertain. Furthermore no reliable comparables exist for hard-
                      to-value intangibles.

            Establishing a new mining operation requires significant up-front capital investment in design-
            ing the mine, procuring all the necessary supplies, plant and equipment, and finally managing its
            development and construction. Project owners generally contract out these activities by means of
            two distinct and very different (in spite of their similarity of names) types of arrangements:

                 ■■   Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts, and
                 ■■   Engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM) contracts.

            Under an EPC contract, the contractor must deliver a complete facility conforming to agreed design
            and performance specifications by a set date and for a guaranteed price (‘turn-key’ contract). There
            is generally very limited scope in these contracts to claim for extensions of time and/or additional
            costs. To be fully accountable, the EPC contractor must have extensive discretion in terms of techni-
            cal mine design, processing plant flow sheets and procurement choices relating to development/
            construction activities covered by the EPC contract. They must also be the principal and have full
            control for all related subcontracts. An EPC contractor generally brings to the project significant
            levels of, often proprietary, technical know-how and project management expertise. As a result,
            the contractor typically bears all risks, both technical in terms of mine design and processing plant
            flow sheets and financial in terms of choice and management of subcontractors that may result in
            cost and timing over-runs.78

            In essence, an EPC contract is most suitable for well-defined projects after detailed engineering
            design has been completed, which allows for the owner to take a ‘hands-off’ approach to its devel-
            opment. EPC offers the owners a single point of contact and responsibility for project performance,
            which minimizes staff requirements, liabilities and technological risk as the project output is guar-
            anteed by the contractor, who must fix any problem that may arise and be liable for any related
            blowout in costs. It, however, limits the owner’s ability to impose changes and intervene when
            problems occur during construction, raising the potential for contractual disputes.

            An EPCM contractor, by contrast, will generally enjoy a modest degree of independence in terms
            of making technical design and procurement decisions, which will be primarily influenced by the
            project owner, who will bear the risk of budgeted cost and time overruns. In most cases suppliers
            of goods and services to the project, while managed by the EPCM contractor, are in fact contracted
            directly to the project owners. EPCM contracts, however, may include ‘incentives’ in the form of
            bonus payments and penalties to encourage the contractor to achieve project targets by exercising
            a strict cost-control and management strategy on budgeted costs and schedules. Also, incentives
            will often be included for the completion of the project in a safe and healthy manner. Bonuses and
            liabilities are generally limited to a maximum of 10% to 20% of the profit margin, negotiated as part
            of the remuneration. Uncapped liabilities of course apply in the case of fraud, death and personal
            injury, consequential losses, etc., which are generally covered by professional indemnity insurance.

            Thus, EPCM suits less defined projects where the owner wishes to maintain more flexibility and
            control over potential changes in the scope of the project and its financing options. By bearing the
            risks of the project the owner can lower its overall cost and reduce the incidence of legal disputes
            by identifying and remedying emerging issues before they grow into serious problems. EPCM is in
            essence a mechanism to contract for specialized professional services. The key characteristics and

    differences between EPC and EPCM contracts have been clearly detailed in Appendix A.5, which
    is reproduced from Plexus Infratech (2015).79

    From a taxation point of view, the cost of EPC and EPCM contracts is part of the capital cost of cre-
    ating the mining asset. As such, it is capitalized in the owner’s balance sheet and depreciated over
    time at the capital recovery rate prescribed by the applicable tax legislation. It is also important to
    note that, contrary to the services provided by some of the other hubs (e.g., finance, insurance, etc.)
    that can be delivered remotely, a significant proportion of EPC and EPCM services may require the
    continuous or recurrent presence of the contractor in the country hosting the mining project.

    As already mentioned, the pre-production period of mine development and construction may
    last a number of years, during which time the needed supervision and management may be pro-
    vided by related foreign parties. The EPC contractor’s activities in the country are likely to last in
    excess of 6 to 12 months, which exceeds the limit beyond which, in the presence of a DTA, the UN
    and OECD conventions would expect the EPC contractor to operate through a Permanent Estab-
    lishment80 (PE, i.e., a branch), thus creating a taxable presence in the country even in the absence of
    a fixed address. Such a PE would be taxed in the host country on the profits attributable to it and to
    impose withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties remitted to nonresidents. The country
    of residence of the foreign hub subsidiary providing the services may in turn provide, to avoid
    double taxation, foreign tax exemptions and/or credits in computing their tax liability.

    Where the hub subsidiary is located in a low-tax jurisdiction it may seek to avoid higher tax rates in
    the host country by organizing its affairs in such a manner as to prevent the creation of a PE. In the
    inevitable case where a PE is created, the MNE may seek to minimize the amount of income attrib-
    utable to the PE, which would be taxed in the host country. Often the approach taken to reduce the
    incidence of taxation in the host country, and the risk of double taxation, is to break the overall task
    into a number of short-term components for which individual subcontracts may be drafted abroad
    with foreign suppliers. Some of these subcontractors may be different members of the same MNE
    controlling the EPC contractor. BEPs Final Reports Action 7 provides a revision of the standard PE
    definition as well as adoption of an anti-fragmentation rule, and further work on the attribution of
    profits to PEs is still to be done.

    An alternative, commonly used structure, particularly in the case of EPCM and of on-going special-
    ized Technical and Scientific Services required during the operational life of the mine, is for the
    mining company to secure the services of individual selected members of the Engineering, Science
    and Technical hub on short- to medium-term contracts, that is to say on secondment, as the need
    for various specialized services arises. Depending on the duration and/or frequency of the engage-
    ment, these individual specialists may have a taxable presence in the country and would generally
    be taxed on a proportion of their salary on a time basis.

    The majority of ongoing specialized technical and scientific services are of a recurrent nature. The
    related costs will influence the annual taxable income of the mining company and be reported in its
    profit and loss statement. Given the high value of the services provided and the significant level of
    risk borne, the fees relating to EPC contracts may include significant compensation for proprietary
    know-how and contingencies to ward against unforeseeable events. As a consequence, the fees are
    generally much higher than those of other contractual arrangements, e.g., EPCM. However, this
    may not be relevant in the context of a MNE, as shifting of risk from the mining subsidiary to an
    internal EPC contractor would not reduce the total risk at the consolidated level.

      The term ‘permanent establishment’ (PE) is a fixed place of business of a nonresident which generally gives rise to
    an obligation to pay taxes in a particular jurisdiction. The term is used in the domestic tax laws of countries as well
    as in tax treaties. It comprises both geographic presence (places of business) and temporal presence for a specified
    time, for example, in excess of 183 days. PEs are often also called ‘branches.’
58	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            The charge for an EPCM contract is generally structured on a cost-plus basis that may range widely
            as a percentage of the total capital cost of the project; i.e., from around 5% up to 20%81 depending
            on the extent of the services provided and the general demand for them in the market at the time.
            An EPCM contract will generally specify:

                 ■■   Hourly or daily rates for the provision of the professional services of various members
                      of the project team having various levels of seniority for the various components of the
                      project,
                 ■■   Overheads as a fixed percentage of the hourly or daily rates, and
                 ■■   A generally fixed amount representing the contractor’s profit margin.

            There is a wealth of information about how to set engineering consulting fees and charges, includ-
            ing the guidelines issued by the Consultants Society of the Australasian Institute of Mining and
            Metallurgy (AusIMM)82 and various other professional engineering groups.

            While in the final analysis the hourly or daily charge rate will depend on what the market will bear,
            in practice it is generally derived by first calculating the hours actually available in a year after
            deducting annual and other leaves, public holidays, staff development time, etc. Then on-costs,
            including payroll tax, workers compensation insurance, other insurances, office rent, and office
            expenses and so on, are applied to the salary of individual consultants. Finally, the desired profit
            margin is added. As outlined by the AusIMM above, in general this markup will be proportionately
            higher for shorter assignments. A simplified example of such a calculation is provided in Box A.7.

            By contrast, given the turnkey nature of most EPC contracts, estimates of manpower needs, in
            terms of person-days, would include a contingency element that is generally restricted to the con-
            tractor’s fee-setting process and not necessarily divulged in detail to the project owners. Also, an
            EPC contract involving innovative processes would generally result in an additional risk premium,
            frequently of the order of 5% being applied, which makes most EPC contracts worth 10% to 20% of
            the overall capital cost of a project, with the higher fees in this range generally applying to under-
            ground rather than open cut operations.

            Assessing an appropriate value for the provision of specialized intangibles, such as Patented
            Assets and other proprietary IP, including exploration, mining and metallurgical methods and
            processes, software applications, etc., that are held by the Engineering, Science and Technical Hub
            is much more complex. As already discussed in Section 3.2 (adapted from Huibregtse (2013), albeit
            with some practical differences in weighting between the OECD and the UN approach) there are
            three different categories of assets and market features, i.e.:

                 ■■   Tangible assets (Category A), e.g., the mine, related buildings, plant and equipment and
                      infrastructure,
                 ■■   Intangible assets (Category B), e.g., exploration, mining and other rights, patents and IP
                      relating to unique and specialized knowhow, proprietary mining and metallurgical meth-
                      ods and processes, information systems, databases, software, etc., and
                 ■■   Location-specific advantages (LSAs), that is to say specific market features (Category C),
                      which in the case of mineral-rich developing countries would include ready access to min-
                      eral resources and lower regulatory and environmental hurdles to mine development and
                      exploitation, and other “synergies” such as availability of a comparatively cheaper yet
                      competent workforce, etc.

            These are relevant to an MNE allocating its profits amongst its entities which are parties to related-
            party transactions. Application of the arm’s length principle recognises the functions performed,

               These percentages are an approximate range that have been drawn from the commodity by commodity analysis
            undertaken in Part B of this Guidebook, and are in agreement with figures in Plexus Infratech (2015).

    the assets utilised and the risks borne. Depending upon commodity pricing in the mining sec-

    intangibles).

    The differences between the asset base compositions of the parties is relevant to what degree their
    respective functions are routine or unique, as well as their respective bargaining powers in deter-
    mining profit markups. Due to confidentiality on the grounds of protecting IP and competitive-
    ness, factual information about comparable market-based transactions is very scarce and often
    unreliable, with relevant transactional databases limited in coverage and extremely expensive to
    acquire. As a consequence, valuation of intangibles represents a major auditing hurdle and is the
    area where there is the largest degree of opacity and opportunity for overcharging with a degree
    of impunity. The revised OECD TP guidelines and their application to intangibles will go some
    way in assisting tax administrations to deal with transfer pricing in this area. In particular, further

    Captive insurance historically started in the mining industry to manage the high level of risks
    inherent in that sector, as independent insurers were sometimes reluctant to provide an appropri-
    ate insurance service given the risky character of the sector at the time. Internal or captive insurance
    services can provide legitimate and significant financial benefits to a MNE as a whole, particularly
    where they are used to ensure routine matters (i.e., higher likelihood, low financial consequence
    events that do not require significant capital reserves to be set aside). A good example of the com-
    mercial purpose of captive insurance companies is it provides the group with access to the reinsur-
    ance market where the premiums are generally lower than the equivalent insurance premiums.

    Some transfer pricing consultants recommend to their clients transfer prices relating to insurance
    services based on a three-tiered responsibility classification of captive insurers, which relies on
    three criteria, i.e., degree of diversification, decision power and the adequacy of capital to cover the
    insured risk (Figure A.16, TPA, 2012). The degree of responsibility, i.e., whether a cost or a profit
    centre, determines whether a cost plus or a CUP based on applicable insurance premiums should
    be used as the appropriate transfer price. In effect, the third criterion, that is to say the actuarial
    ability to realistically deal with an event and provide the compensation insured for, is the dominant
    aspect from a tax administration’s point of view as it is the dominant factor in an insurer (related
    or unrelated) determining whether to accept the risk and the related premium to do so. Valid
    CUPs, however, may not always be readily obtainable in the African context, where in some cases
    the risks are uninsurable and the MNEs will need to wear them. This raises the question whether
    such a controlled transaction would take place at arm’s length making non-recognition by the tax
    administration appropriate.

    While the somewhat mechanistic approach depicted in Figure A.16, which is not formally recog-
    nized in the OECD Guidelines, may help many taxpayers in determining often acceptable transfer
    prices in practice, tax administrations should, in their analysis, still be guided by adherence to the
    arm’s length principle.

62	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            In addition to commercial considerations, there may also be significant tax consequences in the
            setup and use of an insurance hub, as well as the degree to which the related premiums may rep-
            resent legitimate tax deductions. The IMF,84 for instance, refers to the problematic nature of apply-
            ing the arm’s length principle to captive insurance arrangements where the purported transfer or
            re-allocation of risk within the group does not affect the risk borne by the group as a whole. In
            such cases it is argued that there has actually been no transfer of risk. The IMF report points out,
            amongst other things, not only the inherent lack of comparable prices between unrelated parties,
            but the fact that it would be hard for all other group members to step away from the consequences
            of the failure of any affiliate.

            The tax benefits to a MNE from obtaining tax deductions through the use of an insurance hub
            would arise for what in effect would be the deduction of a ‘provision’ for a contingency, keeping in
            mind that tax deductions for provisions are not normally allowed.

            For some risk transfers, the insurance hub may re-insure, sometimes after bundling risks from
            different members of the group to obtain economies of scale, with a third party insurer. The arm’s
            length principle is somewhat more straightforward to apply under these circumstances, poten-
            tially allowing a markup on the cost incurred to reflect what is, in effect, a fee for brokerage ser-
            vices. However, the key used to allocate re-insurance costs that incurred at the corporate level
            among members of the MNE group needs to be carefully considered to ensure that it is appropriate
            and commensurate with the economic benefit actually provided to the mining company.

            It is most important to ensure that the risk that is purported to be insured with an insurance hub
            is ‘insurable’, as there have been rare cases where the ‘risk’ was an artifice not of an insurable
            nature. Tax administrations need to look at the terms and conditions of the insurance contract to
            ensure that the risk to be covered is real and that should it occur, the in-house insurer has adequate
            resources to cover it.

            Unless there are sufficient capital reserves held by the insurer it may well not be in a position where
            it has the capacity or capability to pay, and hence, the transfer of risk that the insurance contract is
            meant to provide may not have in fact taken place. In essence, tax administrations need to ascertain
            the actual facts and circumstances of the arrangement with the insurance hub, making sure that the
            risk is real and that should it occur, the insurer has the resources to pay out. Suggested questions
            to assist with the comparability analysis and application of the arm’s length test are included in the
            audit functional analysis questionnaire (see Appendix A.4).

            Once the facts and circumstances have been established, it is suggested that the tax administra-
            tion also seek advice from an independent insurance agent or broker with experience in the rel-
            evant mining sector to help analyze the responses obtained. Insurers operate on the basis of highly
            sophisticated risk models, and it would be expected that arm’s length prices to a captive or insur-
            ance hub should similarly be based on sophisticated models that operate on both likelihood of an
            event occurring and the consequences should it occur.

            Many of the risks in the mining sector would be predictable over time. One of the issues that may
            arise in relation to some of the risks in mining in African countries relates to lower compensation
            standards, especially for accidents. As a result, a lower premium would be expected than for the
            same risk in a ‘high-cost’ developed country.

            4.2.6  Finance hub

            Among the most common and difficult profit shifting and transfer pricing challenges that tax
            administrations need to consider are the issues that arise from the provision of finance. Mining is

	                                                               Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   63


    a very capital-intensive activity. Where high-risk activities are being undertaken, such as mineral
    exploration, the financial capital is obtained primarily by way of equity and the return to investors
    may be by way of a capital gain should the project be disposed of, or through future dividends if
    exploration leads to a profitable mining operation.

    However, if exploration is successful, significant amounts of up-front capital are required through
    an appropriate mix of equity and debt for the development of the orebody and construction of the
    mine during a period of preproduction that can last from a few to a significant number of years
    while no revenue is generated by the project from which interest expenses could be deducted. This
    issue has been acknowledged by the OECD, which in its recently released Action 4: 2015 Final Report:
    Limiting Base Erosion Involving Interest Deductions and Other Financial Payments85 recommends in
    connection with adoption of the Fixed Ratio Rule that disallowed/unused interest may be carried
    forward. Mining projects also require significant injections of working capital at the initial stages
    when mine production hopefully ramps up to planned capacity, a process that, in many instances,
    is frustrated by teething problems. Significant sums of capital continue to be required during the
    productive life of the mine to maintain operating capacity and to fund possible expansion and/or
    other changes in the design of the mine. This is often referred to as “sustaining capital.”

    While capital may be easily raised by both issuing new equity and/or borrowing at the level of a
    credit-worthy parent MNE, debt funds at the project level may not be easily obtainable from third
    parties in some developing countries, or may entail much higher rates of interest on account of
    higher risk premia. Thus, it is no surprise that many MNEs optimize their overall cost of funding
    for all MNE activities in a globally tax-effective way by carrying out centralized capital raising and
    financial services through an in-house financing arm of the MNE group, a so-called Finance Hub
    (Figure A.17). The financial services provided by a finance hub may include:

            The use of a centralized financing arm by MNEs, however, can give rise to profit shifting and trans-
            fer pricing issues that may be difficult for tax administrations to address in the absence of appropri-
            ate policy and legislative support, which may include interest capping, thin capitalization and/or
            other specific transfer pricing rules. These aspects, which have recently been the focus of renewed
            interest at the OECD,86 will be discussed in more detail below.

            Financial services are an area of relatively high transfer pricing vulnerability because the signifi-
            cant size of financing for a mining business means that even minor mispricing can have a material
            impact on profitability. In addition, complexity may be added through the determination of what
            constitutes debt and equity and the complex treatment of hybrid instruments such as redeemable
            preference shares and convertible notes that can be used to take advantage of tax arbitrage oppor-
            tunities between the tax systems prevailing in different countries. This vulnerability often arises
            because, as long as generous tax systems continue to allow interest on debt to be deductible, there
            will continue to be an incentive for businesses to exploit debt leverage in their capital structure.

            The relative complexity of financial services and its associated risks would normally be associated
            with a higher charge, above the cost incurred for the provision of such services, which makes it
            relatively easy to manipulate the related spread to shift profits. Remuneration for financial ser-
            vices is often built into the effective interest rate charged (the spread) where the volume aspect
            is the amount of the financing (e.g., the loan principal) and the price aspect is often a “reference
            rate.” As an interim measure, a tax administration could consider setting (for example by regula-
            tion) maximum interest rate benchmarks based on observable international rates such as the Lon-
            don Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin appropriate to their country (e.g., LIBOR +200
            basis points or 2%) or, alternatively, allow, as in the case of the West African Iron Ore Project dis-
            cussed in Box B.11, interest rates set in a similar manner by lenders. By contrast, some jurisdictions
            may require that the applicable rate of interest charged to the mining subsidiary in their countries
            should be the average annual rate of interest incurred by the MNE at the consolidated level.

            The determination of an appropriate risk premium to be included in setting the interest rate charged
            to a mining subsidiary in a developing country is indeed a much contested issue. The World Bank
            Group87 provides an up-to-date tabulation of the indicative bank lending interest rates that usually
            meet the short- and medium-term financing needs of the private sector in various countries. The
            rate, of course varies with the economic sector and creditworthiness of the borrower, with mining

               It is interesting to note that no figures are available for many of the African countries, which is probably an indica-
            tion that the relevant financial services are not adequately developed in some of them. This is supported by the per
            capita level of access to a commercial bank branch which in Sub-Saharan Africa is 3 per 100,000 people as compared
            to 38 for Europe. Of the African countries for which rates are quoted some appear very high by developed world
            standards (e.g., 20 to 60%); this may be the result of both prevailing high rates of inflation, country risk premia and
            very high spreads of around 11% between deposit and lending rates.

    widely applied. These include an optional de minimis monetary threshold to filter out low risk enti-
    ties and a ceiling based on a fixed ratio rule, allowing deduction of an entity’s net interest expenses
    up to a benchmark percentage of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
    (EBITDA). This ratio should be set within a corridor of 10% to 30% depending on individual cases.
    Provision is also made for adoption of an optional group ratio rule when this is higher than the
    entity’s fixed ratio, and of applying to it an uplift of up to 10%, should this become necessary to
    avoid potential double taxation. The ratio may also be exceeded when borrowing relates specifi-
    cally to the generation of public benefits.

    As shown in Figure A.18 reproduced from the OECD’s Action 4: 2015 Final Report the fixed ratio
    rule recommendation need not be inconsistent with application of the arm’s length principle and
    does not prevent the concomitant use of other best practice options embodied in individual coun-
    tries’ tax legislation, such as those relating to thin capitalization and specific applicable interest rate
    capping.

    Consistent with the arm’s length test, tax administrations should look more broadly at the mining
    company’s individual circumstances and whether the type and/or level of financing it adopted
    would have been entered into between independent parties dealing at arm’s length. This may
    involve consideration as to whether:

        ■■   The proportion of debt relative to equity in the funding mix is excessive in light of standard
             industry practice and the unique circumstances of the borrowing entity, generally referred
             to as “thin capitalization,” and
        ■■   The applicable rate of interest is appropriate under the circumstances.

    For example, if an entity is carrying a higher level of debt than it would have been capable of rais-
    ing under arm’s length circumstances, the tax administration may be presented with claims for
66	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            higher interest rates that incorporate a premium to compensate for the additional financial risk
            (e.g., credit risk).89 Cases have also been observed where a mining subsidiary was funded on a
            non-arm’s length basis with relatively high debt levels and claimed, in addition to a higher inter-
            est rate, an additional fee for the subsequent provision of a guarantee to cover the loan due to its
            increased riskiness. An example (see Box B.11) is the guarantee provided by the Bermuda based
            head office company HoldCo to secure the $120.3 million equipment finance facility provided by
            the related ChinaCo 1 and the $37.6 million cost overrun finance facility provided by the finance
            hub of HoldCo, to their operating subsidiaries, that is to say to MinCo and Rail/PortCo. Essen-
            tially, under these circumstances, the MNE created the ‘risk’ via its excessive debt financing and
            then sought additional reward for it, where an independent party would not have agreed to fund
            the mine on that basis in the first place as doing so would have rendered it excessively risky and
            potentially unprofitable. As discussed at greater length below, identifying an arm’s length price for
            the loan would, in this situation, first entail re-characterizing part of the loan as equity.

            The power and practice of tax administrations to ignore or reconstruct arrangements that would
            not have been entered into between unrelated parties given the circumstances is one of the most
            contentious issues between tax administrations and businesses in discussion about transfer pric-
            ing. The OECD transfer pricing guidelines recognize two particular circumstances where it would
            be appropriate and legitimate, in exceptional situations, to disregard the structure adopted by a
            taxpayer in entering into a controlled transaction. These circumstances are where the:

                 ■■   Economic substance of a transaction differs from its form and, as a consequence, the
                      transaction may be disregarded and re-characterised in accordance with its substance. An
                      example of this is where related party interest-bearing debt financing would not have been
                      structured in the way it was, having regard to the economic circumstances of the borrow-
                      ing company, as for instance its credit worthiness, resulting in the loan being treated for tax
                      purposes as subscription of equity capital; and
                 ■■   Arrangements viewed in their totality differ from those that would have been adopted by
                      independent parties acting in a commercially rational manner, that is to say where there is
                      no clearly identifiable business purpose and the MNE’s motivation is purely for tax sav-
                      ing. Such a set of circumstances in effect impedes the tax administration from deriving an
                      appropriate transfer price.

            Many arrangements, where the company would not have obtained its financial capital in the same
            way if it were dealing with a third party at arm’s length, may lead to the shifting of profits from
            a mining company in the resource-rich country to a related in-house financier resident in another
            country. Arguably, a mining company acting at arm’s length would be unlikely to enter into a fund-
            ing arrangement with a third party that could be expected to make it unprofitable due to exces-
            sively high debt service costs, particularly if the relevant rate incorporates a high risk premium.

            Particular care is therefore needed by tax administrations in verifying that an independent party
            would have agreed to the terms and conditions. For example, it would be highly unusual for an
            independent party to agree to long-term interest rates higher than those which it could otherwise
            obtain in the market, or those fixed at relatively high rates. Moreover, the debt to equity ratio of an
            independent party would often be significantly lower than that seen for many MNE mining sub-
            sidiaries, particularly in the operating phase.

            Risk hedging via derivatives (e.g., interest rate hedging, exchange rate hedging, etc.) has also
            become a norm over the last decade and this can further complicate a tax administration’s analysis
            of the actual conditions as the counterparties may not be known, and this type of transaction may
            trigger events that may be within the control of the MNE. As with the discussion on insurance,


             These levels of debt will in many cases be accompanied by payments for guarantee fees by the company to a related
            89

            party to protect the loan and interest in this alleged higher risk scenario.

    where the risk has not in fact been transferred out of the MNE, it is problematic as to whether a
    charge for its transfer should stand and be deductible. As with other types of services provided
    by a MNE through a low tax jurisdiction, there is a need to closely examine and verify that the
    arrangements are arm’s length, that is to say that the terms and conditions are such that an inde-
    pendent party would have entered into the arrangement.

    Particular attention should be paid to alleged contractual risk stripping to ensure that the risks were
    ‘real’ in the first place. As with captive insurance arrangements, the risk needs sufficient nexus to
    the mining activities to be a real rather than a theoretical risk. The host country tax administration
    should also verify that the services allegedly provided are for a real activity that is not duplicated.

    Some financial service hubs and/or other related entities can also provide funding linked to the
    supply of significant items of plant and equipment (e.g., trucks, drilling machines, crushing plant,
    rail roads, rolling stock, etc.). This may be either by way of direct loans tied to the supplies or as
    part of a financial lease, both of which can be subject to mispricing. An example of this type of
    arrangement is the $120.3 million equipment finance facility provided by the ChinaCo 1 to MinCo,
    as will be discussed in Box B.11.

    Given the current significant thrust of emerging countries into mineral resources projects in Africa,
    it is not uncommon for the same government-owned corporation to be both a shareholder and a
    lender to a project, as well as the supplier and funder/lessor of plant and equipment that it might
    have manufactured, while also being the buyer and/or marketer of the mineral products. In many
    instances, leasing may continue to be charged by the finance hub at high rates even when assets
    continue to be in use well beyond the point when their value may have been fully written off
    through depreciation.

    Instances have also been observed where the MNE has sought to effectively split assets that are
    actually part of a tightly integrated whole, by assigning part of their value and transferring its own-
    ership to a related party. Courts have found that some of these assets, as for instance open pit mine
    site improvements, exploration and production mining rights, etc., cannot be split.

    MNEs may often seek advice from specialist tax firms as to how to structure their financial needs
    to optimize their business model, including their tax outcomes. Advice provided on these matters
    may appear to offer justification for the MNE in the event that it is subject to a transfer pricing
    audit. However, these justifications usually focus on the price of interest paid for debt financing,
    rather than whether the arrangement would have been entered into at all by a party acting at arm’s
    length.

    4.2.6.1  Thin capitalization as a mechanism for shifting profits

    The choice between equity and debt in setting the financing mix for a mining project is not a
    mechanical one. First, equity is easily available when markets are buoyant, but not necessarily
    when funds are actually needed and may rapidly dry up. The return on equity is highly volatile
    because of fluctuating commodity prices and exchange rates, as well as escalating costs, and expec-
    tations are only realized on average over the long run. The process of raising new equity through
    the stock market is complex and expensive. In addition, the project proponents may not be happy
    to excessively dilute their ownership in the project by excessive reliance on equity, which would
    encourage borrowing instead.

    By contrast, debt financing is cheaper, does not dilute ownership in the project, funds are available
    when actually needed and the relevant interest is by and large tax deductible. However, as the
    amount of debt used increases relative to equity beyond the average level for the mining industry
    sector, it generates additional financial risk for both the equity investors, who bear the ultimate risk
    of the project, and the lenders who, although generally secured, are concerned about the illiquid-
    ity of mining assets in case of liquidation. This anxiety among shareholders and lenders creates
68	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            legitimate expectations for higher return on equity and marginal borrowing rates to compensate
            for the additional risk and militates against increasing and excessive levels of borrowing relative to
            industry standards. This view was re-enforced by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which in a
            recent edition of Mining News90 stated that “In aggregate, the gearing and debt-servicing ratios for
            resource producers remain noticeably lower than those of the broader listed corporate sector.” In
            addition, the RBA pointed out that most of the debt is owed by large companies that have neither
            high gearing nor high debt-servicing ratios; these companies are generally expected to be relatively
            well placed to ride out a period of low commodity prices because they have reasonably strong bal-
            ance sheets, low costs of production, high margins and access to other sources of funding. “None-
            theless, several smaller resource producers (including within the coal and iron ore industries) are
            likely to struggle to cover costs at current prices,” the RBA warned.

            Logic also dictates that, given the generally higher degree of risk in developing countries, the
            debt to equity ratios of mining companies in those locations should be lower than average. How-
            ever, because debt is frequently provided by related finance hubs that use cross-border lending to
            related entities as a tax-effective means of optimizing the cost of capital at the consolidated MNE
            level, this is not often the case, and as a consequence, mining projects in developing countries are
            often “thinly capitalized” and exposed to considerable financial risk. Returning to the example of
            Box B.11, it is worth noting that, while the high level of internal debt made it possible for the project
            to be developed in the first instance, the combination of high interest charges and the recent fall in
            iron ore prices precipitated the mine being put into receivership and subsequently taken over by
            ChinaCo 2, which has recently re-started production in its own right.

            As Table A.5 (CSIMarkets, 2015) indicates, metal mining with a debt:equity ratio of 0.84, that is
            to say with an average debt on total assets of around 45.7%, is a comparatively low user of debt

    finance relative to other sectors of the economy. This is because of the largely illiquid nature of its
    mainly physical and location bound assets, as for instance contrasted with the very liquid assets of
    the financial sector that is reflected in it having the highest debt:equity ratio at 2.67. Similarly, the
    high level of risky R&D undertaken by the health care, energy and technology sectors is the reason
    for them having very low debt:equity ratios.

    The majority of countries have been dealing with the issue of thin capitalisation by determining an
    appropriate level of debt and/or of allowable interest deductions through a range of approaches
    including:

            ■■   Capitalisation rules setting a limit on the ratio of debt to equity;
            ■■   Interest capping rules that limit the amount of interest that can be deducted by an entity for
                 tax purposes in any one year as a proportion of their gross income or EBIT; and/or
            ■■   Group-wide rules that allocate interest expense as a function of the subsidiaries individual
                 contributions to the MNE’s consolidated revenue or earnings.91

    There is a relationship between thin capitalization rules and transfer pricing principles. Thin capi-
    talization rules generally avoid the need for the application of the arm’s length principles on a
    case-by-case basis and act as a safe harbor for debt levels when the given ratio of debt to equity is
    not exceeded. This notwithstanding, some countries, as for instance South Africa, apply the arm’s
    length test, and even in Australia, which has a thin capitalization safe harbor ratio, the arm’s length
    test is applied if the safe harbor ratio is exceeded. The UK is unusual among developed countries
    as it uses the arm’s length test, but does also provide for advance rulings on debt levels. Many
    countries deal with the thin capitalization issue by means of maximum debt:equity ratios. In Africa
    these ratios are generally 2:1 or 3:1, that is to say 66.67% or 75% of total funds respectively, both
    of which are significantly higher than the overall debt:equity ratio of the MNE and industry stan-
    dards for mining. This means that the MNE has essentially created internal debt and allocated it to
    funding of the mining project in the host country. These ratios have historically been set at these rel-
    atively concessionary levels to both encourage investment and for administrative simplicity. Thus,
    under thin capitalization rules a higher level of funding may be treated as debt for tax purposes,
    compared to the level of debt that would customarily be seen in some sectors of the economy, and
    particularly in mining, beyond which the market would adversely impact on the share price of
    high-borrowing enterprises seen as presenting above average financial risk.

    Transfer pricing issues may still arise even where the level of debt falls within the ratios provided
    by thin capitalization rules. Table A.6 shows how an independent mining company borrowing from
    an unrelated bank may be limited by market constraints to fund only 40% of its capital require-
    ments of $100 million by means of a loan at a rate of interest of say 5% per annum. Assuming
    annual revenue of $15 million and costs of $5 million, the mining company would pay $2 million in
    corporate income tax in a jurisdiction with a tax rate of 25%, irrespective of whether the jurisdiction
    allowed for 3:1 capitalization.

    By contrast, Figure A.19 shows how the amount of tax payable is reduced to $1.31 million by the
    mining company borrowing 40% of the funds from an unrelated bank, but secured by the MNE’s
    head office involving a $1 million guarantee fee, and 35% of the funds from a related finance hub.

    Figure A.20 portrays the situation where the related finance hub borrows 40% of the funds from an
    unrelated bank and 35% from the MNE’s head office and on-lends 75% of the funds to the mining
    company, reducing the tax payable to $1.56 million. It will be noted that under this financing struc-
    ture the MNE’s retained earnings are higher than in the case portrayed in Figure A.19 (i.e., $4.69M
    versus $3.94M) even though the total tax paid at the consolidated level is higher (i.e., $1.56M ver-
    sus $1.31M). In both cases profit has been shifted from the host country through interest deductions

               on the additional 35% of total funds borrowed from the finance hub, which would not have been
               available from unrelated lenders.

               Although an interest rate of 5% has been assumed in all three of the above examples, arguments
               may be presented in support of the hub demanding a higher rate of interest on the $75 million on-
               lent to the mining company on account of additional risk.

               An example of the interplay between thin capitalization rules and the re-characterization of a bor-
               rowing transaction under the transfer pricing rules is illustrated in Box A.8 by the position in Aus-
               tralia where (see Example 1 in ATO Taxation Ruling TR2014/6)92 the interest rate is worked out on
               the basis that arm’s length conditions operated and that an arm’s length rate is then applied to the
               debt principal actually issued by the entity (and permitted under thin capitalization provisions),
               instead of the debt interest that would have been issued had the arm’s length conditions operated
               in the context of determining an appropriate level of debt principal.

               Many tax administrations in developing countries contend that, irrespective of how appropriately
               the risk-adjusted interest rates may have been determined using a theoretical basis for various
               jurisdictions in which an MNE is conducting its business, the cumulative interest expense deduc-
               tions for all of a MNE’s subsidiaries should not aggregate to a figure higher than the total net bor-
               rowing cost incurred by the MNE at the consolidated level. If this position is to be enforced, there
               is a need to legislate to either:

                      ■■   Only allow interest expense deductions based on the same interest rate as that paid by the
                           holding MNE on external corporate borrowing at the consolidated level; or
                      ■■   Cap the interest deductions in the jurisdiction to a set percentage (say 30%) of the subsid-
                           iary’s EBIT; or

                Box A.8: Transfer pricing adjustment and thin capitalization (based on Example 1,
                paras 69–76, ATO Taxation Ruling 2014/6)

                      •	   Africa Co. is a resident of an African country and a subsidiary of For Co., the parent company
                           which is resident in another country.
                      •	   The African country has thin capitalization provisions with a debt to equity ratio of 3:1.
                      •	   Africa Co. borrows $300M from For Co. at 15% interest per annum.
                      •	   For thin capitalization purposes, Africa Co. has a safe harbor debt amount of $300M (and
                           equity of $100M).
                      •	   This means Africa Co. has claimed $45M in debt deductions for the year.
                      •	   Borrowings from independent parties at 10% per annum is possible in the African country
                           which may be used as a comparable.
                      •	   In addition, analysis of market reference rates for borrowing of that size and of the credit stand-
                           ing that the capital markets would give Africa Co. may indicate that a maximum $250M loan
                           (not $300M) could realistically be provided by independent lenders under the circumstances.
                      •	   The analysis might show that the loan from For Co. might not reasonably be expected to
                           occur between independent parties dealing at arm’s length because it would not make com-
                           mercial sense for Africa Co. (and For Co.), for example, because of the impacts on Africa Co.
                           from the relatively high cost of the loan on the profitability, viability or competitiveness of its
                           business. Clearly, there is no rationale whereby Africa Co. would have entered into similar
                           arrangements if it were dealing with an unrelated party.
                      •	   As pointed out above, available information supports a conclusion that the closest arm’s
                           length scenario at which a loan might reasonably be expected to exist between independent
                           parties dealing at arm’s length, is a loan of $250M at 10% providing a further $50M of equity
                           were to be raised.
                      •	   On this basis, if there was no ‘safe harbor debt amount’ under thin capitalization provisions,
                           an interest deduction of $25M (i.e., 10% interest on an amount of debt of $250M) would be
                           allowed applying the arm’s length principles. If on the other hand there were a 3:1 safe harbor
                           debt amount, then in combination with the arm’s length principle an interest deduction of
                           $30M could have been claimed, as the thin capitalization provisions would operate to protect
                           the arm’s length interest on the $50M of debt that in their absence would have been reclas-
                           sified as equity.



                 ■■    In line with the BEPS Action IV 2015 recommendations, as already discussed, capping the
                       allowable interest expense deductions of a subsidiary to a predetermined 10% to 30% of its
                       fixed net interest/EBITDA ratio or to the corresponding consolidated MNE’s group ratio
                       if higher.

            The first two approaches are already in current use by some African administrations. The third has
            been proposed by the OECD in the previously quoted discussion paper relating to BEPS Action IV,
            which is currently the subject of significant concern on the side of the tax accounting fraternity,
            because such an approach would depart from strict application of the arm’s length principle and
            may create the risk of double taxation.

            Another example of particular interest is the case where a subsidiary borrows money from and
            pays interest to a cash-rich related party (Annex 3, Example 7, para 254) that has not borrowed
            from or incurred any interest expenses relating to an external source. A strict adherence to the
            principle that the cumulative interest deductions from all subsidiaries should not exceed the con-
            solidated interest expenses of the holding MNE would lead to the above interest expenses being
            disallowed as a deduction. Some argue that this would appear unfair, as the lending entity would

    incur an opportunity cost for which it would not be compensated. On the other hand, it may be
    argued that the ‘loan’ does not increase indebtedness at the consolidated level and is in fact a form
    of equity contribution rendering the ‘interest’ paid a form of dividend, and therefore, not deduct-
    ible for the purpose of assessing taxable income.

    As already mentioned, the international consensus achieved among the OECD signatories on how
    to best resolve these type of issues is embodied in the OECD’s Action 4: 2015 Final Report. It is
    expected that with time the proposed best practice will be also be progressively adopted by non-
    OECD, developing African countries.



      Chapter 4 Key Take-Away Points

           •	   In the context of mining tax, authorities should focus primarily on revenue risks residing in
                the provision of marketing, corporate support, engineering/science/ technical, insurance and
                financial services.
           •	   Tax authorities must make sure that the goods and services being claimed to be provided by
                related entities have actually been provided, and that no over-servicing has taken place.
           •	   It must also ensure that adequate physical controls are in place in terms of volumes and qual-
                ity of exports. This may imply close cooperation with the agencies responsible for customs
                and mines.
           •	   Should be able to clearly differentiate between routine and unique services, and in the latter,
                make sure that the appropriate transfer pricing methods have been used by the MNE, which
                do not over-value the possible use of intangibles (e.g., percentage markups versus cost plus).
           •	   Identify the intangibles and be weary of “soft IP” and/or of IP that has been created through
                R&D charges, which had previously been allocated to the mining subsidiaries.
           •	   An effort should be made to have LSAs (particularly the value of the ready access to mineral
                resources) taken into consideration when negotiating the split of nonroutine inputs into a
                related party transaction.
           •	   Become aware that concessionary thin capitalization rules may represent an incentive for
                MNEs to fund their mining operations to the maximum allowable level of debt, which may be
                in excess of that which is customarily used within the mining sector. This, in combination with
                the application of risk premiums and guarantee fees set at above arm’s length levels, may
                result in financing-related deductions by the mining company that grossly exceed the cost of
                capital incurred at the MNE consolidated level for similar levels of borrowing.
           •	   In general terms tax authorities must make sure that, consistent with the arm’s length prin-
                ciple, related party transactions have been entered into under the same terms and conditions
                that would have applied to an unrelated party in the absence of the MNE’s influence and/
                or compulsion. In exceptional circumstances where this can be proven not to be the case,
                                                                                                   adversarial
                authorities could endeavour to recharacterize the transaction, ideally through non-­
                means.
           •	   Notwithstanding the challenge and frustration in obtaining relevant auditing information from
                some mining companies tax authorities should try to avoid, as far as possible, embarking
                into acrimonious audits and disputes which typically do not lead to a level of restoration of
                revenues that justifies the time and resources invested.

    Attracting Investment in Mineral Exploration and Mining through Specific
5.1 
    Fiscal Incentives
          Most fiscal regimes, in an endeavor to attract globally mobile capital to mineral exploration and
          mine development in their countries, recognize, by way of industry-specific provisions and incen-
          tives, the unique characteristics of the mining industry. Provisions particularly favorable to the
          mining industry are often embedded in the CIT system or into mining contracts, often at times of
          low commodity prices, when the bargaining power of government is also low. For this reason, or
          because some governments did not fully appreciate, at the time of negotiation, the potential long-
          term revenue and administrative consequences of providing various types of incentives, the contri-
          bution made by mining to the socioeconomic development of some countries does not always live
          up to expectations. Fiscal incentives commonly include:

              ■■   Waving and/or reduction/deferral of mineral royalties over a specified period of time;
              ■■   Tax holidays, which specify a period during which a company will not pay any CIT, thus
                   fully capturing all profits in early years of the project, constructed either:
                   •	 On a time basis (e.g., covering the first five years of production). If the tax holiday is
                        unconstrained, the amount of tax relief can be increased by the company through an
                        increase in the rate of extraction or by high-grading, effectively reducing the residual
                        mine life and its profitability. This strategy leaves behind lower tonnages of less valu-
                        able material to be extracted, reducing potential revenue during the period when taxa-
                        tion applies, or
                   •	 On a quantity extracted basis (e.g., covering a specific tonnage of ore or metal as
                        identified in the feasibility study). If the tax holiday is tonnage based, then the taxing
                        authority should satisfy itself that there is no high-grading, but that the grades mined
                        match within reason those submitted in the feasibility study at the time the project
                        received mining approval;
              ■■   Special capital allowances such as:
                   •	 Immediate write-off of capital expenses,
                   •	 Accelerated depreciation for mining-specific capital expenses;
              ■■   Depletion allowance;
              ■■   Exemption from custom duty and VAT for mining equipment; and
              ■■   Negotiated reductions in withholding tax.

          While tax incentives may be considered necessary to stimulate investment in the mining sector
          and related supporting, often multi-user, infrastructure, the decision to grant them should be made
          with full knowledge of the trade-offs involved, such as their impact on much needed revenue

          collection and opportunities for tax avoidance. In general terms, from the point of view of tax
          administrations, any form of tax holiday and depletion allowance should be avoided, if at all pos-
          sible, because ambiguous and hard to administer and, therefore, potentially open to abuse.

          In addition, the mining industry often demands, as a prerequisite to investing, that the negotiated
          fiscal incentives be locked into long-lasting so-called ‘stability agreements’. In some cases, these
          are ratified by parliament, which in effect turns them into laws. This further restricts government
          from introducing any future changes to the fiscal conditions, other than by reaching mutual agree-
          ment with the mining company.

          In the past, some agreements were drafted to cover the life of the mine. More recently, the tendency
          has been to limit the first term to 10–15 years, with a possible extension subject to renegotiation.
          This is a good practice because of the inherent incapacity of both government and industry to think
          realistically into the future, which, in mining, invariably proves highly uncertain. Recent improve-
          ments have seen the introduction of triggers for renegotiation in the event of certain key param-
          eters, for example commodity prices exceeding preset ranges. The presence of stability agreements
          also means that, as the fiscal conditions evolve over time, the tax administration must deal with the
          added complexity of a multiplicity of different coexisting tax systems.


5.2  Criteria for Corporate Structuring and Location of Service Hubs
          Mining value chain functions undertaken in the host country may, from time-to-time, be the sub-
          ject of corporate restructuring for business and/or tax purposes. This may occur after a MNE goes
          through a global business optimization or other business review process that identifies potential
          synergies and sources of productivity improvements, as well opportunities to reduce the tax paid
          globally by the MNE at the consolidated level.

          Restructuring may occur to achieve effective critical mass and operational efficiency by consolidat-
          ing most of a MNE’s specialized intangible assets and nonroutine, value-adding capabilities into
          hubs of one or a few subsidiaries generally located in countries with favorable business conditions
          where for instance:

              ■■   In the case of their specialized engineering, scientific and technical and R&D activities
                   there is good research infrastructure (e.g., universities, research centres, etc.) and a pool
                   from which the required specialized skills may be readily drawn; and
              ■■   In the case of marketing locating in an established trading centre, ideally closer to the main
                   customers, shipping/warehousing facilities, etc.

          In most cases a location is also chosen where it is easier to attract and retain the specialized techni-
          cal and marketing skills required to perform these high-value functions. Establishment of these
          types of hubs involves the physical relocation of key employees and the establishment of adequate,
          relevant technical and/or administrative facilities. Where this is the case, it is generally clear that
          there is ‘economic substance’ in the arrangements, which is to say that the goods and services pro-
          vided by the hubs actually add value. The issue then is merely to ascertain whether the transfer
          prices adopted are at arm’s length.

          In some cases, however, the MNEs’ subsidiaries perform the function of a holding or conduit com-
          pany, often employing very limited or even no resident staff at all. The question of establishing
          whether these types of entities have actual economic substance and the degree to which they add
          value may become difficult to resolve. Various criteria to address these issues have been considered
          by individual tax administrations in isolation when dealing with individual taxpayers, but to date
          no international general principles and/or criteria have been established.
76	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            Although the majority of (but not all) MNEs tend to argue that business considerations prevail in
            the decision as to where to locate some of these key service hub subsidiaries, it would be naïve to
            believe that the decision is not also influenced by fiscal considerations, that is to say exploiting tax-
            minimization opportunities, which can arise in a range of ways, including:

                 ■■   Tax arbitrage, i.e., exploiting differences in tax rates between jurisdictions, which for
                      instance could be broadly grouped as:
                      •	 More than 35%—USA, Japan, etc.,
                      •	 Between 35% and 25%—Australia, South Africa, France, etc.,
                      •	 Between 25% and 10%—Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, Hong
                          Kong, etc.,
                      •	 Less than 10%—United Arab Emirates, Cayman Islands, Bahamas, etc.;
                 ■■   Governments’ willingness to negotiate specific concessions, as for instance in the case of
                      the Netherlands, Singapore and Luxembourg;
                 ■■   Availability of losses to offset the profits;
                 ■■   DTA networks spanning the jurisdictions used by the MNE, particularly where these
                      reduce the rates of withholding taxes on:
                      •	 dividends remitted from profits derived from the mining operations to foreign owners
                          of shares in the mining company,
                      •	 interest on foreign-sourced loans,
                      •	 royalties and license fees for the use of intangibles and IP, and
                      •	 payments for specialized technical services provided by resident and nonresident
                          expatriates, etc.;
                 ■■   Territorial tax systems rather than worldwide tax systems; and/or
                 ■■   Effective controlled foreign corporation (CFC) provisions in place.

            These considerations lead some MNEs to design their corporate structure primarily to minimize
            taxes at the consolidated level by exploiting some of the above fiscal benefits and potential legisla-
            tive loopholes resulting in artificial corporate structures. An example of a fiscally effective choice of
            location for conduit companies is provided by the corporate structure presented in Box A.9.

            While the corporate structure of the Australian MNE was relatively simple, some may become very
            complex and multi-layered. An example is provided in Box A.10 portraying the ownership and
            corporate structure of a large African iron ore producer, servicing export markets in both Europe
            and Asia. The corporate structure of this MNE combines the advantages of proximity to customers
            with the tax benefits of special tax deals in two countries, one European and one Asian, which have
            no CFC rules, and provides withholding tax exemption for outbound dividends to head offices of
            companies in countries with which they have signed a DTA.

            While strictly speaking legally, such constructs are considered by some as ethically flawed, as in
            some instances they significantly reduce tax revenue from countries that would really need it, and
            which are not adequately equipped to monitor and control their fiscal affairs to the advantage of
            taxpayers with strong legal and accounting capabilities, as well as generally a high capacity to pay.

            An extreme example of an artificial tax-effect scheme, albeit not easily adaptable to the mining
            context, is the so-called double Irish-Dutch sandwich illustrated in Box A.11.
	                                                                            Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   77



    Box A.9: Example of tax-minimizing corporate structure commonly used in mining

    As displayed in Figure b mining MNE headquartered in Australia (HeadCo) owns (asides from limited Government
    equity) and operates mines in two different African countries (MinCo A and MinCo B) through two separate holding
    conduit companies registered in a European country (HoldCo European country) and in an African island country
    (HoldCo African island). Financing services to the mining companies are also provided through these jurisdictions. As
    neither of these holding companies has any permanent staff in their respective countries of residence, a question of
    form versus economic substance arises, and one may be justified in assuming that holding companies registered in
    two separate countries are used by the same MNE for the two separate projects because:
        •	   African country A has a bilateral DTA with the European country and African country B with an African
             island country, which have the effect of reducing/eliminating withholding tax payable, and
        •	   Both the European country and the African island country are low tax jurisdictions, with treaties with
             Australia.
    The net result is that HeadCo’s tax liability is largely reduced at the consolidated corporate level.

      Box A.10: Example of a multi-layered tax-efficient corporate structure adopted by a Southern
      African iron ore producer

      HeadCo is a Southern Africa based MNE with significant interests in iron ore mining through majority ownership in
      MinCo. MinCo is one of the top seven iron ore suppliers in the world and exports 80% of its production. Its iron ore
      is in strong demand because of its consistently high grade and quality that makes it ideal for blending with lower
      quality ore at the steel mills. The trading companies (TradeCos 1 and 2), registered as CFCs in a European and Asian
      country respectively (see Figure c),were initially classified as marketing agencies, but later have been reclassified as
      fully fledged distributors on account of title to iron ore shipments being formally transferred to them. This means that a
      greater proportion of profits of profit is realized by them in the low-tax jurisdictions of the European country and Asian
      country even though a relatively low number of employees is based there.

    Box A.11: Double Irish-Dutch sandwich scheme (Source: IMF 2013)

    The objective of a US resident MNE (Head Co.) is to profit from sales in a high-tax country. To do so it sells its product
    through a marketing subsidiary (Sales Distributor Co.) resident in Ireland and provides customer support and market-
    ing through a subsidiary (Support Co.) in the high-tax country on a cost plus basis.
    To minimize capital gain tax in the US, Head Co. transfers patents for the product at the early stages of development
    to a subsidiary (Patents & Conduit Co. 1) registered in the zero-tax jurisdiction of Bermuda.
    A second conduit company to be managed by Patents & Conduit Co. 1 is then registered in Ireland (Conduit Co. 2).
    The US will view the Irish Conduit Co. 2 and the Sales Distributor Co. as a single entity not subject to CFC rules, while
    Ireland would consider Conduit Co. 2 as a Bermuda resident thus levying no taxes on it.
    Money is conveyed from the Sales Distributor Co. to a third Conduit Co. 3 registered in the Netherlands and from this
    back to Conduit Co. 2 in Ireland without paying any withholding taxes under the non-portfolio payments EC rules and
    because of the absence of Dutch withholding taxes.
    As remittance of profits to the Head Co. would trigger US taxation, Patents & Conduit Co. 1 may delay it, sometimes
    indefinitely, thus creating significant amounts of ‘stateless profits’. This structure is illustrated in Figure d.

5.3  Corporate Restructuring Is a Continuous and Dynamic Process
            In reality mining is a very competitive business and companies strive to continuously improve
            their productivity and capture market share by adopting a variety of evolving technical and com-
            mercial/trading strategies. These strategies include driving unit cost of production down by:

                 ■■   Continuous process improvement;
                 ■■   Increasing economies of scale by expanding operations and by growing through organic
                      exploration, joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions;
                 ■■   Gaining early access to innovative technology;
                 ■■   Rationalizing and rebalancing the spread of their investments in terms of commodities
                      sought and geopolitical diversification; and
                 ■■   Adopting innovative funding arrangements.

            To be effective, the majority of these strategies may require frequent and occasionally significant
            changes in the MNEs’ corporate structure, which although not motivated by fiscal considerations,
            may have concomitant tax repercussions.

            On the other side of the spectrum, as governments become aware of inherent weaknesses in their
            mining taxation frameworks and of potential loopholes that the industry may legitimately exploit,
            they progressively introduce amendments to their tax legislation and related regulations to coun-
            teract them. In some cases their actions are effective in limiting or reversing tax leakages, but often
            they provide a rationale for MNEs to embark in further restructuring.

            The influence of tax considerations in successive restructuring decisions is exemplified by the case
            involving a South African mining company that shifted around R20 billions of profits to various
            entities in generally low-tax off-shore jurisdictions through a series of business restructures, taking
            advantage of existing treaties, loose application of transfer pricing and other tax mechanisms which
            the South African Revenue Services (SARS) contend had the primary purpose of moving profits
            offshore, thus minimizing tax payable in South Africa (SA). Critical to the findings of SARS’ audits
            was that profits were shifted to entities and locations where little or no actual value was created.

            A history of relevant events is summarized as follows:

                 ■■   In the 1970s, the Southern African Parent Company developed on-going relationships directly
                      with six key long-term supply clients and one PM-NE Company based in the Northern Europe.

                                                               Parent Co.
                                                             Southern Africa




                                                          Central Europe Sub. Co.




                                            6 key clients                           PM-NE
	                                                         Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   81


        ■■   In 1998 the Parent Company restructured the firm (Figure A.21) to assign these original
             contracts to a newly-formed Subsidiary Company in a central European country (Central
             Europe Sub. Co.) under a marketing agreement.
        ■■   The Parent Company moved two marketing personnel from Southern Africa to this central
             European subsidiary. The tax rate applicable to profits made by this subsidiary was 9.6%,
             as compared to the South African rate of 28%.
        ■■   In 2001, the Southern African country changed from a source basis of taxation to a resi-
             dency basis of taxation, which would have resulted in the Central Europe Sub. Co.’s net
             income being taxed in South Africa at 28%. To mitigate the negative tax effect resulting
             from the change to the residency basis, the Parent Co. formed a branch (Central Europe
             Branch Co.), that is to say a Permanent Establishment (PE) (Figure A.22), to which the Cen-
             tral Europe Sub. Co.’s business was sold for $50 million, with the related capital gain taxed
             at a rate of 9.6%. However, the double taxation agreement (DTA) between the Southern
             African country and the central European country allocated to the latter the taxing rights
             on PEs such as Central Europe Branch Co.
        ■■   In 2009 the Southern African country/Central European country DTA was changed so that
             the Southern African country could tax the profits allocated to the branch. To mitigate the
             negative tax effect resulting from this change and to avail itself of tax credits, the Parent Co.
             sold the business of the Central Europe Branch Co. to a newly formed subsidiary resident
             in a northern European country (Northern Europe Sub. Co.) as illustrated in Figure A.23.
             Interestingly, at the time of sale, the Central Europe Branch Co. had cash of approximately
             R3 billion but was sold for only USD5 million.

    The Central Europe Sub. Co., Central Europe Branch Co. and the Northern Europe Sub. Co. were
    portrayed by the Parent Co. as fully-fledged marketers/distributors responsible for servicing 40%
    of the world’s demand of a specific commodity and growing the business for the entire Group.
    However, for the last 25 years, the seven key clients (including PM-NE) originally procured by
    Parent Co. remained the only foreign clients with no additional customers established. Both the
    central European operations and the Northern Europe Sub. Co. had a maximum of five employees,
    i.e., two management and three administration staff. Over a 10-year period these offshore entities
    retained in excess of R20 billion in profits as the Parent Co. maintained that they performed such
    a strategic and vital role and were fully risk-taking. Notwithstanding the claimed strategic, highly
    functional and risk-bearing nature of the Central Europe Branch Co., its market value when sold to
    the Northern Europe Sub. Co. was set at only $5 million.

            An audit was first carried out to examine what the activities of the Central Europe Branch actu-
            ally were, in order to determine if the Parent Co. in a Southern African country had allocated to it
            an appropriate amount of profits. The Parent Co. maintained that the Central Europe Branch was
            a fully-fledged marketer/distributor, i.e., it performed value-adding functions by marketing and
            distributing the mineral commodity while taking entrepreneurial risks on behalf of the Parent Co.
            In other words, it was maintained that the Central Europe Branch “bought” and “sold” the com-
            modity and thus warranted a high return. The tax audit, however, revealed that the Central Europe
            Branch was actually a provider of management and marketing support services rather than a full-
            risk taking marketer/distributor as purported by the Parent Co. and actually warranted a routine
            return. Fundamental to the Southern African country Tax Administration Office’s (SATAO) find-
            ings was the fact that the Swiss Branch serviced seven long-term customers that were originally
            procured by the Parent Co. in the Southern African country, and hence, all subsequent activities
            performed by the Central Europe Branch were of a management and marketing support nature.

            As a result of the above determination, SATAO concluded that profits attributed to the Swiss
            Branch were not in line with the actual activities of the branch, which meant that the profits of the
            Swiss Branch had to be reduced, under Article 7 of the South Africa/Central European country Tax
            Treaty, to a level of compensation more commensurate with the activities performed. On this basis
            SATAO adjusted the method of allocation and the amount of profits allocated to the Central Europe
            Branch following the 2001 restructuring.

            The fiscal consequences of the 2009 sale of the Central Europe Branch Co. to the Northern Europe
            Sub. Co. are still being audited.


5.4  Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) Issues Pertinent to Developing Countries
            Traditionally, African countries did not have a large tax treaty network and most treaties concluded
            were mainly of regional scope. However, an emerging perception that the extent of the tax treaty
            network offered by various countries can be a factor for potential investors in deciding where to
            direct their investment has seen the number of treaties with developed countries increasing in
            recent years as shown in Figure A.24. Although empirical evidence on the investment effects of

                                         ties (BITs) with the main aim to provide security of investment to foreign investors.94

                                         For developed countries with stable and diverse economies, the give-and-take of taxing rights that
                                         result from having a DTA network, will generally balance out overall in the long term. This results
                                         in an equitable outcome even though, at any given time, it is rare for there to be a balance in capital
                                         flows between two countries.

                                         Entering into a DTA generally involves giving up some taxing rights and reducing the rate of
                                         source country withholding taxes and this may adversely affect the level of revenue collected as
                                         exemplified for a mineral-rich African country in Table A.7. For these reasons it would be generally
                                         undesirable from the point of view of a capital-importing developing nation, which exports min-
                                         eral products, to enter into DTAs with developed countries unless there are other, clearly identifi-
                                         able, offsetting strategic or economic benefits.

                                         The issue of how to structure and negotiate more balanced tax treaties between developing and
                                         developed countries is far from resolved95 and progress is still slow. There are currently two main
                                         international models for tax treaties that provide the basis for negotiation and commentary for
                                         interpretation of tax treaties. These are the:

            The UN Model98 retains a greater share of taxing power to developing countries allowing them to
            levy more direct taxation at source in their jurisdictions as for instance through higher withholding
            taxes to dividend, services, interest and royalty payments, as well as mining-specific exploration
            and extraction taxes, various forms of regulatory fees and levies and customs duties.

            Opponents claim that such forms of taxation reduce the attractiveness of countries to foreign direct
            investment (FDI) and may be economically inefficient. To counteract this perception, as already
            discussed, developing countries often offer tax holidays as an incentive to FDI, sometimes without
            fully appreciating the long-term revenue consequences of such concessions.

            A useful comparison of these two conventions and review of the current state of play as it concerns
            double taxation treaties in Africa is provided by Daurer and Krever (2012).99 Probably for historical
            reasons, two-thirds of treaties negotiated by developing countries to date have followed the OECD
            rather than the ostensibly more advantageous UN convention.

            The Exchange of Information article in DTAs (Article 26 in both the OECD Model and the UN
            Model) is, however, particularly desirable for developing countries. This article can be very useful
            for tax administrators when dealing with transfer pricing issues, tax evasion by residents or con-
            sidering whether reductions in applicable withholding taxes are to be allowed. An alternative is
            the multilateral exchange of information OECD convention, which now numbers in excess of 100
            signatories including some African Jurisdictions (e.g., Ghana).

            While significant improvements are being made with requirements for the flow of interjurisdic-
            tional information, transparency about MNEs’ derivation of profits and their repatriation to share-
            holders is still problematic. Consolidated annual reports tend to be rather opaque regarding their
            inter-group transactions, earnings and the amount of taxes paid in each country. This situation
            will be greatly improved upon implementation of the BEPS Action 13 revised standards for trans-
            fer pricing documentation and county-by-country reporting. However, this information may not
            become public nor be easily accessed until exchanged under treaty by the country where the MNE

          tries to enter into treaty arrangements to facilitate exchanges of information.100

          Other information is available under the EITI101 initiative, though rather aggregated in nature and
          therefore of limited usefulness for transfer pricing analysis.

          Rio Tinto has been proactive in publishing, over the last few years, a comprehensive annual report102
          of all the various types of taxes paid by all its subsidiaries to different levels of government in all the
          countries where they operate. This has enhanced their reputation as a responsible corporate entity
          and engendered generally cooperative relationships with the relevant tax authorities. However,
          while useful, this report is not as comprehensive as that required for country-by-country reporting.

          The international tax dispute resolution process (Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP), Article 25
          of OECD Model and UN Model) which a MNE may wish to have recourse to in situations of taxa-
          tion not in accordance with a treaty (e.g., double taxation), is another desirable feature of compre-
          hensive bilateral DTAs, which may not be otherwise available.

          Both the OECD and the UN now recommend that income from the disposal of shares in land-rich
          companies, including partnerships, trusts and estates, be taxed by the jurisdiction in which the
          property is located. To qualify as land-rich, more than 50% of immovable property must be attrib-
          utable to the company. This aspect of treaties has the potential to significantly impact the disposal
          of shares in successful exploration companies; however, the splitting or bifurcation of assets and
          revaluation of other assets in the company may dilute the proportion attributable to immovable
          property. As for “other income,” the OECD convention allocates it to the residence country, while
          the UN convention suggests mechanisms for splitting it between the host and residence country.

          The decision to enter into tax treaties needs to be based on broad policy and economic reasons, not
          just concerns about profit shifting or transfer pricing. Such a decision needs to balance the expected
          benefits and costs. The IMF notes103 that considerable caution is needed for any developing country
          entering into a tax treaty as they may achieve more through their domestic law (including defini-
          tion of permanent establishment, etc.) than through reciprocal tax treaty benefits. Useful informa-
          tion is also contained in the series of papers published by the UN that addresses the negotiation of
          tax treaties for developing countries.104

          Tax treaty negotiation is a highly specialized skill and experts with these skills are scarce. Signifi-
          cant highly skilled resources also have to be invested in preparation and support for such nego-
          tiations that frequently take considerable time to conclude. African countries may benefit from
          working together to agree on tax treaty attributes and to negotiate as a block if they wish to con-
          clude tax treaties with particular countries.


5.5  Treaty Shopping
          Even though there may not be a DTA between the country of residence of an MNE and the country
          hosting its mining operations, the MNE may reduce its effective tax rate at the consolidated level

                 by ‘treaty shopping’, that is to say by routing its investment indirectly through an entity in a low-
                 tax conduit country that has a tax treaty with the country a MNE intends to invest in.

                 Treaty shopping is commonly undertaken to avoid taxes on capital gains and to achieve reduced
                 withholding tax rates for payment of dividends, royalties and interest.

                 The basic treaty shopping structure is exemplified in Figure A.25 (adapted from IMF, 2014), which
                 shows how a MNE investor (Head Co.) resident in country C wishing to invest in a mining project
                 (Mining Co.) in host country A with which country C does not have a treaty, would, if investing
                 directly in A, be subject to high withholding taxes. For this reason the MNE would invest indirectly
                 through a conduit affiliate (Conduit Co. 1) in country B, which has treaties with both country A and
                 C, both entailing lower withholding taxes. Furthermore, country B may have a treaty with country D,
                 a low-tax jurisdiction. Streaming receipts through a subsidiary (Conduit Co. 2) in country D, can,
                 unless country C applies CFC rules, further reduce Head Co.’s tax liability in country C.

                 With the ever present risk of treaty shopping, developing countries should be cautious about creat-
                 ing tax treaty networks and may wish to consider the negotiation and inclusion of a suitable anti-
                 abuse provision such as a Limitation of Benefit (LOB) article (see IMF discussion on tax treaties).105
                 In the example of Figure A.25, for instance, LOB provisions within the Country A-B treaty may
                 have the effect of redirecting benefits unless it can be proved that the affiliated entity registered in
                 country B is actually adding appreciable value.

                 The revenue costs of any tax treaty may be significantly greater than expected through third coun-
                 try entities accessing treaty benefits via treaty shopping without providing any reciprocal benefits.
                 Some countries have taken the rare step of unilaterally cancelling some tax treaties because of the
                 way they were being used as a conduit to avoid taxes.106

                 In the absence of an anti-abuse article in the relevant tax treaty it may be difficult for a tax admin-
                 istration to redress treaty shopping. BEPS Final Report for Action 6 provides new treaty anti-abuse

      Chapter 5 Key Take-Away Points

           •	   The effect of transfer mispricing on revenue is compounded where, in an endeavour to attract
                FDI in mineral exploration and mining, jurisdictions have made use of significant fiscal incen-
                tives, particularly undesirable tax holidays and excessively restrictive stabilisation agree-
                ments, without a full awareness of their long-term consequences.
           •	   To remain competitive, capture market share and grow, MNEs continuously rationalize and
                optimize their business on a global scale, which may result in often significant restructuring for
                technical and commercial reasons, which may include tax considerations such as opportuni-
                ties for tax rate arbitrage and to benefit from existing tax treaties networks.
           •	   The process of restructuring is dynamically driven by changing market forces, emerging inno-
                vative technology and the incentives/disincentives created by progressive evolution of the
                tax frameworks of various countries designed to reduce opportunities for tax leakages. The
                resulting corporate structures are in the majority of cases, strictly speaking, legal, the main
                question is whether the resulting attribution of profits to MNEs’ subsidiaries and branches in
                various countries is commensurate to the value added by them.
           •	   Audits must focus on clearly understanding the value added by and the risks actually under-
                taken by the various subsidiaries in carrying out their activities; in effect determining whether
                they have ‘economic substance’ rather than ‘form’.
           •	   Legislative means of preventing restructuring have in some instances proven ineffective and
                counterproductive. Strategies based on the existence of a business case, investment incen-
                tives and other means of facilitating business within the country need to be devised to attract
                and retain FDI.
           •	   Developing countries should consider carefully the potential benefits and costs of entering into
                DTAs with developed countries and the potential to create opportunities for ‘treaty shopping’.

This chapter will focus on the specific economic importance and nature of the mining industry in
Africa and its stage of legislative development in the area of transfer pricing. It will identify and
list in Appendices the main mining projects for different commodities in various countries and
consider their revenue and expenditure characteristics as an initial reference for transfer pricing
risk analysis. Discussion will be supported by the provision of a number of relevant case studies.

6.1  Economic Importance of Mining in Africa
          The contribution made by mining to the economy of many African countries has grown in recent
          years ahead of that of other sectors, increasing the importance of this industry as a mechanism for
          economic development and growth. This trend is expected to continue over the long term notwith-
          standing recent significant falls in mineral commodity prices following an unprecedented period
          of twelve years of continuous growth. In addition, many African economies are not well diversified
          and are in many instances, at least for the foreseeable future, significantly dependent on mining.
          The degree of various countries’ dependency on mining is measured by the Extractives Depen-
          dence Index (EDI) developed by the UNDP (Hailu, D. and Kipgen, C., 2015).107 The composite EDI
          is based on three indicators: a) the share of total export earnings from extractives; b) revenue from
          extractives as a share of total fiscal revenue; and c) the value added by extractives as a percentage
          of the total. Table B.1, modified from the above publication, displays the degree of dependency of
          various African countries on the extractive industries.

          It must be noted that not all resource-rich countries are necessarily resource dependent. On this
          basis a vast range of other indicators of dependency have been developed, which include oil, gas
          and mineral revenues or exports of at least 20% of total fiscal revenue and exports (IMF); 5-year
          average resource revenues that are more than 20% of government revenue; and resource rents that
          are greater than 10% of GDP (McKinsey Global Institute). Davies (1995)108 classifies a country as a
          “mineral economy” if the contribution from its extractive industry to total GDP exceeds 8%.

          At last count (RIU, 2014) there were 591 mineral exploration and mining companies in Africa oper-
          ating a total of 1,572 mineral deposits. In the majority of cases mineral exploration and mining
          companies are largely owned by multinational enterprises (MNEs) with minor government equity
          interests (typically 10% or less), and their output is largely exported. Of these deposits, 301 were
          producing mines, 333 were development projects at the conceptual to feasibility stage and 938
          were exploration prospects. The majority of the above deposits (289, 327 and 917 respectively) were
          located in Sub-Saharan Africa. South Africa accounted for 315 deposits of which 135 were operat-
          ing mines.

          The above deposits do not include artisanal mining and low-value bulk minerals for domestic
          use, such as sand, limestone, gypsum, aggregate, etc. They relate primarily to valuable commodi-
          ties including gold, platinum group elements (PGEs), base metals (copper, lead and zinc), steel
          alloy metals (nickel, cobalt, chromium, vanadium and manganese), uranium and bulk commodi-
          ties such as iron ore, bauxite, phosphate rock and coal. Many of the existing mines, as well as

          yet-to-be-developed projects and exploration discoveries, qualify as major or even giant by global
          standards.

          In this light it is no surprise that the continent had become a magnet for foreign direct investment
          (FDI) during the past mining boom and particularly, given its undisputed mineral prospectivity, for
          international investment focused on mineral exploration and mine development at the expenses
          of traditional destinations such as Australia and Canada. SNL Mining & Metals (2014) estimates
          that, in 2013, Africa attracted US$2.9 billion or 17% of worldwide mineral exploration investment,
          mainly for gold, base metals and iron ore. The bulk of this, as shown in Table B.2, was in the Sub-
          Saharan region. No doubt this will over time lead to new mineral discoveries that will sustain, or
          even enhance, the current rate of economic growth in the region.

          With the end of the mining boom, however, the mining industry has in the last couple of years
          been placed under significant financial pressure, particularly exploration with many prospects
          being shelved. Development of some new projects has also slowed down or ceased and a few mar-
          ginal mines had to be put on care and maintenance, which hopefully will bounce back once prices
          recover.


6.2  Current Status of Transfer Pricing Legislation and Administration in Africa
          6.2.1  Transfer pricing legislation

          The ability for tax administrations to identify and address transfer pricing risks is highly depen-
          dent on the existence, within their tax laws, of well-articulated and enforceable transfer pricing leg-
          islative provisions and related regulations. Sophisticated TP legislation should be consistent with
          the generally accepted international standard of the arm’s length principle, as set out in Article 9
          (Associated Enterprises) of the UN Model Tax Convention and Article 9 (Associated Enterprises)109
          of the OECD’s Model Tax Convention. Both models, which between them are the basis for nearly
          all bilateral treaties for avoiding double taxation, endorse the arm’s length principle for pricing
          transactions within a MNE. The OECD (2010) Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enter-
          prises and Tax Administrations, as amended, and its predecessors provide consistent policies and
          practices that have been applied to transactions between related parties in developed economies by
          tax administrations for over three decades. However, attempts to implement or even adapt these
          guidelines to Africa have proven, with a few exceptions, slow, costly and often ineffective.



            Article 7 (Business Profits) provides equivalent arm’s length principles for permanent establishments.

94	        Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


                 Although many African countries have basic provisions in place to deal with transfer pricing, they
                 often do not include appropriate documentation requirements and/or have not yet been comple-
                 mented by the necessary regulations/guidance for implementation. A few African countries have
                 not yet embarked in, or are still at the very initial stages of the process.

                 Even in cases where TP legislation exists, knowledge of the mining industry within some tax
                 authorities may be inadequate, and as a consequence, the specificities of the mining sector may not
                 be fully identified nor addressed.

                 Table B.3 provides an up-to-date view of the status of evolution of transfer pricing legislation in

                   currently provide for the negotiation of Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs), even though this
                   mechanism has been rarely applied in practice.

                   While the existence of appropriate legislation concerning transfer pricing is fundamental to deal-
                   ing with transfer pricing risks, lack of commensurate administrative capacity, limited access to
                   reliable comparables databases and paucity of reliable domestic comparables to actively enforce
                   the legislation may render it largely ineffective.

                   6.2.2  Results of transfer pricing questionnaire

                   A comprehensive transfer pricing questionnaire was drafted and administered to a number of senior
                   tax and mines department officials in some 40 African countries that attended the IM4DC/WBG
                   mining tax administration workshops. The questionnaire was drafted to get an idea of the degree
                   of TP legislative evolution, as well as the extent to which transfer pricing audits are in fact currently
                   being carried out in various countries. The questionnaire, provided in Appendix B.1, included
                   58 questions grouped into 15 specific sections. Responses were received from 19  jurisdictions,
96	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


            representing just under 50% of the nations approached. The quality of the responses was variable
            with many questionnaires only partially completed in spite of repeated reminders.

            In general terms, analysis of the questionnaires confirms that, even though many jurisdictions have
            adequate specific transfer pricing legislation in place, only a relatively small number enforce it to
            any appreciable degree and transfer pricing audits in general, let alone those of mining companies
            specifically, with a few exceptions, are not or rarely carried out.

            More specifically the questionnaires indicated that:

                 ■■   All countries hosting significant mining operations consider transfer pricing to constitute
                      a significant issue, even though only a few countries were in a position to estimate the
                      potential magnitude of its impact on tax revenue from mining (e.g., in South Africa $500
                      to $2000 million).
                 ■■   Half of the countries surveyed have specific transfer pricing legislation/rules in place, one
                      quarter have reference to the arm’s length principle in their general tax laws and the rest,
                      while not currently having established transfer pricing provisions, are either developing
                      them or considering doing so.
                 ■■   The majority of respondents have limited and primarily regional networks of double taxa-
                      tion agreements.
                 ■■   Mining projects are ring-fenced for tax purposes in the majority of jurisdictions where the
                      industry is active, with no specific requirements in a few countries where mining is in its
                      infancy.
                 ■■   Most jurisdictions see the area of mineral transfers/sales as the main transfer pricing risk;
                      however, only a quarter of respondents had systems in place to check the degree to which
                      the prices applied to minerals transferred to related parties comply with the arm’s length
                      principle, and only two or three do so systematically.
                 ■■   Similarly, only a quarter of respondents systematically carry out value-chain analysis to
                      determine whether marketing and hedging fees charged by related parties comply with
                      the arm’s length principle.
                 ■■   About three quarters of respondents reported high levels of borrowing by the mining
                      industry, largely from related overseas parties with remittance of the related interest
                      expenses to the lenders being subject to various levels of withholding tax. However, in
                      many instances the rate of withholding tax may have been reduced or even waved in line
                      with the terms of stability agreements and/or double taxation agreements.
                 ■■   About two-thirds of respondents have thin capitalization rules in place, but some appear
                      unable to effectively enforce them.
                 ■■   Just over half of the respondents have a reasonably clear idea of the degree to which routine
                      corporate services are provided by related parties and confirmed the application of with-
                      holding tax to the relevant remittances. However, only one quarter indicated that the rel-
                      evant transfer prices are routinely checked for compliance with the arm’s length principle.
                 ■■   Similarly, half of the respondents appear to be aware of the extent to which nonroutine
                      specialized services involving the use of intangibles such as IP, are provided by related
                      parties. Even though withholding taxes applied to related party payments are in place in
                      the majority of jurisdictions, systematic checks are only carried out by a minority of the
                      respondents (i.e., 25%).
                 ■■   About a third of respondents have generally limited access to relevant comparables data-
                      bases to support their analyses.
                 ■■   Communication and consultation relating to transfer pricing with taxpayers prior to estab-
                      lishing their mining operations in the country are generally very limited, often confined to
                      making documents detailing the applicable rules available to them.
                 ■■   Three-quarters of the respondents did not carry out any specific transfer pricing audits in
                      2013, although transfer pricing issues did arise in the context of two general tax audits.
                      Two jurisdictions (i.e., South Africa and Tanzania) were actively planning around 20 and
                      14 annual audits involving transfer pricing respectively, some of which relate to mining
	                                                              Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   97


                   companies. In addition, Lesotho and Malawi carried out one and two transfer pricing
                   audits, respectively.
              ■■   Risk profiling and risk-based auditing plans were adopted by jurisdictions hosting a sig-
                   nificant number of mining operations, while a less formalized approach was used in coun-
                   tries with a limited number. While some of the audits have not yet been completed, so far
                   audits are considered to be cost-justified in terms of both consequent adjustments and
                   improvements in the taxpayers’ compliance behaviour.
              ■■   Over half of the respondents confirmed the requirement for taxpayers to maintain con-
                   temporaneous transfer pricing documentation for a period of five to six years. The nega-
                   tive response from the other jurisdictions, which in some cases are known to have such a
                   requirement, is likely due to a misinterpretation of the question, which must have been
                   interpreted in terms of a requirement for industry to actually submit such information
                   annually.
              ■■   There was a general feeling that industry is sometimes reluctant to submit adequate trans-
                   fer pricing information, and even when it does, it may be compiled in a manner difficult to
                   disaggregate and interpret.
              ■■   Around half of the jurisdictions, however, appear to have the legislative power to rechar-
                   acterize transactions and impose adjustments.
              ■■   Some of the adjustments were accepted by the taxpayer. Others were the subject of appeals
                   and/or disputes, which in the majority of cases were settled through a negotiated outcome
                   or suspended because of the overwhelming complexity of cross-border investigations.
                   Two cases that went to court are as yet unresolved.
              ■■   Six jurisdictions have dedicated transfer pricing teams that include between two and
                   twenty officers with variable levels of experience. A few jurisdictions have officers with
                   specialized skills in transfer pricing within the general ranks of their tax inspectors, but
                   numbers are generally very low. Many tax administrations, however, are in the course of
                   training some of their officers in the area of transfer pricing.

          With a few exceptions, the complexity of the processes and the limited technical capacity and
          industry knowledge of most tax administrations, coupled with the high cost of implementing a
          transfer pricing audit function in general, are the main reasons for the current state of affairs. Only
          a few jurisdictions have specific transfer pricing units within their tax administrations, and audits
          of transfer pricing issues are rarely carried out as part of general audits.

          The study questionnaire clearly highlights a strong need for capacity strengthening in the area
          of transfer pricing throughout the African continent and for enhancing the knowledge of mining
          industry processes (including knowledge of the key value drivers in its supply chain) within tax
          authorities, particularly in fast-developing mineral-rich countries. These issues will be reviewed
          and assessed, based on a breakdown of the typical revenue and cost structures (both capital and
          operating recurrent) for representative mining operations involving different mineral commodities
          and production types in the following sections.

6.3 
    for Identification of Transfer Pricing Risks
          6.3.1  General considerations

          As a background to this study and to quantify the economic importance of the mining industry
          in the African context, the African mineral resources for the main mineral commodities currently
          mined in the continent were identified and quantified in terms of:

              ■■   Percentage of world production;
              ■■   Percentage of world identified resources.

            Much of this information was extracted from publications by the US Geological Survey (USGS)110
            and the British Geological Survey (BGS),111 prepared by MinEx Consulting, and from the websites
            of various companies and industry groups. In this section, the term “resource”112 describes miner-
            alisation in the ground, while “reserve”113 has economic connotations and covers that portion of
            a resource that has a high probability of being viable given the current and prospective economic
            situation, and the application of suitable methods of extraction (see Box B.1).

                The USGS defines a resource as “a concentration of naturally occurring solid, liquid, or gaseous materials in or on
            the Earth’s crust in such form that economic extraction of a commodity is regarded as feasible, either currently or
            at some future time.” This classification is then subdivided into identified and undiscovered based on the level of
            information used to identify its existence.
            113
                A reserve is defined as “that portion of an identified resource from which a useable mineral or energy commodity
            can be economically and legally extracted at the time of determination.” Reserves are then further subdivided into
            measured, indicated and inferred based on the level of information used in the determination of quality and quantity.
            These classifications, which are applied primarily to the broad assessment of mineral resources at the level of various
            national and global endowment inventories, relate to, but are distinct from, the reporting resource/reserve classifica-
            tions (e.g., National Instrument 43-101, JORC and SAMREC Codes) used at the project level.

    In addition, a database containing all current mining operations for the main mineral com-
    modities mined in Sub-Saharan Africa was compiled by extracting information primarily
    from the RIU’s Register of African Mines 2014 and from a variety of other published and
    unpublished sources. This database, provided in Appendix B.2, categorises the population of
    mines, including 247 individual operations that are currently in production out of a total of
    289, according to:

          ■■   The mineral commodity they produce on the basis of their main output114 (e.g., gold, base
               metals, coal, etc.);
          ■■   Their geographical location;
          ■■   The type of mining (surface or underground);
          ■■   The size of individual mines in terms of their daily/annual production throughput; and
          ■■   The number and significance of current development projects and exploration potential.

    A cumulative probability distribution of daily production throughputs for each commodity group
    was then constructed, which allowed operations to be classified into three size categories for each
    mining type as:

          ■■   Small: falling below the first quartile (Q1) in terms of production rate,
          ■■   Medium: falling between the first and third quartiles, and
          ■■   Large: having a production rate in excess of the third quartile (Q3).

    The size of the “typical” mine was then taken to be the midpoint of each size category range. It
    must be pointed out that “small,” “medium” and “large” are relative terms in so far that a “small”
    coal or iron ore open-cut mine can in fact represent a reasonable sizeable operation. A “large”
          fication generally denotes a major or world-class deposit.
    classi­

    Typical throughputs were then used to identify a representative stripping ratio and mining method
    for surface and underground operations respectively. On this basis, the order of magnitude of
    the main cost components were assessed for each typical operation, including specific items of
    both capital and recurrent expenditures. These cost breakups provide an initial indication of which
    activities and related transactions are of financial importance in different types of mines and should
    be given priority when considering their potential susceptibility to transfer pricing issues when
    mapping the main risk points to government revenue.115

    6.3.2  Key commodities characteristics and their influence on cross-border transactions

    This section highlights the key differences among the main commodities mined in Africa as identi-
    fied through an analysis of the categorization and breakup of their mining revenue and cost com-
    ponents, which are shown in detail for each commodity in Appendix B.3. These cost breakups
    provide some indication of which activities and related transactions may be of financial impor-
    tance in different types of mines for different commodities, and represent a starting point for con-
    sidering potential issues that may arise in the area of transfer pricing. Furthermore, in looking
    at these cost components, one may gain a better appreciation of the degree to which any of the
    related transactions may involve hard-to-value specialised services and intangible assets. Caution,
    however, needs to be exercised for the manner in which these indicative data are used, and they
    should not be assumed by tax administrations to always be applicable regardless of considerations
    of project-specific circumstances.




    114
        In a minority of cases where the value of co-products were reasonably balanced or the mine was in transition from
    a main commodity output to another, e.g., from gold to copper, a mine may have been listed under both commodi-
    ties. For example Bisha mine in Eritrea produces both significant gold and copper and is therefore listed under both
    commodities.

             Of the high ticket items identified in Appendix B.3, it appears that the following items may involve
             transactions with high intangible components in their cost structures, thus deserving priority
             attention:

                  ■■   Revenue related transactions (e.g., distribution and marketing services);
                  ■■   Management and administrative services provided as an annual operating cost that may
                       include accounting and finance functions;
                  ■■   Transportation services that may involve the provision of insurance; and
                  ■■   Engineering services provided as a capital expenditure.

             The detailed type of information to be found in Appendix B.3 includes a systematic overview and
             listing of the major development and mining projects for key commodities in each African country
             together with an assessment of the importance of Africa, and in some cases of the resources and
             reserves of individual countries, in a global context. In addition, for each key commodity a qualita-
             tive assessment of the exploration potential in Africa is provided based on the number of explora-
             tion projects in each country.

             It is important to note that different commodities have markedly different characteristics in terms
             of their:

                  ■■   Extraction technology involved;
                  ■■   Level of ore tonnage throughput;
                  ■■   Necessary initial capital cost;
                  ■■   Unit recurrent cost of production;
                  ■■   Required downstream processing and related energy intensity;
                  ■■   Reliance on transport and logistics as a major input; and
                  ■■   Specifications and marketing characteristics.

             For example, cost characteristics will be very different between underground and open pit mines,
             particularly in the case of bulk commodities (e.g., iron ore and coal). The latter will also display sig-
                                                                                                              tonnage
             nificantly higher levels of revenue and capital cost as a function of their relatively large ore ­
             throughput. On the redeeming side, however, they will display generally lower recurrent unit costs
             of production due to their economies of scale.

             Contrary to bulk mining that generally produces and exports crushed and screened ore after no or
             minimum beneficiation, some metallic commodities, such as copper and other base metals, nickel,
             and to a lesser degree gold, require significant investment in downstream processing as they are
             marketed as either concentrates or intermediate products (e.g., copper (gold) concentrates, nickel
             concentrate, etc.) and/or crude and refined metals (e.g., blister copper, nickel matte, doré, etc.).

             To be developed, bulk commodities require a significant investment in transportation and port
             infrastructure capable of conveying large volumes of ore to export markets. In the African context
             this may involve railing facilities crossing national boundaries that requires significant negotiation
             and cooperation among countries.

             As discussed in detail in Part A under the heading of Marketing Hubs, product specifications vary
             from very stringent for refined metals sold on terminal markets (e.g., London Metals Exchange) to
             more variable for concentrates and intermediate products, to customer specifications for specialty
             metals and industrial minerals, to strictly quality-based specifications for diamonds and gemstones
             in general.

             6.3.2.1  Global production and resource profiles for key commodities in Africa

             Precious metals are an important part of the mining landscape in Africa. Early mining in Africa
             had been dominated first by gold mining from South Africa’s extraordinary Witwatersrand gold
	                                                            Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   101


    deposits, and second by platinum in the Bushveld Complex. The gold industry is very fragmented,116
    in contrast to other segments of the mining industry in which a few large companies dominate pro-
    duction. Gold deposits are typically smaller than those of other minerals due to the relative scarcity
    and high value of gold, allowing for smaller operations to produce at a profit through low volumes
    of high unit-value material that does not create any major requirement in terms of its transporta-
    tion apart from security and insurance issues. In 2012, world production of gold was calculated
    to be 2,690 tonnes.117 In 2013, total production reached 2,982 tonnes,118 with world gold reserves in
    2014 estimated to be 55,000 tonnes.119 As outlined in Appendix B.3, this increase in production was
    mainly due to a growing supply coming from China.

    Base metal mining (copper, lead and zinc) in Africa is generally more consolidated than their coun-
    terparts around the globe. A few base metal mines in Africa are fully vertically integrated to the
    point where they sell refined metals.120 Generally, operations are only vertically integrated to the
    concentration stage and sell concentrates to related or third party smelters, which often entails
    significant land and sea freight transport activities. The main constraint for developing smelting
    capacity, besides the availability of significant reserves of high-quality ores, is the availability of a
    sufficient, reliable and affordable energy supply.

    Due to its comparatively lower market price (relative to gold, PGMs and other high-value miner-
    als) and the reducing grades being mined, mining copper economically requires relatively large
    operations to move substantial tonnages of material and advanced copper extraction and refin-
    ing technologies. These create relatively high barriers to entry that lead to a global industry that
    is dominated by a few large operators. In 2013, world mine production of copper was calculated
    to be 18.1 million tonnes, representing an 8.4% increase from 2012, and production is expected to
    continue growing on trend at a compound annual rate of 3.9% over the period from 2014 to 2020.121
    As discussed in Appendix B.3, global production of copper continues to be dominated by Chile,
    contributing just under one-third of total supply.

    Mining bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal is quite consolidated,122 and depending on
    mine infrastructure, production along the value chain can start at exploration and end at a high
    level of beneficiation. For iron ore, the level of vertical integration is generally limited to activities
    from exploration to mine development down to a low level of beneficiation, as it is primarily sold
    in the form of crushed and screened ores, sometimes blended and subordinately in the form of
    partially beneficiated products. By contrast, mining of coal products range from bulk material with
    no or limited processing (typically as feed for power plants) to a complex and vertically integrated
    range of products. Most exported coal is generally sold in the form of crushed, screened and/or
    washed/processed material.

    Iron is the world’s second most abundant metal and approximately 98% of production is used
    as the key ingredient in steel making.123 Predominantly found in the form of either hematite or
    magnetite, world mine production in 2013 was calculated to be 2.8 billion tonnes and is expected
    to increase slightly to 2.9 billion tonnes in 2014.124 The top three producing countries accounted for
    more than 77% of total world production in 2013, and were expected to make a similar contribution
    in 2014 (Appendix B.3).

             Coal is globally sourced and found in over 70 countries and actively mined in most of them. It is
             mined for its energy content and mostly used for the generation of electricity, metallurgical use
             (e.g., steel industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from ore) and conversion into liquid
             and gas fuels. According to the World Energy Council, “Coal’s dominant position in the global
             energy mix is largely due to the fact that it is abundant, widely distributed across the globe and
             affordable.” Global consumption of coal is growing and, despite negative publicity, is expected to
             increase as developing countries require more energy to support their expanding populations and
             economic growth. It is estimated that the international coal mining market requires production of
             about 7.7 billion tonnes of coal annually.125

             Iron ore and coal deposits and operations are typically larger in terms of production tonnages
             than those for other minerals due to their abundance and the high volumes required by the mar-
             ket. Entry barriers are high because of the scale of operations that rely on large, mechanised tech-
             nologies requiring significant upfront capital investment. As a consequence, much of the exported
             related production is concentrated in countries with inherently large resources and with access to
             infrastructure, capital and markets. The main constraint to economically mining bulk commodities
             is not exclusively their grade, but also their location relative to markets, making logistics rather
             than the mining processes the key driver as to the economic viability of a deposit. In essence, iron
             ore and coal mines are often high-volume low-margin businesses that require significant invest-
             ment in, often proprietary, transportation infrastructure such as rail and port facilities.126 Thus
             availability of this infrastructure is a critical factor in their development decision.

             Diamond deposits are typically smaller than those for other minerals due to their relative scarcity.
             Entry barriers range from very low for widespread alluvial deposits to very high because of the
             capital and technological requirements for the development of some types of deposits such as deep
             kimberlite plugs and off-shore marine detrital deposits. As a consequence of this and the high dia-
             mond endowment of the continent, there is a variety of diamond producers present in Africa. Dia-
             mond production is, however, becoming increasingly challenging as mining progressively moves
             towards deeper, less profitable and more remote resources. Apart from issues of security and insur-
             ance, transportation is not an issue with rough diamond and gemstones in general because of their
             high-value and low-volume nature.

             Considering the size of some of the African deposits and the scale of the investment required to
             develop them, which cannot be funded with local capital, large mining operations tend to attract
             large multinational enterprises. The strong international demand for mineral products combined
             with the scale of operations results in significant cross-border flows of goods and services and
             related cash flows creating opportunities and risk for the misuse of transfer prices.

             6.3.2.2  Current state of key commodity production in Africa

             Gold and Platinum Group Minerals (PGM) account for approximately half of the operating and
             exploration projects on the African continent, including projects that have reached the advanced
             study stages (Table B.4). As a result, extraction of these commodities contributes substantially
             to government revenues from mining across the continent, justifying the direction of auditing
             resources to these commodity sectors.

             Of the 286 current mining operations, 101 are producing gold (Table B.4). Furthermore, more than
             half of the exploration activity on the African continent is looking for gold deposits. As discussed
             in Appendix B.3, of the 2,690 tonnes of gold produced worldwide in 2012, the African continent

    as a whole accounted for between 20 and 25%,127 with the top 10 producing countries outputting
    almost 500 tonnes of gold.

    Most gold mines in Africa are vertically integrated from exploration through development and
    mining to processing operations, including smelting and in some cases refining, and even sales.
    Sales products for gold mining operations in Africa are typically in the form of refined metal (doré).
    However, the level of purity for these products will vary depending upon the requirements of spe-
    cific customers, and to meet the standards of terminal bullion markets.

    The analysis in Appendix B.3 shows that the majority of gold operations in production on the
    African continent are surface mines, with the “typical” surface gold mine having an expected pro-
    duction rate of approximately 7,500 tonnes of ore per day, and the typical underground gold mine
    having an expected throughput of 1,500 tonnes per day (Table B.5). The analysis also shows that
    there is a strong pipeline for gold mining in Africa, with as many projects at the advanced study
    stage as are currently in production. Of interest is that while the traditional gold mining nation of
    South Africa has the most projects at the advanced study stage, as a region, West Africa has the
    strongest pipeline, signalling the importance of this region to the future of the global gold mining
    industry.

    Shifting attention to copper, of the approximately 16.8 million tonnes produced worldwide in
    2012, the African continent as a whole accounted for approximately 8.5%,128 with the top produc-
    ing countries outputting more than 1.4 million tonnes of copper (Appendix B.3). Currently, the
    copper industry represents a substantial proportion of the mining-related activities taking place
    on the African continent. As illustrated in Table B.4, of the 286 producing mining operations on
    the African continent, 26 of them are copper operations, which ranks fourth among commodities.

             ­ owever, the future importance of copper to the African continent becomes apparent when look-
             H
             ing at the number of projects in the advanced study stage or exploration stage, with 29 and 79 proj-
             ects respectively, placing copper third behind gold and coal for advanced study stage projects and
             second only to gold in exploration intensity. This developing pipeline positions copper as a com-
             modity of ever increasing prominence and importance as the African nations continue to develop.

             The majority of the copper mining operations in Africa are surface mines, where the expected
             throughput is approximately 9,500 tonnes of ore per day (Table B.5). The majority of the copper
             mining operations129 are based in the DRC and Zambia, with the majority of copper mines in the
             DRC being surface operations, while Zambia, with the exception of two large surface mines, has
             predominantly underground operations.

             The analysis in Appendix B.3 also shows that there is a strong pipeline for copper mining in Africa,
             with more projects at advanced study stages as are currently in production. Of interest is that while
             the traditional copper mining nations of DRC and Zambia have a significant number of advanced
             study stage projects, 11 and 5 respectively, Namibia also has 7 projects in this classification. The
             notion that future production may come from these three countries is supported when looking at
             the distribution of exploration projects across the continent, as combined they account for 50 of the
             79 copper exploration projects.

             While currently only accounting for less than 10% of producing mines in Africa, iron ore has the
             potential to contribute significantly to government revenues. Currently, the iron ore sector repre-
             sents a substantial proportion of the mining related activities taking place on the African continent,
             with many projects under exploration or in the advanced study stages. Categorizing the active
             operations by size and geographical location shows that one-third of African iron ore production
             currently comes from South Africa, with the typical mine expected to produce primarily direct
             shipping ore (DSO) at a daily tonnage rate of 8,000 tonnes per day. In total, African production of
             iron ore amounted to 130.6 million tonnes in 2013, which represented 5% of the world supply, and
             of this amount 51% came from South Africa.

    As with other commodities, the analysis in Appendix B.3 shows that there is a strong pipeline for
    iron ore mining in Africa, with more projects at advanced study stages (37) as are currently in pro-
    duction (20). Of interest is that while South Africa is poised to be the largest producer, there are also
    a number of exploration and advanced study stage projects in the West African region.

    Table B.4 shows that the coal industry represents a significant proportion of mining activities tak-
    ing place on the African continent. As far as exploration is concerned, only 6% of the exploration
    activity on the African continent is looking for coal deposits. The main reasons for this are lack of
    transport infrastructure and capital, which are both required to compete with established global
    producers. However, there is significant potential for coal considering the growing energy needs
    of the continent. This will require the establishment of local markets and investment in exploration
    for coal. African governments are also set to become more strategic with the protection of supply
    for local markets through either market restrictions or encouraging more exploration for coal.

    A few countries, with South Africa dominant, account for the 280 million tonnes of coal produced
    in Africa, which is less than 5% of global production. Currently there are 63 coal operations in pro-
    duction on the African continent, with the typical mine being a surface mining operation produc-
    ing approximately 6,000 tonnes per day.

    Africa is a significant and known source of diamonds, but its coloured gemstones are becoming
    increasingly important. Gemstones occur in many countries throughout the continent, with sig-
    nificant diamond finds being regularly recorded. The diamond industry represents a significant
    proportion of mining activities taking place on the African continent, while diamond exploration
    accounts for about 5% of total exploration activity. Of the 130 million carats of diamonds produced
    worldwide in 2013, the top ten African countries by production accounted for almost 70 million
    carats, making up 54% of global production (Table B.6). This is significant and the continent is
    expected to maintain its strong supply position in the global market into the future.

    Currently there are about 41 diamond-producing operations on the African continent, with the
    majority being surface mines. Based on the statistical analysis in Appendix B.3, the typical sur-
    face mine is expected to produce approximately 8,000 tonnes of ore per day (Table B.5). With the

             exception of Sierra Leone, most of the diamond mining operations130 are based in the southern
             region of the African continent.131

             Exploration potential in Africa is high in general for all mineral commodities. The current drive by
             African governments to formalise the artisanal mining sector and the tendency of informal activ-
             ity to alert large companies to potential significant findings signals that the African continent will
             remain a major supplier of world diamond demand for many years to come, which is supported
             by the analysis in Appendix B.3 showing that there is a reasonable pipeline for diamond mining in
             Africa, with the number of exploration projects and studies at advanced stages together outnum-
             bering the producing operations. Considering the relatively small global diamond reserve base,
             this emphasises Africa’s strong position in the diamond sector.

             6.3.2.3  Broad revenue and cost considerations

             Small mispricing differences between transfer prices and at arm’s length prices, when occurring
             in the context of very large items of either revenue or expenses, can result in significant tax leak-
             ages. For instance, on an annualised basis the gross revenue generated by a typical surface gold
             mining operation in Africa is expected to be more than USD132 million (Table B.5). Furthermore,
             mining operations also incur substantial expenses for not only construction, plant and equipment
             of a capital nature, but also consumables and specialty services, which in many cases are provided
             by a related overseas party. The level of potential risk to the tax base will be dependent upon the
             nature of the mining operation, as the different characteristics will dictate a different mix of capi-
             tal expenditures (CAPEX) and annual operating expenses (OPEX), as well as different sources of
             procurement.

             Table B.7 shows the general cost breakup and magnitude of expenditure for items that may be
             incurred by the “typical” surface mining operations for each of the key commodities mined on
             the African continent.132 This table shows that irrespective of the commodity being mined, large
             proportions of CAPEX will be directed towards the purchase and installation of equipment. This
             item, along with those associated with specialised engineering and management services, are often
             considered to be risky and subject to transfer mispricing. Exemption from customs duties and VAT,
             which are frequently part of the fiscal incentives provided to attract FDI in the industry, are also an
             encouragement to inflate costs, indirectly pushing more debt into the importing country. However,
             tax authorities should be in a position to constrain and manage these risks as comparables can be
             found for the majority of equipment purchased by a mining operation. By contrast, and as already
             discussed in Part A when dealing with the MNEs’ use of Engineering, Science and Technical hubs,
             there is greater ambiguity and opportunities for potential mispricing in the areas of engineering
             and management services, which can have a material impact on the taxes to be paid by the mining
             company.

             Looking at the recurring OPEX in Table B.7, it is apparent that the areas of risk will be very depen-
             dent upon the commodity being mined. As expected, the majority of OPEX in a bulk mining oper-
             ation (iron ore and coal) will be for the purpose of transportation, with labour and equipment
             operations accounting for a substantial proportion of the remainder. Alternatively, in gold and
             copper mining, supplies and consumables account for a much greater proportion of the annual
             OPEX. As illustrated in Table B.8, when these supplies and consumables are disaggregated, it is
             apparent that it is those components associated with the processing stages of the operation (grind-
             ing media and mill liners, processing agents, and fuel) that are of the greatest magnitude. This
             demonstrates the importance to a tax administration of understanding the degree to which an

             131
                These statistics must be considered with some scepticism, as some operations do not report production statistics,
             and therefore, they have not been included within the statistical analysis.

             operation is vertically integrated, as mispricing on these annual supplies can have a substantial
             impact on government revenues.

             For example, the typical surface copper mining operation is expected to have a daily throughput of
             9,500 tonnes of ore. With an assumed stripping ratio of 4:1, this mine would expect to have annual
             recurrent OPEX (mine and mill activities) of approximately USD88 million, of which approximately
             USD34 million would be spent on supplies and consumables, and approximately USD17 million
             of those supplies and consumables are related to grinding media and mill liners. If this component
             is acquired from a related party through the use of a transfer price that is 10% above the arm’s
             length price, the erosion of government revenue, assuming a 30% tax rate, would be approximately
             USD0.5 million per annum.

             This cost analysis demonstrates the type of information that can be found in Appendix B.3 for the
             typical mining operations on the African continent, and demonstrates the importance for a tax
             administration to understand the characteristics of a mining operation. For example, if a bulk min-
             ing operation is the subject of investigation, then care should be taken to understand the transpor-
             tation and logistical part of the business, as this is where the greatest risk arises from the misuse of
             transfer prices.

             6.3.3  Examples of transfer pricing issues emerging in the context of various commodities

             This section will examine a range of case studies about transfer pricing issues relating to the key
             mineral commodities covered by the study. For each commodity group, the characteristics of which
             are discussed in detail in Appendix B.3, emphasis is placed on the type of products marketed and
             issues relating to their pricing. Case studies were derived from a multiplicity of sources, including
             the direct experiences of the authors, public inquiries and court cases, rigorous research by special-
             ised institutions and preliminary research/investigations carried out by or on behalf of a number
             of NGOs. In the last instance, there is no doubt that issues relating to profit shifting and to the
             potential misuse of transfer pricing have become a matter of public concern, which is manifesting
             itself in very active involvement on the side of civil society.

    In general there is a paucity of court proceedings dealing with transfer pricing issues specific to
    the mining industry. While there is no shortage of allegations of transfer mispricing based on cir-
    cumstantial evidence levelled to various mining MNEs by a variety of NGOs, and some capture
    the attention of tax authorities, few lead to resolution through the courts, with most resulting in
    compromise tax adjustments being negotiated between the mining companies and the tax authori-
    ties, the terms of which are not released in the public arena. This state of affairs makes gathering
    well-documented case studies in the area of transfer pricing a real challenge.

    6.3.3.1  Precious metals: Some gold and Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) examples

    Gold—Given its generally relatively simple metallurgy, gold is generally processed on the mine
    site down to a crude metallic alloy of gold and silver called dore’. Depending on the type of ore
    it originates from, the gold content of a dore’ bar can be as high as about 95%, but it is generally
    lower with a median of 65% gold and 35% silver. As a result, prices for doré bars vary significantly,
    but are generally a function of the various metals content and the refining costs associated with
    separating these metals to meet set standards of purity.

    Doré bars are normally sent to accredited gold refineries, as for instance to the London Bullion
    Market Association (LBMA), for further refining into gold and silver bars of high purity complying
    with international bullion market specifications (e.g., 995 and 999 parts per thousand for gold and
    silver respectively). Refining charges range between $0.50 and $1.50 per gross ounce. Sometimes
    the dore’ is transferred to a related party, often domiciled overseas, which arranges for its refining
    and marketing of the resulting pure gold and silver bars. To the extent that daily bullion prices are
    easily obtainable (e.g., LBMA, LME and Kitko databases) and in the absence of having to make
    excessive adjustments, ascertaining whether these transactions adhere to the arm’s length principle
    should not present insurmountable complexity. Box B.2 describes a typical business structure that
    may be used in the gold mining industry, and how the UN Manual on Transfer Pricing in Develop-
    ing Countries views this arrangement.

    Box B.3 discusses the cross-border dealings that may occur between related parties in the gold min-
    ing sector, using the example of a Southern African country based MNE. Even so, transfer pricing
    issues often arise in the context of ambiguities in the terms of contracts with related marketing
    hubs, as discussed in detail in Part A and exemplified in Box B.4 using a case study relating to gold
    exports presented by a Latin American country representative at an OECD conference held in Paris
    in 2014.

    Platinum Group Metals (PGMs)—The issue of transfer pricing has recently been brought into
    focus in South Africa as it is alleged that it may be affecting the capacity of certain mines to comply
    with the Mining Charter133 for the transformation of the mining sector. This follows the result of an
    in-depth review of the marketing structure of a PGMs’ producer conducted by the South African
    Mining Development Association (SAMDA) which, in its 2014 ‘Submission to the Portfolio Com-
    mittee on Trade and Industry re: Transfer Pricing and Transformation within the Mining Industry’,
    claimed that the shifting of profits due to such practices is affecting and delaying the pace of black
    economic empowerment (BEE) and the Junior Mining Initiative in South Africa. SAMDA alleges
    that the foreign outflows impoverish local mining companies to a point were project commitments
    are scaled back and/or delayed, and the BEE partners in mining companies are deprived of divi-
    dends that would otherwise have been directed towards repaying their loans and other funding
    arrangements. Box B.5 presents the case study submitted by SAMDA to the committee.


    133
       The South African Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) aims, as one of its
    fundamental principles, to empower Historically Disadvantaged South Africans (HDSAs) who were affected by
    Apartheid policies. The combination of Charter and Scorecard provides for the empowerment of HDSAs to be mean-
    ingful, allowing those who meet the definition to benefit from the mineral and petroleum industries.

   Box B.2: Example MNE structure within the gold mining sector

   Let us consider the case of a gold MNE which has implemented a business configuration (Figure f), whereby explora-
   tion, mining and processing entities (EMP) operate in an African territory, and trading, marketing and sales (TMS) are
   executed by a hub elsewhere. Both EMP and TMS act as entrepreneurs, employing locally qualified full-time employee
   equivalents (FTEs) and undertaking/managing major risks. In line with managerial accounting theory they are treated
   as separate profit centres.

                 E                   M                   P             T                 M                  S

       Black: Elsewhere




   To facilitate cost efficiency and economies of scale the MNE made the strategic decision to centralize treasury, insur-
   ance and management activities (i.e., headquarter services) at the level of the trading hub. Under this business model,
   the following primary and secondary activities will take place between EMP and the trading entity:
   Primary transactions:
        •	   Transfer of the processed gold from EMP to the trading entity.
   Secondary transactions provided by the trading entity for the benefit of EMP:
        •	   Headquarter services,
        •	   Intercompany loan arrangement, and
        •	   Provision of insurance services.
   At the time when the processed gold is transferred to the trading company located in Europe, EMP is rewarded
   through the use of CUP using market prices set on the London Metal Exchange. In line with OECD principles the
   trading hub acting as a centralized treasury, captive funder/insurer and management service hub should receive arm’s
   length remuneration from all intercompany service recipients, benefiting from the provision of these services. Such
   intercompany charges may significantly erode the profits reported by the African entities if inappropriately priced. The
   recent introduction of the BEPS action plan discusses such structured approaches and proposes a higher level of
   scrutiny.
   To safeguard developing countries from base erosion the UN Manual on Transfer Pricing in Developing Countries pro-
   poses the introduction of a specified ceiling for these type of intercompany charges. The UN position considers that
   the synergies created by having access to the “source of gold” (a form of Location Specific Advantage (LSA)) justifies
   the African group companies involved in EMP activities to claim an additional margin on top of a ‘cost plus’ price.
   Alternatively, the African group companies would be able to get an intercompany compensation equal to the higher
   CUP references in the market, depending on whether the “market price references” are reflecting the “economic sub-
   stance” and an “equal market proposition” embedded in third parties/exchange prices.

    Box B.3: Linking the mining value chain with non-arm’s length cross-border arrangements:
    Illustration of transactions relative to the mining value chain for a Southern African
    country (SAC)-based gold company (information sourced from the company’s 2013
    annual report)

    Figure g assists with understanding the cross-border dealings between related parties in the context of the mining
    value chain. For ease of interpretation, red indicates a cross-border transaction. The figure starts (on the left) with the
    range of activities conducted in each country. From this information one can deduce that, with the exception of the
    SAC head office company, the subsidiary companies outside SAC look for new properties. New business develop-
    ment is therefore unlikely in SAC and divestment seems to be the strategy. The second part of the chart (i.e., the sec-
    tion relating to the mining value chain) illustrates that the company has capacity across the entire mining value chain,
    which provides for a situation where there is the potential for several cross-border arm’s length and non-arm’s length
    transactions. Inputs at each stage are mostly in the form of capital, services and management, while the outputs are
    mostly product (gold), profit and either interest or dividend payments. The final purpose of the illustration is to flag
    ‘transactions’ within the group that have the potential for profit shifting, especially cross-border. These appear in the
    red box shaded in yellow. This example involves the following cross-border activities:
        •	   Property acquisitions;
        •	   Fees for services and management;
        •	   Capital provision through debt and equity;
        •	   Payment of interest;
        •	   Mine ownership to access product;
        •	   Marketing and sale of product (gold); and
        •	   Dividend payment to shareholders.
    These transactions could then be analysed further to establish the significance of each to the taxpayer’s overall mul-
    tinational business activities by comparative tax analysis of the specific countries involved. Such an exercise would
    then flag the potential for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) for this company.
    This information assists with the:
        •	   Determination of comparability, when traditional transaction methods are appropriate; and/or
        •	   Determination of comparability between enterprises, when pricing methods using profit comparisons are
             appropriate; and/or
        •	   Allocation of the consideration between the enterprises, when a profit split method is applicable.
                                                                                                          Box continues on next page

    Box B.4: Transfer pricing issues arising from gold exported from Latin America
    (Modified from SUNAT, 2014)

    A Latin American mining company (Mining Co.) markets its gold products through a related trading
    company (Trader Co.) domiciled in a tax haven (Figure h). The contractual arrangements between Min-
    ing Co. and Trader Co. are on the basis of a long-term off-take agreement with prices to be determined
    for all shipments taking place each month. Pricing is determined with reference to the London pm fix,
    but the mechanism as how to set within the quotation period is not specified in detail.

                 Box B.4: (continued)

                 Clearly this approach to pricing does not represent a CUP and results in tax leakages. The tax authority
                 has been considering a number of alternative approaches including:
                      •	   Negotiating an advance pricing agreement (APA), for instance to apply the median of the Lon-
                           don pm fix prices for the monthly period or for the price adopted to fall within the first and third
                           quartile. Under these criteria for the month of August 2011, for example an acceptable price
                           would have been US$1765/oz or between US$1677 (Q1) and US$1816/oz (Q3) both of which
                           are significantly higher than the price of US$1623/oz adopted by the company.
                      •	   • The ‘sixth’ method, that is to say adopting the London pm fix price on the day on which the
                           mineral product was loaded ready for shipment. Assuming shipments on 3/8/2011, 18/8/2011
                           and 26/8/2011, the applicable prices would have been US$1669, 1824 and 1788/oz all of
                           which are once again significantly higher than those adopted by the company.
                      •	   The Transactional Net Margin Method was also considered as in Table e.

                                                 Table e: Transactional Net Margin Method

                                                   Gross profit                      123,340

                                                   Operating profit (OP)              62,124

                                                   NCP 5 OP/(COGS 1 OC)              30.07%


                 Analysis of historical results indicate that net profit margins (i.e., operating profit on total cost), which
                 in 2013 were around 30%, ranged over recent times between 20% and 60%, with a median of 40%.



             6.3.3.2  Base metals: Copper products, pricing and case studies

             The transfer or sale of mineral products can take place at various stages of their downstream pro-
             cessing depending upon the commodity. Base metals (e.g., copper, lead, zinc and nickel), depend-
             ing on the degree of downstream processing undertaken at the mine site, are generally exported
             and marketed in or close to metallic form (e.g., blister copper,134 nickel matte,135 copper cathode,136
             nickel pellets, etc.) or as concentrates. Trading in base metal ores is generally very limited and of
             a regional nature. As standard market specifications and daily prices are publically available for a
             diverse range of metallic forms, the closer the mineral product is to refined metal the less complex
             is the determination of an appropriate transfer price, with the degree of complexity increasing as
             an inverse function of the degree of downstream processing undertaken (e.g., from concentrates to
             metallic forms).

                 An unrefined, intermediate product, for which price is a function of copper content and refining cost if further
             refining is required. Copper content is usually about 98% by mass.
             135
                 An unrefined, intermediate product, for which price is a function of nickel content and refining cost. Nickel con-
             tent varies, but is usually in the range of 60–85% by mass.
             136
                 Refined copper, i.e., meets minimum purity requirements and the price is set in the international market.

    As shown in Figure i, a foreign investor (Head Co.) controls two PGMs mines in South Africa through a local subsidiary
    (Holding Co.). This subsidiary holds 70% and 60% equity in each of them with the remainder held by a BEE partner
    (BEE Co.) which purchased shares in the mines. The foreign investor also registered and holds 100% equity in an
    offshore trading company (Trader Co.) to market the commodities from the two mines. BEE Co., however, is not a
    shareholder in Trading Co.
    The minerals produced are priced by international buyers/traders and sellers at a South African harbour on a FOB
    basis, determining their “Spot Export Market Price.”
    Under the influence of the holding Head Co. the mines entered into a marketing agreement to transfer their product to
    the foreign-owned Trading Co. at a 7% discount to the “Spot Export Market Price,” which the Trading Co. claims is
    an appropriate margin for the marketing and trading services rendered. In addition, occasionally Holding Co. derives
    a further margin by selling the commodity to end users at a price higher than the “Spot Market Price.” This market-
    ing arrangement, it is claimed, has had the effect on many instances of leaving the mines with minimal profits, which
    reduced dividends to the BEE Co. and prevented it from repaying the loans it entered into to buy its share of the mines.
    The BEE Co. commissioned an audit of the Trading Co. to assess whether the allocation of income to it was at arm’s
    length. The final audit report revealed that a discount of between 2% and 3% should have been sufficient to cover all
    fixed and variable costs, including a reasonable return associated with the services provided, assets used and the risk
    borne by Trading Co. Implementation of the recommendations of this audit is currently being considered.

             Of the total new copper produced by mines, as shown in Table B.9, concentrates represent the vast
             majority of the products. “Custom” concentrates sold to unrelated smelters/refiners account for
             43% of all copper produced, while “integrated” concentrates transferred to related smelters/refin-
             ers account for around 36%. The latter will be transformed by downstream processing into various
             products (e.g., blister copper, cathode, etc.) and sold into contestable markets.

             Concentrates are partially processed mineral products, for which no standard market specifications
             or regular daily prices are available. They are sold primarily on the basis of long-term (‘frame’)
             smelting and refining contracts between the mines and smelters/refiners, or merchants, but sub-
             ordinately through merchants using spot sales. A discussion about the typical terms of an off-take
             contract for copper concentrate has already been provided in Part A, and an example of an actual
             contract provided in Appendix A.3.

             As already discussed, charges in treatment/smelting and refining (TC/RC) contracts are based on
             formulas that are broadly accepted and practiced in industry. The terms of treatment and refin-
             ing (TC/RC) contracts, which are generally fixed over the life of the contract, include a quotation
             period and a price reference period, which is generally the average of the LME cash settlement
             price over a single month anchored to the time of shipment or arrival. This is known as the MAMA
             (month after the month of arrival) system of payment. Sometimes averaging may be carried out
             over more than one month or options and back pricing may be granted to buyers. Price references
             are normally the LME and the London Bullion Market as quoted in the reference publications (e.g.,
             Platt’s and Metal Bulletin). Contracts also specify the timing of payment and related applicable
             interest.

             An example flow chart of typical copper concentrate sales is provided in Figure B.1, reproduced
             from de Sousa (2010). Under long-established sales contracts to credit-worthy customers (Tier 1),
             all sales are provisionally priced and title passes at the time of shipment. A first provisional pay-
             ment covering the bulk (90%) of the value of the concentrate is effected in transit prior to delivery
             with a second provisional payment covering the balance (10%) after assaying is carried out at the
             smelter. For Tier 2 sales, 100% payment is expected soon after the concentrate leaves port. The final
             price is then adjusted under the MAMA pricing system, based on the London Metal Exchange
             (LME) quoted prices, leading to a final reconciliation.

             Of course, this type of commercial arrangement makes comparability analysis of the transfer of
             concentrates to related parties, in the absence of direct access to sales invoices, somewhat com-
             plex. However, the fact that the price of the metals contained in the concentrates are quoted daily
             in terminal markets like the LME, enables tax authorities to estimate a robust arm’s length price
             approximation using the Net Smelter Return (NSR) formula traditionally applied by the mining
             industry to set concentrates prices. The NSR formula can be used to estimate the price paid by an
             unrelated “customer” smelter/refiner to the miner at various points of delivery, e.g., CIF smelter
             or, by excluding transport and insurance costs incurred to convey the concentrate from the mine
             site to the smelter, FOB port of export or at the mine gate. The NSR includes:

                              and refining agreement. The terms of smelting/refining agreements relating to the main
                              metal components of most common concentrates are pretty much standard throughout the
                              industry. The net smelter payment as a proportion of the value of the contained metal(s)
                              will vary for concentrates of different mineral commodities and within each commodity
                              for different types, grades and metallurgical quality of concentrates. Table B.10 provides
                              some order of magnitude of typical NSRs for various base metals concentrates as a per-
                              centage of the value of the main metal contained in the concentrate. These rates of payment
                              do not include the effect due to the possible presence of credits and penalty metals, which
                              is discussed in detail below.

                              net of their processing charges. As long as the tax authority has been vigilant in terms of
                              validating the chemical assays of concentrate shipments this component should be able to
                              be estimated with a sufficient degree of accuracy. Table B.11 (AusIMM, 2013) provides an
                              indication of the likely payments and processing charges for precious metals commonly
                              found in copper concentrates.

                        metals commonly found in copper concentrates in Table B.12 (AusIMM,2013).

             Box B.6 provides an example of how the arm’s length price for a copper concentrate can be calcu-
             lated. From this example it is clear that tax authorities should have not only a good understanding
             of smelting and refining contracts, but should also monitor the detailed chemical composition of
             various shipments of concentrates.

             The calculation in this example includes a price participation component (PP), which at current
             copper prices would represent a significant proportion of the total smelting and refining charges.
             With recent increases in the price of copper well beyond the neutral US$0.8 to 0.9/lb, many have
             complained that these charges have become unreasonably high and in many instances PP condi-
             tions have been renegotiated or even removed. In the final analysis, the level of TC/RC and the
             applicability and extent of PP conditions are determined by the relative bargaining powers of the
             miners and the smelters/refiners that depend on the availability of good quality concentrates and/
             or tightening smelting capacity respectively.

             Box B.7 discusses the case of a copper-cobalt mine in an African country, where in 2008 the tax
             authority of the host country commissioned a preliminary audit due to concerns over the contin-
             ued low profitability of the mining operations. This case study shows how relatively easy it is to
             raise allegations of transfer pricing abuse, but how difficult it may become to prove them.

    Box B.6: Example of calculation of Net Smelter Return for a copper concentrate

    Table f displays how the Net Smelter Return (NSR) is calculated for a copper concentrate with a grade of 29% Cu
    carrying gold and silver concentrations of 29 and 60 grams per dry metric tonne (g/dmt) respectively given commod-
    ity prices that were current at the time of writing. The concentrate also carries potentially deleterious elements (e.g.,
    arsenic, fluorine, bismuth, lead, zinc and mercury), some of which in concentrations above acceptable thresholds (see
    Table B.12) trigger the application of penalties.
    The calculation is done in stages. First, the Net Smelter Value for the Cu content (NSV(Cu)) is calculated using a
    broadly accepted industry formula which is displayed at the top of Table f. Then the values of credits (C) and penal-
    ties (PN) are calculated using the parameters provided in Tables B.11 and B.12. Finally, the Net Smelter Return at
    the smelter (NSR(SM)) is obtained by adding these to the net value of copper. The Net Smelter Return at the mine
    (NSR(MI)) is then calculated making the assumption that the mine is located 300 Km inland from the port of export and
    that the concentrate must be shipped to an overseas smelter.

    Box B.7: (continued)

    In 2008, concerned at the consistently low levels of profitability and tax paid by copper miners and by MinCo in par-
    ticular, an African tax authority commissioned a consultant to carry out a pilot audit of its operations. The audit report,
    completed in 2010, indicated that anomalously high increases in costs had over recent years occurred at MinCo that
    were hard to justify on the basis of broader industry comparisons. These involved labour, fuel, mining, insurance,
    security and safety, spares, administration and freight costs. The audit also cast some doubts on the appropriateness
    of volumes and transfer prices applicable to transfers of copper to related parties, which did not appear to comply
    with the arm’s length principle as well as on some relevant hedging arrangements. All these transactions it was alleged
    pointed to potentially significant proportions of profits having been shifted from the African country to HeadCo 1’s and
    HeadCo 2’s subsidiaries registered in the low-tax jurisdictions of Bermuda and of the Virgin Islands.
    The auditors also complained about the reluctance of the company to cooperate in the audit and to produce relevant
    documentation in a timely manner and its general quality.
    The report led to ongoing audit and negotiations between MinCo and the tax authority. Through the intervention of a
    group of NGOs, the MinCo case was also brought to the attention of the OECD which indicated that the matters raised
    were relevant to Chapters II and X of the OECD Guidelines and deserved further consideration on a non-­      prejudicial
    basis, offering to facilitate a dialogue between the parties with the aim to reach a mutually acceptable outcome. In an
    ensuing meeting the parties exchanged information and reached some mutual understanding of the issues at hand
    and an undertaking to engage in further dialogue to resolve them. On this basis and conscious of the nonjudicial
    parallel proceedings being undertaken by the tax authority, the OECD recommended that the parties continue their
    constructive exchanges on their own and that the enterprise deepens its future engagement with all stakeholders
    including NGOs.
    The case is interesting in that it emphasises how relatively easy it is to raise allegations of transfer pricing abuse but
    how difficult it may become to prove them. This is in spite of the fact that the government as a shareholder of the
    company would have had access to some relevant information. The case also highlights how difficult it is to get rel-
    evant reliable information involving transactions with parties in foreign jurisdictions unless there is goodwill on the side
    of all parties involved. The MinCo experience would suggest that the best approach is prevention rather than cure.
    This would involve transparent and continuous communication between the mining enterprise and the tax authority,
    with systematic collection and progressive analysis of relevant information leading to the early detection and poten-
    tial prevention of inappropriate transfer pricing practices as well as to a solid basis for the possible establishment of
    safe harbours and/or advance pricing agreements where appropriate. The case also emphasises the importance of
    strengthening the communication and negotiation skills of senior tax administration officers to enhance prevention
    and minimise litigation.



                Potential credit payments and discounts for penalty elements are a function of their respective
                contents in individual concentrate shipments, which makes them difficult to verify and audit. This
                is particularly the case when assessing the NSR of “dirty” concentrates, particularly lead and zinc
                concentrates, which may represent a very low proportion of the value of the main base metals con-
                tained in the concentrates. In some extreme cases, these types of concentrates may not be capable
                of being sold at all to an unrelated party. As a consequence, dirty concentrates are often sold at
                very heavy discounts to, often related, buyers that use them for blending with high-quality concen-
                trates, thus realising some of the value of the metals contained in them.

                Smelters have traditionally paid 85% of the value of contained zinc based on the average LME
                cash settlement price using the MAMA system, but individual contracts may include other dif-
                ficult to audit complex conditions. In the case of lead, payment is typically 95% of the value of
                the metal contained in the concentrate subject to a minimum deduction of 3 units. Tables B.13 and
                B.14 (modified from AusIMM, 2013) provide typical penalty payments for zinc and lead sulphide
                concentrates respectively.

                Eighty-nine percent of the value of the contained metal is payable in the case of nickel sulphide
                concentrates, with penalties applying for elements such as MgO (i.e., US$4/1%) and arsenic (i.e.,
                US$0.72/10 ppm) when in excess of 5% and 200 ppm respectively. Most smelters will not accept
                concentrates with MgO contents in excess of 7% because of the requirement to use very high

             provenance. MgO premiums tend to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, and as a consequence,
             may become more difficult to estimate and audit.

             6.3.3.3  Iron ore products, pricing and case studies

             Iron ore is sold as a number of products ranging from crude crushed and screened hematite-­
             goethite-(limonite) ore, the so-called direct shipping ore (DSO), to beneficiated and blended ore, to
             (mostly magnetite) concentrates, pellets, sinters and briquettes. DSO is further classified physically
             into either lump (i.e., with a size greater than 6.3 mm and less than 31.5 mm) or fines (less than
             6.3 mm).

             In the past, high-grade (>60% Fe) hard lump hematite ore with low levels of impurities was sold
             at a 20% to 30% premium relative to fines of equivalent chemical composition. However, with
             changes in the operation of blast furnaces, this premium has now reduced to less than 10%. Chan-
             nel iron deposits (CIDs) often occurring in the form of small spherical goethite particles called
             pisolites are generally of lower grade (around 54% Fe) but reasonably sought after because of their
             sintering qualities.

             Aside from the iron content, iron ore prices are influenced by the chemical composition of the ore
             in terms of impurities, such as phosphorus (P), which should be below 0.12% and ideally lower
             than 0.08%, aluminium oxide (Al2O3), which should be less than 3.5% and ideally less than 2.5%
             and relatively low contents of silica (SiO2), sulphur (S) and moisture.

             In the past, iron ore has been sold on the basis of yearly supply contracts using benchmark prices
             set by the first successful annual negotiation between a major producer and steel mill, with the
             agreed price generally being accepted for that year by all other major iron ore producers. An active

    spot market has, however, been developing over the past few years and a forward market is also
    now progressively developing.

    Although annual contracts are still common, prices are generally set on the basis of shorter quo-
    tation periods within them (e.g., 3 monthly), and a trend has also been developing to base sales
    on increasingly shorter-term (quarterly or monthly) contracts covering a number of shipments or
    spot sales. Contract prices, expressed as US$/dry metric tonne or per unit of iron, are generally
    set as the mean of the daily spot market prices over the preceding one to three months based on
    a number of price indices which are quoted daily. Indices for ores of standard specifications (e.g.,
    Platt’s IONEX or the Metal Bulletin’s MBIOI index) have been developed for a variety of iron ore
    fines with Fe grades ranging between 58% and 65% Fe and with specified normalised levels of
    P2O5, Al2O3, SiO2, S and other impurities, delivered on a CFR basis to main Chinese destinations
    (e.g., Tianjin or Qingdao). Increasingly prices are being stabilized by the use of over-the-counter
    iron ore swaps.

    To the extent that the ore sold or transferred may be of a different iron grade from that of the indices
    used, proportional price adjustments are made on the basis of differences in the contained unit of
    iron per dry metric tonne. Databases containing most of the necessary information relating to iron
    ore and other bulk commodities relevant to the African context are readily available (e.g., Platt and
    Metal Bulletin), albeit at a price.

    Determination of an appropriate TP to cover the transfer of iron ore to a related steel mill is rela-
    tively simple if the iron ore producer is also selling iron ore directly to other unrelated steel mills,
    as shown in Box B.8. The price obtained on these open market sales for essentially ore of equal
    quality provides an excellent and defensible range of internal comparables within which to place
    the needed TP, after making comparability adjustments for possible differences in sea freight and




      Box B.8: Example of use of internal comparables to set the transfer price for iron ore

      Mining Company A transfers crushed and screened iron ore to an overseas related Steel Mill Co. B,
      which is part of the same NME group. It also sells identical iron ore under contract to an unrelated Steel
      Mill Co. C and spot to an unrelated Steel Mill Co. D in the same or different overseas countries (see
      Figure k). The prices realized in the arm’s length sale of iron ore to the unrelated steel mills represent a
      very good basis from which to derive a reliable internal CUP, subject to adjustments.
      If the terms of the transfer and the sales are essentially the same (say a series of deliveries on a cost
      and freight (CFR) basis over the same contract time interval), adjustments would primarily relate to dif-
      ferences in the:
           •	   Sea freight related charges,
           •	   Shipping distance, and
           •	   Insurance costs if applicable.
      If the contract time interval is different and/or some of the sales are spot then a need will also arise to
      adjust for price changes over the different times of delivery. This may create a range of possible CUPs,
      and criteria must be established as to where within this range should an appropriate transfer price be
      selected. A possible approach is to make use of the median spot price over the period in question or
      allowing a price to be set within, for instance the inter-quartile range.
      If, for example, the reference period were the three months between June and September 2012, during
      which the iron ore price suffered significant falls (see Figure l), an acceptable transfer price for iron ore
      conforming to Platt’s IODEX specifications could have been US$113/t if using the median or a price
      between US$102/t and US$124/t if using the inter-quartile safe harbour method.
                                                                                             Box continues on next page

             insurance costs due to the different location of the related steel mill relative to the unrelated one(s).
             While sea freight services are invariably offered by unrelated third parties, insurance services, as
             already discussed, may be captive.

             The situation would be more complex if the producer transferred all of its iron ore to a related mar-
             keting hub or, less frequently, to a related steel mill. As discussed in Part A, use of marketing hubs
             to handle iron ore sales has become widespread, as is the case for Australian producers, which have
             established significant marketing hubs in Singapore to be closer to customers and shipping facili-
             ties, and to take advantage of specially negotiated tax incentives.

               In the absence of a sale to a third party in a contestable market, a robust arm’s length price approxi-
               mation can be estimated by adjusting an appropriate price index (e.g., the MBIOI—58% CFR
               Qingdao) applicable over the quotation period proportionally for any difference in iron grade, and
               by applying penalty discounts if any of the undesirable elements exceeds standard limits. This
               process is illustrated in Box B.9, which estimates an arm’s length price approximation for iron ore
               fines with a grade of 57% Fe (i.e., 1% below the 58% Fe of the index) and levels of P at 0.12% and
               Al2O3 at 4%, which are on the high side of their respective allowable levels of <= 0.08% and <= 3%
               respectively. These discounts are consistent with those set in the example of a typical spot sales
               contract provided in Part A.

               Sometimes impurities in iron ore and in base metal concentrates exceed the maximum allowable
               ranges and may render the concentrate unsellable, or sellable at very high discounts, often only
               to related users, who can realise the value of their key metal content by blending the ‘dirty’ con-
               centrate with better quality material of different origin. Determining whether the level of quality
               discount applied complies with the arm’s length principle may then become very challenging if the
               blending occurs after transfer to an overseas related party. Of course, no such problem arises if the
               miner carries out blending of substandard ore/concentrates as part of their domestic operations
               upstream of their being loaded on a ship for export.

               As well as showing an arm’s length price approximation CFR Qingdao, Box B.9 also displays the
               equivalent iron ore price FOB the port of export (in this example Port Hedland, Western Australia).
               This, incidentally, when converted to Australian dollars, is the ‘royalty value’ base on which a 7.5%
               ad valorem mineral royalty is levied by the Government of Western Australia. Of course, state min-
               eral royalties, which are based on revenue after allowing for a relatively limited number of generally
               easy to audit deductions, are exposed to a much lower risk than the corresponding corporate income

                 Box B.10: Extract from the Iron Ore (Hamersley Range) Agreement Act, 1963

                 It is remarkable that the following definition of the term “f.o.b. value” is a 1990 amendment of this Act
                 that was drafted over 51 years ago, i.e., 46 years before the establishment of marketing hubs in Singa-
                 pore, at a time when iron ore was marketed on the basis of annual benchmark prices being negotiated
                 with the steel mills by one of the major suppliers and then adopted by all the others and long before
                 transfer pricing started to emerge as a serious global taxation issue.
                 “f.o.b. value” means—
                      in the case of iron ore shipped and sold by the Company, the price which is payable for the iron
                 (i)  
                      ore by the purchaser thereof to the Company or an associated company or, where the Minister
                      considers, following advice from the appropriate Government department, that the price payable in
                      respect of the iron ore does not represent a fair and reasonable market value for that type of iron ore
                      assessed at an arm’s length basis, such amount as is agreed or determined as representing such a
                      fair and reasonable market value, less all export duties and export taxes payable to the Common-
                      wealth on the export of the iron ore and all costs and charges properly incurred and payable by the
                      Company from the time the iron ore shall be placed on ship at the Company’s wharf to the time the
                      same is delivered and accepted by the purchaser including:

                 time prevailing . . . ,” any opportunity for mispricing of iron ore is severely restricted in the context of
                 mineral royalties.
                 Furthermore these conditions imply that the royalty-collecting authority should be given ready access
                 to the related sales invoices and that, failing this, the f.o.b. value may be determined by other means.



             tax, even though minerals may have been transferred to a related marketing subsidiary of a MNE,
             and only subsequently sold by it to a third party. Risk to royalty revenue may be lowered by drafting
             the related development agreements clearly in terms of how the ‘FOB value’, to which the royalty
             rate is applied, is defined in terms of the revenue realised through the first arm’s length sale to an
             unrelated third party, either by the mining company or by an associated company, less specified
             allowable deductions. The contractual obligation placed on the mining company and by reflection
             on its MNE parent help circumvent the difficulty in obtaining information about sales conducted
             by related marketing hubs in foreign jurisdictions, which may not be obtainable when enforcing the
             powers under domestic tax laws in the absence of a relevant exchange of information (EOI) agree-
             ment. Box B.10 provides an example of the ‘FOB value’ definition contained in the State Agreement
             Act covering the development of one of the first large Western Australian iron ore projects.

             Alternatively, as in the case of a major iron ore mine (see Box B.11) located in West Africa, related
             parties that buy its iron ore may also have under the terms of their off-take contracts the right to
             market that iron ore to third parties and to charge a substantial fee for their marketing services.

    Box B.11: Large West African iron ore mine

    MinCo is a large-scale iron ore open pit mining, railing and port operation located in a West African country. Although
    production from this world-class resource has been recently suspended because of low iron ore prices, the project has
    commissioned capacity of around 20 Mt of ore per annum including direct shipping ore with a grade of 57.7% iron,
    low silica but relatively high Al2O3 and moisture.
    A study conducted by Dan Watch (Dieckmannn, 2011)a has raised doubts about the amount of taxes paid by and
    the transfer pricing practices of MinCo and related companies. Figure n shows how its operating mining (MinCo) and
    railing/port (Rail/portCo) companies are held by conduit companies, primarily owned by HeadCo all registered in
    Bermuda. HeadCo in turn is owned by various companies largely under the control of an individual entrepreneur who
    is credited with having facilitated the establishment and funding of this mining project. The major Asian steel group
    (AsiaCo 1) also holds 25% equity in both of the operating companies, with the local government holding 10% equity
    in the Rail/portCo only. By being a major shareholder in HeadCo, another major related Asian railway and materials
    company (AsiaCo 2) has also a significant indirect ownership in MinCo’s operations and is classified as a related entity.

    HeadCo’s report for the first half of 2014 shows a significant number of related party transactions having taken place
    particularly in the area of:
        •	   Iron ore sales prices—AsiaCo 1, AsiaCo 2 and HeadCo and others have off-take agreements for signifi-
             cant annual tonnages of iron ore, which in fact the mine has been unable to fully satisfy resulting in multi-
             million-dollars liquidated damages for breach of warranties. Of the 8.9 wet Mt of ore sold in the first half of
             2014, 48% went to AsiaCo 1 and 24.0% to AsiaCo 2, with the rest sold to other parties. Sales were priced
             with reference to the Platts’ 58% IODEX Index subject to impurities and other customers’ discounts. The
             AsiaCo 1’s off-take agreement includes an investors’ discounts over the life of the mine ranging between
             0% and 15% as a function of iron ore prices, as shown in Table g. As this and some of the other customers’
             discounts are in addition to the normal industry discounts for low grade and high alumina (about $9/t) and
             of up to $5/t in de-sliming costs (soon to be carried out at the mine site) and do not include a premium for
                                                                                                          Box continues on next page

            low silica, the relevant sales prices do not strictly comply with the arm’s length principle. AsiaCo 1’s ‘most
            favoured treatment’ reflects the critical foundation contribution they made to the development of the project
            including the 2012 commitment to purchasing 25% equity in it for $1.5 billion. Over the first 6 months of 2014
            customers’ discounts other than for impurities and processing charges ($93.7M) were around $17M reducing
            the company’s income taxable and mineral royalties payable to the local government. It is fair to say, how-
            ever, that HeadCo has been trying to renegotiate to reduce or ideally eliminate these discounts.

       •	   Sales agency—Both AsiaCo 2 and HeadCo are also sales agents, with the former under the terms of a
            20-year agreement. An annual marketing commission of $39.0M was paid to AsiaCo 2 in 2014 in line with
            sales expected to take place over the year. From the HeadCo’s financial report it would appear that they will
            remit to MinCo 98% of sales proceeds. This presumably amounts to a marketing fee equivalent to 2% of the
            value of sales.
       •	   Supply of plant and equipment—AsiaCo 2 is the preferred supplier of plant and equipment and other facilities
            for the construction and maintenance of the mine and railing/port system amounting to date to in excess of
            $100M and, as discussed below, has also been the provider of relevant tied debt funding for their acquisition.
       •	   Provision of debt finance—Total debt drawn down as of 30, June 2014 stood at $819.5 million and included:
            •	   $400M of convertible bonds with a coupon rate of 8.5% and an effective rate of 12.62%. These bonds
                 were issued at the parent company’s level with AsiaCo 2 contributing $50M,
            •	   $208.3M in pre-export finance facilities at an interest of LIBOR plus 5.5% (effective rate 8.35%) with
                 monthly repayments of $10.4M. The report does not specify who the lender of these funds is,
            •	   $120.3M in equipment finance facilities with an interest of LIBOR plus 5.5% (effective rate 8.35%), 5.59%
                 (7.23%) and 6.0% (7.33%) provided by AsiaCo 2 and secured by HeadCo,
            •	   $53.3M in a financier shareholders’ loan at a rate of 2% (effective 8.35%) provided by AsiaCo 1. A gain
                 of $4.4M was recognised at inception because of the favourable rate.
            •	   $37.6M as a cost overrun finance at a rate of LIBOR plus 8% to 9% (effective 13.92%) provided by a
                 HeadCo’s finance subsidiary and guaranteed by HeadCo.
   In all cases it will be difficult for the tax authority to relate the borrowing costs at the level of the operating com-
   panies to those incurred at the consolidated level and by the related financing entities and whether deductions in
   excess of costs actually incurred are claimed. It may also be debatable whether fees incurred for the provision of
   loan guarantees by HoldCo have in fact displaced financial risk at the consolidated level and represent legitimate
   deductions.
       •	   Corporate strategic and support services provided by HeadCo on a $2.17 cost per tonne basis.
   This case study clearly displays a corporate/business structure which achieves the aim of shifting a potentially sub-
   stantial proportion of profits from the host country to lower-tax jurisdictions, thus lowering the overall tax bill at the
   consolidated level and creating an incentive to invest and bear significant risk in the host country. However, corrobo-
   rating the allegations of transfer mispricing raised by Dan Watch (Dieckmann, 2011) would require an in-depth audit


                                                                                                      Box continues on next page

    supported by detailed cross-border information, much of which may not be available to the tax authorities of the host
    country. The case raises the interesting issue of whether or to what a degree customers’ discounts negotiated in the
    context of long-term offtake agreements make the applicable prices inconsistent with the arm’s length principle. In
    the context one may argue that these discounts compensate the buyer for other benefits conveyed to the iron ore
    producer such as availability of significant equity and debt funds and a secure market for its products, particularly in
    the early sensitive years following commissioning of the mine. The company would probably argue with a degree of
    legitimacy that the project would unlikely have been developed without attracting foundation shareholders such as
    AsiaCo 1 and 2. Thus at the macro scale the issue boils down to a strategic decision on the side of the host country
    government as to what a fair split of profits should be under the circumstances.
    The case is also interesting in so far that the main related parties are largely owned by a sovereign state which plays
    a wide range of functions, e.g., buyer and marketeer for the commodity, shareholder, banker, procurer, supplier and
    possibly manufacturer of some of the plant and equipment employed.
    While the project appears to have an adequate level of equity in its funding structure, the tax authority of the host
    country should satisfy itself that the risk premia added to LIBOR in its debt facilities are justifiable and that the secu-
    ritisation charges by the parent HeadCo are warranted.
    Questions should also be asked as to the realism of the offtake contract tonnages in the early stages of the project
    which have been leading to large amounts of liquidated damages and the appropriateness of charging for marketing
    and corporate support and strategic services as either a significant fixed amount or as a function of tonnages rather
    than on a cost plus basis.

                  6.3.3.4  Coal products, pricing and case studies

                  The classification of various types of coal is primarily a function of their carbon/energy and mois-
                  ture contents. The International Coal Classification of the Economic Commission for Europe (UN/
                  ECE) recognises two broad categories of coal, which in order of increasing diagenesis are:

                        ■■   Brown coal, including peat, lignite and sub-bituminous coal mainly used domestically in
                             power generation, and
                        ■■   Hard coal, including mainly bituminous coal and subordinately anthracite, for thermal
                             (steam coal) and metallurgical (coking coal) used in the iron and steel industry.

                  Details of the characteristics of each type of coal are provided by the International Energy Agency
                  (IEA)137 as follows:

                        ■■   Peat: Combustible soft, porous or compressed, fossil sedimentary deposit of plant origin
                             with high water content (up to 90 per cent in the raw state), easily cut, of light to dark
                             brown colour. Used primarily on a low scale domestically and next to the pits.
                        ■■   Lignite: Lignite is brownish-black in colour and has a carbon content of around 25–35%, a
                             high inherent moisture content sometimes as high as 66%, and greater than 31% volatile
                             matter on a dry mineral matter free basis. Its ash content ranges from 6% to 19% compared
                             with 6% to 12% for bituminous coal. This non-agglomerating coal has a Gross Calorific

                          Value (GCV) of less than 17,435 kJ/kg138 (4,165 kcal/kg) and greater than 31% volatile
                          matter on a dry mineral matter free basis. This category includes oil shale and tar sands
                          produced and combusted directly or used as inputs for other transformation processes.
                     ■■   Sub-bituminous coal: Defined as non-agglomerating coals with a GCV between 4,165 kcal/
                          kg (17.4 GJ/t) and 5,700 kcal/kg (23.9 GJ/t 20857) containing more than 31 per cent volatile
                          matter on a dry mineral matter free basis.
                     ■■   Bituminous coal: Bituminous coal is used for steam raising and space heating purposes
                          and includes all bituminous coal that is not included under coking coal. It is usually more
                          than 10% volatile matter and relatively high carbon content (less than 90% fixed carbon).
                          Its GCV is greater than 23,865 kJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis. Mostly
                          used as thermal coal, but when its quality allows the production of a coke suitable to sup-
                          port a blast furnace charge it may be used as coking coal.
                     ■■   Anthracite: A high-rank coal used for industrial and residential applications. It is generally
                          less than 10% volatile matter and a high carbon content (about 90% fixed carbon). Its GCV
                          is greater than 23,865 kJ/kg (5,700 kcal/kg) on an ash-free but moist basis.

             Beneficiation is essential for export-quality coal, and most coals in Africa require coal washing
             and processing facilities. Coal preparation for market readiness is essential because of inherent
             impurities like ash content, as coals for metallurgical or coking use rely on very low ash content.
             Beneficiation also causes coal to change its form, which is problematic from an accounting and
             price calculation perspective. Examples are the conversion of coal into heat, electricity, liquid fuel
             (CTL—a process referred to as coal liquefaction), and gas (e.g., underground coal gasification—
             UCG). However, most of these applications of low-quality coal tend to be within a single country
             and as a result tax leakages are minimised, as the relevant tax administration generally has access
             to detailed financial information about both the producer and the user of the coal, both of which
             would have had to submit tax returns.

             Coal is readily available from a wide variety of sources in a well-supplied worldwide market.
             Coal is transported to the market in bulk—by trucks and rail (local market) and by ship (interna-
             tional markets). Most coal, and essentially all low quality coal, is used in the country in which it is
             produced, with the large number of suppliers contributing to an active international coal market,
             ensuring that the market is competitive and efficient. Because of bulk transport over sometimes
             very long distances, transportation costs account for a large share of the total delivered price of coal.

             The transfer or sale of coal products can take place at various downstream stages of processing,
             depending upon the commodity and the market. Mines generally produce specific products (in
             terms of quantity, quality and size) depending on customer requirements. Typically, quantity and
             fragment size are important for power station coal, while for thermal (and export), quality is more
             important. Thermal coal therefore requires more processing and fetches higher prices. Depending
             on the yield factor and the quality of the raw coal, processing of coal may result in significant quan-
             tities of low-quality coal—typically between 30% to 50% of ROM coal ends up in waste material
             dumps. The typical quality parameters include calorific value, ash composition, volatile matter,
             moisture content, fixed carbon, sulphur and other impurity contents. Revenue and cost calcula-
             tions for coal transactions can become very complex for specific markets when quality require-
             ments and penalties for impurities are factored in.139 Because the market for a diverse range of coal

               products is remote from the operations (often extending into the international market), there are
               significant TP considerations for coal transactions along the value chain.

               Figure B.2 illustrates the scale of coal and coal product exports in South Africa. Coal exports
               (including its downstream products) amounted to about US$5.5 billion (16%) of South African
               export value in 2013, which have several transfer pricing and cost implications because of the
               geography and range of products. When coal consumed by ESKOM for electricity generation, by
               SASOL for the manufacturing of synthetic fuels and chemicals for the local market, and coal for
               domestic consumption in the industrial sector (iron and steel industry) are added to exports, one
               starts to comprehend the scale of the industry. As a consequence, insignificant mispricing and
               cost manipulation can lead to significant erosion of the tax base. From this explanation it follows
               that there is potential for BEPS, and a company-developed TP policy for approval by the revenue
               authorities is essential for setting and verifying prices for coal and its beneficiated market products.

               The case study in Figure B.3 is a relatively simple case illustrating the implications for a large,
               vertically integrated multi-commodity group based in South Africa. Beneficiation of coal is only
               to the processing stage, which suggests that coal is sold to both ESKOM and the domestic metal-
               lurgical market. The company also ‘imports’ coal from its international subsidiaries. Ownership of
               international subsidiaries inevitably results in cross-border activities for all commodity divisions.
               Figure B.3 further demonstrates the extent to which the company is vertically integrated along its
               value chain.

               In summary, the potential TP issues for this company are:

                   ■■   Pricing of metallurgical coal to its ferrous smelting subsidiaries;
                   ■■   Pricing of export coal;
                   ■■   Pricing of coal imports from its international subsidiaries;
                   ■■   Establishing component of transport costs to price—for both domestic and export coal;
                   ■■   Pricing of business development services rendered to international subsidiaries;
                   ■■   Acquisition cost of, and ownership stakes in, new properties in its international portfolio
                        of assets;

    Box B.12: Ore producers: A coal mining example

    A MNE operating in the coal industry has implemented a centralized business configuration, whereby the trading
    company located in a European jurisdiction acts as the principal. In this respect, the trading entity claims have in place
    the significant people functions as well as the required equity buffer to manage all major risks. Marketing and sales
    entities represent the MNE’s revenues centres while exploration, mining and processing entities act as cost centres.
    Under this business configuration, the African operations are integrated only to the mining stage including crushing
    and screening of the ore and initial beneficiation. Afterwards the ore is transferred to a processing entity located in
    Eastern Europe, which subsequently transfers it to a centralized trading company.
    Under this fully centralized business structure, all important decisions, business plans, policy settings/strategy on
    exploration, mining, R&D activities and marketing are all defined and controlled by one single entity, i.e., the trading
    entity. Stripped of their main risks and assets, the exploration and mining entities are being regarded as performing
    routine services and are compensated with a limited markup on top of their costs. In effect their role has been con-
    strained to that of a mining contractor. The sustainability of such business models has lately received a lot of criticism,
    through the OECD initiative on BEPS. In essence, the recent action plan on BEPS is waving a red flag for such busi-
    ness structures indicating that there might be concerns regarding substance requirements.
    An allocation of the relevant headcounts under each significant function, i.e., exploration, mining, R&D, processing,
    marketing and sales, may be legitimately requested by local tax authorities to assess whether the substance require-
    ments of the trading company are being met.
    The UN position could warrant that the location saving and synergies of having access to the ‘source of coal’ justify
    the African group companies involved in the E/M activities to claim a premium on top of what otherwise would be a
    typical ‘cost plus’ price generally involving a margin of the order of 5% above fully loaded cost. The magnitude of this
    additional uplift to take into account relevant location savings and synergies would be determined through a process
    of negotiation between the parties as if they were independent entrepreneurs dealing at arm’s length.

                6.3.3.5  Diamonds and other gemstones

                While diamonds and gemstones in general are mined primarily for their rarity and beauty, lower
                quality diamonds and some other hard non-gem-quality minerals also have significant industrial
                applications. There are many (at least a hundred) recognised gemstones, which are cut and pol-
                ished from naturally occurring crystals because of their hardness, scratch resistance and above all
                considerable beauty. Value is based on size, rarity and appeal.

                Africa is a significant and known source of diamonds, but its coloured gemstones are becoming
                increasingly important. Gemstones occur in many countries throughout the continent, with sig-
                nificant diamond finds being regularly recorded. This report is primarily concerned with the pro-
                duction of diamonds because of its status as the gemstone of choice and its important industrial

                 Box B.13: Transfer pricing for rough pink diamonds

                 The determination of a royalty value for pink diamonds in Western Australia provides an extreme exam-
                 ple of the complexity of determining whether the transfer prices proposed by a royalty-payer are realis-
                 tic in the absence of an arm’s length price set in a contestable market. The Argyle mine produces major
                 quantities of white, mainly industrial-quality diamonds, but also a commercially significant quantity of
                 very rare, hence very valuable, gem-quality pink diamonds.
                 Non-pink diamonds are exported and marketed in sorted batches in a contestable market in Antwerp
                 largely at arm’s length.
                 By contrast, the entire production of pink diamonds is transferred to, and processed domestically and
                 overseas by, related “cut and polish” divisions of the same MNE that owns the mine, then sold as fin-
                 ished gemstones in a variety of specialized international markets. A viable approach for government
                 to reflect market prices for pink diamonds transfers was to appoint a government diamond valuator
                 (GDV) to physically inspect and value the rough pink diamonds produced in each period. Although the
                 company provided their valuations, they were reluctant to disclose the sales value realised in their over-
                 seas tender of finished cut and polished stones. The GDV assessed rough values by imputing specific
                 costs and margins obtained through market intelligence to various downstream processes. Valuations
                 involved, besides consideration of expected yields, complex judgment and classification of the rough
                 stones in line with common GSA valuation criteria in terms of size, depth of colour, and crystallographic
                 and other hard-to-assess qualities. Needless to say that initially the company’s and GDV’s values were
                 at variance often significantly so. Because of the very limited marketing information provided by the
                 company, the responsible minister used his power under the relevant legislation to deem the values
                 obtained by the GDV to be the appropriate base on which to levy royalties, which the company reluc-
                 tantly adhered to pay. The situation improved significantly after the government and company agreed
                 to construct a reference physical standard of rough pink diamonds of different quality and relative value
                 to assist sorting of future production batches for valuation. The process of cutting and polishing high-
                 quality tender stones now also includes tracing of individual batches of rough pink diamonds.
                 Prior to the departure of the government diamond valuator, a mutually agreeable valuation matrix was
                 created by the outgoing valuator and the Argyle mine. Pink transfers to Argyle’s cutting and polishing
                 facilities have since been valued for royalty purposes using this valuation matrix. The original valua-
                 tion matrix has subsequently been adjusted as a result of reviews into Argyle’s pink business to better
                 define the relationships between pink rough transfer prices and cut and polished sales. Agreements
                 between Argyle and government have also resulted in progressive adjustments to transfer prices within
                 the matrix to reflect movements in cut and polished sales and related margins.




             use. Diamond production has traditionally not been vertically integrated and as a consequence
             most transactions involve the sale of ‘rough’ diamonds. There are, however, cases where produc-
             ers transfer rough diamonds to related cut and polish entities and subsequently to their marketing
             arm. This is particularly the case for unique types of stones, as for instance pink diamonds, which
             are discussed in Box B.13. Apart from security and insurance, transportation is not an issue with
             gemstones because of their high-value and low-volume nature.

             Natural diamonds are among the world’s most precious natural resources, as extremely successful
             marketing campaigns, such as that based on the De Beers-coined slogan of A Diamond Is Forever,
             have made them by far the favourite gemstone for consumers. In 2013, reported diamond pro-
             duction amounted to 130 million carats of rough diamonds valued at USD 14 billion. Large-scale
             diamond production is becoming increasingly challenging as mining moves towards deeper, less
             profitable and more remotely located resources.

             Market entry barriers range from very low for the widespread alluvial deposits to very high due
             to capital and technological barriers to entry for some operations such as off-shore and deep kim-
             berlite deposits. As a consequence, there is a variety of different diamond producers in Africa,
             including a few dominant producers and a multiple of small firms as well as artisanal producers.

    Recent increases in production reflect growing demand from India and in particular China, which
    is now the world’s second largest consumer of diamond jewellery after the US, with demand grow-
    ing 18% in 2011.140

    Most mine sales are in the form of rough (unpolished) diamonds. Because of its low-­ volume high-
    value status, a diamond is easy to transport, making it susceptible to informal trade (even smug-
    gling connected to a black market) across national boundaries to markets, escaping the tax regime
    of the host country. Once mined, the rough stones move through the value chain, similar to that of
    other commodities. There is a very strong link between mining and marketing for diamonds, per-
    haps more than for most other mineral commodities. Changing preferences in consumer demand
    cause dealers, cutters, polishers, jewellery manufacturers and retail stores to respond quickly to
    new trends and fashions. The world value-added on diamonds is significant as diamonds move
    along the value chain. About 60% of value is added from rough to cut and polished diamonds, with
    a further 200% (or more) added by jewellery manufacturing and retailing.

    Although there has been an improvement in market transparency, the price of the vast majority of
    gemstones is generally not set in highly transparent terminal markets, but frequently, as in the case
    of rough diamonds, through tenders by invitation in a limited number of traditional and new mar-
    keting centres. The price achieved generally reflects the degree to which the mineral products sat-
    isfy their individual users’ specifications, thus creating value-in-use. In many cases marketing may
    add significant, often hard to verify, value. Wholesale diamond sales are conducted in a number
    of major trading centres (e.g., South Africa, Belgium, Dubai, Israel, etc.) with India currently estab-
    lishing a special trading zone to accelerate development of its already significant diamond trading
    sector. Selling is by means of tenders to which, in most cases, buyers (called sight holders in South
    Africa) attend by invitation and tend to transact at or close to the tender prices recommended by
    the major producers/sellers that, in some cases, hold oligopolistic power. The assortments offered
    for sale are generally combined and valued by the producers/sellers, and checked for consistency
    with standards and certified by the relevant government diamond valuator before they are sealed
    and exported.

    The major diamond mining companies in Africa are vertically integrated to a large degree from
    exploration through mine development to the market, which poses transfer pricing risks because
    of first, the specialised valuation skills that are required for rough diamond valuations, and second,
    the wide range in the pricing structure per carat. Because of often significant differences in specifi-
    cations and value-in-use, pricing tends to vary widely for essentially similar products. These prices
    are generally kept confidential in an endeavour to protect proprietary processes and valuable mar-
    keting niches. Needless to say, the specialised nature of some of these markets and the absence or
    paucity of relevant databases creates difficult auditing challenges. Among gemstones, diamonds
    represent a major challenge for tax authorities, because of their enormous variations in the quality
    of individual stones that makes them hard to value, and the financial significance and oligopolistic
    nature of the related market.

    To the extent that secondary sales of rough gem-quality diamonds are subordinate and a system-
    atic record of the prices realised is not readily available, it is problematic to determine what an
    appropriate arm’s length price should be for this commodity. It is fair to say that diamond produc-
    ers have invested heavily and have been very successful in creating a cultural perception that this
    commodity, with essentially little intrinsic value, denotes high luxury and prestige for the wearer
    and symbolises love pledges that will last “forever.” Appropriately incorporating this ostensibly
    high intangible value into diamond prices is patently difficult and, in the presence of sustained
    retail demand for diamond jewellery, this task tends to be dominated by the main producers/
    sellers.

             The per-carat value of a diamond could increase as much as eightfold from the mine to the retail
             sale of diamond jewellery. As illustrated in Figure B.4, on average, from every 5 carats of rough
             diamonds mined, 2.3 carats are classified as industrial and the remaining 2.7 carats as gem quality.
             Of the latter, 1.7 carats will be lost in the cutting and polishing process, yielding on average one
             carat of cut and polished jewellery.

             The total value of rough diamonds averages around USD120/crt, with industrial-quality diamonds
             generally valued in the range of USD10 to 20 per crt, while gem-quality rough averages USD200/
             crt. In spite of initial modern mechanical sorting, manual sorting/classification involving a signifi-
             cant degree of subjective judgement still represents a major component in the creation of the assort-
             ments to be exported and marketed. Individual gem-quality diamonds are classified according to
             a number of criteria provided, among others, by the Gemmological Institute of America (GIA),
             including crystalline structure (e.g., stone, shapes, cleavages, macles and flats) that affects the yield
             (from 50% down to 25%) and rough weight, colour and clarity, which in combination allows the
             valuator to place them in a price matrix (e.g., the Rapaport diamond price list or, in the case of De
             Beers’ Diamond Trading Company (DTC), its own “Price Book”) and derive from this matrix the
             rough price per carat. Box B.14, modified from the Diamond Buying Guide produced by Info Dia-
             mond, provides an example of how to determine the purchase price for a rough diamond once it
             has been classified according to GIA criteria.

             Because of the specialised nature of the classification process, of the large number of valuation
             criteria, and consequently, of possible quality combinations (thousands), there can be significant
             differences from valuator to valuator. This makes the job of a government diamond valuator very
             difficult, in checking whether the assortment of diamonds for export conforms to approved stan-
             dards and are appropriately valued.

             The complexity and opacity of the process, the difficulty of some governments to secure the services
             of competent specialised valuators, and the general lack of adequately disaggregated volume and
             value information for diamonds exported and imported by individual companies makes detailed
             analysis almost impossible. However, following the reporting requirements in relation to the
             Kimberley Process Certification System (KPCS), designed to stem the trade in conflict diamonds,
             analysis of aggregated export/import figures and their trends has become possible for individual
             countries. Not surprisingly, this has led to many allegations raised by civil society organisations
             of mispricing of rough diamonds exported and/or imported by key African producing countries,
             such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (See the Africa Canada Alliance’s 2014 case study

    presented in Box B.15) and South Africa (See the Leverhulme Centre for the Study of Value’s 2014
    case study presented in Box B.16). As usual, it is generally easy for some of the NGOs to raise con-
    cerns about possible transfer mispricing but extremely difficult for the relevant tax authorities to
    follow these up with irrefutable analysis and evidence that would prove them valid.

    The South African situation, based on a comprehensive analysis conducted by Braking and Sha-
    rife (2014)141 and described in Box B.16, is somewhat different from the Congolese case study, in
    that over the timespan since KP statistics have become available in 2007, South Africa has been
    importing significant amounts, by value, of rough diamonds, as well as exporting large amounts
    by volume. In some cases these volumes significantly exceed domestic production, but at a much
    lower unit value.

    The valuation of rare and fancy coloured (yellow, pink and blue) rough diamonds is particularly
    challenging for both industry and tax authorities, as the value of the related jewellery stones can
    be very volatile because they are the subject of intensive and specific marketing/advertising

                 Box B.15: Congolese exports of rough diamonds to Dubai

                 Questions about mispricing were raised on the basis of the large and increasing margins realised
                 between the prices of rough diamonds imported from the DRC into Dubai, and the corresponding
                 export prices now exceeding 40%. Such a margin appears excessive relative to the value added in
                 Dubai, which is claimed to be mainly derived from re-sorting the bundles, in some cases after “boiling”
                 the diamonds, i.e., deoxidising them in sulphuric acid to significantly improve their appearance, and
                 also mixing them with diamonds of other provenance, thus increasing their gem to industrial ratio and
                 value prior to their export primarily to India with new KP certificates of mixed origin issued in Dubai.
                 Dubai is rapidly developing as a tax-free, diamond trading centre, now ranking third in the world,
                 which in 2013 handled $12.4 billion worth of rough diamonds. Critics argue that this may only happen
                 because diamonds leaving the DRC (currently the second largest world producer by volume but 10th in
                 value terms) are consistently undervalued due to the inability and/or incapacity of the local government
                 valuators at the Centre d’Evaluation, d’Espertise et de Certification (CEEC) to keep up with the large
                 levels of exports contesting their valuations. This, it is claimed, results in significant reductions in the
                 related corporate income tax and 3.75% export duty collected in the DRC. Some of the value-added
                 also stems from the discounted purchase of rough diamonds from legal but objectionable sources
                 where the parcels are re-valued, mixed with other shipments and exported with no tax consequences.
                 Interestingly some Congolese government officers have indicated (Personal communication, 2014) that
                 these high margins are only realised on exports to Dubai and not to assortments shipped to Belgium
                 or Israel where margins are in the 5% to 8% range. It is easy to understand how, aside from possible
                 transfer mispricing, the 50-year tax holiday provided in Dubai’s Free Trade Zone may represent a strong
                 incentive for families of related companies to set up their trading hubs in this locality even though their
                 diamonds will ultimately be conveyed from there to Belgium, India and other Asian destinations where
                 they could have been sent in the first instance.
                 The somewhat relaxed import/export regulatory regime as it concerns gold and diamonds and the
                 capacity to carry out significant and untraceable cash transactions outside the formal banking system
                 make Dubai an attractive destination for some enterprises. Table h, derived from 2013 statistics pub-
                 lished by the CEEC, indicates that, on a weighted average, the export value as declared by industry at
                 $10.04 per carat was 41% under-priced relative to estimates of $14.19 per carat carried out by or on
                 behalf of the CEEC. It is also estimated that in 2013 transfer mispricing of rough diamonds cost the
                 Congolese fiscal revenue in the order of $66.1 million. Independent valuations of imported diamond
                 parcels should be conducted on an ad hoc basis by the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre which imple-
                 ments the KP certification process. Although the policy is to reject shipments of gem-quality rough
                 diamonds undervalued by more than 30%, no such rejections have occurred in the past 5 years.

      Box B.16: Analysing the relationship between South African export and import
      volumes and prices

      Although De Beers has recently been divesting of many of its traditional diamond mines, De Beers and
      Petra Diamonds now collectively account for 97% of production by value, with De Beers still producing
      77% of South African diamonds by volume.
      Since KP statistics have become available in 2007, South Africa has been importing significant amounts
      of rough diamonds by value but not by volume much of which has been subsequently re-exported. At
      times, as in 2007 the estimated difference in value between imports and exports appears to be signifi-
      cant, with imports valued at $1,705 per carat and exports at $134. This can be in part explained by the
      fact that, while South Africa exports and markets both industrial and gem-quality diamonds, it may be
      importing mostly gem-quality diamonds, in the case of De Beers, often from associated companies
      and mainly from Namibia and Botswana. However statistics tend to indicate that only a minority of
      imported diamonds (LCSV estimates less than 10% by volume) are cut and polished in South Africa,
      largely by De Beers, in spite of significant reductions in export tax (i.e., down to 5%) on diamond jew-
      ellery with the bulk of rough diamonds presumably re-exported after re-valuing and re-sorting them.
      LCSV alleges that as Petra sells the bulk of its production domestically, but none to De Beers, this
      means that as a consequence the latter must account for around 97% of South African export/imports.
      However the related values are not disclosed by the company on the grounds of confidentiality with
      only the value of production being provided. Nonetheless past De Beers’ “Report to Society” indicate
      that about 50% of production by value is sold to the domestic cutting industry by its Diamond Trading
      Centre (DTC) and the State Diamond Trader. On this basis and keeping in mind the low rate of cutting
      and polishing of imported diamonds, the LCSV concludes that the difference between exported rough
      diamonds and domestic production must be made up by a significant proportion of re-exported gem-
      quality rough diamonds of foreign origin previously imported and declared as high value.
      Table i, compiled by the LCSV using KP statistics under the assumption that import values are in fact at
      arm’s length, and that the majority of rough imports are in fact re-exported in rough form and inventory
      movements are moderate, provides a measure of how much less diamonds that are re-exported are
      apparently worth compared to when they were imported or mined. Moving progressively from left to
      right in the table, LCSV estimates that underpricing of South African exports amounted to $3.3 billion
      over the period 2005 till 2012, of which $2.8 billion was attributable to De Beers. These figures are of
      course only indicative of a hard-to-reconcile discrepancy but, given the lack of a detailed company by
      company breakdown of the KP data, may potentially contain significant error. It will, nonetheless, be
      interesting to see whether and how De Beers will respond to these allegations and in particular that,
      being the dominant player in South Africa, they “. . . are able to influence the behaviour of the buyers,
      sellers and critically of the regulator.” This influence is attributed to De Beers’ unique and undisputed
      industry position and power in determining diamond values including control of the reference “Price
      Book.” Under the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (N. 22 of 2002) detailed statis-
      tics for individual mines or companies submitted to the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) are to
      remain confidential where one company has more than 75% market share, or where there are less than
      three producers unless they grant permission to the DMR to publish the data. Even though De Beers’
      production value has fallen below the 75% threshold, it remains to be seen whether detailed figures will
      be produced to clarify the situation and dispel these allegations.
                                                                                           Box continues on next page




    campaigns making them fashionable, and the value is set by very specialised tenders/auctions that
    are generally conducted, usually by invitation, in New York and/or other key European fashion
    centres. More often than not, cutting and polishing is conducted by a related entity, hence, CUPs
    for rough coloured diamonds are hard to obtain and largely unreliable. Transfer is generally cross-
    border, but sometimes domestic, involving issues at both the level of mineral royalties and corpo-
    rate income tax. The former is exemplified for the case of mineral royalties on pink diamonds from
    Western Australia in Box B.13. Inevitably, if the value of production is significant, the governments
    of producing countries will need to rely on specialised diamond valuation skills that may not be
    readily available and, at any rate, extremely expensive.

    Chapter 6 Key Take-Away Points

       •	   The African continent has continued to increase in importance as a producer of mineral com-
            modities. Based on its uncontested exploration potential, this trend is set to continue into the
            future.
       •	   Gold is the dominant commodity on the African continent in terms of production and
            exploration.
       •	   While South Africa has historically been the dominant producer for all commodities, it now
            receives much less exploration attention relative to other African countries, and with the
            exception of coal, her dominant position may shift in the future.
       •	   Although most African jurisdictions by now feature in some cases reasonably detailed transfer
            pricing legislative provisions, with a few exceptions, relatively little action is currently taking
            place in terms of transfer pricing auditing in general, and of mining related transfer prices in
            particular.
       •	   Targeting for the purpose of performing transfer price audits should be done on a systematic
            basis that identifies the greatest risks to government revenue.
       •	   Of the high ticket items, it appears that the following may involve transactions with high intan-
            gible components in their cost structure, thus deserving priority attention:
            •	   Revenue related transactions (e.g., distribution and marketing services);
            •	   Management and administrative services provided as an annual operating cost that may
                 include accounting and finance functions;
            •	   Transportation services that may involve the provision of insurance; and
            •	   Engineering services provided as a capital expenditure.
       •	   Diamond mining poses a high level of transfer pricing risk in Africa due to the complexity in
            valuing the vast array of diamond qualities, and the consequent wide range in the pricing
            structure per carat.
       •	   Guidelines such as the BEPS Action Plan and related final recommendations and the UN
            Manual on Transfer Pricing in Developing Countries can provide valuable guidance on how
            inter-company charges can be set at fair levels.
       •	   Tax authorities must understand the components included within the calculation of revenue
            for different types of mining projects and mineral products. As illustrated in the case examples
            throughout this chapter, some minerals have specialised formulas that are used to calculate
            revenue (i.e., NSR, CFR, etc.).
       •	   The best approach for ensuring accurate transfer prices are used is prevention rather than
            cure. As a result, it is important for tax authorities to maintain ongoing, open and transpar-
            ent lines of communication with taxpayers and to create incentives for their cooperation and
            compliance.
       •	   Where a range of comparable prices may apply to the exchange of a product or service,
            clearly defined criteria should be established early to determine where within that range the
            appropriate transfer price should be placed on the basis of the functions performed, assets
            used and risk borne by the supplier.
       •	   Transfer pricing is only one factor in a multifaceted complex of issues resulting in base ero-
            sion and profit shifting, and it cannot be dealt with in isolation, that is to say, without full
            cognisance of its interplay with MNEs’ restructuring and the exploitation of DTA networks,
            i.e., ‘treaty shopping’.

                    Institutional and
              Administrative Capacity

As transfer pricing in the mining sector cannot be understood or addressed in any meaningful
practical way without placing it into a broader contextual setting, this Part will look at how tax
administrations can select cases, identify their risk issues, audit the evidence and resolve disputes
for transfer pricing in general and their application in the mining sector. It will look at the skills and
resources required, as well as what can be done to overcome any shortcomings, including the need
for transfer pricing capacity strengthening. It will also look at the identification of comparables
databases relevant to mining and their use in an African context. It will discuss various interim
options to lift capacities, including making use of short- to medium-term consultants and coopera-
tion with other tax administrations within Africa and abroad.

                    Transfer Pricing Administration,
                             Compliance and Audits

         In opening this chapter, it must be pointed out that the authors deliberately refrained from dealing
         with some important higher level contextual issues such as:

             ■■   The institutional prerequisites for a country to be perceived as attractive to FDI, promot-
                  ing business development and better compliance resulting in economic growth. These
                  include, besides a stable and competitive fiscal regime, political stability, rule of law
                  through an independent judiciary, low levels of corruption and black economy and a
                  competent bureaucracy with administrative capability in terms of formulating policy and
                  enforcing rules that are economically efficient and fair. There is a large body of literature
                  that deals with these issues in general, but recent works of note dealing specifically with
                  natural resources includes that by Prof. Lou Anne Barclay (University of West Indies) on
                  ‘embedded autonomy’ in the context of the bauxite industry in the Caribbean142 and that
                  by Lorenzo Cotula (2016)143 on the interplay between FDI, taxes and sustainability of the
                  resources sector.
             ■■   The fact that gaps in transfer pricing auditing capacity in Africa are just one of many fac-
                  ets of the current generally weak fiscal administration capacity in the continent and in
                  developing countries in general. The general issue of how to improve mining taxation
                  administration and collection frameworks in Africa, including better co-ordination and
                  collaboration among the various ministries and government departments involved in the
                  process, has been dealt with in a previous World Bank CET publication (Guj et al, 2013
                  op. cit.) to which the reader is referred.
             ■■   Many of the issues discussed in this chapter including the development of risk assessment
                  criteria, the institutional setup of transfer pricing units and strengthening of administra-
                  tive capacity, as well as tailored reporting requirements are relevant from a non-sector
                  specific transfer pricing perspective. All these issues are thus also discussed from an econ-
                  omy-wide perspective in the concurrently published general World Bank handbook on
                  “Transfer Pricing and Developing Economies” (please refer to chapters 6, 7 and 8).


7.1 Compliance Process Overview
         As already discussed (in section 4.1), tax administrations need to gain access to relevant business
         information, undertake analysis and use risk-based criteria to determine which miners warrant
         their attention. Under resources constraints, the best return on the public funds invested is to direct
         the key transfer pricing expertise available to auditing a limited number of high-flow/high-risk

             transactions, while promoting general compliance through improved taxpayers communication
             and development of simplified procedures in the handling of routine transactions.

             The following four phases outline the practical mechanisms to enable this process of prioritization
             and decisions that reflect the interdependent levels of potential revenue value and related risk:

                  ■■   Phase 1—Case Selection: selecting who should be looked at—what are the significant risks
                       to address and their relative priority. What industry or business groups and what taxpay-
                       ers may present those risks.
                  ■■   Phase 2—Risk Assessment: selecting what issues to look at within identified MNEs.
                  ■■   Phase 3—Audit: identifying and undertaking action needed to manage the specific tax-
                       payer risks through to adjustment (if required). This may often involve gathering evidence
                       through audit or other risk mitigation processes.
                  ■■   Phase 4—Resolution: resolving the risks both relating to the past and into the future. Nego-
                       tiation is a key activity at this phase and it may involve arbitration, litigation, mechanisms
                       to relieve double taxation and possibly advance pricing arrangements (APAs).

             The main characteristics of these processes are summarized in Tables C.1 and C.2.

             It is important for tax administrations to review their risk management and resource allocation
             decisions in the mining sector at regular intervals (for example, annually) so that they are dynamic
             to changes in circumstances and context. Static (set and forget) risk management decisions may
             fail to identify and respond in a timely way to significant changes in tax compliance risks as it is
             not uncommon for mining companies to modify their related party arrangements, especially when
             they are aware that tax administrations are looking at particular issues. For example, tax adminis-
             trations started to look at commodity marketing arrangements many years ago, and some of those
             audits may still be in progress, however, the marketing arrangements that miners are engaged in
             today are very different from those reviewed in the audits, which were started many years ago. It
             is important that risk management decisions reflect both past potential noncompliance as well as
             current risks.

             This temporal or time aspect of risk management ensures an appropriate balance between ‘fix-
             ing the future’ and ‘punishing the past’. If a tax administration gets mired or bogged down in
             dealing with past noncompliance, it may not be able to address current noncompliance. This is
             particularly important for the mining sector as compliance activities are commonly complex and
             frequently take many years to resolve. Significantly, an overextended administration may also miss
             the opportunity for policy, legislative or administrative changes to prevent or lessen the risk of
             future noncompliance.

             In addition to determining the likelihood of a risk occurring and the consequences should it occur,
             tax administrations need to consider how amenable each risk may be to treatment. That is, can the
             tax administration do something to remedy the problem or is a legislative or a broader interna-
             tional change needed.

             To do this in the mining sector for profit shifting and transfer pricing risks in particular, it is essen-
             tial that the tax administration understands the particular mining operations that take place in its
             country. An initial understanding of the following is essential to inform tax administrations of the
             strategic risks that may exist in their country:

                  ■■   The global industry characteristics and value chain for particular mineral commodities, and
                  ■■   The role and contribution that African countries, and in particular, the role their specific
                       country plays in that global industry and the mining value chain.

             An effective active compliance program requires the creation and maintenance of adequate data
             collection systems to provide the platform for a systematic examination of the population and then

 Phase 3              A process similar to the following four steps should be used when undertaking an audit of transfer prices:
 Audit the Evidence
                      Step 1: Identify the actual conditions. Gather and review the facts/evidence.
                      Step 2: Analyze—Identify and adjust for comparable circumstances relevant to arm’s length condition. Select best arm’s length method
                      Step 3: Apply the transfer pricing rules to achieve consistency with the relevant guidance material. (e.g., OECD, UN, country specific)
                      Step 4: Update/amend transfer prices if necessary. Decide on roll back/roll forward aspects. Monitor ongoing compliance.

 Phase 4              Resolve the adjustment with the taxpayer and other relevant tax administrations (MAP).
 Resolve Issues       Identify who else in the industry/market may have similar issues and consider whether to provide additional guidance or if compliance action is
                      warranted.

    ultimately the basis for measuring improvements in system-wide profit and tax outcomes and
    trends in taxpayer behavior. While this aspect may be seen by some as lower priority for adminis-
    trations focused in the first instance on the establishment of a viable compliance framework, it is
    something that becomes important as the system matures and should be built in from early stages.
    These processes will be facilitated by the implementation of the three-tiered approach to transfer
    pricing documentation as outlined in BEPS Final Report Action 13, in particular, the country-by-
    country (CbC) reporting framework as discussed in section 7.6 below.

    7.1.1  Phase 1—Who is of concern?—Case selection

    This section will provide an outline for how the tax administration can identify whom it should
    look at because of relative tax risk.

    To get a sense of the more specific risks and who presents those risks, tax administrations must
    develop an understanding of:

        ■■   Which MNEs conduct mining operations in their country;
        ■■   The business structure (both legal and operational) used by each MNE to undertake min-
             ing operations in the country and how that structure fits within the MNE’s global legal and
             operating structure;
        ■■   The high-level financial performance of those MNEs globally and of their mining subsid-
             iaries and other entities in the host country; and
        ■■   The relative performance of the various MNEs and mining companies that operate in the
             host country. It can be difficult to separate poor financial performance due to profit shift-
             ing through transfer pricing and poor financial performance caused by other reasons, such
             as inadequate administrative capacity, macroeconomic factors and business conditions
             including cost and capital expenditure constraints. Insights to filter out those miners more
             likely to be undertaking profit shifting or transfer pricing can be obtained by comparing
             line item costs and profitability against:
             •	 Peers—similar but unrelated mining operations. This may include comparing prices
                  achieved for sale of the same or similar commodities by other miners or published
                  market prices and general industry trends (e.g., if the industry reflects increasing
                  demand and higher prices it would be unusual for a mining company to be reflecting
                  losses or decreasing profitability),
             •	 Parts—other parts of the MNE’s business involved in the mining chain, especially
                  those in other countries, and/or
             •	 Past—historical results.


    It is this understanding that will lead to selection of the best cases for audit or other action. This
    case selection should be based on a ranking of the risk and the order in which a tax administration
    might want to be able to review them. This will mean that scarce tax administration resources can
    be deployed for the best long-term return on their investment. Resource allocation may not neces-
    sarily be based on the highest short-term audit results, even if they may appear potentially attrac-
    tive and a balance between a long and short time horizon is sometimes needed.

    A much greater understanding of the specific mining company is also needed by tax administra-
    tions to identify and undertake the action required to address the issues. This is where formal
    information and evidence gathering are crucial, and more in-depth analyses will be done in an
    audit or other process.

    Where a MNE undertakes mining activities in an African country, it is usually required to do so
    through a subsidiary resident in that country, established specifically to own and operate the proj-
    ect. This mining company should have clearly articulated accounting policies relating to transfer
    pricing, and maintain documentation (including contemporaneous documentation) that demon-
    strates these prices have been set in line with the arm’s length principle as expressed in the tax
150	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             legislation of most African countries, which generally reflects the principle set out in the OECD
             Transfer Pricing Guidelines. There will ultimately be four layers of transfer pricing documentation:

                   ■■   Global/master file;
                   ■■   Local transfer price documentation;
                   ■■   Country-by-country reports under BEPS; and
                   ■■   Local transfer pricing forms.

             In determining whether the transfer prices used by a mining company are consistent with the
             arm’s length principle, tax administrations in the country where the mine is located (host country)
             may need to audit some of the ‘higher-risk’ local mining companies. How the tax administration
             decides whom to audit is the result of a process of case selection and risk assessment.

             The Case Selection phase can be conducted using information that is publicly available, or acquired
             from analytical firms or industry bodies, as well as basic tax file data. It is recommended that the
             tax administration evaluate and fully understand the extent of the public data sources available
             in the country. Preferably, the basic tax file data would be supplemented by a questionnaire about
             international arrangements and related party transactions. Many developed countries have such
             schedules as part of their tax file, e.g., Australian International dealings schedule,144 and it has been
             found to be critical in enabling risk based case selection as well as facilitating subsequent audit
             activities. In addition, some companies may publish a summary of related party transactions in
             their quarterly and annual financial reports. Communication with taxpayers may not be necessary
             at this stage, unless there is a clear need for supplementary information discussing related party
             transactions, or to acquire some additional basic information.

             It is suggested that analysis for the case selection phase starts with:145

                   ■■   High-level profitability analysis—Comparisons of the aggregated financial performance
                        of the mining company relative to that of the parent MNE, and preferably over several time
                        periods to identify and understand underlying trends. Consideration should be given to
                        the presence and impact of economic cycles over time. For this comparison, data from the
                        tax file of the mining company and subsequent questionnaires and the financial accounts
                        of both the mining company and the consolidated MNE are used. As diagrammatically
                        shown in Figure C.1, while information is readily available for the mining company in the
                        host country, and generally for the MNE at the consolidated level, depending on where
                        it is registered, financial information about any of the possible conduit companies regis-
                        tered in other, often low-tax, jurisdictions is generally largely unobtainable. An exhaustive
                        list of possible line items of financial information, ordered in the standard format of the
                        Profit and Loss account and of the Statement of Financial Position (Balance Sheet) as modi-
                        fied from the ATO/OECD analytical training spreadsheet (OECD, 2013), which should
                        be sought is provided in Appendix C.1. This appendix also shows the range of ratios that
                        could ideally be generated if exhaustive financial information were readily available to
                        carry out comparisons between these two entities preferably over a reasonably long inter-
                        val of time. It is important for the tax authority to clearly determine whether a transaction
                        is correctly identified as recurrent, thus impacting on the Profit and Loss Statement, that
                        is to say affecting the entity’s profit and level of taxation, or classified as a capital expense
                        and recorded on its Balance Sheet.
                             The tax authority may be alerted by circumstances where the mining subsidiary is dis-
                        playing an inexplicable lack of profitability and consistently lower financial ratios relative
                        to the MNE’s corresponding ones over a protracted period of time. This type of analysis

                                       tax rates, tax to sales, tax to earnings before interest and tax, and tax to accounting profit.
                                       This type of ratio analysis is helpful in case selection, but has limited economic relevance.
                                           Although the courts have shown a marked preference for the use of CUP whenever
                                       possible, both industry and tax administrations (e.g., the IRS) have been making increasing
                                       use of the TNMM and related key financial ratios. In this context, the OECD (2011)146 sug-
                                       gests the seven key Profit Level Indicators (PLIs) listed in Appendix C.1.

                          The profitability analysis needs to be informed by other sources of data, which will better enable
                          the tax administration to decide who should be looked at as a matter of priority. This includes:

                                  ■■   Broad/global industry analysis—Identification of mining activities undertaken in the
                                       country, what minerals are mined, what mineral products are exported and in what form
                                       and volume, and identification of the MNEs that have operations in the host country. The
                                       goal is to identify which mining operations have the largest turnover or cash flows.
                                  ■■   Market analysis—High-level overview of the prevailing global, regional and local mar-
                                       ket conditions for the major mineral products produced and exported by MNEs from the
                                       country. Gaining insights into the level of prices that could reasonably have been expected
                                       to be achieved on the basis that the commodity could have been sold to an independent
                                       third party at the point of export from the resource country.
                                  ■■   Business analysis—This includes an overview of the global business of the MNEs with
                                       operations in the host country and an understanding of the global business in relation to
                                       the activities that are undertaken in that host country. It is important at this stage to under-
                                       stand which MNEs have the most significant level of related party transactions. Ideally,
                                       this analysis should also reveal the nature of those related party transactions and whether
                                       they involve hard-to-quantify intangibles. This analysis also requires a high-level under-
                                       standing of the corporate/legal structure of the global business and in particular the parts
                                       of the MNE that interact with the host country.

             At the end of this phase, the tax authority should have an adequate understanding of the MNEs
             and a sense of which of those MNEs’ local operations may need to be further reviewed and why.
             This will be largely informed by market conditions, and based on a ranking of turnover, profitabil-
             ity and the level of related party transactions.

             7.1.2  Phase 2—What issues do they present?—Risk assessment

             This section will provide an outline for how the tax administration can identify priority issues for
             the taxpayers who have been identified to be looked at in Phase 1, case selection.

             Risk Assessment involves looking at the specific mining MNEs that have been identified in Phase
             1, but more importantly, drilling down deeper into the activities of each MNE and its operations
             within the host country. At this stage it is likely that the tax administration will need access to infor-
             mation from other government agencies, the MNE itself and publicly available information from
             analytical firms, as for example, credit rating firms and industry bodies.

                  ■■   Functional analysis—Understanding of the goods and services that are produced or
                       received by the mining company, especially when involving transactions with other parties
                       within the MNE group. This analytical stage satisfies the need to identify who does what
                       and in what legal capacity, as well as to identify the major contracts, especially those with
                       other parts of the MNE group and any other significant issues. A questionnaire for guid-
                       ing this functional analysis is provided in Appendix A.4 and discussed in further detail in
                       section 4.2. Using the mining value chain, identify the different entities and the functions
                       they perform (i.e., processing is done in the host country, marketing by an entity resident in
                       a foreign country), classifying them as main (primary) and support (secondary) functions
                       and where the functions are performed. One must also determine how individual func-
                       tions are split among the various entities within the MNE group and evaluate their relative
                       contribution to consolidated profits. The nature of the related transactions, including map-
                       ping of the functions performed, risks borne and assets (including intangibles) employed
                       or transferred by related companies, are the essential factors that should be taken into
                       consideration in determining the appropriateness and compliance of the transfer prices
                       adopted by the MNE with the arm’s length principle. This analysis should extend to cover
                       both where the functions are performed and who undertakes them, as well as what occurs
                       in practice, i.e., where value is actually added, that is to say comparing form and sub-
                       stance, thus identifying potential mismatches.
                  ■■   Detailed profitability analysis—Understanding of the disaggregated business arrange-
                       ments and transactions affecting the profitability of an individual mining company. This
                       includes arrangements that give rise to revenue and expenses and the resultant accounting
                       profit. Initial benchmarking of the profit against that of the industry sector at large and, in
                       particular, the profitability of the sector from the perspective of the host country and the
                       countries where the minerals are ultimately used. For example, for iron ore, this would
                       involve looking at market prices and industry benchmarking, including sales to China (a
                       major buyer of iron ore) from Australia and Brazil, and then pay particular attention to
                       sales originating from African countries, as discussed in more detail in Part B. Potential
                       reasons to explain competitiveness need to be identified. For gold it would, for exam-
                       ple, include looking at published market prices as well as benchmarking in the industry,
                       although valid CUPs are hard to find.
                  ■■   Tax analysis—Understanding of tax-effective accounting undertaken by the mining
                       subsidiary and the MNE. It is important to understand any variances between the tax
                       and accounting computation of profits and losses, as well as the structures and financial
                       arrangements that are used for global tax planning by the MNE and, in particular, the role
                       of the local mining company in those arrangements and how they affect the tax paid by
                       that company in the host country.
                  ■■   Mining value chain analysis—Identification and mapping of the value chain for the par-
                       ticular mining activities from the exploration discovery of the resource through to the
	                                                       Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   153


             ultimate sale to the final customer. The analysis will reveal the degree of vertical integra-
             tion relative to the point in the chain at which the mineral product is sold to an unrelated
             party or transferred to a related one.

    At the end of the risk assessment (Phase 2) the tax administration should have an informed/refined
    ranking of which MNEs and their subsidiaries need to be further investigated, as well as the iden-
    tification of potential transfer pricing issues and the controlled transactions involved. The ranking
    of these MNEs, along with the risk of transfer mispricing estimated in terms of likelihood of occur-
    rence and value of its consequence results, form the pool of potential audit cases.

    7.1.3—Phase 3—Audit

    This section will provide an outline of how the tax administration can audit the evidence to sup-
    port an adjustment to tax payable if needed (or other action to mitigate the identified risk) in
    response to noncompliance with the arm’s length test by a miner.

    This phase can be thought of as having four steps, though in practice there can be a degree of itera-
    tion between each step as the audit moves to completion.

    Step 1. Identify the actual conditions—The first step in the audit phase is the identification of
    actual conditions of the controlled transactions between related parties, including the contractual
    arrangements setting out terms and conditions, so that for transactions of concern can be accu-
    rately delineated for subsequent comparability considerations. This includes identifying the rel-
    evant economic characteristics of the accurately delineated transaction.

    The extent of information and evidence gathering builds upon the analysis done in previous
    phases particularly the Risk Assessment phase. Importantly, this more detailed functional analysis
    of specific controlled transactions or arrangements will focus on the material functions performed
    (in the host country and elsewhere), the assets used in performing those functions and the risks
    associated with their performance. This step is crucial to understanding how transactions, as out-
    lined in contractual arrangements, are implemented in practice and if they are indeed carried out
    as prescribed in the relevant contracts.

    This step needs to be done with the level of rigor that would, if required, enable a successful adjust-
    ment to tax payable negotiations leading to settlement, or failing that litigation.

    The gathering of information and evidence will require communicating with senior officers of the
    mining company, including the tax manager (and possibly other related entities), obtaining original
    source documents, requests for the mining subsidiary to provide answers to written questions, or
    interviews with key personnel in the supply chain. Information from other third party sources may
    also be needed, for example, from banks, other government agencies (e.g., mines department and
    customs) and from tax administrations of other countries (especially where there is an exchange of
    information agreement in place).

    The evidence gathering should include a thorough review of any contemporaneous transfer pric-
    ing documentation that is maintained.

    The tax administration should seek the following information during step 1 of the Audit phase to
    establish the facts about the transfer or sale of products by the mining company:

        ■■   Location of the mine/s;
        ■■   Copies of contracts of sale between the mining company and purchasers (related and third
             parties);
        ■■   Copies of contracts between any related party intermediary and third party purchasers.
             The mining company may claim that it does not have this information and is unable to
154	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


                       provide it, even though it can be assumed that it would be within the MNE’s ability to
                       provide access to these relevant contracts;
                  ■■   Explanation of the mining value chain as it relates to their operations, from extraction,
                       processing, haulage, loading for export from the host country;
                  ■■   Volumes, quality specifications and dates of export from the country;
                  ■■   Any export control approvals for the commodity;
                  ■■   Who chooses, authorizes and controls sales to third parties;
                  ■■   Who chooses, authorizes and controls sales to related parties;
                  ■■   Who negotiates sales contracts and whether they operate autonomously;
                  ■■   Who determines product pricing and how these determinations are made;
                  ■■   What is the currency of product sales and transfers; and
                  ■■   Who bears any currency exchange risk between the currency of product sale/transfer and
                       the domestic currency, and how is the exchange rate calculated.

             Where a related entity, such as a marketing hub, is located in a foreign country and interposed in
             the sale between miner and an unrelated third party, the tax administration may be denied infor-
             mation about the terms, conditions and price of the sale to the third party. This may be the case
             even though it should be expected that it is within the ability of the MNE to provide that informa-
             tion, and the resulting lack of transparency may be deliberate to frustrate the tax administration’s
             ability to properly determine the arm’s length price. The protracted and frustrating communication
             period of soliciting the release of this information can take many months and even years, yet ulti-
             mately may be unsuccessful. Second best evidence, such as computed reference prices, may need
             to be used to progress the case in a timely manner if access to relevant information is frustrated.

             Step 2. Comparability analysis and adjustments—Having gathered relevant evidence, step 2 of
             the audit phase involves a comparability analysis and selection of the most appropriate trans-
             fer pricing method. This step establishes and determines the degree of comparability between
             controlled (related party) and uncontrolled (independent) transactions. The OECD identifies five
             comparability factors:

                    I.	 Characteristics of the property or services—For example, it must be ascertained whether
                        the controlled and uncontrolled transactions are the same or different, and in the latter case
                        to what extent, and what adjustments may be necessary. This must reflect
                        •	 what is being mined (type, quality, quantity, etc.);
                        •	 when and where it is mined;
                        •	 whether significant technical and unique design features are involved, or well-known
                             relatively simple mining and processing methods;
                        •	 whether significant haulage is undertaken and mechanisms by which this is done;
                        •	 what further refining, smelting, blending and other forms of processing take place and
                             where; and
                        •	 ultimately, what is the mineral product that is sold or transferred.
                   II.	 Functional analysis—Looking at the functions undertaken for both the controlled and
                        uncontrolled transactions/arrangements, to ascertain whether there are any material
                        differences (taking into account assets used and risks assumed) and if so, what are they
                        and what are the possible alternative comparability adjustments that could be made. For
                        example, if the controlled arrangement involved a significant long rail haulage function,
                        whereas the uncontrolled arrangement was located close to port, an adjustment reflecting
                        the difference in value of that haulage might be necessary to make them comparable.
                  III.	 Contractual terms—Terms and conditions need to be analyzed for controlled and uncon-
                        trolled arrangements, looking at how the responsibilities, risks and benefits are divided
                        between the parties. For example, determining what comparability adjustment would
                        be needed if a controlled arrangement included a significant price discount benefit for
                        shareholders in its contract for sale, whereas an uncontrolled transaction did not include
                        such a benefit, as described previously in Box B.11 relating to a major iron ore mine in
                        West Africa.

        IV.	 Economic circumstances—The arrangements undertaken by the parties being used for
             comparison, both the controlled and uncontrolled, are looked at to determine what their
             respective circumstances are. For example, are they in the same geographic market or are
             they at the same or different stages in the product cycle (is one starting up a new min-
             ing venture that still has high levels of financing for its capital investment or is it a long-­
             established miner where its capital investment has long since been recouped).
         V.	 Business strategies—Looking at the strategies of the parties involved in both the con-
             trolled and uncontrolled arrangements may reveal if they are undertaking the same or
             different business strategies. For example, one might be engaging in a market penetration
             strategy by pricing their product to increase their global market share, while the other may
             be reacting to a market penetration strategy.

    The information requirements differ somewhat between the five transfer pricing methods pre-
    sented by the OECD (2010). For example, some methods place a high degree of comparability on
    products while others on functions, and some are one-sided while others are two-sided analyses.
    Comparability analysis both assists, and in return is informed by, the selection of the most appro-
    priate or best method for identifying arm’s length conditions.

    Step 3. Apply the most appropriate transfer pricing method—The next step (step 3) of the audit
    phase is the application of the transfer pricing rules to determine an arm’s length price or price
    range (or if the most appropriate method was either the transactional net margin or profit split,
    the arm’s length net margin or profit range). OECD guidance material is used by its members and
    is normally adopted by nonmembers at this step for consistency in the application of arm’s length
    principles. It is important to ‘check’ the economic rationality of the prices or profits derived. If the
    result appears unusual it may indicate that some economically relevant factor has been missed or
    not properly considered.

    Step 4. Amend the transfer price if needed—The final step (step 4) of the audit phase is to see if
    the price (or net margin/profit) determined in step 3 is materially different from that used by the
    taxpayer for the relevant period, and, if so, the difference should be identified and calculated. If the
    arm’s length price (or net margin/profit) is materially different than that used by the taxpayer then
    the taxpayer should be made aware of this in writing. Many tax administrations do this in a ‘posi-
    tion paper’ that outlines the initial findings. It is usual for the taxpayer to be given time to consider
    the potential adjustment and to respond with corrections to any incorrect facts, or clarifications to
    the functional profile of the business.

    It is important that the tax administration carry out the calculations to enable issuing of a tax amend-
    ment quickly, as it is common for taxpayers in the mining sector to seek to negotiate the quantum of
    a proposed adjustment at this stage before any formal additional tax payable is assessed. While it is
    important for auditors to be open to taking into account any new facts or evidence if they are mate-
    rial and relevant, undue delay in issuing assessment of additional tax has shown to significantly
    delay collection, and possibly the quantum of additional tax. Prompt finalization of the audit stage
    by the issue of amended tax assessments can be useful to crystallize the quantum of any potential
    dispute and move the parties to an appropriate resolution in a more timely way.

    7.1.4  Phase 4—Resolve issues

    This section will provide an outline for how tax administrations can resolve disputes arising from
    the audit phase.

    As soon as a mining MNE indicates that it wishes to dispute an audit resulting in a transfer pric-
    ing amendment, the tax administration should put in place a specialist negotiating team. The vast
    majority of transfer pricing matters/disputes are settled by negotiation in a way that is permissible
    under the host country’s domestic legislative framework. The settlement should include certainty
    about prior years to be adjusted, the so called ‘roll back’ period. In addition, it may also include
156	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             a ‘roll forward’ position in an attempt to reduce the incidence and ideally avoid future disputes
             on the matter. The audit outcomes may also serve as a basis for the negotiation of a possible APA,
             where permissible.

             Where the tax administration adjustment is disputed, or where relief of double taxation is sought,
             the process usually involves further negotiations with the taxpayer, and may also involve the use
             of arbitration, obtaining expert evidence, dealing with objections, appeals and potential litigation.
             Discussions with relevant overseas tax authorities regarding the Mutual Agreement Procedure
             (MAP) to reduce double taxation that might otherwise have occurred as a result of the adjustment
             may also be undertaken at this phase.

             While it is tactically important that this phase be dealt with objectively and separately from the
             earlier phases, it nevertheless needs to be properly informed by the significant investment made in
             gathering and analyzing information and evidence during the audit phase.

             7.1.5—Process summary

             The entire transfer pricing compliance process, from Case Selection to Risk Assessment to Audit
             and to Resolution, is technically complex and can take a number of years to complete. Each case
             is a considerable resource investment by the tax administration, including opportunity cost,
             and hence it is important that the right taxpayers are selected and reviewed in the right manner
             (Figure C.2).

             The excessively long timelines, as displayed in Figure C.2, may be counterproductive to reaching
             satisfactory resolution as participants (in both the tax administration and the mining MNE) may
             change resulting in a reduced understanding of the circumstances that surround the case in ques-
             tion. Therefore, as a matter of good practice, it is suggested that tax administrations ensure each
             phase is commenced promptly and conducted according to timely compliance plans to achieve
             shorter overall timeframes. It may also be possible to impose shorter timeframes on some of the
             taxpayers’ procedural obligations.


    Availability of Transfer Pricing Analytical, Compliance and Auditing Skills
7.2 
    and Resources
             Different knowledge and skills are required during the four phases in the transfer pricing compli-
             ance process (see section 7.1 and Table C.1), from case selection to resolution.

             To effectively deal with transfer pricing, tax authorities need to have access to expertise in a variety
             of areas, including:

                  ■■   Legal and tax technical—knowledge of international law (including international commer-
                       cial law and international transport law), domestic law and the specific tax laws.
                  ■■   Economic—knowledge of economic theory and analysis at the global, country and sector
                       level. In addition, there is a need for specific knowledge of economic analysis methods that
                       have been developed to deal with issues of transfer pricing (especially those consistent
                       with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines). These skills are most often held by industry
                       economists with a microeconomic specialization and an understanding of how the eco-
                       nomic value chain works in a specific sector.
                  ■■   Accounting—knowledge of international accounting standards, country standards, and
                       practical experience with the preparation of accounting and financial reports, including
                       those in an international context. In addition, forensic accounting expertise may be needed.
                  ■■   Finance—expertise in financial analysis, project modeling and evaluation, risk and deci-
                       sion analysis in the context of mining projects.
                  ■■   External auditing—knowledge of audit processes and experience in applying them to the
                       review of the financial accounts of large corporates and/or MNEs.

                       taxpayer in question and relative risks.
                  ■■   IT skills—to access and analyze electronic information, including data and text mining
                       expertise.
                  ■■   Interviewing skills—to effectively extract relevant information required to determine the
                       substance and/or classification of the transaction under review.
                  ■■   Negotiation—experience in high-level corporate negotiations, including at the interna-
                       tional level.

             While many tax administrations have a strong preference to build and grow their internal capabil-
             ity in all these areas, it can be very difficult, costly and take many years (often decades) to achieve
             at the depth required to maintain a continuing functioning unit. Even developed countries that
             have been building capability and undertaking transfer pricing work for decades have very mixed
             outcomes. A comprehensive paper by the Boston University School of Law indicates that judicial
             decisions in many disputes in Australia, US, UK, Norway and Canada tended to favor the taxpay-
             ers, and these experiences have reinforced the trend and desirability to facilitate compliance and
             cooperation rather than litigation.147

             Current capability in the skills outlined above in African countries is relatively limited, and it is
             critical, if transfer pricing issues are to be addressed in the next few years, to evaluate all skills
             mobilization options, including those for the use of external experts to enable sought after results
             in the short- to medium-term as local tax administration skills are being strengthened. It would
             also be necessary to design and implement a robust training program. If tax authority staff are
             trained in transfer pricing, consideration should be given to a ‘return of service’ clause to ensure an
             adequate recompense for the investment in their training.

             As there is also significant demand by professional firms and MNEs for people with transfer pric-
             ing skills, opportunities to build capability in partnership with the private sector and having the
             potential to benefits all parties involved, should be sought and pursued. This type of collaborative
             approach can serve to reduce the turnover of key staff within government agencies, as well as
             defuse external competition for scarce skills.

             In addition, to enhance dissemination and sharing of this specialized knowledge, future programs
             should make increasing use of complementary web-based training packages and e-learning plat-
             forms. As discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 below, some e-learning packages with a general
             transfer pricing focus already exist. However, these packages are not developed from the perspec-
             tive of tax administrations. They are generally developed for small to medium size corporates to
             facilitate transfer pricing in a manner that would likely be acceptable to many tax administrations,
             with the focus primarily on pricing transactions rather than questioning whether arm’s length par-
             ties would have entered into the transaction under the same terms and conditions. Therefore, it is
             suggested that they be complemented by developing government-orientated and sector-specific
             modules, one of which should focus on mining.


7.3  Is There a Role for TP-Specific Administrative Units?
             One of the administrative issues that tax administrations will need to decide upon is an internal
             structure or design to effectively deal with transfer pricing issues, and more specifically transfer
             pricing issues in the mining sector in Africa. Transfer pricing in the mining sector clearly cannot
             be dealt with in a vacuum. In countries where the mining sector accounts for a significant propor-
             tion of the economy (and consequently tax revenue) and where the sector is dominated by foreign

    MNEs, it will be appropriate for the tax administration to factor this into the design of its structure.
    Trade-offs will inevitably need to be made against other factors such as high volume low value (but
    nevertheless still important) work. Structural and design decisions for the tax administration will
    be influenced by a range of factors including:

        ■■   Existing internal structure and design of the relevant tax administration. Commonly used
             organizational structures may be based on the:
             •	 Type of tax (e.g., transactional (VAT, excise) or aggregated (e.g., CIT)), or
             •	 Specific functions undertaken (e.g., advice, risk and intelligence, audit, litigations, and
                 perhaps policy), or
             •	 Market size (e.g., large, medium, small and micro business). Large business units may
                 be further specialized into market sectors such as mining and energy, financial, etc.
        ■■   Existing or preferred organizational culture of the tax administration.
        ■■   Business and economic characteristics of the population of taxpayers and their interac-
             tions with the tax administration.

    The trend in mineral-rich African countries in recent years has been, with a very few exceptions,
    for the establishment of a centralized large business unit, not specialized to any individual sector
    of the economy. The definition of what constitutes a large business is based primarily on exceeding
    a turnover threshold. An interesting variation is the establishment in 2009 of the Tanzania Minerals
    Audit Agency (TMAA) that acts independently of the Tanzanian Revenue Services. The TMAA “is
    mandated to monitor and audit mining operations, financial and tax records of mining entities, and
    ensure sound environmental management in all mining areas for large, medium and small scale
    miners.” In addition centralized or regionally based medium-size units have also been established
    in many jurisdictions. Further discussion of these factors are set out in Appendix C.2.

    Whatever structure is used for the overall tax administration, there is basically three broad ways of
    approaching the design of work units dealing with transfer pricing issues. These approaches need
    to cover all four phases of transfer pricing work, i.e., case selection, risk assessment, audit, and
    resolution. These broad approaches are:

        1.	 General—Where the area dealing generally with a particular function (e.g., case selection or
            audit or resolution) also deals with transfer pricing issues when they arise.
                 This approach has the benefit of using tax officers skilled in the particular work func-
            tion (for example, skilled officers with quantitative measurement skills for case selection, or
            officers with general audit skills for the audit function) and having a broader cross-section
            view of tax compliance issues, of which transfer pricing is just one. However, it can lead to
            a situation where the officers skilled in a function become ‘a jack of all trades and master of
            none’ in relation to the issues.
        2.	 General with expert support—Similar to (1) but where the functionally skilled tax officers
            in the general area are supported on transfer pricing cases by specialized advisors from a
            centralized pool of transfer pricing experts.
                 This approach also has the benefit of having functionally skilled tax officers with broad
            tax issue skills, but with the addition of expert advice when and as needed. The pool of trans-
            fer pricing experts would include those with relevant specialist economic, legal, accounting
            and auditing qualifications.
        3.	 Stand-alone specialist—Specialist units dedicated to dealing with transfer pricing issues
            across all industries, or possibly with subunits dedicated to specific industries such as min-
            ing. An example of a specialized large business unit in the South African Revenue Service
            (SARS) is described in Box C.1. Smaller TP units have also been established in other jurisdic-
            tions such as Kenya and Malawi.
                 This approach has the benefit of highly specialized transfer pricing skills, but may not
            be able to maintain high-level functional skills (e.g., quantitative analytical skills) and may
            lead to ‘tunnel vision’. This may also suboptimize the outcomes as other tax compliance
            issues, which may be of possibly greater economic significance for the country, may not

                 Box C.1: South African Revenue Services (SARS) Large Business Centre (LBC)

                 Transfer pricing is mentioned as a strategic focus area in the SARS five year strategic plan from 2012–
                 2017. SARS have a dedicated unit of 20 professional staff dealing with and enforcing TP rules. Con-
                 sidering the scale of mining-related international transactions in South Africa, it is prudent to have a
                 special unit within SARS to manage the relationship with large (often multinational) companies. For this
                 reason SARS established a Large Business Centre (LBC). The criteria for taxpayers to be administered
                 by the LBC are:
                      •	   All taxpayers which form part of a group of companies with a consolidated group turnover of
                           greater than R1billion,
                      •	   All mining and multinational groups with a consolidated turnover greater than R250million,
                           and
                      •	   All financial services groups.
                 The purpose is to promote an optimal and voluntary compliance at lowest cost to both SARS and the
                 corporate taxpayer. The LBC contributes to the four SARS strategic outcomes:
                      •	   Improved customs compliance;
                      •	   Improved tax compliance to maximize revenue collections;
                      •	   Increased ease and fairness of doing business with SARS; and
                      •	   Increased cost effectiveness and internal efficiencies by improving governance and maximiz-
                           ing return on investment.
                 Enforcement is done by first, the administrative unit, second, self-regulation through the MNE develop-
                 ing a TP policy and third, since 2001, through an annual declaration questionnaire. The intention is to
                 collect detailed information on:
                      •	   MNE transactions, starting at the mine through to marketing agencies across international
                           borders, along with entity ownership structures;
                      •	   Understanding hedging and treasury arrangements;
                      •	   Tracking IP transfers as part of international transactions;
                      •	   Understanding services transactions; and
                      •	   Thin capitalization/ funding arrangements.



                      be adequately identified or dealt with (e.g., thin capitalization, capital allowances). Staff
                      specialized with a relatively narrow compliance focus may also find it difficult to compete
                      for broader promotional opportunities and may, as a result, have relatively limited career
                      pathways.
                          An observation about highly specialized units with narrow industry-sector focus is that
                      they tend to introduce a degree of inflexibility into the organizational structure that can, if
                      circumstances change, make required adaptation to those new circumstances more difficult,
                      protracted and costly. For example, setting up a transfer pricing unit with deep understand-
                      ing and skill in diamond mining may, given the degree of difference in the functions and
                      processes involved, lead to some difficulty in adapting such a unit to gold mining or another
                      sector should the diamond mines shut down. Transitions, however, would be easier among
                      commodities with similar mining and processing technologies as the required skills are
                      often transferable, e.g., different base metals. The trade-off between the effectiveness that
                      increased specialization may provide, and the resultant reduction in adaptability to change,
                      must be kept in mind when setting up a highly specialized unit.

             This structural question is an open one and, based on observations, there does not appear to be a
             uniform view internationally as to whether TP-specific units are preferable to alternative models
             whereby TP specialists provide advice to ‘generalist’ audit/compliance teams. A general overview
	                                                                  Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   161


         on the benefits and shortcomings of different organizational structures is presented in the general
         handbook on “Transfer Pricing and Developing Economies.” Country experience suggests that for
         a transfer pricing team in its startup phase, with the transfer pricing regime still under develop-
         ment, a centralized approach will often provide for the most effective allocation of resources.148
         Regardless, the overarching point is a general one in relation to capability, and recognition that the
         ‘skill set’ for transfer pricing specialists is (on one view) different than other tax disciplines to the
         extent the arm’s length principle is predicated on economic concepts, usually reliant on accounting
         information to inform the economic questions, with a statutory test that is designed to codify an
         economic concept into a ‘bright line’ legal test. Therefore, taken together it is a tax discipline that
         requires knowledge of economics, business/commercial dealings, accounting, and tax law.

         Whichever model is chosen will involve a matrix management approach, but there will need to
         be a dominant organizing feature. Experience has shown that in the capacity building phase, an
         approach that emphasizes functional coherence builds technical knowledge faster and more coher-
         ently, albeit at the cost of specific industry or taxpayer knowledge. For example, within a large
         business unit or a general audit unit, there may be a smaller group that specializes in transfer
         pricing issues. The skills in dealing with large corporations or general audit skills should enable
         members of the units to deal with other compliance issues with support from the transfer pricing
         experts to identify, analyze and deal with any transfer pricing issues.


7.4  Comparables Databases
         Critical to Step 2 of the audit phase of a transfer pricing examination is access to key information
         and databases to undertake searches for comparable transactions to support potential comparabil-
         ity adjustments for calculation of an appropriate arm’s length price, leading to possible adjust-
         ments to the taxable income and resulting tax payable. This entails a clear understanding of the
         functions performed, assets employed and risks assumed by the parties to the transaction under
         review. The next step is to determine the appropriate method to apply to the tested party to deter-
         mine to what degree the transfer prices adopted are compliant with the arm’s length principle and
         to look for relevant comparables. If there are no internal comparables available, regard must be
         had to external comparables obtained from a variety of sources and/or from specialized databases.

         There are a variety of databases that contain information about different types of entities (e.g., dis-
         tributors, manufacturers, service providers, etc.) and of transactions. A few these include: the big
         Bureau van Dijk’s family of databases collectively known as Orbis and including Amedeus cover-
         ing European firms; Osiris; OneSource; Oriana; TP Catalyst; RoyaltyStat, a database of royalty and
         licensing agreements; Global Symposium; and Fame. A more exhaustive list of commonly used
         databases and a brief description of their individual use/content is provided in Appendix  C.3,
         while Appendix C.4 contains a list of currently available software packages designed to facilitate
         the determination of arm’s length prices using some of the above databases.

         Subscriptions to some databases can be very expensive and may not be affordable to some tax
         administrations in developing countries. There have been suggestions that one way to overcome
         this difficulty would be for a number of jurisdictions to pool their resources to gain and share
         access to relevant databases. However, to date this has not occurred in practice, but negotiations
         are in course for some developing countries.

         Databases can be global (e.g., Orbis and Osiris) or regional in their composition. For instance, Ama-
         deus focuses on Europe, Fame on the UK, and others on the Asia Pacific, the Americas or other
         regions. In the case of Africa, however, there are no specific databases. Furthermore, it is debatable

             Please refer to Chapter 8, “Developing a Transfer Pricing Audit Program” of the general World Bank handbook on
         “Transfer Pricing in Developing Economies” for further information.
162	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             if data actually exists to even compile one. Aside from the general lack of independent entities,
             there are, in the majority of jurisdictions, limited statutory requirements for independent compa-
             nies to file and make publicly available relevant information, which is therefore extremely limited.

             As a consequence, many countries in Africa are reliant upon foreign databases in transfer pricing
             examinations. At this stage it is estimated that about 50% of comparables used in the African con-
             text are derived from European information in Amedeus, and the remainder mostly from Asian
             databases. The choice of the database to be used is dependent on the country of origination and of
             destination of the goods and services supplied.

             The pitfall of using foreign databases is accounting for regional differences and the ensuing need
             for comparability adjustments, as for instance relating to geographic location, size of market, risks
             such as political and country risk, differences in regulated versus unregulated markets, etc. In
             practice, comparability adjustments of this nature are difficult to institute, and hence, are not often
             performed, with the foreign database used as a starting point for negotiation where regional dif-
             ferences are highlighted and the impact of these differences on the interquartile range are debated.
             Furthermore, the financial reporting standards applied by foreign companies may differ from
             some African practices, adding to the complexity of using foreign-based databases, even though
             there has recently been a trend towards greater harmonization in financial reporting standards
             (IFR, IAS, etc.).

             A lot of very useful information relevant to mining companies active in Africa can be derived
             from their reports to various stock exchanges. Of particular use are the Australian Stock Exchange
             (ASX), the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the London Stock Exchange’s international mar-
             ket for smaller growing companies (AIM), as most mining companies with interests in Africa are
             listed on them. In addition, valuable company information, with emphasis on Africa, can also be
             obtained from the African Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), and on commodity trading in an
             African context from the JSE-affiliated South African Future Exchange (SAFEX), the Mercantile
             Exchange of Madagascar and from the Mauritius based Bourse Africa.

             Some databases, such as those from Bloomberg, Platt’s and Metals Bulletin, focus specifically on
             commodities, and are therefore very relevant in the context of mining. Given the size of the cash
             flows relating to the transfer of mineral products, these databases are extremely useful in address-
             ing issues relating to pricing. The paucity of comparables in the area of pricing of mineral com-
             modities has recently been recognized as a major issue by the OECD, which has embarked in the
             compilation of a toolkit to assist in the assessment of transfer prices for some of the major mineral
             commodities, e.g., initially gold, copper and iron. The toolkit will contain detailed information
             about the downstream processing of the relevant ores, identifying the range of mineral products
             that may be marketed at various stages of their transformation from crushed and screened ore to
             refined metals. It will also contain valuable, and generally hard to obtain, information about the
             markets and pricing mechanisms for the various products.

             Given these challenges to practically resolve a transfer pricing case, access to information becomes
             critical. In some African tax administrations, the process of gathering robust and detailed informa-
             tion on related parties transactions from other sources (such as other government institutions, and
             exchange of information requests with a tax treaty partner) have proven useful in reaching audit
             findings and resolution without resorting to arguing as to what point in a comparable range would
             be appropriate to the transaction under consideration.


7.5  Transfer Pricing Documentation
             Documentation for transfer pricing is an ongoing issue for both tax administrations and MNEs.
             Useful material can be found in the UN Practical Manual on Transfer Pricing (Chapter 7), the
             OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines (Chapter V) and in the OECD discussion draft seeking com-
             ments on the revised text for Chapter V issued in January 2014.
	                                                                    Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   163



    Figure C.3: The four phases of the transfer pricing process (for details see Table C.1)



            Phase 1                       Phase 2                   Phase 3                          Phase 4
         Case Selection               Risk Assessment                Audit                          Resolution




               The newly amended Chapter V sets out three objectives for transfer pricing documentation
               (Para 5, page 2):

                   1.	 To provide tax administrations with the information necessary to conduct an informed
                       transfer pricing risk assessment;
                   2.	 To ensure that taxpayers give appropriate consideration to transfer pricing requirements in
                       establishing prices and other conditions for transactions between associated enterprises and
                       report the income derived from such transactions in their returns; and
                   3.	 To provide tax administrations with the information that they require in order to conduct
                       an appropriately thorough audit of the transfer pricing practices of entities subject to tax in
                       their jurisdiction.


               The OECD discussion draft also sets out a two-tiered approach to standardizing transfer pric-
               ing documentation, comprising a master file (at the global or business line level) and a local file,
               but which ultimately will also include two further tiers, i.e., country-by-country reports and local
               transfer pricing forms. Significant improvements are expected in the coming years when both tax
               administrations and MNEs adopt and implement this approach.

               Documentation requirements of tax administrations will vary according to the phase of work that
               is being undertaken as displayed in Figure C.3 and already detailed in Tables C.1 and C.2 in sec-
               tion 7.1, including,

               Case selection (phase 1)
               Access to information for case selection is necessary to enable tax administrations to make an
               informed decision about whom to audit. Obviously, additional information will be needed for the
               risk assessment (2) and audit (3) phases.

               Information from a range of sources can be used in the selection of a mining company for a transfer
               pricing case, and documentation from the taxpayer is only one of those sources. Information from
               the taxpayer at this stage is likely to be found in their tax file and, if required, additional transfer
               pricing schedule of information.149 Descriptions of the type of information useful for risk indicators
               can be found in the OECD Draft Handbook on Transfer Pricing Risk Assessment.150

               The information from tax filings would be used in conjunction with other information, including:

                          within the host country. In addition, it is important to seek publicly available financial
                          accounts for other MNEs’ entities, particularly, if available, those with which related party

                          transactions have been carried out, and the consolidated MNE accounts. Even in low tax
                          jurisdictions financial accounts are often available and they can be very useful in helping
                          to understand who does what within the MNE and where the profits are booked.151 That
                          information is generally not visible by just looking at the consolidated accounts because
                          intra-group transactions are eliminated during the consolidation process.
                     ■■   Critical information about the taxpayer and the transaction under audit can be gleaned
                          from its annual reports. Information such as strategic direction of the taxpayer entering
                          markets; key value drivers of the business; specific industry information regarding the
                          commodity; related and third-party transaction information; financial information regard-
                          ing the profitability of the taxpayer against the group as a whole; and employee informa-
                          tion, including salaries, can be derived from the annual reports.
                     ■■   Information from other government agencies, as for instance, customs for export tonnages
                          and quality details of the commodity sold.
                     ■■   Analyst information, much of which is available over the Internet or may be purchased
                          from a specialist analyst firm. Valuable information and insights so obtained will be useful
                          for case selection, but will need validation at the risk assessment or audit phases.

             At this relatively early phase, taxpayers will be very sensitive to the perception of unnecessary
             compliance burden if they are required to provide excessive information. Therefore, the overrid-
             ing principle should be to use information that would be readily available to the taxpayer. This
             is the type of information they need to run their mining activities and business, to prepare finan-
             cial accounts and satisfy regulatory filing obligations. The OECD refers to documentation require-
             ments in terms of reasonableness and materiality.

             Risk review and audit (phases 2 and 3)
             It is at the risk review and audit stages that taxpayers are normally asked to provide more spe-
             cific information and documentation to assess a particular transfer pricing matter or recalculate an
             arm’s length price. Some mining subsidiary companies respond to information requests from tax
             administrations in a timely and reasonable manner, even where some of the information may need
             to come from other companies within the MNE. This enables audits to be undertaken efficiently
             and any necessary adjustments to the tax payable to be finalized appropriately.

             However, in practice, it is not uncommon for some taxpayers to play the ‘deny-delay-defeat’ game
             response, whereby the tax administration is told that the information they require to do a proper
             transfer pricing risk review or audit of the company is not held in that jurisdiction, but held in a
             foreign country, and that approval of another company up the chain is required for its release to
             the tax administration. It is also not uncommon for tax administrations to be told that some of the
             information requested is of a confidential nature and cannot be disclosed.

             Acquiring this information can take some time, create delays or even be met with legal challenges
             (so-called collateral litigation) on the basis that the company is not required to keep that type of
             information or that the tax administration has no right to enforce that the information be provided.
             Unfortunately, this approach may make it difficult to complete a timely and effective audit.

             Alternatively, the ‘distract-deflect’ game response may be used, whereby requests for information
             during audits may be met by some MNEs providing massive quantities of data and information,
             only some of which is relevant to the audit. The administration is forced to look for the evidence
             ‘needle’ in the ‘haystack’ of irrelevant data. As the tax administration is not familiar with the data
             and information provided, nor the systems used, it may take significant resources to work through
             this mass of data to find the necessary and relevant information, and even then, the critical parts
             may sometimes prove to be missing.

    On the other hand, tax administrations are frequently criticized, often with good reason but some-
    times to create delays, for making imprecise and excessive information requests. Irrespective,
    information requests for documentation need to be both reasonable from a taxpayer’s perspective,
    sufficiently precise to be complied with and adequate for tax risk assessment, audit purposes and
    possible litigation. The use of experts, including, if required, external audit firms, tax advisors and
    tax lawyers/advocates can assist tax administrations to prepare requests that could not reasonably
    be criticized as unnecessary. This is a good strategy to use when undertaking important audits
    where a lack of cooperation, tactical game playing or collateral litigation is anticipated.

    Good case management practice suggests that discussions be held at a relatively early stage
    between the tax administration, the company (and other relevant MNE entities if they wish) and
    their external advisors to determine what and how the needed information can be provided in a
    timely and reasonably cost effective manner. This may lead to a schedule for the provision of infor-
    mation over a set period of time.

    In practice, even with the best intentions of all parties, it is not unusual to find that some of the
    documents sought by the administration do not in fact exist, or that they will not be obtained by
    the tax administration within a reasonable time, if at all.

    Therefore, tax administrations need to consider alternative sources for obtaining the information
    they require. One of these sources is through an exchange of information request with a tax treaty
    partner. However, as there are few bilateral treaties in place with African countries, becoming a
    signatory to the OECD multilateral treaty, as suggested in BEPS Action 15, would be a more effec-
    tive information exchange vehicle.

    Requests for information from other countries should be considered and made as early as possible
    in the risk assessment or audit process to enable sufficient time for the treaty partner to obtain and
    forward the required information. Exchange of information requests can take some time to be satis-
    fied and the country may not have, and may not be able to obtain, the requested information, and
    in such circumstances a request might be of limited use.

    Information access difficulties for a tax administration can be minimized where there is a legal
    framework that requires taxpayers to keep and/or provide the necessary information. The grant-
    ing of power to the tax administration (or a law enforcement body) to enforce those requirements
    and access information, documents and premises for this purpose is crucial. Where information
    is not kept or cannot be provided, appropriate penalties need to be considered. The penalties are
    usually civil in nature and may include a monetary penalty and possible court orders for specific
    performance. In cases of fraud or misconduct criminal penalties may apply, but in practice this
    rarely arises in a transfer-pricing context.

    In addition to penalties, it is suggested that consideration be given to legislation that provides an
    incentive to keep and make available the required information, and to not obstruct the tax admin-
    istration in its proper auditing role. This incentive could be in the form of a rebuttable presump-
    tion to be granted to the tax administration enabling it to calculate tax on their views of the arm’s
    length principle, if information is not provided by the taxpayer within a reasonable time period.
    For example:

        ■■   Rebuttable presumption of price—Assume the tax administration of Country X requests
             contracts, invoices, and bank records for the sale price of ore exported. If that informa-
             tion is not provided within say 90 days, then the tax administration of Country X may
             assume for tax purposes that the transaction price is the weighted average quoted price for
             each quarter during which sales occurred based on their estimation of the tonnages and
             relevant exchange rates. The tax administration’s assessment will stand unless the com-
             pany can rebut it in court, demonstrating that the tax administration’s position is excessive
             using evidence, as for example, including source documents such as contracts, pricing
166	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


                       comparables, etc. If such an approach were to be adopted, it would be important that it
                       also include a requirement that the company pays any legal and court costs incurred by
                       the tax administration to ensure that it does not create an incentive to disregard the tax
                       administration’s requests and impose additional compliance costs on tax administrations.
                  ■■   Contractual alternative—The royalty contractual conditions embodied in some mining
                       agreements between governments and the entities with mining rights include terms
                       that require the price for royalty purposes to be that paid by a purchaser to the entity
                       or any associated entity, i.e., if a commodity was transferred from a mining company
                       in Africa, to an offshore related party marketing hub, then onsold to an independent
                       third party purchaser in China, the price is to be that paid by the latter party. Where
                       such royalty agreements exist, information about the purchase price should be provided
                       to the tax administration and legislation could require this price (less adjustment for
                       appropriate costs) to be the arm’s length price. Examples of provisions from royalty
                       contractual agreements relating to iron ore mining in Western Australia are provided in
                       Appendix C.5.

             Advance pricing arrangements (APAs), although currently uncommon in Africa, depending upon
             what is included, may also be considered in the future as a cooperative and effective means of
             managing appropriate transfer pricing outcomes with taxpayers agreeing to provide necessary
             information and documents in a timely way. APAs will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8.

             Contemporaneous documentation
             There is another perspective on transfer pricing documentation that relates to ensuring compli-
             ance. Taxpayers need to evaluate, prior to the filing of their tax return, their own compliance with
             the transfer pricing rules. Requiring them to document their transfer pricing position helps ensure
             the creation of a culture of compliance (para 10 OECD Ch V update).

             Creation of this documentation contemporaneously, that is to say at the time of the transaction or
             by the time they complete the preparation of their file, can restrain taxpayers from developing justi-
             fications after the fact (paras 10 and 11 OECD Ch V update). It can also create incentives for timely,
             careful consideration of their transfer pricing positions if backed by the transfer pricing penalty
             regime. Some countries require contemporaneous documentation to be kept and some take it into
             account as a specific factor in their transfer pricing risk assessment.

             Hence, it is suggested that mining companies should be required to document their transfer pric-
             ing position at the time arrangements are entered into and whenever circumstances change. This
             would include when contracts are entered into with related parties. For example, if a 5-year con-
             tract were entered into with a related party, the documentation would articulate how the terms
             and conditions of the contract satisfy the arm’s length principle. In addition, documentation of any
             changes to the contract, as well as practical application of the contractual arrangements, should be
             made contemporaneously or at least prior to tax filing each year. This would include, for example,
             the actual practical nature of the dealings, timing and pricing. Tax administrations should watch
             to ensure that definitions relating to what is expected as ‘contemporaneous documentation’ are as
             clear and unambiguous as possible.

             There is a further question of whether, and at what stage, the contemporaneous documentation
             should be provided to the tax administration. One option is for the information to be provided in
             all cases with their tax filing. This is likely to create an unnecessary cost of compliance, and once
             provided, puts an obligation on the tax administration to review the material, potentially result-
             ing in an inefficient use of resources. A more reasonable option is to require the contemporaneous
             documentation to be kept and provided within say 28 days of a request from the tax administra-
             tion. Any such request is likely to be made during the risk assessment (2) or audit (3) phases, where
             particular issues have been identified.

             It is important that key information in any documentation supplied be cross-checked against other
             disclosures made by the taxpayer in its financial reports, income tax returns, the MNE’s annual
	                                                              Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   167


          report and website, agreements entered into with related parties and third parties, exchange con-
          trol submissions (in African countries enforcing it) as well as responses to the tax administration
          during the audit and other forms of audits, as for instance conducted in the context of VAT or
          customs.

          Appendix C.6 provides a suggested list of documents that would be required by tax administra-
          tions during the risk assessment and audit phases for transfer pricing issues in the mining sector.

              ■■   Detailed examples of country experience in the design and implementation of reporting
                   obligations are provided in Chapter 6 on “Promoting Taxpayer Compliance through Com-
                   munication, Disclosure Requirements, Transfer Pricing Documentation, and Penalties” of
                   the general WBG handbook on “Transfer Pricing and Developing Economies.”


7.6  Country-by-Country (CbC) Reporting
          BEPS Final Report for Action 13 contains revised standards for transfer pricing documentation and
          a template for CbC reporting. Chapter V of the OECD TP guidelines have been revised and three
          objectives for transfer pricing documentation have been outlined which, in summary, aim to:

              ■■   Ensure taxpayers give appropriate consideration to transfer pricing;
              ■■   Ensure tax administrations have sufficient information for transfer pricing risk assess-
                   ment; and
              ■■   Provide tax administrations with information to assist in transfer pricing audits, recogniz-
                   ing that supplementary information may also be needed.


          A three-tiered approach to transfer pricing documentation is proposed to achieve the objectives
          above. This approach comprises:

              ■■   Master file providing an overview of the MNE group business including an organizational
                   chart, description of the MNEs business, intangibles (including R&D), financial activities
                   and its financial and tax position.
              ■■   Local file providing more detailed information about specific related party transactions,
                   including a description of the local entity and its transactions with related parties (includ-
                   ing value, identification of parties, copies of agreements, comparability and functional
                   analysis and method chosen and basis).
              ■■   CbC report which provides aggregate jurisdiction-wide information relating to the MNEs
                   global allocation of income, taxes paid, and certain indicators of the location of economic
                   activity based income. Reporting of the MNEs main business activities includes research
                   and development, holding or managing intellectual property, purchasing or procurement,
                   manufacturing or production, sales, marketing or distribution, administrative, manage-
                   ment or support services, provision of services to unrelated parties, internal group finance,
                   regulated financial services, insurance, holding shares or other equity instruments and
                   dormant activities.

          The CbC standards are intended to provide sufficient information for tax administrations to under-
          take transfer pricing risk assessment and as such they do not provide all the information needed
          to conduct an in-depth audit. The CbC information would nevertheless be very useful in an audit
          as a basis to identify further information requests and enquiries. The CbC standards set out an
          exemption for MNEs with annual consolidated revenue in the immediate preceding fiscal year
          of less than €750 million. This exemption strikes a balance between costs of compliance and the
          need for tax administrations to get necessary information as it excludes 85–90% of MNEs (many of
          which would be small to medium MNEs) while still capturing 90% of corporate revenues. When
          considering the size of the mining MNEs investing in Africa, it is not expected that the exemption
          will apply to many.
168	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             Implementation of the new standards will have far reaching potential benefits for developing
             countries, allowing them the ability to more easily access information on the global operations of
             MNEs that operate in their territories.

             The concept extends the information provided by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
             that has been progressively implemented, although on a largely voluntary basis, for some time, and
             is much more useful for transfer pricing analysis. Similar legislation is also currently being intro-
             duced across the European Union requiring companies operating in the extractives sector to publish
             ­
             country-by-country data. The disclosure required by the European Commission is on a project-by-
             project, government-by-government and country-by-country basis and includes data on the following:

                  ■■   Income taxes paid;
                  ■■   Bonus entitlements;
                  ■■   Royalties;
                  ■■   Dividends;
                  ■■   License fees;
                  ■■   Payments for infrastructure improvements; and
                  ■■   Signature, discovery and production bonuses.

             Similarly, rules have recently been finalized under the US Dodd Frank Act (section 1504) requir-
             ing certain information to be provided by extractives companies listed on the US Security and
             Exchange Commission (SEC), and while revisions to the requirements of the Act are expected, this
             legislation is expected to remain in force in spite of significant opposition from some quarters.

             These initiatives present a big step forward adding to the pressure for greater transparency and
             disclosure by MNEs into the future as well as setting uniform standards and facilitating more
             sharing of information between tax administrations. However, the information produced by these
             initiatives, albeit comprehensive, will still need to be supplemented by additional specific informa-
             tion during in-depth transfer pricing audits.

             Implementation of CbC reporting is being facilitated by the BEPS work on Action 13, including:

                  ■■   Model domestic legislation for CbC;
                  ■■   CbC to apply to MNEs for first financial year commencing after 1 January 2016;
                  ■■   CbC reports to be filed with the country of residence of the ultimate parent company
                       within a year of the end of their financial year;
                  ■■   Automatic exchange of information arrangements are being developed for exchanges
                       under the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters,
                       bilateral DTAs and Tax Information Exchange Agreements.

             It is eagerly anticipated by the tax administrations of many countries, albeit with a degree of trepi-
             dation by some in the industry.


7.7  Penalties and Statutes of Limitation
             Penalty provisions in tax regimes act as an incentive for taxpayers to pay the correct amount of
             tax, and to penalize those who do not. There are three types of penalty related provisions that fre-
             quently arise in transfer pricing cases. While they are separate, they do operate in an interrelated
             way:

                  ■■   Penalty for underpayment of tax—usually based on the amount of tax underpaid;
                  ■■   Penalty for not keeping the required transfer pricing documentation;
                  ■■   Interest on tax paid to reflect time value of money during the period while the tax remained
                       underpaid.
	                                                          Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   169


    It is common for MNEs to regard any penalty as a serious matter that needs to be reported to
    the Board, so it is important that imposition of penalties be appropriate and reasonable. A fun-
    damental tenet for penalties is that they be proportionate to the wrongdoing, and it is important
    in the transfer pricing context, given the complexity and legitimate difference of views between
    a tax administration and a MNE’s subsidiary taxpayer as to the application of the arm’s length
    principle in determining the correct transfer price, that the imposition of penalties do not become
    counterproductive.

    The level of culpability and the quantum of underpayment of tax are two factors that are relevant to
    determine a proportionate penalty. Where a taxpayer (including the broader MNE) has genuinely
    sought to do the right thing by both keeping good transfer pricing documentation and providing
    it in a timely way, but it nevertheless ends up paying a relatively low level of extra tax because of a
    difference in view on transfer pricing, the taxpayer should be regarded as having taken reasonable
    care, and any penalty should be reduced or eliminated accordingly. However, if the quantum of tax
    underpaid is significant, say, outside the inter-quartile price range for the relevant commodity, or
    if reasonable care has not been taken, then a percentage of tax underpaid would be an appropriate
    penalty.

    Where the taxpayer or the MNE has been negligent, reckless or deliberate in not seeking to prop-
    erly apply the arm’s length principle or keeping and making adequate documentation available,
    then a higher percentage of the underpaid tax would be an appropriate penalty.

    In addition to legislative requirements, the OECD152 has as an objective that taxpayers appropri-
    ately consider transfer pricing requirements in establishing prices and other conditions in their
    dealings between associated enterprises and reporting for tax purposes.

    Many African jurisdictions also have specific transfer pricing documentation requirements and
    related penalties, but some, as for instance South Africa, do not. It is not uncommon for African tax
    administrations to face difficulties in obtaining the necessary documentation to determine the true
    substance/classification of transfer pricing transactions under review. This may be due to a lack
    of statutory power to request such information from the foreign MNE, or a lack of access to DTA
    exchanges of information. Where the taxpayer and/or foreign MNE does not cooperate in clari-
    fying the necessary information, then consideration could be given to a transfer pricing penalty
    that entitles the tax administration based on the most unfavorable point of the arm’s length range
    identified (either by the taxpayer or the tax administration). This approach could be modeled, for
    example, on that used by the German tax administration.153

    In addition to any penalty for a tax underpayment, the taxpayer should be required to compensate
    the revenue for the ‘time value of money’ lost as a result of the often protracted process of mak-
    ing transfer pricing adjustments. The ‘time value of money’ is an appropriate rate of interest that
    could have been earned by the government of the host country on the additional tax payable if it
    had been paid when the original tax was due. This approach could be modeled, for example, on
    the approach taken in the UK Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Act [http://www.legislation
    .gov.uk/ukpga/2008/13/contents].

    Tax regimes provide varying statutory limitations on the period permitted for tax administrations
    to make adjustments. For transfer pricing adjustments, this period can vary considerably. Some
    countries have had unlimited periods, while others may have either just their standard period for
    all other taxes or a prescribed longer period. Good practice, including for transfer pricing issues,
    requires tax administrations to ensure filing is done on time and to undertake its risk assessment

             and commence audits in a timely manner. It is not good public administration and it is not good for
             investment or business for final tax liabilities to remain uncertain for long periods of time.

             Nevertheless, given the complexity of transfer pricing audits and the problems often associated
             with obtaining documentation and data from taxpayers and third parties to establish arm’s length
             pricing, it would appear that a period of 3 to 5 years from the time of tax filing should be sufficient.
             This is generally the length allowed by most African jurisdictions with a longer time (e.g., 6 or
             7 years) allowed in a few instances.

             However, arguably there should be no statutory period of limitation where the taxpayer has not
             maintained and made available to the tax administration adequate transfer pricing documentation.
             This means that taxpayers who take their transfer pricing documentation obligations seriously will
             obtain the benefit of a statutory period of limitation, while those taxpayers who do not keep and
             provide transfer pricing documentation should not be able to ‘game play’ such limitation periods.

             It is also in the interest of good administration for statutory limits to act as an incentive for tax
             administrations to do their risk assessment and audit work competently and in a timely manner.
             Good practice for transfer pricing audits would suggest that analysis of the tax file data and requests
             for any additional information necessary for case selection should be made, preferably, within a year
             of the initial filing date. Risk assessment cases and audits should then follow where warranted, com-
             mencing within a few months (preferably within 18 months from the tax filing). Providing the infor-
             mation requests have been effectively complied with in a satisfactory manner, good audit practice
             would suggest that the audit should be completed and any necessary adjustments be made within
             a further period of about 24 months—longer if there are delays in getting necessary information.
             There is a direct relationship between information availability and audit duration in transfer pricing
             cases in the mining sector, and it is for this reason that information requests (from taxpayers, treaty
             partner countries, and other sources) need to be made early in the audit phase.

             Following is a good practice example timeline from case selection through to audit (on the basis
             that taxpayers provide requested information in a timely manner):

                  ■■   Tax file lodged 30 June 2016 (for year ended 31 December 2015)
                       •	 Within a year (30 June 2017) undertake phase 1 case selection, and make any initial
                           information requests.
                       •	 Within a further six months (31 December 2017) commence risk assessment review
                           (phase 2) on the candidate cases identified.
                       •	 Within a further six months (30 June 2018) decide whether to carry out an audit on the
                           issues identified, with a view to making an adjustment.
                       •	 Within a further 24 months (30 June 2020) complete the audit and issue amended
                           assessments. (A resolution phase may then commence if the taxpayer disputes the
                           amended assessment of tax).

             These good practice timeframes for actions of the tax administration may initially seem counter-
             intuitive, however, experience has shown that it is not unusual for audit staff, particularly those
             relatively new to the subject area, to wait until the last minute before requesting required informa-
             tion, or to overinvest or overengineer the evidence gathering and analysis stage (so called ‘analysis
             paralysis’, in other words display an inability to reach a conclusion from the evidence available).
             While not wanting audit processes to become deadline driven, there is a real need to improve case
             management, which is to say for them to be purposely progressed in a determined but always
             appropriate manner.

             Having very experienced staff review the progress of review and audit cases at particular stage
             gates (e.g., guiding the information request) or periodically (every three to six months) assisting
             in keeping cases progressing in a timely fashion, can be a very effective approach. This approach
             would also help inexperienced staff gain expertise and build confidence.

7.8  Audit and Compliance Measurement
         It is important that the tax administration has clear measures of success for compliance, especially
         audit functions. The traditional measures have largely focused on:

             ■■   Strike rates—proportion of cases looked at and adjusted, and
             ■■   Monetary size of adjustments—on a per-case basis as well as an aggregate measure over a
                  period of time, usually annually.

         These measures are somewhat outmoded and can in fact be misleading because they do not reflect
         the value of voluntary compliance, nor do they value preventive activities. They can also engender
         dysfunctional behavior:

             ■■   Strike rates can lead to auditors making unjustifiable small adjustments to achieve a high
                  strike rate. Equally, taxpayers who are aware of this behavior on the side of the tax admin-
                  istration may even facilitate such immaterial adjustments that are counted as a successful
                  strike, in an attempt to distract auditors from more material but possibly more difficult
                  issues. Auditors themselves may demonstrate a bias towards easy cases (including some of
                  dubious provenance) rather than the more difficult cases requiring more in-depth and pro-
                  fessional auditing techniques. It may also lead to auditors spending additional unneces-
                  sary time on a case looking for something to adjust rather than accepting that the taxpayer
                  may have been compliant.
             ■■   As for the monetary size of adjustments, experience has shown that auditors may spend
                  many years on a case that covers returns over several successive years as this approach is
                  more likely to lead to a larger monetary adjustment than “doing a year’s work in a year.”
                  This extended audit period can, however, be inefficient in terms of the resources used
                  as well as loss of alternative opportunities. Opportunity for a more strategic and timely
                  response may be delayed or lost, for example, the early closing of a loophole in the legisla-
                  tion. Monetary size adjustments can also encourage particularly large and possibly spuri-
                  ous adjustments to be made, only for the adjustments to be subsequently (maybe some
                  years later) overturned on appeal or lost in the courts.

         In summary, it is important for any administrative function to ‘measure what it values’ (e.g., the
         overall outcome sought, such as increased voluntary compliance), otherwise, the tendency is for it
         to ‘value what it measures’ (e.g., strike rates).

         Without overinvesting in performance measurement, it is important to have a suite of indicators
         of the effectiveness and efficiency of compliance activities. This should include a balanced set of
         measures such as:

             ■■   Conversion rate indicators (e.g., audit strike rate, adjustment rates, etc.);
             ■■   Time indicators (e.g., average time to complete an audit, effort time);
             ■■   Coverage indicators (e.g., percentage of the target population audited);
             ■■   Cost indicators (e.g., cost to perform an audit, cost of compliance);
             ■■   Revenue indicators (e.g., voluntary compliance revenue, revenue from audits);
             ■■   Stocks and flows indicators (e.g., number of audits on hand/completed); and
             ■■   Quality indicators (e.g., average audit quality, taxpayers’ satisfaction).

         Trends (not just lines of best fit) over time in these indicators (e.g., using control chart approaches)
         can provide a richer and more accurate picture of whether the system is improving or going
         backwards.

    Taxpayer Relations: Information Material, Rulings
7.9 
    and Communication/Consultation
             7.9.1  Communication designed to engage taxpayers and to enable compliance

             To enable taxpayers to comply with the tax administration’s view of compliance regarding rel-
             evant transfer pricing policy, legislation and administrative guidelines, it is critical that taxpayers
             (and foreign MNEs), particularly large ones and key industry groups, are aware of, understand
             and accept those views or, if disagreeing, dispute them in a transparent manner. This requires tax
             administrations to make their views on key matters known to taxpayers in an understandable way
             through active industry and taxpayer engagement and consultation. It can be beneficial to engage
             industry in the codesign of practical strategies to achieve clear and easily accessible administrative
             guidance as to how to comply with relevant government requirements.

             To enable current compliance a number of tax administrations have put in place what is in effect
             ‘real time’ consultation and compliance approaches. For example, the US IRS’s Compliance Assur-
             ance Program, the Netherlands’ Horizontal Monitoring Program and Australia’s Annual Compli-
             ance Arrangement/Pre-lodgment Compliance Review are all compliance approaches designed to
             enable and ensure compliance with the tax administrations view at the time the taxpayer (and/or
             its MNE) is contemplating material transactions, rather than months or years after the event. This is
             a relatively resource-intensive approach that can only be truly justified where the size of a taxpayer
             and its importance in the tax system are of such a magnitude that warrants the effort.

             Appropriate controls are crucial to ensure that tax administrations maintain their objectivity
             (avoiding client capture of the regulator) and that anticorruption mechanisms are followed (e.g.,
             see http://www.transparency.org/files/content/corruptionqas/Approaches_to_curbing_corruption_
             in_tax_administration_in_Africa_2014.pdf). The following controls should be considered a mini-
             mum standard:

                  ■■   Documentation: registers of audit and settlement positions, their rationale, whether
                       accepted/rejected, decision rationale; dual sign-off including by an independent staff
                       member, internal audit and review of register at regular intervals.
                  ■■   Supervision: adequate supervisor workload/spans of control, supervisors located with
                       and able to access audit staff, good supervisor skills and sound tax knowledge.
                  ■■   Movement: rotating staff to ensure that supervisory relationships do not become too close
                       or interdependent, rotating staff to ensure that client contact does not become too close or
                       interdependent.
                  ■■   Integrity: additional checks for employees in roles that are exposed to greater risk of cor-
                       ruption, such as family/associate asset holding reviews.

             To enable future compliance many tax administrations negotiate Advance Pricing Agreements
             (APAs). APAs are primarily designed for large taxpayers because they are resource intensive,
             though generally less so than a comparable audit. Larger numbers of smaller taxpayers are more
             effectively dealt with by general rulings that effectively provide safe harbor outcomes for relatively
             simple matters (see section 8.1 for more details on safe harbors). Negotiating APAs requires the
             same degree of rigor as an audit to establish an agreed evidence based arm’s length price. Impor-
             tantly, APAs differ from an audit because:

                  ■■   They are voluntarily entered into by taxpayers (and their MNEs),
                  ■■   Engagement is undertaken in a more cooperative way—that includes timely disclosure of
                       relevant information, evidence and documentation, and
                  ■■   Many matters can be easily dealt with by stated ‘critical assumptions’.

             Most APAs provide an agreed price and run for a set period of time (typically 3 to 5 years) before
             renewal and re-verification. Where a price range is used, the tax administration should be careful
	                                                                Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	     173


    to ensure that over the longer term the bottom of the range does not become the price point. Use of
    a price range allows for price variation as conditions change, and it is expected that the price point
    should, over time, be around the median of the range. Experience has shown that the price point
    used by many taxpayers with APAs has often been selected at the bottom of the agreed range. It
    is important that as a part of the annual communication process, a confirmation that the circum-
    stances surrounding the critical assumptions have not significantly changed be provided. APAs are
    discussed in more detail in section 8.2.

    7.9.2  Communication related to enforcing compliance

    Experience over many years across countries indicates that communication and relationships
    between tax administrations and mining MNEs regarding transfer pricing issues can be problem-
    atic from the perspective of each party. While a degree of professional tension inevitably arises
    where the relationship of trust and transparency between a taxpayer and the tax administration
    occasionally breaks down, this would be unfortunate and undesirable and every effort should be
    made to avoid this set of circumstances from developing.

    As a form of best practice, some tax administrations have published codes of conduct as to what
    taxpayers can expect during engagement with tax administrations (see Appendix C.7). Ensuring
    that best professional practice is adhered to by tax administrations when undertaking transfer pric-
    ing audits in the mining sector can significantly improve communications and lead to better and
    more timely outcomes.

    The body of guidance materials should evolve and develop in response to priorities identified by
    both taxpayers and administrators. So should the treatment of various taxpayers differentiated
    according to perceptions of ‘risk and consequence’ that may change in the face of an improving or
    deteriorating compliance behavior.

    The audit stage for transfer pricing cases is especially difficult, and it is important that auditors
    are well versed in soft skills and the ability to bring an audit to a successful conclusion regarding
    tax law and its enforcement where required. Tax administrations and the MNEs can have opposite
    positions during audits and a range of tactics, which may be deliberate or instinctive, that may
    come into play by either or both parties.

    Approaches that may be helpful when dealing with some of the common issues that may arise dur-
    ing transfer pricing audits in the mining sector include:

         ■■   Be clear about the role of a tax administrator: Auditors should be confident, when chal-
              lenged, about validating their role in assuring the community and government that the
              transfer pricing provisions of the tax legislation are being verified and enforced in a profes-
              sional, impartial and transparent way.
         ■■   Understand the MNE and their transfer pricing strategy: Auditors may better prepare and
              find it easier to deal with MNE officers when they know the roles and background of those
              officers. For example, if MNE officers were the initiators of the transactions being reviewed
              they can sometimes be defensive. Alternatively, passive responses may be received where
              the transactions were put in place upon instruction from the head office. Internet searches
              can be useful for this preparation.
         ■■   Have a clear agenda and objective: Officers should be very clear about why they are com-
              municating with the MNE officer. This includes clarity about the output (e.g., obtain-
              ing particular information or documents) or outcome (e.g., an agreed way forward)
              that the administration is seeking to achieve. What would ‘success’154 look like? Careful


    154
        For a transfer pricing audit in the mining sector it might be either assurance that prices for commodities and other
    major components of the mining value chain satisfy the arm’s length test or, if they do not, that an adjustment is
    made to the tax payable by the mining company.
174	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


                       consideration should be given to ensure the mode of communication chosen is efficient
                       for both the tax administration and the MNE, and that it will be appropriate to achieve
                       the desired outcome. Communication modes include telephone, letter, email or in-person
                       meetings. They also need to reflect the degree of formality and evidencing that is needed.
                  ■■   Anticipate the MNEs strategy: Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for some mining MNEs
                       when subject to transfer pricing audits to complain to more senior tax officials and govern-
                       ment officers (including Ministers) about the audit and the auditors’ dealings with them.
                       Therefore, it is good practice to brief such stakeholders prior to engaging with mining
                       MNEs on major transfer pricing cases. This is best done as part of a regular briefing pro-
                       cess. Sufficient factual detail155 (subject to any tax secrecy limitations) should be included
                       in the briefing to enable the stakeholder to understand and support the activities and to
                       avoid, because of lack of information, any inadvertent move or statement that may under-
                       mine the validity of the transfer pricing audit.
                  ■■   Be adaptive and flexible: Information and documentation are perennial issues that arise in
                       transfer pricing audits in the mining sector due to the extent to which necessary informa-
                       tion may be held outside the host country. Transfer pricing audits can get bogged down in
                       trying to get information or even collateral litigation on claims for legal professional privi-
                       lege. Creativity is needed to look for other ways to proceed in a timely way, for example,
                       suggesting independent arbitration, using other sources/alternative documentation or
                       proceeding to adjust tax payable on the best available evidence.
                  ■■   Be willing to compromise: It is important to identify and be ready to propose or accept
                       compromises within the limits of justifiable reason recognizing that mining transfer pric-
                       ing issues are inherently complex and many aspects can be argued. Compromises can pre­
                       sent opportunities to reflect cooperative solutions. It is essential that they be made in good
                       faith, and for good governance, and that the underlying reasons and justifications for such
                       compromises are documented.

             While many mining MNEs do the right thing, experience has shown that there are some instances
             where tactics are used to disrupt transfer pricing audits from being undertaken in an effective and
             timely manner. Auditors need to be able to identify and have the skills to deal with these tactics
             should they occur (see Appendix C.8).

             There is evidence that due to the greater ease of communication in influencing public opinion,
             MNEs have become very sensitive to the potential for reputational risk both in the source country
             and in their country of residence. This may represent a powerful incentive to increase transparency
             and demonstrate compliance. Pressures to bring about this behavior have also been applied by
             some tax jurisdictions that have published lists of the amount of taxes, sometimes surprisingly low,
             paid by major companies, the so-called ‘name and shame’ strategy.

             7.9.3 
                   in mining tax administration

             Irrespective of the mining taxation policy in force and of how tax administration functions and
             revenue collection are structured, there must be a clear allocation of the functions to be performed
             by and of the accountabilities of the various ministries and their departments involved. This is fun-
             damental to ensure effectiveness and to reduce potentially wasteful instances of inefficient over-
             laps and duplication of effort. These matters are discussed at length in a World Bank—CET 2013
             publication entitled ‘How to improve mining taxation administration and collection frameworks:
             A sourcebook’ to which the reader is referred. Although discussion in this sourcebook is written in
             the context of mining taxation administration in general, the issues are equally relevant to transfer
             pricing. Recommended initiatives for enhancing effectiveness and efficiency in tax administration
             include, among others:


             155
                 For example, MNE identity, general description of transfer pricing audit scope (such as whether sale of gold sold
             and exported to related foreign party was arm’s length), and period audit is expected to cover.

        ■■    Establishment of practical inter-agency protocols, promoting greater cooperation, thus
              simplifying and expediting processes,
        ■■    The harmonization and sharing of relevant databases, through data warehousing with
              clear responsibility for the collection and integrity of various datasets, and
        ■■    Sharing of specialized skills, which would see greater integration of technical mining engi-
              neering skills normally resident in the Department of Mines and physical quantity and
              value verification skills resident with Custom and Excises within the compliance and risk
              management processes, including audits, normally carried out by the tax office.

    In spite of general agreement in principle about the desirability of more effective inter-agency
    communication and cooperation, implementation of these types of improvements is generally
    progressing slowly, as it affects the boundaries of ministries and departments and therefore their
    political influence and share of limited budget resources.




      Chapter 7 Key Take-Away Points

             •	   Tax authorities must establish systematic and well-articulated compliance processes includ-
                  ing risk-based case selection, risk analysis, audit and resolution phases to replace any ad hoc
                  approach that may have prevailed in the past.
             •	   An assessment must then be made of the current inventory of auditing skills and to what
                  degree the available skill base is adequate to address the desired auditing plan, determining
                  priorities for future skill development and/or procurement from external sources.
             •	   An assessment of the information needs and requirements for each phase of the compliance
                  cycle must also be carried out determining which are the best sources and/or strategies to
                  satisfy them in a timely manner that does not introduce excessive delays and frustrates the
                  successful conclusion of audits.
             •	   The lack of comparables databases with specific relevance to mining in Africa is a major
                  drawback, as is the cost of and difficulty to make adjustments based on existing databases
                  with primary focus on European and/or other developed economies.
             •	   ATAF’s strategies to secure multiuser licenses for its members for some of the commercially
                  available databases should be supported.
             •	   Transfer pricing documentation is an on-going issue for both tax administrations and MNEs,
                  which may be ameliorated by clearer definition of what contemporary documentation the tax-
                  payers should develop and maintain and of the timing and modality for its submission.
             •	   Tax administrations should not impose unreasonable demands for information but be vigi-
                  lant about the strategy adopted by some taxpayers to avoid disclosure of some element of
                  information critical to a satisfactory audit. Process frustrating strategy can be recognized
                  and grouped under the headings of deny, delay, and defeat. The impending introduction of
                  country-by-country reporting and the increasing use of international exchange of information
                  agreements may improve this situation in the medium term.
             •	   While statutes of limitations should be waived where there is prima facies evidence of tax
                  avoidance, tax administrations should impose shorter and more rigid timelines for their offi-
                  cers to complete the four phases of the process, and in some cases it may be expedient to
                  abandon a stale case rather than having it drag on for many years at high cost and with declin-
                  ing chances of a favorable resolution.
             •	   Policy makers must be conscious that some of the current performance indicators based on
                  strike rate and monetary value of cases resolved may prove to be counterproductive in the
                  influence they may have at the case selection stage.
             •	   Taxpayer relations and cooperation is a critical area deserving urgent attention. Training will
                  be required in the area of communication and negotiation to promote voluntary compliance,
                  reduce the incidence of litigation and improve acceptance of adjustments by taxpayers.

                             Capacity Building

8.1  Administrative Guidance and Safe Harbors
          In 2013 the OECD156 redefined safe harbor as “. . . a provision that applies to a defined category of
          taxpayers or transactions and that relieves eligible taxpayers from certain obligations otherwise
          imposed by a country’s general transfer pricing rules.”

          As noted, these simplification measures can take several forms, from legislative safe harbors where
          the statutory test is waived; ‘practical’ safe harbors where the statutory test still applies but there
          is acknowledgement that provided certain criteria are met (and these can include quantitative cri-
          teria such as profit outcomes), the taxpayer can be assured they will be treated as ‘low risk’; and
          de minimis thresholds in the case of low levels of related party dealings and/or small size of the
          overall business.

          The advantages of using a safe harbor for pricing of routine low-risk functions are that it pro-
          vides certainty for a taxpayer, potentially reduces the costs of complying with transfer pricing
          administration, reduces the need to perform comparable studies, and frees up resources so that
          tax authorities and taxpayers can concentrate on more important transfer pricing matters, such as
          restructuring, intangible transactions and high-risk transactions where reliable comparables are
          not available.

          The downsides of a safe harbor are that it does not necessarily comply with the arm’s length prin-
          ciple (however, it may result in a reasonable approximation of the principle), that double taxation
          may result if the safe harbor is not bilateral or multilateral, and that safe harbors can be open to
          abuse. Taxpayers will try to fit their transactions into safe harbours and because disclosure require-
          ments are often not very stringent, doubtful transactions could escape undetected. For example,
          a safe harbor may be established for low-value support services to allow a profit margin on total
          costs of 5% or less, but this would not be helpful if applied to an overinflated cost base.

          Safe harbours should, therefore, be accompanied by stringent disclosure and review requirements
          so as to prevent possible abuse. In this respect, the OECD has recently broadened its approach to
          safe harbours as part of the BEPS 2015 Final Report for Actions 8–10 resulting in a revision of Chap-
          ter VII of the OECD transfer pricing guidelines. An elective simplified approach for a broad range

    of low-value-adding intra-group services has been introduced that seeks to achieve the necessary
    balance between appropriate charges and the need to protect the tax base of the payer countries. It
    provides for a limited (5%) markup on costs and provides a consistent allocation key for these ser-
    vices. It also provides greater transparency through specific reporting requirements and includes
    clear guidance on documentation that taxpayers should prepare and submit upon request from the
    tax administration in order to qualify for the simplified approach.157

    Follow-up work on the design and implementation of the simplified approach is being undertaken.158

    Tax administrations can develop and provide their own simplified approaches or safe harbours
    tailored to their needs and those of industry. For example, late in 2014 the ATO released its online
    guidance on ‘Simplifying transfer pricing record keeping’ providing options to be made available
    for the following categories of transactions, excluding transactions of a capital nature:

          ■■   Small (nondistribution) business taxpayers with aggregated turnover of less than Austra-
               lian $25M;
          ■■   Small- to medium-size distributors with aggregated turnover of less than Australian $50M;
          ■■   Low-risk intra-group services amounting to less than Australian $1M or less than 15% of
               aggregated expenses/revenue; and
          ■■   Low-level intra-group loans with a combined cross-border loan balance of Australian $50
               million or less.

    To avail themselves of these simplified transfer pricing options taxpayers and transactions must
    satisfy certain general conditions, e.g., they must not have:

          ■■   Derived sustained losses over three or more consecutive years, or
          ■■   Related-party dealings with specified countries, or
          ■■   Undergone a restructure in the relevant income year.

    In addition to these general hurdles, the four categories of taxpayers listed above will also need to
    satisfy further hurdles relating to each specific option.

    As noted above, there are a number of examples of where safe harbors have been developed and
    implemented after extensive consideration of the issues. These probably provide good guidance as
    to where other countries could consider something similar if it was warranted.

    Before establishing a safe harbor, African countries need to first assess what risks are involved and
    what limitations should be applied to it, and determine to what extent the benefits from adminis-
    trative simplification would outweigh any potential revenue foregone. There are no precise mecha-
    nisms for determining what might be sacrificed through a safe harbor. One mechanism that South
    Africa is using to determine levels of risk and noncompliance is by reference to audit results and by
    engaging industry experts. Useful intelligence has been gathered to ascertain industry norms and
    thresholds, which have assisted in reviewing previous safe harbors, as well as areas for consider-
    ation on potential future safe harbors.

    Setting of safe harbors must be based on initial comparable analysis. In this respect the introduc-
    tion of equitable safe harbors at a policy level in Africa could be constrained by the paucity of local
    comparables databases.

8.2  Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs)
             The OECD Guidelines define an Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) as: “An arrangement that
             determines, in advance of controlled transactions, an appropriate set of criteria (e.g., method,
             comparables and appropriate adjustments thereto, critical assumptions as to future events) for the
             determination of the transfer pricing for those transactions over a fixed period of time. An advance
             pricing arrangement may be unilateral involving one tax administration and a taxpayer or multi-
             lateral involving the agreement of two or more tax administrations.”

             Markham (2005)159 discusses in detail the advantages and disadvantages of entering into an APA
             mainly from the point of view of taxpayers in the UK, US and Australia. Advantages include cer-
             tainty, pursuing a cooperative approach with the tax authority, the possibility of including past fil-
             ing (the so-called rollbacks) and options for possible extensions. Disadvantages include problems
             with unilateral APAs (which, however, can be overcome through use of MAP if a DTA is in place),
             the cost of filing an APA, the possibility that the process may alert the tax authority to conduct
             a transfer pricing investigation that may otherwise not have occurred, and that the APA may be
             refused. In addition, the danger exists that APAs may become irrelevant in an environment of con-
             tinuous and fast paced business evolution.

             In African countries where the largest taxpayers are in the mining sector, and therefore, likely to
             be selected for audit in any event, an APA may be suitable and indeed a better way to review the
             evidence and achieve agreement on arm’s length transfer pricing to drive compliance in a coopera-
             tive way.

             In addition to including the transfer pricing of mining commodities, cases should include the fol-
             lowing types of transactions, which are included in the majority of APAs:

                  ■■   Intangible property transactions;
                  ■■   High-risk transactions where reliable comparables are not available;
                  ■■   Financing transactions;
                  ■■   Restructuring; and
                  ■■   High-value service transactions.

             It is important to cover all the high-risk transactions, as an APA covering only limited issues is
             unlikely to result in reliable tax outcomes. What may be agreed for one issue (for example, com-
             modity pricing) may not lead to a better tax revenue outcome if it is accompanied by a change in
             another issue (for example, an increase in debt levels and associated deductions for interest). The
             broad range of issues that need to be covered can be addressed efficiently through their inclusion
             in the ‘critical assumptions’.

             Information asymmetry is often a problem when auditing mining companies, and APAs may prove
             very useful to assist in addressing the issue as it is based on cooperation and the provision by the
             MNE of all necessary information. This information is not only useful for the APA concerned, but
             may also be useful for gaining insights which assists in building expertise and knowledge to better
             undertake transfer pricing compliance activities for other mining MNEs.

             Nevertheless, a review of the status and use of TP legislation in Africa (Table B.3) indicates that
             even though some mineral-rich jurisdictions in the Sub-Saharan region may have developed legal
             provisions for the use of APAs, very few, if any have been implemented to date. This may be due to
             the perceived time, cost and skill intensity (both in terms of industry and transfer pricing expertise)

          of the process of conducting the necessary negotiations, as well as the demand on resources for car-
          rying out an annual compliance tracking mechanism.

          The costs of entering into and the supervisory requirements involved in an APA program can be
          similar to those required for an audit, but usually are more timely given that the required infor-
          mation is often provided upfront. This suggests that this type of arrangement should be made
          available by governments but only when justified by substantial expected benefits relative to its
          cost. Hence, an approval process for APA candidates, similar to that of case selection for audits, is
          needed so that scarce transfer pricing resources are not invested in matters of relatively low signifi-
          cance for the tax system.

          In practice, APAs are often entered into as administrative arrangements where no special legisla-
          tion is necessary. While they may focus on specific issues and controlled transactions, their use-
          fulness in assuring overall revenue (especially important for developing countries) may not be
          achieved unless all significant tax issues, especially financing issues, are covered by the APA or
          other equivalent compliance product (for example, a ruling product).

          Process-wise, APAs are similar to an audit but usually quicker to administer because of their coop-
          erative nature and they provide easier access to relevant information. This can be seen in the pro-
          cess map shown in Figure C.4.

          Given the paucity of general audits of mining companies currently carried out in most African
          jurisdictions, it comes as no surprise that resources are preferentially directed at carrying out risk-
          based audits, drilling down to specifically identifying TP related risks before contemplating the
          possibility of negotiating possible APAs. Given the administrative costs of APAs, the decision on
          their introduction should be based on a careful review of costs and benefits.

                  ■■   Detailed guidance on the role and design considerations for APA programs is provided
                       in Chapter 7 on “Avoiding and Resolving Transfer Pricing Disputes” of the general WBG
                       handbook on “Transfer Pricing and Developing Economies.”


8.3  Application of the “Sixth” Method
          In addition to the five recommended methods, the OECD has also been considering, but does not
          endorse, the use of the so-called “sixth method.” The method was developed to deal with transfer
          pricing of commodities (including agricultural as well as mining) traded by agents in terminal
          markets that regularly quote their prices. This method, employed initially in Argentina in 2003
          was soon followed by Ecuador, Uruguay, and has now been adopted by most mineral-rich South
          American countries. Many Latin American jurisdictions have recently introduced transfer pricing
          legislation (e.g., Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Bolivia and Chile) and all but Chile
          have adopted the sixth method. In addition, others have recently amended their existing transfer
          pricing regulations (e.g., Brazil, Panama, Peru and Columbia) and Brazil and Peru adopted the
          sixth method. India has also recently introduced the sixth method.160, 161

          The sixth method focuses on exports of commodities and mandates publicly quoted commodity
          prices be set in a contestable market on the day of loading of the mineral commodity for export,
          regardless of volume, geography, and other factors that influence the market price. It applies to
          specified commodities sold to a final external consumer through a related intermediary located
          in a foreign (generally low-tax) jurisdiction (“triangular transaction”) and where the foreign
          intermediary lacks sufficient substance to create value in the mining value chain. In effect, when

               commodities are sold under these circumstances, the sixth method ignores the intermediary dis-
               tributor and prices the transaction according to publically quoted prices established for the com-
               modities in uncontrolled markets. Uruguay and Peru refer to the “sixth method” as a variant of the
               CUP method.

               Advantages of the sixth method are its ability to alleviate the audit burden in applying an arm’s
               length approach, address the access to information challenge and the lack of comparables. It may
	                                                                   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   181


          also be an effective way for African countries to increase the tax assessed on companies exporting
          commodities.

          The sixth method, however, is also subject to criticisms as it is arbitrary and does not permit adjust-
          ments for factors relevant to the arm’s length price. These factors include those with impact on
          costs (i.e., geography which involves transportation, logistics and insurance costs) or volumes and
          agreement terms. There is also a lack of clarity about the definition of ‘commodity’ for the method
          and which commodities would satisfy the test of public or known prices.

          Importantly, the sixth method is not consistent with the ALP, and to that extent it may create a risk
          of economic double taxation, which may have implications for potential investors’ perceptions of
          sovereign risk in jurisdictions adopting it. These issues are discussed in ‘Sixth method raises transfer
          pricing concerns in developing countries’.162 This risk may be mitigated where the ‘sixth method’ is not
          mandated, but only available where an arm’s length method cannot reliably be applied.

          An African country that considers introducing the “sixth method” for pricing mineral commodi-
          ties in its TP legislation needs to first determine whether this is a viable option for the country, and
          detailed research needs to be undertaken to:

                ■■   Determine what the potential impact would be on foreign direct investment, economic
                     growth and job creation in the mining industry;
                ■■   Critically evaluate the effectiveness of using the “sixth method” to curb transfer pricing
                     abuses. MNEs may react by introducing higher marketing/sales commission/services fees
                     to counter the application of the ‘simplified CUP method for commodity transactions’. Bra-
                     zil restricts MNEs from introducing exorbitant fees by having limitations on deductions;
                ■■   Consider the alternative option of introducing this approach in an anti-avoidance provi-
                     sion as opposed to a transfer pricing provision to address the arm’s length principle con-
                     cerns that taxpayers may raise.

          The process of researching and developing options for the sixth method should involve good com-
          munication, negotiation and ideally agreement between industry and the relevant tax authority.

          In contrast to the ‘sixth method’, the BEPS Final Reports for Actions 8–10 include a clarification
          about the use of the arm’s length CUP method specifically for commodities.163 It provides that
          quoted prices can be used under the CUP method, subject to a number of considerations. This new
          guidance is to be supplemented by further work to provide knowledge, best practices and tools for
          commodity-rich countries to use for determining the transfer price in commodity transactions.164

          The knowledge, skills and experience needed for each of the four compliance phases (case selec-
          tion, risk assessment review, audit, and resolution) differ somewhat, particularly between priori-
          tizing candidate cases and doing those cases, and between doing the cases and resolving those

             Risk-based case selection,165 particularly where relatively large numbers of taxpayers exist com-
             pared to tax administration compliance staff (e.g., having 300,000 public groups to monitor with
             about 1,000 compliance staff is not uncommon), and where each taxpayer potentially has mul-
             tiple tax risks, largely requires very strong quantitative analytical skills,166 such as those commonly
             found in data miners (e.g., those familiar with predictive and descriptive analytical approaches).
             To effectively utilize resources and select cases for audit, a robust and efficient risk-based process
             must be developed and carried out by suitably competent resources.

             Case selection is generally differentiated by tax type (e.g., income tax versus VAT) as the data sets,
             risks and taxpayer behaviors often differ in this manner. While case selection in tax administra-
             tions is less often differentiated by industry (e.g., mining versus manufacturing), it should be rec-
             ognized that different industries possess different and individual dynamics, regulations, modus
             operandi, etc.

             That said, many tax risks are common across industries. For example, restructuring is not unique
             to the mining sector—it is also a common risk in other sectors including manufacturing, informa-
             tion technology, etc., and may be a precursor event to enable profit shifting via transfer pricing.
             However, the supply chain restructuring risk takes a particular form in the mining sector—it typi-
             cally involves the (re)allocation of key activities from extraction, blending, processing and refin-
             ing, marketing and distribution, treasury, financing and hedging, logistics and shipping, or mobile
             assets such as intellectual property, to hubs in lower taxed jurisdictions. Similarly, the risks around
             avoidance of capital gains taxes are not unique to a particular industry, but in the mining sector
             they are likely to relate to the sale and acquisition of entities that are either land rich or hold rights
             to explore or mine.


             165
                 Alternative selection approaches such as census (where every taxpayer gets reviewed), random case selection
             (picking taxpayers for review out of a hat), interval sampling (picking say every tenth taxpayer) or judgment based
             case selection (picking taxpayers for review based on an ‘I reckon’ approach—auditors often want to do this) are
             unlikely to be as effective as risk based approaches where taxpayer data is essentially regressed to improve the cor-
             relation between the risk being present and the data indicating the risk might have been present. A feedback and
             learning loop should be inherent in robust risk-based approaches. Without feedback and learning selection effec-
             tively becomes judgment rather than risk based. For appropriate risk differentiation it is important that the view of
             risk consider risk likelihood factors and risk consequence factors separately rather than producing a single output.
             It should be obvious that a risk with a high likelihood but low consequence warrants a different tax administra-
             tion approach to a risk that is low likelihood but high consequence. Assessing the performance of case selection
             approaches just on the strike rate produced has a real danger of an outcome that chases matters of relatively little
             consequence, but high likelihood. (e.g., a $1,000 adjustment on a $100M turnover taxpayer is immaterial.) It should
             be noted that selection systems that use binary thresholds or relatively crude risk scoring approaches do not make
             the best use of the information value available and will generally be significantly outperformed by systems that rank
             candidate cases by approximate measures of likelihood and consequence to give a view of potential risk adjusted
             value. This is something that is, unfortunately, often poorly done by many tax administrations.
             166
                 Quantitative skills should not preclude the appropriate blending of any qualitative intelligence (e.g., text) that
             may be present. The trick is to capture that qualitative intelligence in a robust manner that allows for its meaningful
             analysis and use across potentially large numbers of taxpayers. (e.g., Whistle blower or Dob-in systems.)

             Risk Area             Example of Training Requirements for Necessary Skills and Expertise

     Marketing hub              Need to understand legal contract arrangements including terms and conditions
     (Chapter 4.2.2)            that may reflect non-arm’s length arrangements. This requires knowledge of
                                the laws in the host country as well as those of other jurisdictions, operation
                                of international commercial and transport law, etc., as they apply in practice
                                to the mineral commodities being reviewed. Need to understand, in economic
                                terms, where value is truly being added in relation to the marketing function,
                                and specifically the hub. Accounting skills are required to ascertain if revenue is
                                being accrued appropriately in accordance with relevant accounting standards.
                                Training of auditing skills should focus on how and where to obtain financial
                                information contained in the MNEs’ accounts in various jurisdictions and whether
                                they fairly reflect the activities being undertaken.

     Corporate services hub     Need an understanding similar to that required for a marketing hub with
     (4.2.3)                    emphasis on sound corporate services models that provide support functions.
                                Knowledge of international industry practices is needed as well as sound
                                accounting skills to determine the appropriateness of the allocation keys used.
                                Auditing skills are also important to verify transactions.

     Engineering, science and   Need an understanding similar to that required for a marketing hub with
     technical hub (4.2.4)      key focus on how to value and set an appropriate compensation for use of
                                intangibles and of high-value, specialized technical/scientific equipment.

     Insurance hub (4.2.5)      Need an understanding similar to that required for a marketing hub with
                                emphasis on understanding the special nature of insurance and how risks are
                                priced and managed (transferred, treated or mitigated), as well as the allocation
                                key used between MNE entities.

     Finance hub (4.2.6)        Need an understanding similar to that required for a marketing hub with
                                emphasis on how mining is financed in terms of its initial and on-going capital
                                investment and operational needs internationally. In particular, an ability to
                                analyze the financial structures pertaining to the mineral commodity(ies)
                                concerned, and more specifically those of common application across resources
                                projects in African countries is required.




    The skills and expertise needed to deal effectively with transfer pricing are set out in section 7.2.
    More specifically, to deal with transfer pricing risks in the context of mining in Africa, tax adminis-
    tration may wish to focus their training on those areas identified in Table C.4.

    In summary, there is a strong case for broadly based transfer pricing training to be provided that
    may benefit from the establishment of a strong knowledge-sharing base and generic training mate-
    rial, which may be utilized across different African jurisdictions. This may ideally be complemented
    by well-designed e-learning platforms, which would lessen the travel cost and time imposition that
    would be required as a high component of face-to-face tuition. A number of e-learning products are
    already commercially available in the market. While some are quite useful and very well presented,
    allowing self-paced study and self-assessment, their focus is so far exclusively on the point of view
    of the taxpayer. It could be argued that a need may exist for similar digital training products to be
    developed with the specific perspective and purpose of training tax administration officers.

    Detailed industry specific knowledge is, however, important during the risk assessment and audit
    phases. In this phase one has to understand the taxpayers business to understand the tax outcomes,
    and then establish whether a contestable issue exists. Building such industry knowledge to aid in
    effective transfer pricing risk assessment and audits of the mining industry may not be an easy
    process. External industry experts are not always readily accessible to tax administrations, and
    if they are, there can be an underlying hesitation for such experts to reveal the inner workings
184	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             of the industry due to concerns about professional conflicts (they often have consulted for most
             of the large miners) and future engagements (they probably want to consult for the large miners
             again). This reticence appears to be less of a concern for academic mining experts. Intensive courses
             designed to raise the level of understanding of the workings of the mineral exploration and min-
             ing industry for non technical professionals are already delivered as part of a number of Masters
             programs, as for instance in Mineral Economics. Wider development of similar courses could be
             promoted for consideration by some of the universities in mineral-rich African countries. Ideally,
             such courses should include field visits to mining and mineral processing operations in the country
             and/or abroad.

             If the tax administration is going to be dealing with the particular industry or taxpayer on a regular
             basis, as will be the case for a unit set up to audit large mining operations, it is largely incumbent
             upon the tax administration to build its own intelligence by undertaking its own research; gather-
             ing intelligence through the audit process; liaison with industry and regulatory bodies, particu-
             larly with their Department of Mines and/or State Development; other tax administrations, as for
             instance VAT and Customs; global forums; etc., so that the auditors are not starting from scratch
             each time. This can be a significant investment of resources, and care should be taken that staff do
             not end up doing research that is largely unusable or unused. Tax administration research units can
             become enamored with pontificating about some obscure but interesting aspect (e.g., the taxation
             of virtual currencies) rather than sticking to what is needed to identify and complete compliance
             cases in an effective and efficient manner.

             A useful guide to transfer pricing risk assessment is the OECD’s Draft Handbook on Transfer Pric-
             ing Risk Assessment (“the Handbook”) published by the Steering Committee of the Global Forum
             on Transfer Pricing. The Handbook details country procedures, methods and practices in order
             to provide a useful guide to tax administrations designing their own risk assessment approaches.

             Many in Sub-Saharan African countries, as for instance South Africa, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia,
             Kenya, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, have identified basic risk indicators to guide case selection and
             put in place and/or are continuing to develop risk-based audit strategies. Their effectiveness,
             however, is in many cases constrained by weak intelligence gathering processes, limited access to
             information from other tax jurisdictions and to relevant comparables databases, and inadequate
             transfer pricing documentation and human resources with appropriate skills.

             The knowledge, skills and experience needed to resolve a case also differs somewhat from that
             needed to make robust evidence based adjustments of the arm’s length price on some matters.
             Negotiation skills and knowledge of litigation are particularly needed, as well as a sound apprecia-
             tion of the strengths and weaknesses of each party’s position in the dispute. It is not uncommon at
             this phase to find that some aspects of the case (often a counterfactual aspect) is less well evidenced
             or documented than would be required before a judge, and sound understanding of risk enters into
             the negotiation picture.

             The negotiation and settlement of cases is another point where key controls are needed to ensure
             the objectiveness of outcomes reached. It is important for knowledge, skill and experience build-
             ing of auditors that they are appraised of the reasons for particular settlements so that they can
             improve their litigation brief building in the future. It should be noted here that it is not uncommon
             for auditors to overestimate the strength of their case, equally, it can occur that the negotiation team
             has overlooked some aspect or key feature that could have been put more forcefully or argued
             differently.

             Often not done under time pressures, a full post-case debriefing and analysis should be conducted
             to extract learnings for the future. Such a debriefing can be important in ensuring that all members
             of the compliance team are aware of how they can improve in the future, as those that do not learn
             from past mistakes are condemned to repeat them.

    Secondment as a Training Strategy or with the Objective to Aid
8.5 
    and Expedite Enforcement of Transfer Pricing Rules
          8.5.1  Secondment of tax officers to more experienced administrations

          As a general statement, targeted training programs are essential to transfer pricing capacity and
          capability building. Whilst on-the-job performance of actual audits is often the primary skills
          development technique, skills can be further enhanced, and greater consistency obtained, if on-
          the-job training is supplemented by a structured formal training program that combines theory
          with practice, allowing for trainees to see how the theory manifests itself in reality.

          It may be argued that, given the long duration of TP audits, a single short- or medium-term sec-
          ondment by tax officers of a developing African tax administration to an experienced administra-
          tion may not expose the visiting tax officers to the full spectrum of TP auditing phases/activities.
          Similarly, the issue also arises in the reverse scenario where experienced tax officers are seconded
          for short/medium terms to other developing countries. Ideally secondments should be comple-
          mented by repeated interactions to enable the more experienced officers to mentor staff over a
          timeframe of several years, to ensure appropriate skills transfer as well as securing outcomes from
          the audit work itself.

          The development of a training program should be structured against an assessment of existing
          levels of competencies. As a result, training programs may range from basic to intermediate to
          advanced. If no specific transfer pricing competencies exist, a tax administration can nevertheless
          attempt to build capability and capacity from the ground up. Individuals with existing and proven
          tax and audit experience, and possessing strong self-starter attributes, must be identified as ideal
          candidates for a pilot transfer pricing team.

          This pilot team can then start to conduct its own needs analysis with possible recommendations to
          address and close identified skills gaps. This may include identification of individuals for:

              ■■   Short- (say less than a month) and medium-term (say up to six months) secondment to
                   more experienced tax administrations in the general region or elsewhere, and/or
              ■■   Attendance at internationally recognized training courses and programs, for example the
                   OECD-run transfer pricing outreach and training programs, and/or
              ■■   Study tours and fact-finding visits to other tax administrations, particularly in mineral-rich
                   countries with advanced transfer pricing rules and implementation structures in place.

                Secondment of transfer pricing experts and/or tax officers from more competent regional
          8.5.2 
                and international jurisdictions to assist with audits, process improvement and training

          An alternative is to second transfer pricing specialists from the private sector or from more
          advanced tax administrations over short- to medium-length periods of time. Ideally, these experts
          should be embedded in tax administrations at the critical time of development and initial enforce-
          ment of their transfer pricing legislation. This approach has already been successfully applied in
          other, more general, areas of tax policy reform and restructuring of tax administration and collec-
          tion frameworks, where tax experts are typically provided under contract to international orga-
          nizations such as the UN, World Bank, etc. In these cases, resourcing seems to be evenly split
          between actual employees of these organizations and individual consultants contracted to them,
          many of whom are often recently retired tax officers from the tax administrations of developed
          countries with a significant level of practical experience. Sometimes, active officers of tax admin-
          istrations in developed countries are released for relatively short periods by their organizations to
          provide assistance or to conduct special investigations in the context of support provided through
          bilateral arrangements with donor countries such as Norway, Germany, etc. Alternatively, inter-
          national organizations have been known to source specialized expertise from major international
186	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             tax accounting firms, but this has been primarily in the context of fact-finding projects generally
             relating to comparative policy studies or other relatively short investigations normally involving a
             number of developing countries.

             As already discussed, an effective way to expand capability is to foster regional collaboration.
             Regional secondment of experts, that is to say from other African administrations, while of sig-
             nificant relevance may not be feasible over long periods because of the consequential depletion of
             generally scarce expertise in their country of origin. This is an issue that should also be considered
             in the context of the possible establishment of the proposed Multinational Transfer Pricing Units
             and to some extent of the ‘Tax inspectors without borders’ initiatives discussed in section 8.6 below.
             The African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) has been effective in facilitating training and devel-
             opment amongst tax administrations. Individual members of ATAF also have their own assistance
             programs designed to contribute to regional assistance initiatives.

             While short-term secondments with regional and international jurisdictions can be very helpful,
             serious consideration must be given to the availability of funds for such secondments. Further-
             more, agreements with regional and international jurisdictions must be in place to facilitate such
             secondments.

             Whatever the type of secondment that is finally arranged, the most important aspect should be to
             ensure that it does not merely provide a stop-gap service, but that it leads to an effective transfer
             of knowledge, enhancing the capability of local officers. Secondments should therefore include,
             besides helping to do the job, a component of training and follow-up knowledge sharing.


    Pooling of Expertise and Cooperative Models of Capacity and Knowledge Sharing
8.6 
             Establishing and maintaining the expertise required to deal with transfer pricing issues from case
             selection, to risk assessment, to audit, to resolution often requires a big and ongoing commitment
             over many years. This may not be possible for many developing countries at this stage, particu-
             larly less wealthy ones. For such developing countries, the effectiveness and cost of establishing
             and operating transfer pricing capability might be optimized by using some innovative and shared
             administrative arrangements as discussed below.

             8.6.1  OECD’s ‘Tax Inspectors Without Borders’ initiative

             Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB), which is an initiative introduced by the Centre for Tax
             and Development of the OECD, with strong support from G20 and G8 leaders,167 has the objective
             to provide a pool of transfer pricing experts to developing countries to assist with audit work,
             and to enable the transfer of tax audit knowledge and skills to tax administrations in developing
             countries through a real-time “learning by doing” approach. It does this through the use of experts
             (currently serving or recently retired tax officials) from different jurisdictions working directly with
             local tax officials on current audits and audit-related issues concerning international tax matters,
             sharing general audit practices. Anticipated benefits include:

                     ■■   Improvements in the quality and consistency of audits;
                     ■■   Transfer of knowledge;
                     ■■   Potential for more revenue;
                     ■■   Greater certainty for taxpayers; and
                     ■■   Encouraging a culture of compliance through more effective enforcement.

             Tools have been developed to address issues of confidentiality and conflict of interest that enable
             TIWB to work on real, live cases alongside the local audit team.

    8.6.2  Establishment of Multinational Transfer Pricing Units (MNTPUs)

    Multinational Transfer Pricing Units (MNTPUs) could be created as a shared resource between
    groups of participating African countries to undertake a range of transfer pricing work with the
    necessary range of expertise. An approach could be a pan-African organization supported by
    international organizations, but such an ambitious scope would make its practical implementation
    an unrealistic challenge. It would be more realistic, expeditious and convenient to assemble such
    MNTPUs on a regional basis, using the boundaries of existing regional organizations, linguistic
    groupings or on an ad hoc basis. Once again, initially at least, these MNTPUs would have to rely on
    an appropriate level of international support. This pooling of transfer pricing knowledge should be
    supported by appropriate web-based systems and e-learning platforms.

    This type of unit could undertake all four phases of transfer pricing compliance (from case selection
    through to resolution) or be limited to one or more of the phases depending upon the agreed needs
    of participating member countries. While respecting the sovereignty of each country, the activi-
    ties of the unit would be undertaken on behalf of the respective tax administrations of member
    countries. For example, in the case selection and risk assessment phases, the unit could undertake
    analysis across the same MNEs operating in different member countries, then make recommenda-
    tions based on relative risks so that the member countries could make decisions about which to
    audit168 and when.

    To facilitate the operation of the MNTPU, arrangements would need to be put in place to ensure
    the unit had the necessary legal authority to undertake the required activities, including exercise
    of statutory powers acting in the shoes of the tax administration, e.g., to seek access to informa-
    tion, undertake reviews and audits, settle disputes, etc. Tools/measures will also need to be devel-
    oped to address issues of confidentiality and conflict of interest, enabling the MNTPU to work on
    real-life cases across the same MNEs in different participating African countries. Similar practical
    challenges have been faced by developed countries when undertaking simultaneous audit pro-
    grammes and multilateral tax administration taskforces169 and their experiences would assist in
    developing suitable options. In relation to confidentiality, options may also be based on how law
    and accounting firms manage these issues (e.g., through internal arrangements that form an ‘infor-
    mation barrier’ to prevent communications that could lead to conflicts of interest.)170 The OECD
    also has developed tools that address issues of confidentiality and conflict of interest that enables
    the TIWB to work with audit teams.

    Mechanisms should also be created to prioritize and allocate resources to various cases, to set
    agreed time schedules to perform the case work, and to charge out time on the case work to the rel-
    evant tax administration, including a contribution to overheads. Funding for the establishment and
    ongoing running costs for such a unit could come from proportionate contributions from member
    countries, and possibly with some assistance from international organizations. Proportionate fund-
    ing could be calculated by reference to the number and nature of cases done, as well as charge
    out rates for time taken for work done for each country. All these legal and administrative mea-
    sures, particularly the issue of confidentiality, will need to be thoroughly investigated and resolved
    before this initiative may be seriously considered for possible implementation.

    If the unit had the capacity to risk assess 20 taxpayers and commence eight audits each year, it
    would make recommendations to a panel of member countries. The panel could then make deci-
    sions as to what work would be done by the unit so that resources could be allocated to the highest
    risk work on an agreed funding basis.



    168
       Or other compliance treatment, such as Advance Pricing Agreement.
    169
       Such as the Joint International Taskforce on Shared Intelligence and Collaboration established in 2004 between
    four countries and now brings together 30 national tax administrations.
    170
       The law societies of some countries have developed (and sometimes published) guidelines for information barriers.

             As capability for these activities within each of the countries would currently be low, it is also
             important that the simultaneous building of capability be fast tracked. The building of capability
             internally by tax administrations can take decades, and it is at risk of being lost to international
             professional firms that offer more attractive opportunities and remuneration to skilled staff. Fur-
             thermore, the escalating pace of trade globalization and e-commerce does not afford tax adminis-
             trations the luxury of a leisurely buildup in capability if current tax leakages are to be stemmed
             and ideally reversed. A professionalization timeline of two to five years would be more in line with
             current circumstances. Therefore, it is considered that internal capability needs to be supplemented
             (at least at the early stages) with expertise from developed country tax administrations and profes-
             sional external consultants. Where external consultants are being used, it is critical that an effective
             skills transfer to internal tax administration staff be in place.

             A specialized shared MNTPU would be a new and unique arrangement. Given the current capa-
             bility of tax administrations, the resource-rich nature of African countries and the global business
             optimization models used by MNEs, it is suggested that now might be the right time to explore the
             feasibility of implementing this knowledge pooling concept and of defining:

                  ■■   Potential member countries;
                  ■■   Roles and functions of the unit;
                  ■■   Governance arrangements for the unit;
                  ■■   Resource contribution framework for member countries and international organizations;
                       and
                  ■■   Joint-knowledge and e-learning platforms, etc.

             A potential model for the MNTPU, that merits closer examination, is the African Legal Support
             Facility (ALSF) which was launched in 2010 under the auspices of the African Development Bank
             (AfDB). The ALSF was a response to a request from African Finance Ministers for support in three
             areas namely, commercial creditor litigation, the negotiation of complex commercial transactions,
             and capacity building. All member countries of the AfDB are eligible to request support. The ALSF
             is currently assisting African states on 26 projects. The majority of the projects involve direct assis-
             tance in contract negotiation, or the building of legal foundations needed to properly negotiate
             contracts.

             Like for the ALSF, the MNTPU would need to identify an appropriate host organization, as well
             as core funding. The Unit’s main point of difference would be the time schedule for support, as a
             meaningful intervention in transfer pricing cases is likely to take on average significantly longer
             than targeted assistance to contract negotiations, thus presenting particular funding and human
             resource challenges.

    Chapter 8 Key Take-Away Points

       •	   The administrative benefits of well-designed safe harbors for routine, low-risk service transac-
            tions outweigh the potential disadvantages arising from a less strict application of the arm’s
            length principle, and the related risk of double taxation is generally capable of being success-
            fully addressed.
       •	   The South American experience indicates that there may be a valid role to play for the ‘sixth
            method’ in the context of African mining transactions involving cross-border transfer of min-
            eral commodities to related parties.
       •	   There is a need for better targeting training to the needs of the different four phases of the
            transfer pricing process and to better balance its group ‘classroom’ approach with the individ-
            ual ‘learning-by-doing’ approach. The latter may include medium-term secondment of prom-
            ising candidates to work in more advanced jurisdictions as well as secondments of transfer
            pricing experts to the tax administration to assist with the conduct of complex audits with
            emphasis on knowledge transfer.
       •	   In mineral-rich jurisdictions it would be advantageous for tax officers dealing with specific
            large mining taxpayers to attend courses designed to familiarize non-mining professionals
            with technological aspects of mining and metallurgy. If this type of ‘mining for non-miners’
            courses are not available in local tertiary institutions, then arrangements should be made with
            the local geological survey and department of mines to organize such briefings, which may
            last one week and include field visits to mining operations.
       •	   Regional expertise pooling and cooperative initiatives for capacity and knowledge sharing
            should be strongly supported. This would include initiatives for the acquisition of multiuser
            licenses for comparables databases, the OECD’s ‘tax inspectors without borders’ initiative
            and the establishment of multinational transfer pricing units (MNTPUs) leading to potentially
            significant synergies through pooling of transfer pricing expertise across a region on the basis
            of well-established and mutually beneficial arrangements in relation to establishing auditing
            priorities and allocating related costs. These MTPUs should also seek the potential tech-
            nical participation and funding from appropriate international agencies and/or other donor
            countries.
                                                                                                      9
                       Discussion and Conclusions

The study confirmed that transfer pricing represents a major issue in the context of the taxation of
the mining subsidiaries of MNEs operating in mineral-rich developing countries, particularly in
Africa given the economic importance of this industry on the continent.

In the absence of significant investment incentives or regulatory constraints on the side of the
governments hosting their mining operations, MNEs exercise their legal choice as to the way they
wish to structure their global business and locate their different functions/activities in a manner that
maximises returns to their shareholders. The trend has been for MNEs to locate some of the downstream
processing activities and many of the unique high-value functions of the mining value chain and
related intangible assets into specialized entities or hubs frequently resident in low-tax jurisdictions.

MNEs contend that consolidation of specialized functions into hubs servicing their global
operations is not driven primarily by tax-minimisation considerations, but by the objective of
achieving critical mass, proximity to customers, to shipping and trading centres and research
facilities, as well as attracting and retaining the necessary highly skilled personnel by stationing
them in attractive locations. Preventing such restructuring, however, is very difficult for a host
country government, particularly where the firm can make a strong business case for it. However,
the extreme complexity and artificiality of some of these business structures, sometime also the
result of ‘treaty shopping’ to obtain benefits and to circumvent the restrictions arising from the
generally limited double taxation treaty networks in Africa, would point to the fact that they are
in fact largely designed to minimise the MNE’s tax liabilities at the consolidated level, as in fact
admitted by some international mining executives.

The inevitable consequences of such restructuring are that:

    ■■   The tax base of the source country is eroded as profit is shifted abroad;
    ■■   The functions of the MNE’s mining subsidiaries are often stripped down primarily to rou-
         tine physical activities utilising tangible assets, that is to say to those of a ‘contract miner’;
    ■■   Few mining companies in Africa are fully vertically integrated and frequently export
         crushed and screened ore after limited beneficiation (as for instance iron ore and coal for
         production of steel and power generation), or concentrates and/or other intermediate
         products to smelters/refiners for their conversion into refined metallic products; and
    ■■   As a consequence, mining companies have become increasingly reliant on a very signifi-
         cant number of cross-border transactions for the provision of high-value, specialised ser-
         vices and assets, many of which are conducted with related entities which are part of the
         same MNE group.

In the final analysis it is a matter of fact and adjustments will be appropriate where substance does
not equal form or reality doesn’t equal the totality and there is no clear business purpose, only a
tax minimization motivation. In some cases compliance with the arm’s length principle may call
for re-characterization of a transaction.

Our research, which analyzed the cost composition of current mining operations for some of the
main commodities in Africa, indicates that some of these transactions may involve significant

                                            190

    flows. Significant inbound flows relate to payments for transfers of intermediate to refined mineral
    products to related parties. Outbound flows include a range of payments for both routine (e.g.,
    corporate services) and specialised (e.g., marketing, treasury/financing, insurance, logistics and
    technical/R&D) goods and services provided by related parties.

    It is therefore paramount that industry should set the related transfer prices on the basis of the
    arm’s length principle as espoused in the OECD transfer pricing Guidelines, that is to say that the
    ‘conditions’ surrounding the transaction would have been agreed to by independent parties, and
    that tax administrations should have the capacity to ascertain that they are actually compliant
    with it.

    Our review, however, has indicated that this may not be the case in many instances for a variety of
    reasons including the fact that:

        ■■   There is no shortage of examples of related party transactions which mining companies
             would not have independently enter into because the conditions could have reasonably
             been expected to lead to them trading at a long-term loss. Acting without compulsion,
             mining companies would have been unlikely to accept clearly excessive discounts on min-
             eral products sales and/or excessive prices charged for good and services, including high
             interest and fees on borrowing and guarantees, nor would they have divested of assets,
             at times well below their market values, to an entity in a low tax jurisdiction and subse-
             quently pay that entity premium fees and/or royalties for their use;
        ■■   Most of the mineral products transferred to related smelters/refiners or marketing hubs
             are intermediate products for which there are no stringent specifications and readily avail-
             able market prices, which creates opacity and opportunities for manipulation;
        ■■   Some transactions, particularly those involving hard-to-value specialised marketing,
             technical/R&D, management and legal know-how and related intangible assets and IP,
             are often not transparent and tax administrations are generally denied access to specific
             financial information relating to the relevant foreign service providers;
        ■■   In spite of most jurisdictions having thin capitalisation rules in place, there is still a range
             of unresolved conceptual issues relating to the provision of financial services by related
             entities, such as determining appropriate risk premiums for interest charged on intercom-
             pany loans and guarantee fees, which make these types of transactions potentially open
             to abuse;
        ■■   Due to the domestic unavailability of some of the specialised services, there are generally
             no local sources of comparable uncontrolled prices, particularly for typical mining specific
             transactions and tax authorities must rely on comparables databases primarily based on
             non-mining-related overseas information in most cases irrelevant to Africa;
        ■■   For reasons of inadequate resourcing and transfer pricing expertise, most jurisdictions in
             Africa, while having recently developed some form of transfer pricing legislation, have,
             with very few exceptions, so far been incapable to effectively enforce it, with very few
             transfer pricing audits being carried out in general and extremely few specific to mining.
             Indeed there is within most tax administrations an inadequate degree of in-depth knowl-
             edge of the mining industry, its activities and processes and generally an inadequate level
             of communication and cooperation with other government institutions, such as depart-
             ments of mines and geological surveys, where such critical expertise resides.

    To address the first issue, in the absence of detailed financial information relating to the cost
    incurred and the margin applied by the service provider, tax authorities must analyze the nature of
    the related contract in terms of the function undertaken, the people, skills and assets utilised and
    the risk born e, to assess whether the economic substance of the deal justifies the charges imposed.
    In addition the tax authority should negotiate tax information exchange agreements with key juris-
    dictions in which service providers are residents. This may lead to adjustments and, in exceptional
    circumstances, to re-characterisation of the transaction in question into what the arm’s length con-
    ditions should have really been. This action is generally strongly resisted by taxpayers on the basis
192	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             of its potential for double taxation, but this danger may be exaggerated as it can be in most cases
             addressed through MAP171 and through the general practice in most jurisdictions to provide for-
             eign taxation credits or exemptions. With time some of these information gaps will hopefully be
             filled by increased bilateral and multilateral international exchanges of tax information agreements
             aided by improved computer capacity and the implementation of the BEPS country-by-country
             reporting initiative.

             In the short term, governments may attempt to capture a greater proportion of the rents from
             licensing access to their nonrenewable mineral resources in the ground, that is, before the value
             chain starts and of profits through withholding taxes on outgoing remittances for dividends, inter-
             est, royalties and fees for use of specialized assets and services. The effectiveness of this approach,
             however, may be reduced or even impeded by the existence of unfavorable DTAs.

             The complexity of determining an arm’s length price for the transfer of mineral products to a related
             party increases the further upstream the product transferred is from its final refined metallic form
             satisfying the specification requirements of an established terminal market providing daily price
             quotations. Even in the case of downstream processed metallic commodities, the terms of off-take
             agreements, particularly excessively flexible conditions as to the price determination modalities
             within their ‘quotation period’ and timing of payments, can present challenges in making appro-
             priate adjustments to the reference price. The ‘sixth method’, adopting the price of the commodity
             quoted on the day of its loading for export as the basis for other necessary adjustments, appears to
             have been effectively used by many South American jurisdictions and may be worth considering in
             other developing countries. When it comes to intermediate mineral products such as concentrates,
             however, due to the great variety of possible unique quality factors potentially significantly affect-
             ing their arm’s length price, the situation becomes extremely more complex. Besides good physical
             monitoring of quantities and qualities of exports by Customs, and because of the absence of quo-
             tations and comparables, auditing would require extremely specialised technical and marketing
             knowledge not generally present in tax administrations, and adjustments would most likely be
             conductive to disputes. A possible approach in the future may be to seriously consider the nego-
             tiation of APAs with major producers leading to a transfer price expressed as a set percentage of
             the value of the metal contained in the concentrate based on its quotation price if available. This
             negotiation process may be assisted, if necessary, by specialised external consultants. Nonetheless,
             some technical training will be required for tax officials, who generally have legal and accounting
             professional backgrounds, with regard to metal accounting and mining economic concepts in gen-
             eral. Timing of payment outside normal industry practice could be addressed by the imputation of
             interest on the abnormal credit extended between the parties.

             In the case of routine corporate support services, valid comparables may exist because in most
             cases there are active local service providers, and global and regional databases may have some
             degree of relevance to the African situation. The question still remains as to whether, due to the
             controlled nature of the transactions, there may not be a tendency to overservice the mining sub-
             sidiary. For nonroutine specialised services, such as marketing and technical services, auditing is
             harder, as the costs involved in providing these services in the accounting records of the mining
             company in the source country is generally an aggregated measure of the related expenses. To the
             extent that the accounts of the foreign suppliers are generally not accessible to the tax administra-
             tion, it is very difficult if not impossible to analyze their charges in terms of the fixed and variable
             costs incurred and the margins demanded for their services. In addition most databases express
             these charges as a percentage of the value of sales or of the capital cost of the project being devel-
             oped, which is not helpful in truly determining to what degree they comply with the arm’s length
             principle. A tax authority will need to adapt to use these aggregated percentage ratios as a basis for
             comparison and exercise their best judgement to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether they are
             relevant to the services being audited and whether the unique skills and assets used and the risks


             171
                   Where a treaty applies, MAP procedures may not resolve all double taxation issues.
	                                                        Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   193


    borne by the supplier justify the position of the charge within the often wide inter-quartile range,
    or make adjustments if necessary. The higher side of the range may be justified if the function
    performed makes significant use of innovative, proprietary, often patented intangibles, techniques
    and processes, unless a separate user licence or royalty has been charged for their use. Administra-
    tions must, however, be weary of ‘soft IP’ claims. Unfortunately comparables databases relating to
    IP valuation and licences/royalties for their use are particularly rare and in general not specific to
    mining. Finally the current push for recognition in the allocation of profits of LSAs in source coun-
    tries, which in the context of mining would include the value of ‘ready access to mineral resources’
    in Africa, should be supported and systematised.

    The debt to equity ratios allowed by current thin capitalisation rules in Africa (i.e., typically
    in the range of 2:1 to 3:1), while possibly valid for general application, often exceed the ratios
    typically observed in mining elsewhere in the world as the industry is viewed as risky and its
    assets essentially illiquid. Its concessionary nature represents an incentive for MNEs to fund
    their operations through the highest possible level of either intra-group loans or a combination of
    debt facilities from both related and unrelated sources, with the latter secured for the enhanced
    financial risk through guarantees provided by a related entity. Issues do also arise in terms of
    whether a risk premium should be added over the MNE’s cost of borrowing in determining the
    interest rate to be applied to the loans provided to a mining subsidiary in a risky developing
    country. Such a practice, as well as that of MNEs lending from retained sources of cash, may, if
    unchecked, lead to a situation where interest deductions at the consolidated MNE level exceed
    the interest expenses actually incurred. This issue, which in part relates to the practice of ring-
    fencing of mining subsidiaries, has been addressed and with time will be resolved if African
    jurisdictions adopt the OECD’s BEPS Action IV recommendation to allow an entity to deduct
    net interest expenses up to a benchmark net interest/EBITDA ratio to be set within a corridor of
    10% to 30%. Meanwhile, some jurisdictions have resorted to only allow deductions based on the
    average consolidated borrowing cost of the MNE or capping the allowable interest using a rate
    derived by adding a defined premium (e.g., 200 points) to a regularly published international
    rate of interest such as LIBOR. As to financial guarantees and other forms of guarantees, insur-
    ances and hedging, the criteria for deductibility should be heavily weighted on whether and/or
    to what a degree the related arrangements actually shift risk from the MNE at the consolidated
    level to a third unrelated party.

    Finally, the assistance provided by various international institutions is gradually ensuring that
    most African jurisdictions have or soon will have an adequate legislative basis to address transfer
    pricing issues in their countries. The main challenge is now to put in place adequate administrative
    capacity to effectively enforce it. The problem has two dimensions, that is to say transfer pricing
    in the general taxation context and specifically in mining, and the possible solutions will differ as
    a function of the current and projected importance of this industry and the size of its participants
    in the context of the various countries’ economies, which have been quantified in Part B. Letting
    aside for the moment the critical question of availability of specialised resources, in mineral econo-
    mies, the establishment of a large taxpayer unit (LTU) with special functional sections, including
    a transfer pricing one and, in some cases, even of a specialised mining section within it, may be
    justifiable. The establishment of a market-based structure and particularly of an LTU need to be
    weighed against the danger of possible cultural isolation from the rest of the organisation, duplica-
    tion of internal functions and efforts and may in some cases not represent the best way of deploy-
    ing the specialised resources. Structuring along tax types or functions may provide an alternative
    if resources are, as in the case of most African administrations, scarce. Transfer pricing issues could
    then be either addressed in the context of general tax audits, or with the support of embedded
    transfer pricing specialists or, at the limit, a stand-alone specialist unit may be established to carry
    out specific transfer pricing audits. The last approach is currently relatively rare in Africa, but
    establishment of specialised transfer pricing units may be justifiable in the case of some jurisdic-
    tions in the future. It must, however, be ensured that other important areas of tax administration, as
    for instance of thin capitalisation and capital allowances rules, are not neglected in the process. The
    main issue is, of course, how to resource an appropriate structure in terms of securing personnel
194	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             with the necessary transfer pricing skills even when the financial resources to do so may be made
             available. This is because government’s employment conditions are generally uncompetitive in
             tapping a limited pool of qualified tax professionals relative to those in the private sector, which
             makes it difficult for government to portray itself as an employer of choice. In the case of Africa this
             is likely to be a long-protracted process involving significant training of possibly bonded internal
             resources including secondment to more advanced tax jurisdictions and the establishment of fol-
             low-up mentoring and clear career paths, temporary use of external tax specialists with emphasis
             on transfer of knowledge, the establishment of ad hoc or regional specialist Multinational Trans-
             fer Pricing Units (MNTPUs) units pooling expertise from various countries based on agreed pri-
             oritisation and cost-sharing rules, implementation of the OECD’s ‘tax inspectors without borders’
             initiative, etc. Cooperative approaches may also include the joint acquisition and sharing of key
             comparables databases, and of knowledge-sharing and e-learning platforms, which would other-
             wise prove unaffordable for individual tax administrations.

             Experience suggests that in the case of transfer pricing prevention is better than cure. Most cases
             that have led to litigation in court were lengthy, expensive, absorbed significant resources and by
             and large proved unsuccessful for tax administrations. There is no doubt that emphasis must be
             placed on promoting voluntary compliance and reducing litigation, which in the African context
             will require significant improvement in taxpayer relations, lessening of the current tendency for
             adversarial positions, communication and consultation and significant strengthening of tax admin-
             istration negation skills.

             In essence, improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of administration of transfer pricing
             rules and audits in Africa against a background of continuous and fast expansion and evolution of
             global trade will need to keep pace with it, which will involve significant cost and require both a
             concerted effort at the domestic level and continued international support. These actions, however,
             should not detract from the significant effort still needed to lift the generally inadequate tax admin-
             istration capacity of many African jurisdictions.

                             copper for which vessel space has been booked, pricing has been established or quo-
                             tational period is running or any payment has been made.
                  15.	 SUSPENSION OF QUOTATIONS
                       15.1	The metal prices and currency quotations specified under this Agreement are the
                             quotations in general use for the pricing of the metal content of the concentrate.
                       15.2	 In the event that any of these price quotations cease to exist or cease to be published
                             or should no longer be internationally recognized as the basis for the settlement of
                             concentrate contracts, then upon the request of either party, the Seller and the Buyer
                             will promptly consult together with a view to agree on a new pricing basis and on
                             the date for bringing such basis into effect. The basic objective will be to secure the
                             continuity of fair pricing.
                  16.	 DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                       Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement including any question
                       regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved
                       by arbitration under the Rules of the London Commission of international Arbitration
                       (“LCIA”), which Rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Clause. The
                       tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one to be nominated by Buyer, one by Seller and
                       the third by the President of the LCIA. In case either party fails to nominate its arbitrator
                       then he will be appointed by the President of the LCIA. However, it is understood that

           both parties shall be entitled to take any reasonable measures for the protection of rights
           accrued to them by this Agreement without prejudice to the provisions of this Clause.
           The arbitration shall be held in London, England. The arbitration tribunal shall state in its
           award in detail the facts of the case and reasons for its decision. The award shall be final
           and binding and not subject to appeal.
    17.	   CHOICE OF LAW
           17.1	 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law.
           17.2	 The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Concen-

                 metals or on commercial documents relating thereto or on the cargo itself, imposed in
                 the country of origin shall be borne by the Seller.
           18.2	 Any taxes, tariffs and duties whether existing or new on the Products or contained
                 metals or on commercial documents relating thereto or on the cargo itself, imposed in

    19.	   LICENSES
           The Seller undertakes that all the necessary export licenses and all other authorizations
           required for the Products have been obtained (and/or will be obtained) for the entire quan-
           tity covered by this Agreement. The Seller furthermore guarantees that such licenses will
           remain in force for the full life of the Agreement.
    20.	   ASSIGNMENT
           20.1	 Without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unrea-
                 sonably withheld, neither party may assign its rights or obligations under this Agree-
                 ment in full or in part except that the Seller shall be entitled to assign its rights under
                 this Agreement by way of security to providers of funding to the Seller without the
                 consent of the Buyer.
           20.2	 Except as expressly provided in Clause 20, a person who is not a party to this Agree-

                 to enforce any term of this Agreement but this does not affect any right or remedy of
                 a third party which exists or is available apart from the Act.
    21.	   DEFAULT
           21.1	Upon the occurrence and during the duration of an Event of Default, the Non­               -
                 Defaulting Party may in its sole discretion:
                 (a)	 notify the Defaulting Party of an early termination date (which shall be no ear-
                       lier than the date of such notice) on which this Agreement and the transactions
                       contemplated hereunder shall terminate;
                 (b)	 withhold any prepayments due to the Defaulting Patty until such Event of
                       Default is cured; and/or
                 (c)	 suspend performance of its obligations under this Agreement until such Event of
                       Default is cured.
                 If a notice of an Early Termination Date is given under this Clause 21.1, the Early Ter-
                 mination Date will occur on the designated date whether or not the relevant Event of
                 Default is then continuing.
           21.2	 If an Early Termination Date is established, the Non-Defaulting Party:
                 (a)	 shall in good faith calculate its aggregate net gains, or losses and costs resulting
                       from the termination of the Agreement and notify the Defaulting Patty of the
                       aggregate net amount owed or owing as of the Early Termination Date, or, if that
                       is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter that is reasonably
                       practicable.
                       (i)	 If the aggregated amount shows a net loss, the Defaulting Patty shall, within
                             five (5) days of its receipt of such notice pay an amount equal to that loss to
                             the Non-Defaulting Party, including interest at 4% above the base rate from
                             time to time of [Lloyds TSB Bank pie] from the Early Termination Date until

                                           paid, plus any other amounts due and owing under this Agreement (or oth-
                                           erwise) to the Non-Defaulting Party.
                                     (ii)	 If the aggregated amount shows a net gain the Non-Defaulting Party shall,
                                           after giving effect to any setoff rights in accordance with Clause 21.2(b) and
                                           subject to Clause 21.3, pay the net amount without interest to the Defaulting
                                           Party on the date twenty (20) days after the Early Termination Date.
                               (b)	 may (at its election) set off any or all amounts which the Defaulting Party owes
                                     to the Non-Defaulting Party under this Agreement or otherwise against any or
                                     all amounts which the Non-Defaulting Party owes to the Defaulting Party under
                                     this Agreement or otherwise.
                         21.3	 Each party acknowledges that the payment obligations set forth in this Clause 21 are
                               a reasonable approximation of the anticipated harm or loss and acknowledges the
                               difficulty of estimation of actual damages, and each party hereby waives the right to
                               contest such payments as unenforceable, a penalty or otherwise. Neither party shall
                               be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such harm or loss.
                  22.	   INDIRECT LOSSES
                         Neither the Seller nor the Buyer shall be liable, whether in Agreement or in tort or other-
                         wise, for indirect, consequential or special damages or losses of whatsoever nature, how-
                         ever caused.
                  23.	   INCOTERMS 2000
                         Insofar as not inconsistent herewith INCOTERMS 2000 (and any later amendments thereto)
                         shall apply to this Agreement.
                  24.	   CHANGE OF CONTROL
                         In the event of any actual change in the organization, control or management of the Seller,
                         including without limitation, a change to the majority shareholding or privatization or
                         equivalent process of the Seller, subject always to Clause 20, herein, this Agreement will
                         not be changed or in any way modified and shall continue in full force and effect.
                  25.	   CONFIDENTIALITY
                         Each party shall use its best efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Agreement and all
                         information disclosed to it concerning the other party and its assets and businesses and not

    Functional Analysis Questionnaire

The functional analysis is a critical step in transfer pricing compliance. The questions asked and
documents sought in this step seek to verify that what is reported to the tax administration reflects
what is actually being done—the ‘actual conditions’.

Importantly, no discussion of comparability or pricing should take place until after the facts are
established by the functional analysis.

The goal of the functional analysis step is to establish: who should get what for the functions per-
formed and identify which parties are responsible for key value-added activity.

The actual rather than alleged drivers of profitability need to be factually established and this will be
critical evidence for any adjustments that may occur and any subsequent negotiations or litigation.

It is important that the functional analysis be conducted at the taxpayer’s offices and mining facili-
ties as it is these assets and personnel that the auditor will be verifying. The people interviewed
should be those performing the function rather than the taxpayer’s accountant, lawyer or advisor.

The output of the functional analysis provides the basis for determining:

    ■■   who will be the ‘tested party’,
    ■■   what is the most appropriate transfer pricing methodology,
    ■■   what are most appropriate comparables.

Note that the miner in Africa may have been stripped of a number of functions, particularly alleg-
edly high-value ones, and so a number of the questions of ‘what’ functions are performed in the
Country, are likely to be met with a ‘No’ answer and the questions of ‘who does the function, are
likely to be met with ‘Don’t know.’

In these situations it may be necessary to consider the use of ‘Exchange of Information’ with the
other Country tax authority or consider how to continue to progress the audit in the absence of
such information.

To guard against requested information being produced as counter evidence in litigation, consid-
eration may need to be given to barring the subsequent production of evidence in defence after it
had been requested in the Audit phase. (See Section 264A in the Australian Income Tax Assessment
Act.) The aim would be to encourage the production of all relevant facts to the tax administration
during the audit and limit ‘new’ facts being produced afterwards. This is not dissimilar from the
effect of discovery processes in commercial litigation.

Example functional analysis questions—these would need to be altered or supplemented depend-
ing upon the actual situation being audited.

             for the Main Mineral Commodities

B.3.1  Precious Metals
          Precious metals are an important part of the mining landscape in Africa. Early mining in Africa
          had been dominated first by gold mining from South Africa’s extraordinary Witwatersrand gold
          deposits, and second by platinum in the Bushveld Complex. Gold in Southern and West Africa and
          Platinum Group Minerals (PGM) mostly in Southern Africa account for almost half of the operat-
          ing and exploration projects in the continent, including projects that have reached the advanced
          study stage. As a result, extraction of these commodities contributes substantially to government
          revenues from mining across the continent, justifying the direction of auditing resources to these
          sectors. Considering the size of the deposits and the scale of the investment required, gold and
          platinum mining are attractive to large multinational companies. This combination, along with a
          strong international demand, creates risk for BEPS through transfer mispricing.

          The issue of transfer pricing has been brought into focus in South Africa as it is alleged that it may
          affect the capacity of certain mines to comply with the Mining Charter173 for the transformation of
          the mining sector. This has been particularly the case for platinum group metals (PGMs) produc-
          ers following revelations during the Marikana Commission hearings, where, while discussing the
          sales of PGMs through a Bermuda-based marketing subsidiary, a high ranking officer of one of

              The South African Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) aims, as one of its
          fundamental principles, to empower Historically Disadvantaged South Africans (HDSAs) who were affected by
          Apartheid policies. The combination of Charter and Scorecard provides for the empowerment of HDSAs to be mean-

               B.3.1.1 Gold

               Industry profile: World production and resources

               The gold industry is very fragmented.175 This is in contrast to other segments of the mining indus-
               try in which a few large companies dominate production. As can be seen in Figure D.2, gold has
               historically been found in various quantities around the globe, in deposits that are typically smaller
               than those of other minerals due to its relative scarcity. Coupled with relatively low market entry
               barriers, the global gold industry is characterized by many small and intensely competitive firms.

               In 2012, world production of gold was calculated to be 2,690 tonnes.176 In 2013, total production
               reached 2,982 tonnes,177 and world gold reserves in 2014 were estimated to be 55,000 tonnes.178 This
               increase in production was mainly due to growing supply coming from China (Table D.1).

               When looking at the future of the global gold sector, it is expected that Africa will remain a major
               player and grow from current levels of around 20% of global production. As depicted in Figure D.3,
               since the year 2000 a greater proportion of the total gold deposits and promising projects identified
               have been on the African continent, which bodes well in terms of increasing levels of future activity.

               Current African producers: Production size and geographical distribution

               The gold industry represents a significant proportion of mining activities taking place on the Afri-
               can continent. As Table D.2 shows, of the 286 current mining operations, 101 are producing gold.

                    Most gold mines in Africa are vertically integrated from exploration through development and
                    mining to processing operations, including smelting and in some cases refining, and even sales.
                    Sales products for gold mining operations in Africa are typically in the form of refined metal (doré).
                    However, the level of purity for these products will vary depending upon the requirements of
                    specific customers, and to meet the standards of terminal bullion markets. Because of its inherent
                    value and high density, gold does not create any major requirement in terms of its transportation
                    to the refiners and/or to markets, apart from security and insurance issues.

                    A review of RIU’s Register of African Mining shows that currently there are approximately
                    101 operations in production on the African continent, categorized in Table D.4181 by size of opera-
                    tions, whether the operations are predominantly surface or underground workings and geographi-
                    cal location. As shown, the majority of gold mining operations in Africa are, or are partially, surface
                    mines (65%), with just under half (48%) falling into the “medium” size category based upon the
                    statistical analysis discussed below.

                    Table D.4 shows that the majority of the gold mining operations182 are based in either the south-
                    ern region of the African continent, with 28 operations in South Africa (34%), 8 operations in

                    A further investigation shows that the majority of surface gold mines (71%) are located in the West
                    African region, while 83% of the remaining operations are in the southern African region (South

                    gold mining nation of South Africa has the most advanced study stage projects (13), Burkina Faso

    is not far behind (11), and when combined with the rest of the West African region, the number of
    advanced study stage projects exceeds those in South Africa, signaling that this region may take
    over as the largest gold producer on the African continent. This notion is also supported by the
    wave of exploration being undertaken in that area. As shown in Table D.4, the African continent is
    scattered with projects exploring for gold mineralization (397 listed across 35 countries), with more
    than half (233) being in the West African region, 46 in Tanzania and only 7 in South Africa.

    From the database of operating African mines that has been compiled for this study (Appen-
    dix B.2),183 mines in each commodity group were classified according to their annual production
    throughput as small, medium or large. Table D.5 displays the results of this statistical analysis for
    the surface and underground gold mining operations184 that are currently in production on the
    African continent. In this table, the “typical” mine is taken to be the midpoint of each size category
    range, with the upper bounds for Q1 and Q3 being shown in italics.

    Broad revenue and cost considerations for risk analysis and audit prioritization

    Small mispricing differences between TPs and at arm’s length prices, when occurring in the context
    of very large items of either revenue or expenses, can result in significant tax leakages. For instance,
    on an annualized basis the gross revenue generated by a typical gold mining operation in Africa
    can range from as little as US$44 million in the case of a small underground mine to as much as
    US$370 million from a large surface operation. Table D.6 provides a complete listing of the order
    of magnitude estimates of the gross annual value of mineral extracted for the typical gold mining
    operations.185

        Those operations that are composed of a combination of surface and underground operations, or that are in transi-

    data for operations that may be in a ramp-up or ramp-down phase.

             Furthermore, mining operations also incur substantial expenses for not only construction, plant
             and equipment of a capital nature, but also consumables and specialty services, which in many
             cases are provided by a related overseas party. The level of potential risk to the tax base will be
             dependent upon the nature of the mining operation, as the different characteristics will dictate a
             different mix of capital and operating expenditures and sources of procurement.

             Table D.7 shows the general cost breakup186 and magnitude of expenditure for items that may be
             incurred by the “typical” surface gold mining operations identified in Table D.4 from the database
             of current operations on the African continent.

             The typical median size surface gold mining operation in Africa has a throughput of 7,500 tonnes
             of ore per day. With an assumed stripping ratio of 4:1, this mine would have annual recurrent
             operating costs (mine and mill activities) of approximately USD73 million, of which approximately
             USD30 million would be spent on supplies and consumables, and approximately USD6 million on
             administration. These two components, which may be subject to the use of transfer prices between
             associated parties, account for approximately 49% of the annual operating budget in this typical
             operation. Looking at a typical small surface gold mine, these costs will typically rise to 56% of the
             annual operating budget, and fall to 39% of the annual operating budget in a typical large mine.

             When looking at the absolute value of these components in a typical medium surface gold mine,
             they total approximately USD36 million annually. If these expenses were to be charged at 5%
             above the typical amount (USD38 million instead of USD36 million) the reduction in taxes payable,
             assuming a 30% tax rate, would be approximately USD0.6 million per year. If this same calcula-
             tion is made for a large surface mine, the annual reduction in tax revenue rises to about USD1.65

    million. If the supplies and consumables category is disaggregated as in Table D.8, it can be seen
    that the largest proportion of annual expenditures will be associated with the processing stages
    of the operation (grinding media and mill liners, processing agents, and fuel). In the medium size
    operation, these components can account for approximately 78% of the annual expenditure on
    “supplies and consumables.” As a result, it would be considered good practice for the tax author-
    ity to have knowledge of mineral processing so that these items of expenditure can be competently
    audited for fair pricing practices.

    Looking at the initial capital expenditures that would be required for these mines, the components
    associated with the purchase and installation of plant and equipment and those associated with
    specialized engineering and management services are considered to be of the highest risk of being
    subject to the use of transfer prices. These categories of capital expenditure account for 57%, 57%
    and 68% of the total capital expenditure for a small, medium and large surface gold mining opera-
    tion respectively. Of these, the purchase of plant and equipment is by far the largest expense. Com-
    parable transactions can be found for the majority of equipment purchased by a mining operation,
    hence opportunities for transfer mispricing are to some degree constrained. Transfer mispricing,
    however, can still occur in the context of funding of these capital items by either internal loans or
    leasing. By contrast, as already discussed in Part A when dealing with the MNEs’ use of Engineer-
    ing, Science and Technical hubs, there is greater ambiguity and opportunities for potential mispric-
    ing in the areas of engineering and management services.

    The comparable cost data for the underground gold mining operations are presented in Table D.9,
    indicating that the typical medium size underground gold mining operation has a throughput of
    1,500 tonnes of ore per day. If a sublevel open stoping mining method is used, this mine would
    have annual operating expenses (mine and mill activities) of approximately USD31  million, of
    which approximately USD12 million would be spent on supplies and consumables, and approxi-
    mately USD4.5 million on administration, together accounting for 53% of the annual operating
    budget. Comparing this to the typical small underground gold mine, these costs will typically be
    51% of the annual operating budget, and 59% of the annual operating budget in a typical large
    sized operation.

    When looking at the absolute value of these components for the typical large underground gold
    mine, it can be seen that the largest annual expenditure will be on supplies and consumables rather
    than labor and equipment operation, as was the case for the surface mining operations. These sup-
    plies and consumables can total approximately USD21 million annually. If these expenses were to
    be charged at 5% above the typical amount (USD22 million instead of USD21 million) the reduction
    in taxes payable, assuming a 30% tax rate, would be approximately USD0.3 million per year. If the

B.3.2  Base Metals
               Ownership of base metal mines (copper, lead and zinc) in Africa is generally more consolidated
               than their counterparts around the globe. A few base metal mines in Africa are fully vertically
               integrated to the point where they carry out sales of refined metals.187 In general, however, they are
               only vertically integrated down to the concentration stage and sell concentrates to related or third
               party smelters. This entails significant land and sea freight transport activities. The main constraint
               for developing smelting capacity, besides availability of significant reserves of high-quality ores, is
               the availability of a sufficient, reliable and affordable energy supply.

               B.3.2.1 Copper

               Industry profile: World production and resources

               Copper was one of the first metals to be mined and is still one of the most important industrial min-
               erals due to its high conductivity and corrosion resistant properties. However, due to its low mar-
               ket price, compared to that of gold, PGMs and other high-value minerals and progressively lower
               grades being mined, mining copper economically requires first, relatively large operations to move
               substantial tonnages of material and second, advanced copper extraction and refining technolo-
               gies. These create relatively high barriers to entry that lead to a global industry that is dominated
               by fewer large operations. As can be seen in Figure D.4, the occurrence of copper deposits has
               tended to be grouped, within a relatively small number of countries hosting significant deposits

             that contribute disproportionately to total global production. Copper at 12% of global demand by
             value, along with gold, iron ore188 and coal189 (by both value and mass) dominate world markets for
             minerals and metals.

             In 2013, world mine production of copper was calculated to be 18.1 million tonnes, representing an
             8.4% increase from 2012, and production is expected to continue growing at a compound annual
             rate of 3.9% over the period from 2014 to 2020.190 Table D.11 shows that production of copper metal
             continues to be dominated by Chile, contributing just under one-third of the total supply. In fact,
             the top five producing countries accounted for more than 60% of total world production in 2013,
             and were expected to make a similar contribution in 2014.

             When looking at the future of the global copper sector, it is expected that Africa will be a major
             player. In this context it is worth noting that the reserve figures for the DRC and Zambia do not
             reflect the very significant exploration potential of these countries for this metal. As depicted in
             Figure D.5, Africa as a continent contributed approximately 5% to total production in 2011. This fig-
             ure grew to approximately 8.5% and 10% of world production in 2012 and 2013 respectively.191 As
             some of the large Chilean copper mines mature and realize lower grade material, production from
             the African continent will be well positioned to play a role of increasing importance into the future.

             Current African producers: Production size and geographical distribution

             Currently, the copper industry represents a substantial proportion of the mining-related activities
             taking place on the African continent. As illustrated in Table D.2, of the 286 producing mining
             operations on the African continent, 26 of them are copper operations, which ranks fourth among
             commodities. However, the future importance of copper to the African continent becomes appar-
             ent when looking at the number of projects in the advanced study stage or exploration stage, with

                     whether they are predominantly surface or underground workings and geographical location. As
                     shown, the majority of the copper mining operations in Africa are, or are partially, surface mines
                     (65%), with more than half (54%) falling into the “medium” size category based upon the statistical
                     analysis. Table D.13 also shows that the majority of the copper mining operations193 are based in
                     the DRC (10) and Zambia (8). A further investigation shows that the majority of copper mines in
                     the DRC are surface operations, while Zambia, with the exception of two large surface mines, has
                     predominantly underground operations.

                     The review of the African mining database also shows that there is a strong pipeline for copper min-
                     ing in Africa, with more projects at advanced study stages as currently in production. Of interest is

    advanced study stage projects, 11 and 5 respectively, Namibia also has 7 projects in this classifica-
    tion. The notion that future production may come from these three countries is supported when
    looking at the distribution of exploration projects across the continent, as combined they account
    for 50 of the 79 copper exploration projects.

    As done for gold mining operations, an analysis of the operating African mines database (Appen-
    dix B.1)194 was undertaken to identify the characteristics of “typical” copper mines on the African
    continent. Table D.14 displays the results of the statistical analysis for the surface and underground
    copper mining operations195 that are currently in production.

    Broad revenue and cost considerations for risk analysis and audit prioritization

    As already mentioned, small mispricing differences between TPs and at arm’s length prices when
    occurring in the context of very large revenue items can result in significant tax leakages. For
    instance, if after smelting and refining charges a company receives payment for 78% of the value of
    the copper contained in the concentrate,196 on an annualized basis the gross revenue generated by a
    typical copper mining operation in Africa can range from as little as USD20.7 million in the case of
    a small underground mine to as much as USD1.48 billion from a large surface operation. Table D.15
    provides a complete listing of the order of magnitude estimates of the annual value of mineral in
    the ground for the typical copper mining operations identified through the statistical analysis.

    If the smelter is a related entity, and the price it pays for the copper in the concentrate is 90% of the
    prevailing spot price (say USD5,968/t rather than USD6,631/t), revenue would be reduced to the
    NSRs shown in Table D.16, resulting in an erosion of the tax base of between USD2 million and
    USD148 million depending upon the type of operation, irrespective of the mining and milling costs

        Those operations that are composed of a combination of surface and underground operations, or that are in transi-

             incurred to produce the concentrate. Assuming a 30% tax rate, the magnitude of the tax leakage
             would be in the order of between USD0.6 million and USD44.4 million. These estimates are predi-
             cated on the basis that the weight and grade of concentrates transferred to a related smelter have
             not been understated, which re-enforces the need for thorough physical controls and exchange of
             relevant information between different government agencies, e.g., tax authority, Department of
             Mines, Customs, etc.

             It can be concluded that the prices used to transfer intermediate products between related parties is
             an area of potentially very high tax sensitivity and warrants special attention in the audit process.
             This type of information will help alert taxing authorities about unusual transactions resulting in
             anomalous cost structures and in protracted low profitability or loss making relative to peers.

             However, revenues are not the only area of focus. As with the gold analysis, copper mines also
             incur substantial capital and operating expenses for goods and services, which in many cases will
             be provided through or by a related overseas party. Again, the level of potential risk to the tax base
             will be dependent upon the nature of the mining operation, as the different characteristics will
             dictate a different mix of capital and operating expenditures.

             Table D.17 shows the general cost breakup and magnitude of expenditure for items that may be
             incurred by the “typical” surface copper mining operations identified in Table D.14. The typical
             median size surface copper mining operation has a throughput of 9,500 tonnes of ore per day.
             With an assumed stripping ratio of 4:1, this mine would have annual operating costs (mine and
             mill activities) of approximately USD88 million, of which approximately USD34 million would be
             spent on supplies and consumables, and approximately USD7 million on administration. These
             two components, which may be subject to the use of transfer prices between associated parties,
             account for approximately 47% of the annual operating budget in this typical operation. If the sup-
             plies and consumables are further subdivided as in Table D.18, it is the supplies associated with the
             processing side of the operations that represent the major cost components. This includes grinding
             media mill liners, and the processing agents, as well as the fuel to run the processing operations.
             It is expenditures on these supplies that the tax authority should be focusing on, as they pose the
             largest risk to government revenue.

             When looking at the absolute value of these components in a typical medium size surface copper
             mine, they total approximately USD41 million annually. If these expenses were to be charged at 5%
             above the typical amount (USD43 million instead of USD41 million) the reduction in taxes payable,
             assuming a 30% tax rate, would be approximately USD0.6 million per year.

             Looking at the initial capital expenditures that would be required for this mine, the components
             associated with the purchase and installation of equipment, and those associated with specialized
             engineering and management services are of the highest risk to be subject to the use of transfer
             prices. These categories of expenditure account for 46% and 11% respectively of the total capital
             spend for the medium size surface copper mining operation. Of these, the purchase of equipment
             is by far the largest expense. However, as comparable transactions can be found for the majority of

B.3.3  Bulk Minerals
               Ownership of mining for bulk commodities such as iron and coal is quite consolidated197 and the
               level of vertical integration in these sectors is generally limited to activities from exploration to
               mine development down to a low level of beneficiation. Bulk operation requires significant trans-
               portation infrastructure which in some cases may be proprietary. Bulk commodities are primarily
               sold in the forms of crushed and screened ores and subordinately in the form of partially benefici-
               ated products.

               B.3.3.1 Iron Ore

               Industry profile: World production and resources

               Mining of iron ore occurs on a significant scale, involving large equipment operating in highly
               mechanized surface mining environments. It is often a high-volume/low-margin business that is
               highly capital-intensive, and requires significant investment in infrastructure such as rail and port
               facilities.198 These large capital requirements create relatively high barriers to entry that lead to a
               global industry that is dominated by a few large companies.

               While iron ore deposits are found in numerous jurisdictions around the globe, concentrations that
               are economical to mines have tended to be grouped within a relatively small number of host coun-
               tries (Figure D.6).

             for more than 77% of total world production in 2013, and were expected to make a similar contribu-
             tion in 2014 (Table D.21). Total African production amounted to 130.6 million tonnes in 2013 (5% of
             world supply) with South Africa accounting for 51% of African production.

             Current African producers: Production size and geographical distribution

             With the high exploration potential that is apparent in Africa, iron ore mining has the potential to
             contribute significantly to government revenues. Currently, the iron ore sector represents a sub-
             stantial proportion of the mining related activities taking place on the African continent, with many
             projects under exploration or in the advanced study stages. Categorizing the active operations by
             size and geographical location in Table D.22 shows that African iron ore production is currently
             dominated by medium- to large-size operations.

             It can also be seen that while South Africa is the dominant producer (33%), there are a number
             of countries producing iron ore, with large mines located in both Mauritania and Sierra Leone
             (although the latter is currently on care and maintenance on account of depressed iron ore prices).
             The review of the African mining database also shows that there is a strong pipeline for iron ore
             mining in Africa, with more projects at advanced study stages than currently in production. Of
             interest is that while South Africa is poised to be the largest producer, there is a number of explora-
             tion and advanced study stage projects in the West African region.

             An analysis of the operating African mines database (Appendix B.1)201 was undertaken to identify
             the characteristics of “typical” iron ore mines on the African continent, with the results presented
             in Table D.23.

             Broad revenue and cost considerations for risk analysis and audit prioritization

             Table D.24 provides a complete listing of the order of magnitude estimates of the annual value
             of sales based on the mineral in the ground for the typical iron ore mining operations identified
             through the statistical analysis. For example, if a large iron ore mine is producing a product grad-
             ing 62% it could expect to receive annual revenues in the order of USD1.8 billion when the market
             price is USD100/tonne.

             At this level of revenue, even a 1% change in the price paid can translate into tens of millions of
             dollars on an annual basis. In the iron ore sector, this transfer may be to a related steel mill, where
             the iron ore is turned into a final saleable product in a jurisdiction other than that within which
             it was mined. As a result, the prices used to transfer products between related parties is an area
             of potentially high tax sensitivity and warrants special attention in the audit process. However,
             revenues are not the only area of focus as iron ore mines are very dependent upon infrastructure
             to move the large quantities of material that are extracted to the point of sale. As a result, these
             mines incur substantial capital and operating expenses, which in many cases will be provided by a
             related overseas party. Again, the level of potential risk to the tax base will be dependent upon the
             nature of the mining operation, as the different ore body characteristics will dictate a different mix
             of capital and operating expenditures.

             Table D.25 shows the general cost breakdown for both operating and capital along with the magni-
             tudes of expenditures that may be incurred by the “typical” iron ore mining operations identified
             in Table D.23.

             The typical medium-size iron ore mine in Africa has a throughput of 8,000 tonnes of ore per day.
             With an assumed stripping ratio of 4:1, this mine would have annual operating costs (mine and
             transportation activities) of approximately $212.9 million, of which approximately 80% would be
             spent on transportation202 and approximately 13% on labor. Only 3% and 2% of the annual amount
             spent are related to supplies and administration respectively. Thus, the largest transfer pricing
             risk area on an annual basis will be associated with transportation expenses, and as shown in
             Table D.25, this will be the case no matter what the size of the operation is.




             202
                 These transportation charges include rail based on a 500km trip from mine to port; port handling, storage, loading
             and unloading fees; and sea freight from Africa to China (currently the largest market for iron ore).

          use of transfer prices. These categories of expenditure account for 48% and 13% respectively in the
          case of a medium-sized iron ore mining operation, and are even higher for the large-sized operation.


B.3.4  Energy Minerals
          Energy mineral commodities (which in this report exclude petroleum) typically mined in Africa
          are coal and uranium. Unlike most other commodities that allow for relatively easy classification
          as either mineral or not, unconventional energy resources, like coal-bed methane and oil shale, are
          hard to classify because their geology is integrated with that of the host minerals. This report is
          mostly concerned with the production of coal because of its dominance in the global energy mix.

          B.3.4.1 Coal

          Coal is globally sourced and found in over 70 countries and actively mined in most of them. It is
          mined for its energy content—and mostly used for the generation of electricity, metallurgical use
          (e.g., steel industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from ore) and conversion into liquid
          and gas fuels. Coal plays an important role in the global energy mix and accounts for 40% of global
          electricity production.203 According to the World Energy Council, “Coal’s dominant position in the
          global energy mix is largely due to the fact that it is abundant, widely distributed across the globe
          and affordable.” Global consumption of coal is growing and, despite negative publicity, is expected

270	   Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


             to increase as developing countries require more energy to support their development and popula-
             tions and economic growth.

             The mining of coal ranges from producing bulk material with no or limited processing (typically
             as feed for power plants) to a complex and vertically integrated range of products. Depending on
             mine infrastructure, production along the value chain can start at exploration and end at a high
             level of beneficiation. However, most coal exports are in the form of crushed, screened and/or
             washed material. Bulk operations require significant transportation infrastructure that in some
             cases may be proprietary. Its availability is a critical factor in decisions relating to development of
             these commodities.

             Industry profile: World production and resources

             Mining of coal today happens on a significant scale, involving heavy equipment like surface drag-
             lines and trucks, conveyors (both underground and on surface) and underground mechanized
             equipment like shearers and continuous miners. Raw coal requires preparation to increase its qual-
             ity by removing all or some of the undesirable components. In addition to changing its chemi-
             cal properties through processing technologies, the market has specific requirements for the size
             distribution of coal products. The international coal mining market requires production of about
             7.7 billion tonnes of coal annually204 with new methods of extracting energy from coal that are gain-
             ing momentum, e.g., coal to liquids205 and underground coal gasification (UCG).206

             Coal deposits and operations are typically larger (by production) than those for other minerals
             due to its abundance and high volumes required by the market as inputs for energy. Entry barri-
             ers are high because of the scale and reliance on large, mechanized technologies requiring signifi-
             cant upfront capital investment, causing the production to be concentrated in countries with large
             resources and with access to infrastructure, capital and markets. As can be seen in Figure D.7, coal
             has historically been found in various quantities around the globe.

             The largest coal-producing nations are China, the US, India, Australia, Indonesia, and Russia.
             The largest importers are Japan, China and South Korea. The largest consumers of coal are China
             (almost 50% of total global consumption), the US, India, Russia and Japan. World coal production
             was calculated to be 7,520 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) (or 10,743 million TCE)207 in 2011
             (Table D.26). The 2011 reserve estimates clearly illustrate the abundance of coal occurrence in the
             producing countries.

             When looking at the future of the global coal sector, it is expected that Africa, coming from a low
             industrial base, will experience significant growth in energy consumption. As depicted in Figure
             D.8, since the year 2000 the African continent has been the host of nearly a quarter of newly iden-
             tified coal deposits. This trend makes the African continent a player that should see an increased
             level of activity moving forward.

                Converting coal to a liquid fuel (CTL)—a process referred to as coal liquefaction—allows coal to be utilised as an
             alternative to oil. South Africa’s SASOL process has been producing coal-derived fuels since 1955.

               Current African producers: Production size and geographical distribution

               The coal industry represents a significant proportion of mining activities taking place on the Afri-
               can continent. Table D.2 shows that of the 286 producing mining operations, 63 (22%) are produc-
               ing coal. As far as exploration is concerned, only 6% of the exploration activity on the African
               continent is directed to coal deposits. The main reasons for this are the lack of transport infrastruc-
               ture and capital, which are required to compete with established global producers. However, there
               is significant future potential for coal considering the growing energy needs of the continent. This
               will require establishment of local markets and investment in exploration for coal. African govern-
               ments are also set to become more strategic with the protection of supply for local markets through
               either market restrictions or encouraging more exploration for coal.

               A few countries, with South Africa dominant, account for the 280 million tonnes of coal produced
               in Africa. The African continent as a whole accounted for less than 5% of global production, with
               South Africa accounting for more than 90% of African production (Table D.27). Ranked seventh in
               terms of global production, South Africa is the only African country within the top 10 coal produc-
               ers worldwide.

               A review of RIU’s Register of African Mining shows that currently there are 63 coal operations in
               production on the African continent, categorized in Table D.28209 by size, type and geographic loca-
               tion of operations. From Table D.28 one can observe the following:

                       ■■   Most coal mining operations in Africa are surface mines (44% of all mines); and
                       ■■   Medium-sized mines account for 50% of all mines.



               209
                     Of the 63 operating mines, only 50 provide production data that allows for their classification by size.

             for coal mining in Africa, with 38 projects at advanced study stage to sustain current production.
             As expected, South Africa’s coal mining sector has the most advanced study stage projects (25),
             with Botswana making rapid advances to expand its coal production (five at advanced study stage,
             compared to only one operating coal mine). Coal production is concentrated in Southern African
             countries, signaling that this region has above-average coal endowment and is potentially bet-
             ter connected to the markets. This notion is also supported by the exploration being undertaken
              in that area. Although this appears adequate to maintain current supply, it is not sufficient to sup-
             port the likely growth in future demand for coal in Africa.

             Table D.29 displays the results of the statistical analysis for the surface and underground coal min-
             ing operations that are currently in production on the African continent.

             Broad revenue and cost considerations for risk analysis and audit prioritization

             It stands to reason that there is scope for mispricing of some coal products, which could lead
             to BEPS and tax leakages. The scale (volume) is also significant, especially for large mines. For
             instance, on an annualized basis the gross revenue generated by a typical coal mining operation
             can range from as little as USD12 million in the case of a small underground mine to as much as
             USD1.4 billion from a large underground operation—and this is without considering a variable
             pricing structure. Table D.30 provides the order of magnitude estimates of the annual value of
             mineral sales in the ground for the typical coal mining operations identified through the statistical
             analysis.

             Table D.31 shows the general cost breakup and magnitude of expenditure for items that may be
             incurred by the “typical” surface coal mining operations identified in Table D.29 from the database
             of current operations on the African continent.

             The typical medium-size surface coal mining operation has a throughput of 6,000 tonnes per day.
             With an assumed stripping ratio of 20:1, this mine would have annual operating costs (OPEX—mine
             and mill activities) of approximately USD204.5 million, of which approximately USD23  million

                  (11% of OPEX) would be spent on supplies and USD7.6 million (4%) on administration. As can
                  be observed in Table D.32 when the supplies component is further subdivided, the major expen-
                  ditures are on explosives, fuel, electricity and spare parts and lubricants (especially for a small
                  mining operation). While there is minimal opportunity for transfer mispricing in the provision of
                  electricity, the other three components do pose significant risks, and are areas of expenditure that
                  should be understood and scrutinized by the tax administration system.

                  Because coal is sold in bulk and distances to markets are significant, one can expect transport costs
                  to be high—in this case USD116.4 million (57% of OPEX). For coal, costs associated with labor

               and transport combined make up 81% of OPEX. Although significant, the risk could be managed
               through comparison with arm’s length prices—if labor and transport were provided by associated
               parties. The other components of OPEX account for only 19% and the effort here should go into
               tracking and analysis of trends and deviations. The percentages for large surface mines are very dif-
               ferent because of the larger scale, where transport alone accounts for 74% of OPEX. When looking at
               the absolute value of the OPEX for a typical large surface coal mine, it totals approximately USD1.3
               billion annually. If these expenses were to be charged at 5% above the typical amount, the reduction
               in taxes payable would be approximately USD19.5 million per year—assuming a 30% tax rate.

               Looking at the initial capital expenditures that would be required for these mines, the actual
               amounts increase with the size of the operations, but the percentages of CAPEX remain similar
               and in a narrow range. The component associated with the purchase of equipment and supplies
               is the highest, accounting for 67–70% of total capital spent. However, as comparable transactions
               can be found for the majority of equipment purchased by a mining operation, the engineering and
               management services (second highest at around 10%), potentially pose the next highest risk from
               a transfer pricing perspective. Again, the effort here should go into tracking and analysis of trends
               to understand deviations from year to year.

               The “typical” underground coal mining operations presented in Table D.33 show that the typi-
               cal large-size underground coal mining operation has a throughput of 56,500 tonnes per day. If a
               Longwall mining method is used, this mine would have annual operating costs (mine and mill
               activities) of approximately USD489 million, of which approximately USD388 million (79% of
               Total OPEX) will pay for transport because of the very high production rate and bulk transport
               thereof.
	                                                                        Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   277


               Similar to surface mines, transport, labor and equipment combined dominate OPEX (90%), and
               if arrangements are not at arm’s length, comparative prices are readily available for these inputs.
               Other components of OPEX are USD33.8 million (7% of OPEX) on supplies and approximately
               USD5.7 million (1%) on administration. Because of the reduced volumes at smaller mines, trans-
               port costs for underground coal mines account for (only) 38% of OPEX.

               Looking at the initial capital expenditures that would be required for underground coal mines, one
               observes a similar trend as that for surface mines, i.e., the amounts increase significantly with the
               scale of the operation, but percentages for capital items are in narrow ranges. Like surface mines,
               capital on equipment purchases and installation dominates as a category, flagging risk. The risk
               could be managed by comparative analysis of arm’s length prices and annual tracking of trends.


B.3.5 Diamonds
               Industry profile: World production and resources

               Diamond deposits are typically smaller than those for other minerals due to the relative scarcity of
               this mineral. Entry barriers range from very low for widespread alluvial deposits, to very high for
               some operations (e.g., off-shore detrital and deep kimberlite deposits) due to the high capital and
               technological requirements. As a consequence there is a variety of very different diamond produc-
               ers in Africa. Such producers typically include few, dominant large producers and multiple small
               firms as well as large numbers of artisanal producers. Artisanal diamond producers can be of real
               benefit to the economy when formalized, but can sometimes cause complexity and even conflict
               when the formal economy is unable to accommodate them appropriately. As can be seen in Fig-
               ure D.9, diamonds have historically been found in Southern Africa as well as a few other regions
               around the globe.

             ALROSA (25% of value and 33% of volume) and De Beers (21% of value and 26% of volume) were
             the two largest diamond producing groups in 2013. Table D.34 shows that the five top producing
             countries (by volume) in 2013 were Russia, Botswana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Aus-
             tralia and Zimbabwe. The rapid growth in supply from Zimbabwe is worth noting, as this country
             recorded major discoveries in recent times. The increase in production was mainly due to growing
             demand from China and India. China is now the world’s second largest consumer of diamond
             jewelry after the US, with demand growing 18% in 2011.212

             In terms of inventory, the Statista Portal213 credits Australia (250 million carats), DRC (150 million
             carats), Botswana (130 million carats), South Africa (70 million carats) and Russia (40 million carats)
             with holding the largest diamond reserves worldwide in 2014. All other countries combined account
             for only 90 million carats in reserves. According to De Beers,214 current exploration is mostly directed
             to historically underexplored countries such as Angola, the DRC, Zimbabwe and Arctic Siberia, with
             current world exploration spent for diamonds estimated at USD1 billion per year—about 50% of the
             pre-economic crises levels. When looking at the future of the global diamond sector, it is expected
             that Africa will remain a major player, with Zimbabwe joining the group of major producing coun-
             tries. As depicted in Figure D.10, Southern Africa has since 2,000 recorded significant diamond finds
             and a greater proportion of world production is expected to come from the region.

             Current African producers: Production size and geographical distribution

             The diamond industry represents a significant proportion of mining activities taking place on the
             African continent, while diamond exploration only accounts for about 5% of total exploration
             activity. Of the 130 million carats of diamonds produced worldwide in 2013, the top ten African
             countries by production accounted for almost 70 million carats, making up 54% of global produc-
             tion (Table D.35). This is significant and the continent is expected to maintain its strong supply
             position in the global market into the future.

280	         Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa


                   A review of RIU’s Register of African Mining shows that currently there are about 41 diamond-
                   producing operations on the African continent, categorized in Table D.36215 by size of operations
                   and mining method. As shown, the majority of diamond mines in Africa are surface mines (59%),
                   with just under half (48%) of all mines falling into the medium-size category.

                   Except for Sierra Leone, Table D.36 shows that most of the diamond mining operations216 are based
                   in the southern region of the African continent, with 11 operations in South Africa (41%), 5  in
                   Botswana (19%) and 3 in each of Namibia and Lesotho. These statistics must be considered with
                   some skepticism, because Table D.35 suggests that there should be more operations in the DRC,
                   Zimbabwe and Angola than Table D.36 indicates. However, as some operations do not report pro-
                   duction statistics, they have not been included within the statistical analysis. In addition the infor-
                   mal sector is still largely unaccounted for in African statistical databases and there is evidence of

    large-scale smuggling of diamonds from some jurisdictions to avoid mineral royalties and export

    Considering the scale of informal activity in the diamond sector, the current drive by African gov-
    ernments to formalize the artisanal mining sector and the tendency of informal activity to alert
    large companies to potential significant findings, one can safely assume that the African continent
    will remain a major supplier of world diamonds for many years to come. A review of RIU’s Regis-
    ter of African Mining 2014 shows that there is a reasonable pipeline for diamond mining in Africa,
    with the number of exploration projects and studies at advanced stage together outnumbering
    that of producing operations. Considering the relatively small global diamond reserve base, this
    emphasizes Africa’s strong position in the diamond sector. The situation will further improve if
    one were able to fully account for the impact of the informal sector, which as discussed is signifi-
    cant for diamonds in Africa. Of further interest is that South Africa has the most advanced study
    stage projects (5), which is probably misleading in light of its declining status as a diamond pro-
    ducing nation. This may be because diamond mining in South Africa tends to be formal, while the
    informal sector is much more prevalent in the rest of Africa, with the exception of Botswana.

    Table D.37 displays the results of this statistical analysis for surface and underground mining
    operations217 that are currently in production on the African continent. As expected, production
    tonnages from surface mines are generally higher than those from underground mines. It is worth
    noting that there is significant variation in output for diamond mines, where a small surface mine
    is on average four times larger than a small underground mine, while medium-sized mines pro-
    duce about the same tonnage irrespective of whether they are surface or underground mines. In
    the large mines category, the throughput of a typical surface mine is about double that of an under-
    ground mine.

    Broad revenue and cost considerations for risk analysis and audit prioritization

    It stands to reason that mispricing differences between TPs and arm’s length prices in the diamond
    trade is a real possibility when considering the multinational downstream and integrated activi-
    ties of the major diamond producers. From a BEPS perspective, there is more risk to host countries
    of under-invoicing of revenue received for rough production than for over-invoicing of expenses.
    Under-valuation of rough diamonds, particularly of gem quality, is very difficult to control because
    of the specialized nature of their valuation and can result in significant tax leakages. For instance,
    on an annualized basis the gross revenue generated by a typical diamond mining operation can
    range from as little as USD4.8 million in the case of a small underground mine to as much as
    USD320 million from a large surface operation.218 A 10% under-invoicing on a large surface mine
    results in a USD 9.6 million tax loss for the host country annually. Table D.38 provides a complete


    217
        Those operations that are composed of a combination of surface and underground operations, or that are in transi-
    tion from surface to underground, have been removed for the purpose of this analysis so as to avoid skewing the
    data for operations that may be in a ramp-up or ramp-down phase.
    218
        These calculations of gross revenue are based upon a grade of 30 carats per hundred tonnes in a surface mine and

               listing of the order of magnitude estimates of the annual value of mineral in the ground for the
               typical diamond mining operations identified through the statistical analysis.

               Although a priority for diamonds, revenues from rough diamond sales are not the only area where
               transfer mispricing can lead to an erosion of the tax base. These operations also incur substantial
               expenses of an operational and capital nature. The level of potential risk to the tax base will be
               dependent upon the nature of the mining operation, as the different characteristics will dictate a
               different mix of capital and operating expenditures. Table D.39 shows the general cost breakdown
               and magnitude of expenditure for items that may be incurred by the typical surface diamond min-
               ing operation identified in Table D.37.

               The typical medium-size surface diamond mining operation has a throughput of 8,000 tonnes per
               day. With an assumed stripping ratio of 4:1, this mine would have annual operating costs (OPEX—
               mine and mill activities) of approximately USD43.3 million, of which approximately USD28 mil-
               lion (65% of OPEX) would be spent on labour and equipment operation. Supplies and consumables
               cost in the order of USD7.3 million (17%). Unlike coal, which is sold on bulk, transport costs for
               diamond production (high quality but small volume) are insignificant. For diamonds, costs associ-
               ated with administration and other categories are roughly 10% of OPEX for all types of mines. Most

                  of the OPEX risk could be managed through comparison with arm’s length prices. When looking
                  at the absolute value of these components for a typical large surface diamond mine, they total
                  approximately USD147 billion annually. If these expenses were to be charged at 5% above the typi-
                  cal amount, the reduction in taxes payable would be approximately USD2 million per year, which
                  is insignificant considering the risk of under-invoicing.

                  The initial capital expenditures are much bigger for larger surface diamond operations, but the per-
                  centages of CAPEX remain similar and in a narrow range regardless of mine size. The component
                  associated with the purchase of equipment and installation is significant. This category of CAPEX
                  accounts for 46–51% of total capital spent. However, as comparable transactions can be found for
                  the majority of equipment purchased by a mining operation, the engineering and management
                  services (second highest at between 11 and 15%) potentially require more scrutiny from a transfer
                  pricing perspective. The effort here should go into tracking and analyzing trends to understand
                  deviations from year to year.

                  Figures for typical underground diamond mining operations in Table D.40 show that a typical
                  large mine is expected to have a total OPEX similar to that of a medium-size operation irrespective
                  of differences in their throughputs. This can be explained by the difference in mining methods,
                  whereby sublevel caving typically used in some medium-size mines has higher unit operating
                  costs that are justified by the corresponding lower capital investment required for this mining
                  method. A medium-sized underground diamond mine using a sublevel caving mining method
                  has annual operating costs (mine and mill activities) of approximately USD57.6 million, of which
                  about USD23.3 million (41% of Total OPEX) will pay for labor and equipment operation. As it is
                  the case for surface mines, supplies, consumables, labor and equipment combined dominate OPEX
                  (71%), and comparative prices are generally readily available for these inputs, which makes assess-
                  ing whether transfer prices are at arm’s length relatively easy. It should be noted that administra-
                  tion fees are significantly higher (two to three times) for underground mines compared to surface
                  mines. This is an issue that will require careful scrutiny because of the limited data on relevant

                  Factors Influencing Tax
         Administration Internal Structure
            to Deal with Transfer Pricing
              Issues in the Mining Sector

Internal structural and design decisions for tax administrations will be influenced by a range of
factors including:

    ■■   Existing internal structure and design of the relevant tax administration. The most com-
         monly used organizational structures are:
         ■■ Market based—This means the tax administration is likely to have a large business,
             small and medium business and micro business work areas. In the large business area
             there may be other subspecializations such as financial, energy and mining, and man-
             ufacturing industries, as well as a variety of technical specializations.
                  International organizations advising countries (e.g., UN/IMF/WBG/OECD)
             frequently recommend that such large business units be set up. An example of a
             large business unit is that established by the South African Revenue Service (SARS)
             described in Box C.1. This type of unit can bring much needed focus on MNEs, how-
             ever, it can lead to the area becoming isolated from the rest of the organization because
             it is often vertically integrated to include all business functions within the unit. This
             vertical integration can lead to duplication in the organization and a possible fiefdom
             culture with a noticeable tendency towards internal promotion.
         ■■ Tax type—This means the tax administration is likely to have vertically integrated
             structures dealing separately with each type of tax (e.g., VAT/Income Tax/Excise,
             etc.). This type of unit can bring strong focus on the peculiar differences that exist
             between tax types, because for instance VAT is a transactional tax, whereas income tax
             is based on aggregated transactions over a period of time.
                  Taxpayers often behave differently for different types of taxes, for example, VAT
             can be treated as a ‘pass through’ tax, as compared to income tax which is borne by the
             shareholder, and therefore a greater incentive may exist to avoid or minimize income
             tax.
         ■■ Functional—This means the tax administration is likely to have Advice, Risk and Intel-
             ligence, Audit, Litigations, and perhaps Policy work areas that perform these functions
             across all taxes and markets.
                  There may be specialist units within these functional areas, dealing for example
             with particular industry sectors or particular areas of the law. This functional approach
             can build capability quickly as it allows for a natural skilling pathway for staff, for
             example, from simple advice to complex advice, and from simple audits to complex
             audits.
    ■■   Organizational culture of the tax administration. There may be historical reasons and
         preferences for particular structures and there may be commonly acceptable ways for


                                          290

         different sections and/or officers to deal with each other internally. For example, the style
         of leadership may result in the organization being strongly competitive between units or
         alternatively to work very cooperatively together for particular outcomes.
    ■■   Business and economic characteristics and distribution of taxpayer population, as well as
         the nature of the most common interactions they have with the tax administration.

                                               Tax Administration
                                                Codes of Conduct

Some tax administrations have published codes of conduct as to what taxpayers can expect during
engagement with the tax administration. By way of example, the South African Revenue Service
has a Service Charter and the IRS has a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Such practices are important to the
preservation of fair and ethical enforcement by a government body and includes inter alia a com-
mitment to:

    ■■   High standards of professionalism and ethical behavior;
    ■■   Act at all times within the law and give effect to taxpayer’s rights;
    ■■   Exercise the tax administration’s powers and duties in a fair and equitable manner and
         within the ambit of the law;
    ■■   Apply the law consistently, in an unbiased way and impartially;
    ■■   Be polite, courteous, helpful and readily accessible in dealings with the MNE, and at all
         times treat the MNE as a valued client who is entitled to receive the highest standard of
         service;
    ■■   Recognise the MNE’s right to access of information excluding that information that is spe-
         cifically protected by law;
    ■■   Good governance and access to mediation;
    ■■   Preserve the confidentiality and secrecy of the tax authority’s confidential information or
         taxpayer information as required by any statute that imposes confidentiality obligations.

            Three Broad Categories of
          Tactics That May Be Used to
       Disrupt Transfer Pricing Audits

1.	 Deny—Where the responses of the MNE are aimed at inappropriately convincing the tax
    administration that:
    ■■ There is no material transfer pricing problem, or
    ■■ That they should not be looked at. Reasons asserted sometimes are based on there being
       other taxpayers with worse transfer pricing cases and/or issues for the administration
       to look at and/or that the tax administration is being discriminatory.
       Some MNEs may seek to deflect the focus away from the risks identified by the auditor.
  Information may be provided on issues of minor importance rather than the material issues
  that are the focus of the audit. It is important that the auditor stay focused on the material
  issues and, if necessary, put the minor issues to one side to be looked at later in the audit or
  addressed on a ‘go forward’ basis.
       Some MNEs may maintain that the issue is not as important or as big as the auditor
  suspects or knows it really is. For example, the MNE may say that even if the marketing
  hub were shifting profits, the tax problem would be minimal as the profits would come
  within the ambit of the controlled foreign company regime or be comparably taxed in the
  other jurisdiction. Such claims should be thoroughly investigated by the auditor maintain-
  ing appropriate professional skepticism and not just be accepted at face value. If the MNE’s
  claims are found not to be correct, they should be refuted and the examination of the issues
  should proceed.
       Other things that auditors should be on the lookout for include:
    ■■ Omission of important information or facts that would change the view of the
       arrangements,
    ■■ Statistics that may be open to manipulation or misrepresentation, or
    ■■ Difficult to understand answers that may be long winded and/or overly technical
       If an auditor has any doubt in the truth of what is presented or said, they should insist
  that it be backed up with evidence.
2.	 Delay—Where the responses of the MNE may slow the audit process down so that any stat-
    utory period of limitation expires or may compromise any adjustment to the tax payable.
       Many MNEs in the mining sector go through restructuring and merger and acquisition
  activities from time to time and this may make it difficult to locate historical information
  needed for a transfer pricing audit. Host country MNE officers may also claim that they do
  not have authority to deal with the request for information and that it needs to be passed
  up the chain for further instructions. These problems, however, should not be accepted as a
  reason for noncompliance with the request. The reality of MNE organizational change needs
  to be factored into compliance activities making it all the more important for risk assess-
  ments, audits and accompanying requests for information to be made in a timely way (see
  section 8.2.4).
       Audits may also be delayed by a late staged request by the MNE for a ruling or other
  interpretative view. While the request needs to be properly considered, the fact gathering

                                     302
	                                                       Transfer Pricing in Mining with a Focus on Africa	   303


           activities in the audit should proceed in the meantime. Alternative means of resolving the
           interpretation should also be explored, such as both parties agreeing to move quickly to liti-
           gation and determination by a court at the conclusion of the audit. This would be especially
           suitable if a ruling or interpretation could not be provided quickly as may frequently be the
           case for transfer pricing interpretative matters. There is a risk that the internal workings of
           the tax administration can be disrupted by audit stage ruling requests if it leads to compet-
           ing pressures between their advice/rulings and audit areas.
                Experience has shown that one of the most common reasons for mining transfer pricing
           audits to be slowed down is the delay in auditors getting the information they need from
           MNEs. In recent years it has become more common for auditors to informally request infor-
           mation rather than make a formal request under legislative provisions. Some MNEs prefer
           informal requests as it minimizes the risk of penalties (which are sensitive issues for MNEs)
           that may come with formal requests. Formal requests may also be interpreted narrowly by
           MNEs with the risk that the auditor will not get the information they were expecting. There
           is some merit to these positions and it is suggested that the auditor should discuss with
           the MNE the required information and documents that it needs to better understand what
           may be available and when. In practice there have been cases where years have gone past
           with some information being provided while other important information is not. Each delay
           rarely seems individually unreasonable, but collectively they can significantly impact on the
           time taken and resources used in the audit. Good audit practice means outstanding informal
           information requests should be crystallized into formal requests from time-to-time. Even
           with formal requests, significant delays can occur where the MNE requests, and is granted,
           repeated extensions of time to provide the information. Reasons for delay include inad-
           equate MNE resources or officers taking leave. It is suggested these are matters that should
           be managed by the MNE and not exceptional circumstances which would warrant further
           extensions of time.
         3.	 Defeat—Occasionally action is taken that risks the cessation of a transfer pricing audit and
             adjustment to the tax payable.
                Occasionally actions are taken of such a magnitude that they threaten individual tax
           officers, the tax administration as an organization or even the economy of the country. These
           may include, for example, threat of legal action against an auditor, threats that a mine will
           be closed down or that functions or entities will abandon the jurisdiction.
                When faced with such a threat it is important to understand what can actually be done
           in the circumstances. For example, a quick check with legal counsel may show that there is
           no case if legal boundaries have not been stepped over. It is also important to keep lines of
           communication open by briefing relevant stakeholders, such as senior tax and other govern-
           ment officials.

    While tax administrations generally cannot publicly disclose information about particular taxpay-
    ers, they can disclose broad information. It is important that tax administrations let the public
    know what they are faced with when they are dealing with the major transfer pricing issues. This
    may be done, for example, in the tax administrations annual report, through media releases or
    during parliamentary enquiries or hearings. Public disclosure may prevent or clear up potentially
    ruinous media articles and also garner appropriate support from the community for the difficult
    work of dealing with transfer pricing in the important mining sector.
