This edition of the Kyrgyz Republic Country Economic Update was prepared by Bakyt Dubashov
(Economist) and Aurélien Kruse (Senior Economist). The Special Focus Section was prepared in
collaboration with the Kyrgyz energy team led by Katharina Gassner (Senior Energy Economist)
and Kathrin Hofer (Energy Specialist). The section on energy affordability was prepared using
analysis conducted by Aibek Baibagysh Uulu (Poverty Analyst), with input from Saida
Ismailakhunova (Poverty Economist) and Sarosh Sattar (Senior Poverty Economist). A full analysis
of the Kyrgyz energy sector is presented in the forthcoming World Bank report: “Analysis of the
Kyrgyz Republic’s Energy Sector”.

The report benefited from comments and guidance by Maria Gonzalez-Miranda (Practice Manager)
and Christos Kostopoulos (Lead Economist for Central Asia). Akylai Osmonalieva (Team Assistant)
and Oxana Barysheva (Team assistant) provided editorial support.

The first part of the Economic Update analyzes recent macroeconomic trends and presents an
assessment of the country’s short- and medium-term outlook.

The Special Focus Section discusses the state of the country’s energy sector, including issues
surrounding its financial viability and fiscal implications, as well as the social implications of reform
scenarios.



We hope you find it useful and welcome your comments!

Overview
The Kyrgyz                         The Kyrgyz economy remained resilient to an adverse and volatile
economy has been                   external context, growing at a robust 3.8 percent in 2016. Growth was
resilient to shocks                driven by a recovery of the gold sector and an increase in private
in 2016.
                                   consumption, fueled by increased remittances, as well as government
                                   spending. The stabilization of the exchange rate, following appreciation
                                   early in the year, and low international food prices kept inflation at bay
                                   for most of 2016. Both exports and imports contracted: the former
                                   impacted by weak external demand and the enforcement of strict quality
                                   standards by the Eurasian Economic Union1; and the latter mostly
                                   reflecting low fuel prices and volumes imported. As a result, the trade
                                   balance improved slightly, while the current account balance was
                                   buoyed by the recovery in private transfers.

An expansionary                    Against the backdrop of the weak external environment, the authorities
policy stance                      pursued an expansionary fiscal policy and relaxed the monetary stance,
boosted demand                     boosting domestic demand in the short run. Increased government
but reduced fiscal
                                   spending supported economic activity. However, this came at the cost of
space.
                                   significantly reduced fiscal buffers, which had been built in previous
                                   years. Meanwhile, the lower policy rate did little to expand credit, given
                                   weak transmission mechanisms. As a result, excess liquidity in the
                                   banking system was high, while credits to the economy shrunk.

Going forward,                     Looking ahead, growth is projected to decelerate slightly to 3.4 percent
growth is expected                 in 2017 and then recover to 4 percent over the medium term, owing to
to decelerate                      remittance supported-consumption, with a neutral contribution from
slightly in 2017
                                   investment and a negative one from net exports. The economy is
and recover in
2018                               expected to remain dependent on remittances, and exchange rate
                                   developments could affect trade patterns. A major policy challenge is to
                                   boost exports and investment through increasing the competitiveness of
                                   the economy.

The Kyrgyz energy                    Although its financial performance has improved somewhat in 2016,
sector is in bad                     thanks to favorable weather developments and tariff increases for non-
shape: unable to                     residential consumers, the energy sector remains in precarious
support growth
                                     condition. It continues to absorb scarce fiscal resources in inefficient
and draining fiscal
space.                               ways, at a time when rebuilding fiscal space is a priority. Reforming the
                                     sector is now a matter of urgent priority.

A. Recent Socio-Economic Developments
Growth and inflation
The Kyrgyz                        Real GDP growth is estimated to have reached 3.8 percent in 2016,
economy                           broadly unchanged from the previous year (Figure 1). The expansion in
performed better                  output was driven mainly by a recovery of gold production (particularly
than expected in
                                  in the second half of the year) and consumption. However, non-gold
2016.
                                  GDP growth decelerated notably to 3.7 percent from 4.9 percent in 2015,
                                  mainly on account of slowdown of agriculture and construction as
                                  described below.

Consumption drove                 On the demand side, growth is believed to have been driven mostly by
growth on the                     private consumption, as well as government recurrent spending. The
demand side                       former was supported by recovering remittance inflows, while the latter
                                  reflected inter alia the full-year implementation of wage increases
                                  enacted in late 2015 as well as increased spending on goods and
                                  services. Investment growth, for its part, was mostly on account of
                                  public investment, while private investment stagnated. Credit to the
                                  economy declined by 1 percent (compared to robust growth of 17.4
                                  percent in 2015).

Gold production                   On the production side, economic activity was driven mainly by
drove industrial                  industry. Industrial output grew at 5.1 percent (compared to a 3.1
output growth,                    decline in 2015), and in turn mostly by gold production (increasing by 5
with weak
                                  percent after a -8.3 percent drop in 2015)2. Non-gold industry growth
performance in
services                          was also healthy at 5.4 percent (vs. 1.5 percent in 2015) driven by
                                  mining, the food industry, oil refinery (production in a new Chinese
                                  plant) and machinery. However, growth decelerated in agriculture to 3
                                  percent in 2016 (vs. 6.2 percent in 2015) reflecting a weak crop output;
                                  it also slowed significantly in construction (to 7.5 percent from 16.3
                                  percent), possibly an effect of the external shock, and services (to 3
                                  percent vs. 3.7 percent) due to a fall in the transport and communication
                                  sector.

so by demand conditions.

Low food prices                   Inflation (end-of-period) is estimated to have been negative (-0.5
and the absence of                percent) in 2016, down from 3.4 percent in December of the previous
exchange rate                     year (Figure 3). This was on account of lower food and fuel prices, which
pressures led to a
                                  fell by 5 percent, and 12.1 percent respectively. While this came mostly
significant decline
in consumer prices.               as a reflection of international trends, it was also a result from over-
                                  supply in the domestic market given obstacles to exports in Eurasian
                                  Economic Union (EEU) markets and increased competition from
                                  regional producers. In addition, exchange rate dynamics and the pass-
                                  through effect of the som’s appreciation relative to the dollar, as well as
                                  more muted inflation expectations, contributed to moderate the
                                  pressure on prices, with the impact of monetary accommodation, if any,
                                  expected, to materialize with a lag (Figure 4).

Developments in                   On the one hand, the slower growth contraction in Russia in 2016 drove
the region, mainly                an improvement in remittance inflows (which grew by around 18
in Russia,                        percent in US dollar terms) supporting household incomes and
continued to affect
                                  consumption. As a share of GDP, this represents an increase to 24.9
the economy
                                  percent from 20.1 percent in 2015. On the other hand, the volume of
                                  trade with Russia (Kyrgyz Republic’s main trading partner) contracted
                                  for the third consecutive year, by some 35 percent. This was partly on
                                  account of lower import prices and volumes3 of fuel but also reduced
                                  exports (mainly textile goods). By contrast, trade with Kazakhstan
                                  increased by 10 percent with a rebound in re-exports of consumer goods
                                  from China.



3 Since macroeconomic trends cannot account for the apparent drop in demand for fuel imports (especially given prices trends), the
reported decline in volumes could reflect statistical issues or other mis-reporting.

External sector
Both exports and                   Exports performed poorly in the first 9 months of 2016. Over that
imports shrunk, in                 period, total exports are estimated to have declined by 1.5 percent, in US
US dollar terms,                   dollar terms, in spite of the fact that gold exports grew by about 5
over the first 9
                                   percent (Figure 5). This weak performance is attributable to a significant
months of 2016
                                   decline in exports of agricultural and agro-processed goods, which
                                   typically make up more than 10 percent of the country’s non-gold export
                                   basket. In turn, this resulted partly from the enforcement of enhanced
                                   standards of quality by EEU member countries. More broadly, the real
                                   appreciation of the som relative to the Kazakh tenge4, depressed
                                   competitiveness, dis-incentivizing exports and heightening competition
                                   on the domestic market. By contrast, exports to Uzbekistan, China and
                                   Turkey are reported to have increased. To the former, growing exports
                                   could be a reflection of improved trade facilitation as well as re-export
                                   activity. To China, they were mostly on account of gold, following
                                   Chinese investments in the sector. With Turkey, higher exports were
                                   driven by a good harvest for beans, Kyrgyzstan’s main export product to
                                   the Turkish market.

Higher imports                     Total imports are estimated to have fallen by 4.7 percent, in US dollar
from China suggest                 terms. Imports of fuel declined by about 50 percent, mainly reflecting
a recovery of re-                  lower international prices and volume declines. At the same time,
exporting activity

                          relatively faster than exports from a considerably higher base. As a share
                          of GDP, the trade deficit shrunk more noticeably to 31.8 percent from
                          33.6 percent in 2015 (Figure 6).

significantly.
                          mostly due to increased private transfers, including remittances, which
                          grew by about 18 percent in US dollar terms. While these developments
                          helped buttress stability in the short term, they may not contribute to
                          long term external sustainability, which would require robust export
                          growth. The current account deficit was financed by foreign direct
                          investment and public borrowing; FDI amounted to US$430 million and
                          public borrowing was US$370 million in 2016.

Financial sector
The financial             The financial sector expanded modestly on account of banking sector

                          Among the many possible reasons behind this decline: the slowdown in
                          construction and services, price effects (with the som appreciation
                          lowering the value of foreign currency denominated loans), the direct
                          lending operations of the Kyrgyz-Russian Development Fund, and the
                          impact of NBRK regulation -enacted in February 2016- to curb lending in
                          foreign currency. On the liabilities side, total deposits increased by 4

                      deposits fell by almost 12 percent.

Financial stability   Overall, banking sector performance indicators remained comfortably
indicators remain     positive, signaling a stable financial system. The capital adequacy ratio
in the green          was high at 24.8 percent as of end-December 2016, up from 22.4 percent
                      a year before, and well above the statutory requirement of 12 percent.
                      The liquidity ratio declined slightly to 75.5 percent (from 77.8 percent at
                      end-2015) though remaining well in excess of the required level of 45
                      percent. Both returns on assets and returns on equity remained positive
                      at 0.5 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, although lower than in 2015
                      (1.5 percent and 10.8 percent). Moreover, the non-performing loans
                      ratio deteriorated slightly to 8.8 percent from 7.1 percent in 2015 and
                      4.5 percent in 2014


Social sector
Household             In 2016, higher remittances and lower food (domestic and external)
consumption           prices positively impacted the purchasing power of households,
increased mainly      especially at the bottom of the income distribution. Except for dairy
due to remittances
                      products and vegetables, the Kyrgyz Republic is highly dependent on
and low food prices
                      imports of food, particularly for meat, vegetable oils, sugar and
                      wheat/wheat flour. The latter commodity is the most important food
                      item for households in terms of caloric intake; in 9 months of 2016,
                      Kyrgyz households on average dedicated 46 percent of total
                      consumption to food.

Incomes from          In 9 months of 2016, income from wages and self-employment

and remittances
                      generated through agricultural activities, and 4 percent from
continue to be the
most important        remittances. Real incomes per capita increased by 3.8 percent. The
income sources        importance of different income sources varied regionally, with urban
                      households being more dependent on incomes from wages and self-
                      employment, while rural households tended to rely to a larger extent on
                      agricultural income and received remittances. The share of remittances
                      in total incomes is especially large for migrant rural households and very
                      sensitive to macroeconomic conditions. Without remittance income,
                      migrant households are much poorer than non-migrant households in
                      the country. The poverty rates of non-migrant households have
                      remained relatively stable.

B. Macroeconomic and Structural Policies
Fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies
The government                         Fiscal policy has been significantly expansionary, as the authorities
pursued an                             sought to support aggregate demand, while carrying through with plans
expansionary fiscal                    to expand the country’s infrastructure. The general government budget
stance, at the cost
                                       ran a deficit of 6.6 percent of GDP in 2016, a large increase from 3
of higher deficits.
                                       percent in 2015 (Table 2). This gap resulted from increased current and
                                       capital spending, as well as from lower revenues, due to a decline in non-
                                       tax collections.

Revenue to GDP                         Total revenues amounted to 33.3 percent of GDP, down from 34.4
fell, on account of                    percent in 2015. Tax revenues increased by 1 percentage point to 25.2
lower non-tax                          percent of GDP as a result of better VAT administration and increased
proceeds.
                                       custom revenues. At the same time, there was a sharp decline in non-tax
                                       proceeds, by 2 percentage points to 5.9 percent of GDP, largely reflecting
                                       a high base effect after one-off receipt in 2015. The amount of grant
                                       support remained unchanged at 2 percent of GDP, which included both
                                       program and project grants.

Expenditures                           Total expenditure surged to 39.8 percent of GDP from 37.4 percent in
increased                              2015. The higher current spending reflected the full year
considerably.                          implementation of wage increases for teachers, adopted in September
                                       2015, as well as increased expenses on goods and services, related to
                                       hosting the World Nomad Games and the CIS Summit. On the capital
                                       spending side, the increase stemmed from more intense implementation
                                       of road and energy infrastructure projects, financed by both foreign and
                                       domestic sources.

The large ensuing                      The fiscal deficit was mainly financed by external borrowing and a
deficit was                            drawdown of government deposits. In particular, capital spending was
financed through                       supported through external borrowing (amounting to 4.2 percent of
external
                                       GDP, net of debt amortization). The remaining deficit was funded
borrowing.

                                30 percent to 10.6 billion of soms (2.3 percent of GDP).

Fiscal expansion                Overall, the fiscal policy in 2016 was broadly appropriate in that it
supported demand                boosted domestic demand in the face of external headwinds. Moreover,
without                         exchange rate developments helped mitigate the impact of higher
endangering
                                spending on inflation dynamics and debt ratios. While the stock of debt
macro-stability in
the short run, but it           increased significantly (by 4.3 percent in US dollar terms), the debt-to-
is not sustainable.             GDP ratio declined to 61.7 percent from 67.2 percent in December 2015.
                                However, the flipside of these fortuitous conditions is that the country is
                                significantly exposed to adverse exchange rate shocks that could tilt the
                                debt outlook adversely.

                                     this reduction, the NBKR’s overnight interest rates for loans and
                                     deposits were set at 6.25 percent from 12 percent and at 0.25 percent
                                     from 4 percent, respectively. This, together with NBRK regulation
                                     limiting foreign currency borrowing for a broad group of consumers, led
                                     to a gradual decline of the interest rate in the loan market (figure 7). As a
                                     result, the monetary base grew by 27.6 percent and the money supply
                                     increased by 14.6 percent in 2016. On the demand side, however, this
                                     increase has not led to growth of credit to economy, but rather to money

                                   production, while non-gold growth is projected to remain flat. In 2018,
                                   however, growth is expected to rebound to 4 percent owing to

                                   investment is expected to be neutral and from net exports negative.

The government                     Fiscal expansion has eroded fiscal buffers which must now be rebuilt. In

                                   deficit is to be reduced by almost 3 percentage points to fall below 2.0
                                   percent of GDP in 2018 (excluding on-lending). The adjustment is
                                   expected to be expenditure-led, with capital spending (-2.5 pp of GDP)
                                   and the wage bill (-1.5pp of GDP) being the main components, as total
                                   revenue is projected to fall by 1.5 percentage points.

                                   employment is more prevalent. Social transfers will continue to play an
                                   important role in driving poverty reduction in both urban and rural
                                   areas. A scheduled increase in pensions should have a positive
                                   distributional effect, given that pensions represent close to 15 percent of
                                   income among the poor. Finally, lower food prices in 2017 should also
                                   positively impact the purchasing power of households at the bottom of
                                   the income distribution. As a result, the national poverty rate is
                                   projected to decline to 31.7 percent in 2017 and 30.2 percent in 2018.

                       derailed and not carried-out at the expense of key social programs will
                       be a major challenge. In addition, it is high time for the authorities to

A Status brief of the energy sector

struggling             afloat through significant support from the Republican budget. This,
                       however, is insufficient to finance the investments that would be needed
                       to maintain ageing equipment or invest in the capacity required to meet
                       growing demand; and it comes at the expense of other key expenditures
                       (better roads, education and other key services) and macro-stability
                       (with a growing debt burden). Finally, the policy of subsidized prices,
                       which comes at a very significant fiscal cost, mostly benefits large,
                       wealthy consumers, in contradiction with its alleged social objective.

                       when it can be produced in sufficient quantities to be exported, thereby
                       helping to diversify the economy and open new markets. The purpose of

                           reform, therefore, should be to ensure that the potential of the sector to
                           support growth, job creation and a better quality of life for Kyrgyz
                           citizens is fully realized.

underexploited             neighboring countries. Exports can generate valuable revenues for the
                           government, which could be reinvested to improve existing
                           infrastructure, build new capacity, and support economic growth by
                           increasing available electricity at affordable prices. Yet only a small
                           fraction of Kyrgyzstan’s hydropower potential is utilized today, and the
                           country has become a net importer of electricity in recent years.

                           capacity. It is also a source of fiscal risk and macroeconomic instability.

                           building new generation. In the meantime, growing domestic demand

The challenges are              These improvements notwithstanding, the sector still faces daunting
daunting.                       challenges. The primary challenges include macro-fiscal risks,
                                inadequate supply reliability and poor quality of service, high energy
                                intensity and low efficiency, limited financial viability, and concerns
                                about affordability and willingness to pay.

Challenge 1 - Macro-fiscal risks
The energy sector               Energy sector companies have accumulated very significant amounts of
is deeply indebted              debt, which constitute a direct contingent liability for the budget. The
                                cumulated stock of debt of energy sector companies, as of 2016,
                                amounted to KGS 90.7billion, an amount equivalent to 19.8 percent of
                                GDP and 32.2 percent of the country’s overall stock of public and
                                publicly-guaranteed debt. Given the persistent cost recovery gap and the
                                sector’s considerable unmet need for new investment, repayment of this
                                debt from energy companies to the State is hypothetical at best.

… and currently                While energy sector debt currently appears as an asset in Government
unable to repay                accounts, these assets should be discounted. Currently, the solvency of
                               energy sector companies is only maintained through regular debt
                               restructuring and roll-over, with no clear pathway toward equilibrium
                               under the current framework.

space                          unable to meet their spending needs out of own revenues, they require
                               significant yearly transfers and loans from the budget. In 2015 and 2016,
                               these loans amounted to KGS 42.8 billion and 5.2 billion respectively. On
                               average, over 2015-16 the amounts on-lent to energy companies were
                               equivalent to 67.8 percent of the wage bill, 63.8 percent of all expenses
                               on goods and services, 65.2 percent of the total amount spent on
                               pensions, and almost 13 times higher than the (yearly) amounts devoted

Challenge 2 - Supply reliability and quality of service

Sector assets are              Old and under-maintained assets put energy supply reliability and
old and under-                 quality at risk. Sizeable investments have been made to rehabilitate
maintained                     some of the most dilapidated sector assets, but 45 percent of available
                               generation capacity is beyond its useful service life. The state of
                               transmission and distribution assets exacerbates the risk of network
                               failures; for instance, in 2016, Severelectro, the largest power
                               distribution company, reported that about 40 percent of the 928 km of
                               underground cables in Bishkek urgently needed replacement. In the
                               district heating sector, most assets were commissioned 20 to 50 years
                               ago, and are in poor condition.

Old assets mean                Chronic underinvestment, and under-expenditure on repairs and
poor service                   maintenance have led to poor service reliability and quality. Distribution
quality and                    companies reported an average of 43 outages per day between 2009 and
reliability.                   2012. In 2013, firms experienced an average of 0.9 outages per month,
                               costing about 4 percent of sales value.11 The largest HPP (Toktogul)
                               experienced breakdowns in two consecutive winters (2015 and 2016)
                               due to cable line breaks. Quality of supply is also poor, with more than
                               half of the respondents in a 2013 survey indicating problems with
                               voltage fluctuations/low voltage, and nearly one fifth reporting damage
                               to electrical appliances because of poor supply quality.12 Customer
                               service also needs improvement. On a scale of 0-8, with 8 indicating total

in winter if no                Residential demand is characterized by high seasonality. In 2016,
action is taken.               households consumed an average of 286 kWh/month in summer and
                               721 kWh/month in winter. Winter demand accounts for 67 percent of
                               total demand. The use of electricity for heating is a driving factor behind
                               this seasonal consumption pattern. The winter supply gap is expected to
                               grow to 883 GWh in 2030 if no action is taken. Even with the additional
                               capacity expected to be commissioned in 2017 and 2018 from the
                               rehabilitation of the Bishkek CHP plant (+300 MW) and Toktogul HPP
                               (+200 MW), Kyrgyzstan may need to rely on imports in the winter.
                               Higher reliance on imports is likely to have a detrimental impact on the
                               sector’s financial viability given the impact on the cost of service.

Challenge 3 - High energy intensity and poor efficiency

The Kyrgyz                     The Kyrgyz Republic ranks among the 15 most energy-intensive

                               productivity and competitiveness of Kyrgyz companies. A 2013 World
                               Bank Report (Growing Green)15 found that the Kyrgyz manufacturing
                               sectors is among the most energy intensive in EECA.

                                             due to below cost-recovery tariffs amounted to KGS 4.36 billion (1
                                             percent of GDP). Transmission and distribution losses also remain high.
                                             Combined technical and non-technical losses were KGS 1.23 billion (0.29
                                             percent of GDP). Compared to other countries in the region, electricity
                                             losses in the Kyrgyz Republic are high. In 2013, the electric system lost
                                             an estimated 20 percent of generation output in transmission and
                                             distribution losses, compared to 8 percent in Georgia, 12.3 percent in

a/ Mean share is for households with a positive expenditure for that particular energy subcategory. The estimate excludes
households with zero spending on a specific energy source. Thus, total mean energy expenditure is not equal to the sum
of the individual energy components. b/ Heating fuel refers mainly to coal but also to other sources such as bottled gas
and commercial wood.

Subsidized tariffs             The current tariff structure is highly regressive, contradicting its social
are highly                     objectives. The principal mechanism through which the State seeks to
regressive and                 support low income consumers is through a “socially-oriented tariff”,
benefit mostly                 below cost recovery, for residential consumption below 700 kWh. This
wealthy consumers              threshold, however, applies to over 80 percent of residential
                               consumption, thus benefitting a large proportion of consumers who do
                               not need the subsidized tariffs and also benefitting disproportionately
                               large consumers. Incidentally, the tariff structure is believed to
                               incentivize fraud with small commercial users reportedly registering
                               themselves as residential consumers to bypass the higher tariff category.

Still certain                  Energy affordability is a concern for specific categories of the poor and
categories are                 urban consumers. Though the share of household income devoted to
vulnerable to price            energy expenses is low by international standards, the impact of
increases and                  electricity tariff increases on poor rural households would be significant
require protection             given that they have few sources of cash income. Moreover, given the
                               seasonal nature of agricultural income, households dependent on
                               farming have the lowest income during the winter when their energy
                               consumption—and bills—are the highest. Likewise, changes in district
                               heating tariffs would be especially burdensome for low income urban
                               households. The urban poor face different problems than the rural poor
                               including the difficulty of substituting electricity for alternative and
                               cheaper sources of fuel.17 Moreover, those urban residents connected to
                               district heating must pay based on a formula and not on actual
                               consumption. Thus, their energy expenditures are fixed and as prices
                               rise, they have to scale back on other discretionary consumption items
                               such as food, medicines, and other essentials.

But the current                The safety net is fragmented and offers modest support only to the
safety net currently           extreme poor. The Kyrgyz Republic’s safety net includes a cash transfer
doesn’t reach them             program targeted to the extreme rural poor, called the Monthly Benefit
well.                          to Poor Families (MBPF). Though the MBPF represents an important
                               building block of a safety net, it suffers from problems of low coverage,
                               leakage, and inadequate benefits. In addition, there are other programs
                               such as untargeted “categorical benefits” and a transfer program to help
                               the disabled. In order to mitigate the impact of higher energy prices on
                               the poor, vulnerable, and vocal population groups, the government has
                               developed several blunt mechanisms such as increasing compensation
                               to pensioners, public servants, and MBPF recipients

Most people want               Consumers’ willingness to pay is also not necessarily aligned with ability
better service but             to pay, and the desire to have better services. A recent survey on public
                               awareness of energy reforms showed that the public continues to see

these are inefficient and hazardous to the health.

are unwilling to                 high electricity prices as the major priority for government to address
pay for it.                      (21 percent of surveyed households).18 When asked how electricity
                                 tariffs should be managed, 65 percent of respondents said tariffs should
                                 be decreased.

Policy priorities
Multifaceted                     A mix of priority policy and investment actions are needed to address
reforms are                      the challenges described above. The priority actions include the
urgently needed                  following:

                                         Tariff reforms. Closing the cost-recovery gap to restore the
                                          financial viability of the sector, decrease fiscal exposure and
                                          ensure that sector companies have sufficient funds to invest in
                                          supply-side improvements (loss reduction) will not be possible
                                          without increasing tariffs. The implementation of the new MTTP
                                          2018-2021 must be done with more consistency and a focus on
                                          increasing revenues from residential consumers who currently
                                          benefit from below-cost tariffs. Reducing the consumption
                                          threshold for subsidized electricity, for instance from 700kWh to
                                          350kWh, would help to substantially reduce the deficit: such a
                                          reduction alone would result in an estimated 22 percent drop in
                                          the electricity deficit by 2020.

                                         Prioritizing investment and rehabilitation of sector assets.
                                          Progress has been made in mobilizing external financing for the
                                          rehabilitation of existing sector assets, but demand is growing
                                          and additional investments will be needed to meet winter peak
                                          demand. Such investments must be carefully prioritized, on a
                                          least cost basis, and include rehabilitation as well as new
                                          generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure.
                                          Demonstrating that the sector is generating sufficient revenues
                                          to cover costs will be instrumental in mobilizing additional
                                          resources from development partners.

                                         Loss reduction in combination with tariff reform. Priority
                                          investments should also include continued implementation and
                                          expansion of loss reduction measures, which will reduce the
                                          generation needed to meet demand, thereby improving supply
                                          adequacy and reducing the probability of outages. The larger
                                          distribution companies have already begun to implement loss
                                          reduction programs, including the installation of smart meters.
                                          Similar programs should be implemented, when possible,
                                          throughout all other distribution companies. However, it should

                                         be noted that loss reduction measures are not sufficient to
                                         substantially reduce the sector deficit and they need to be
                                         implemented in combination with tariff reforms. Even if losses
                                         were reduced to twelve percent (the average in the region) by
                                         2020, sector simulations show that there would still be a deficit
                                         of KGS 5.9 billion in the electricity sector in the absence of tariff
                                         reform. Even with losses equal to 8 percent, the lowest in the
                                         region (recorded in Georgia) the deficit still reaches KGS 5.5
                                         billion in 2020.

                                        Strengthening governance and regulation. Governance and
                                         regulation improvements continue to be needed. At the sector
                                         level, future policy action should include the adoption of a least-
                                         cost sector planning process; the unbundling of the Energy
                                         Holding’s accounts for different generation companies; and
                                         improvements to the revenue allocation scheme, as the current
                                         scheme gives distribution companies little incentive to reduce
                                         losses and improve financial discipline by not rewarding them
                                         for such efforts. At the regulatory level, the development and
                                         adoption of a revised, cost-recovery level MTTP is important for
                                         the 2018-2021 period, together with staying the course on actual
                                         implementation of the MTTP. The energy sector regulator will
                                         also need to strengthen its monitoring and enforcement of key
                                         performance and quality indicators. In the longer term, the
                                         option of revising energy and electricity laws to account for the


24|
          changing nature of sector institutions (recently established
          regulator, newly created energy holding and State Committee)
          should be considered to provide greater clarity on the remit of
          the entities and strengthen their decision-making capacity.

         Strengthen the protection of vulnerable households. The
          government has limited capacity and fiscal resources to have a
          broad safety net program to reach all the poor in the country
          (although addressing the revenue gap in the sector would reduce
          the need for budgetary transfers and hence increase fiscal space
          significantly). Thus, in the short run, it should devote its effort to
          strengthening the MBPF program, which targets the extreme
          poor, and rationalizing and scaling-back categorical benefits. In
          the short- to medium-term, the poor can be helped by (i) having
          a well-designed and targeted lifeline tariff, since it is the easiest
          and most practical way of mitigating the impact of tariff
          increases of the poor; and (ii) adopting a mechanism to help
          households smooth energy payments annually to prevent
          bunching in winter months. In the longer term, the social
          protection system should move away from categorical benefits,
          and focus on supporting the vulnerable and poor. The efficiency
          of the social protection system could also be greatly improved by
          simplifying what is currently a complex system of top-ups and a
          multiplicity of small programs that are costly to administer.

         Communication and Outreach. The government fears a political
          backlash from raising tariffs given the population’s perception of
          mismanagement of the sector—and the reality, where they
          receive unreliable services. Thus, any outreach efforts have to
          include a mechanism of using evidence that draws the linkage
          between higher tariffs, better sector management and stronger
          protection of poor and vulnerable.
