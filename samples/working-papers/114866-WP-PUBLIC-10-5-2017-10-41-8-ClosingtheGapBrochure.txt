There is an increasing global focus on social
protection. For the first time social protection (SP)
is part of a comprehensive Sustainable Development
Goals (SDG) agenda.
SDGs Goal 1 is to end (extreme) poverty in all its manifestations
by 2030, ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable,
increase access to basic services, and support people harmed by
climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and
environmental shocks and disasters. Target 1.3 (Goal 1) seeks to
implement nationally appropriate social protection systems and
measures for all, including floors, and by 2030 achieve substantial
coverage of the poor and the vulnerable. Target 1.5 (Goal 1), which
is related to adaptive SP, aims to build the resilience of the poor
and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and
vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic,
                                                                                         Figure 1. Number of developing countries with SSN programs

There has also been an increasing complexity of SSN                                      In the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region, for example,

Most countries have a diverse set of SSN instruments. Globally,                          from 0.3% of GDP in 2000 to more than 1.5% in 2015 (see Figure
77% and 42% of countries have unconditional and conditional                              3). This happened at the same time as the regional GDP has also

A growing commitment to SSN is also evident in the                                       However, significant variations in spending are observed across
fact that countries tend to spend more on SSN over                                       countries and regions. ECA, SSA and LAC are currently at the
