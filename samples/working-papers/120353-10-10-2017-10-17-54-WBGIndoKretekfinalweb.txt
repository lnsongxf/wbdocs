EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Indonesia, home to 73.6 million smokers estimated as of 2015, has one of the high-
est rates of cigarette consumption in the world. Smoking prevalence among work-
ing-age individuals has exceeded 30 percent since 2001. In 2013, smoking prevalence
among males was 66%, while smoking prevalence among females was 6.7%. If the current
trend of smoking rate remains unabated, the smoking population will grow to 95 million
by 2025. The share of the smoking population could be reduced from 35.7% in 2010 to
25% in 2025, if Indonesia adopts the global target endorsed by the United Nations General
Assembly in 2011 (30% relative reduction in smoking prevalence) for prevention of prema-
ture deaths from four major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as, cancer, diabetes,
lung disease and cardiovascular disease.

Indonesia has one of the most complex cigarette excise tax systems in the world.
The current cigarette excise tax has 12 tiers, which are based on the type of cigarettes, the
number of cigarettes produced, and per-unit retail price. Such a system favors downward
substitution to more lower priced products and has limited impact on smoking reduction.
The tiers in the cigarette excise tax structure aim to accommodate small-scale cigarette
firms, especially SKT firms. The rationale for such a structure is that smaller SKT firms
account for more than half of total factories in the tobacco industry. Moreover, these firms
are responsible for employing a significant share of the workers in tobacco manufacturing.

This report aims to contribute to the policy debate over the tobacco excise tax
reform and employment in Indonesia by identifying the socioeconomic and labor
market characteristics of kretek workers and their households from two large kretek
producing districts. The analysis in this report is based on data collected from a sample
survey of 720 kretek workers’ households from two large kretek producing districts, Kudus
and Malang. The rationale for undertaking a special survey of hand-rolled kretek workers’
households is twofold. First, kretek making is much more labor intensive in hand-rolled
kretek firms than in machine-made kretek firms. It is estimated that 93% of kretek workers
are employed in hand-rolled kretek factories (World Bank, 2017a). However, the existing
national-level surveys do not distinguish between kretek workers in machine-made and
hand-rolled kretek firms. Second, the insight into the qualitative dimensions of choice of
livelihood, particularly the work-life preference pattern of predominantly female hand-rolled
kretek workers, is critical in identifying the alternative livelihood options for displaced kretek
workers. This dimension was captured in both the focus group discussions (FGDs) and a
specific module on kretek workers’ livelihood options in the kretek roller household survey.

We found that Kretek workers are typically female, older adults with a low level of
education. The average age of the kretek worker is 40 years, and about 94% of the kretek
workers are female. More than half of the kretek workers obtained an elementary educa-
tion. About 27% of the kretek workers obtained a junior high school education, while only
15% of them obtained a senior high school education.


4 // Executive Summary
The kretek rollers in the sample work mostly in large firms, and the clear majority
are production line workers. Large firms employ 72.6% of the workers, followed by
20.2% in medium firms and only 4.9% and 2.3% in small firms and micro firms, respec-
tively. Kretek workers are involved in different stages of kretek production. About 38% are
involved in rolling paper, 33% in filling tobacco dust, 38% in cutting, 31% in packaging,
and 13% in ticketing. About 46% of these workers are engaged in more than
one task.

The majority (65%) of the kretek workers reported having an unwritten contract
with their firms. While there is no significant difference between wages of contract and
casual workers, a significantly larger fraction of contract workers reported receiving non-
wage benefits from their employers, such as, paid sick leave, paid holiday/vacation, and
paid maternity leave.

An average kretek worker has been working in her firm for 214 months or close to
18 years and only a third were working full-time in the kretek industry.
The observed long-term employment opportunity of kretek workers suggests that the
kretek industry offers a sense of job security that they may not get in other occupations.
The full-time workers worked on average 2,568 hours annually, while kretek workers who
worked less than full-time worked on average 1,426 hours annually. The full-time employ-
ment among kretek workers is 80.4% (639 FTE workers out of 795), which means that the
307,793 workers employed in the kretek industry as of 2014 are equivalent to 247,394
full-time workers. Given that kretek workers are predominantly female who are less likely
to be household heads and more likely to have nonmarket responsibilities (e.g., child care,
household chores), it is typically the motivation to provide supplementary income for the
family that drives the less than full employment nature of kretek rolling.

About two-thirds of the kretek households (60.84% of the sample) reported receiv-
ing at least one form of social benefits in the past year provided by the government
of Indonesia. These are social safety nets for the poor and near-poor population docu-
mented in the ownership of a Social Protection Card (Kartu Perlindungan Social, KPS and
Kartu Keluarga Sejahtera, KKS) and Health Insurance Card (Kartu Indonesia Sehat, KIS and
BPJS Penerima Bantuan Iuran, PBI). These benefits include cash assistance or transfer, rice
for the poor (raskin), assistance for health payment, assistance for poor students, and assis-
tance from the social protection programs of KPS or KKS. About 11.9% of kretek house-
holds own KPS or KKS cards. They are entitled to a monthly cash assistance of Rp 200,000
(US$15). We find that enrollment in the rice for the poor program is positively and signifi-
cantly correlated with female-headed households.

We estimate that the desired tax increase will reduce employment in the handmade
kretek industry by about 8.25%. Households whose member is laid off from the kretek
industry would experience a decrease in the household resource by about 38% and in
household income by about 41%. The decrease in wage income is estimated to be higher
at 49%. However, households have other income sources such as farm and nonfarm



                                                                                               5
resources. Thus, the estimated drops in household resource and income are still lower
than the estimated drop in wage income. Nevertheless, some households would lose
as much as 31–47% of total household resources or 27–52% of household total income.
These are quite significant as affected households would lose, on average, more than
one-third of their total resource and income.

The total income loss from the reduction in employment in the handmade kretek
industry amounts to 1.4% of the revenue gain from increasing cigarette taxes.
The World Bank estimates the annual revenue gain would be Rp 12,875 billion and the
employment loss in the handmade kretek industry would be 24,000. Given the mean
annualized kretek income at Rp 15,500,000 and the projected decrease in wage income
by 48.93%, the loss of 24,000 jobs in the kretek industry would imply total income loss
amounting to Rp 182 billion, which is 1.4% of the revenue gain. This is a win-win policy
change because the tax and price increase will not only reduce tobacco use and related
health costs, it will generate additional revenue which can more than compensate for the
income loss due to a reduction in production and employment in the kretek industry.

It is important to note that these estimates represent the gross employment effect
of lower cigarette consumption. When prices of cigarettes increase, consumers may
shift their consumption to other goods and services which will create jobs in these sec-
tors. Evidence has shown that the job losses in the tobacco sector (gross effect) are usu-
ally compensated with job creation in the other sectors (net effect). For Indonesia, Ahsan
and Wiyono (2007) estimated positive effects varying from 84,340 to 281, 135 jobs with
tax increases of 25 percent and 100 percent, respectively (Ahsan and Wiyono, 2007).

Based on the findings of this report, we can draw two major policy
recommendations:

First, the most vulnerable groups in the affected population who would need immediate
income support in the event of job loss include the workers who are less educated, older,
heads of their households, and contribute a significant proportion of total household income
from kretek rolling. The government can provide income support to these workers with less
than 2% of the revenue gained from a tax increase.

Second, the remaining 98% additional revenue or part thereof can be allocated for re-skill-
ing and redeployment of laid off kretek workers to smooth their transition to an alternative
source of employment in the short to medium term.

This report is part of the Indonesia Tobacco Employment Studies implemented by the World
Bank and the American Cancer Society. The findings from this report complements the find-
ings from the other reports which focused on other specific segments of the tobacco sector
employment in Indonesia, more specifically tobacco farmers (World Bank 2017b), clove farm-
ers (World Bank, 2017c), and tobacco manufacturing more broadly (World Bank, 2017a).

    INTRODUCTION
    Kretek or clove cigarette is a major form of combustible tobacco product in Indo-
    nesia, home to 73.6 million smokers estimated as of 2015 (around 40% of the
    adult population). If the current trend of smoking rate remains unabated, the smoking
    population will grow to 95 million by 2025. The share of the smoking population could
    be reduced from 35.7% in 2010 to 25% in 2025, if Indonesia adopts the global target
    endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011 (30% relative reduction in
    smoking prevalence) for prevention of premature deaths from four major noncommuni-
    cable diseases (NCDs), such as, cancer, diabetes, lung disease and cardiovascular disease.

    Indonesia is poised to fight the NCD epidemic by reducing tobacco use through
    aggressive tobacco control measures including significant increases in tobacco
    taxes. The tobacco industry in Indonesia has been actively defying tax increases based
    on the argument that the livelihood of workers employed in the tobacco industry
    depends on the continuing demand for tobacco products, and their economic well-be-
    ing would be at stake if they lose jobs due to a fall in production in the wake of falling
    demand in this sector. The employment consideration in tobacco manufacturing has also
    been reflected historically in the preferential treatment of the hand-rolled kretek industry
    in cigarette excise tax policy (see Box 1).

    The costs of employment and income loss are, however, expected to be minimal
    when compared to the social and fiscal gains attainable from tax increases. The
    additional revenue generated from tax increases can be channeled to provide income
    support to displaced tobacco workers and help them find alternative sources of employ-
    ment. By examining the socioeconomic status and alternative livelihood options of kretek
    workers, we provide an estimate of the income loss that kretek rollers can incur vis-à-vis
    the revenue gain from a desired tax increase. We argue that the additional revenue can
    be made available to provide government support required to compensate the affected
    households for surviving the income shock and re-skill the kretek workers to make transi-
    tions to alternative jobs.

    Using data from the Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics, the World Bank esti-
    mates 307,793 kretek workers in Indonesia in 2014 (World Bank, 2017a). With an
    average household size of four, this employment size implies that approximately 1.2 mil-
    lion people are dependent on kretek rolling for their livelihood in Indonesia. The report
    shows that tobacco manufacturing represents only a small share of the economy wide
    employment (0.60%). Additionally, the contribution of the tobacco manufacturing to
    employment in the manufacturing sector is quite small (5.3%) in comparison to the


                                                                                                 11

contribution of the food (27.43%), garment (11.43%), and textile (7.90%) sectors.
Although small, tobacco manufacturing jobs are heavily concentrated with about 94%
of tobacco manufacturing workers in Central Java, East Java, and West Nusa Tenggara. In
these provinces, several districts are quite dependent on tobacco sector employment, as
for example Kudus (30%), Temanggung (27.6%), and Kediri (26%).

This report identifies the socioeconomic and labor market characteristics of kretek
workers and their households from two large kretek producing districts. The anal-
ysis in this report is based on data collected from a sample survey of 720 kretek workers’
households from two large kretek producing districts, Kudus and Malang. The details of
the survey methodology are provided in Appendix A. The purposive selection of sample
districts is driven by a high degree of regional concentration of kretek factories. Based on
the annual Survey of Industry (SI), 40% of Indonesian kretek workers are in three districts
only—Kudus (21.4%), Kediri (10.2%), and Malang (8.6%) (World Bank, 2017a).
The rationale for undertaking a special survey of hand-rolled kretek workers’
households is twofold. First, kretek making is much more labor intensive in hand-rolled
kretek firms than in machine-made kretek firms. It is estimated that 93% of kretek workers
are employed in hand-rolled kretek factories (World Bank, 2017a). It is expected that the
brunt of the employment impact of tax policy change would be felt by those currently
employed in hand-rolled kretek factories, and they would need targeted intervention for
income support and redeployment programs. However, the existing national level sur-
veys do not distinguish between kretek workers in machine-made and hand-rolled kretek
firms. Due to this limitation, we were unable to investigate the socio-economic and liveli-
hood conditions of hand-rolled kretek workers in isolation from the machine-made kretek
workers. The hand-rolled kretek roller survey thus complements the existing national level
surveys. Second, the insight into the qualitative dimensions of choice of livelihood, partic-
ularly the work-life preference pattern of predominantly female hand-rolled kretek work-
ers, is critical in identifying the alternative livelihood options for displaced kretek workers.
This dimension was captured in both the focus group discussions (FGDs) and a specific
module on kretek workers’ livelihood options in the kretek roller household survey.

This report consists of six sections, including this introduction. The next section,
Section 2, describes the socioeconomic profile of kretek workers and their households. In
Section 3, the labor market characteristics of kretek workers are discussed. The livelihood
status of kretek workers are covered in Section 4. Section 5 presents the simulated results
of the impacts of cigarette excise tax policy reform on the livelihood of kretek workers.
Finally, Section 6 concludes with the summary of findings and policy recommendations.




12 // Introduction
Box 1: Kretek Industry in Indonesia
The history of mixing cloves with tobacco to make kreteks in Indonesia dates back to the
seventeenth century, although the commercialization of clove cigarettes on a successful
scale did not take place until the twentieth century.

Initially, kreteks were rolled by hand in a cottage environment and the industry was dom-
inated by the Javanese Indonesians. The ownership of kretek industries gradually went
to the hands of Chinese entrepreneurs, who played a key role in large-scale production
of kreteks and the emergence of the largest kretek companies such as Djarum, Bentoel,
Gudang Garam and Sampoerna. Hand-rolled kreteks occupied the kretek market exclu-
sively until 1968 when mechanization began in this industry.

Mechanization in the kretek industry was a natural response of the kretek companies to
growing demand for kreteks that necessitated a rapid increase in production and led to
a shortage of labor in the 1970s to 1980s. Between 1970 and 1990, annual cigarette con-
sumption in Indonesia more than quadrupled from 33 to 141 billion sticks. Mechanization
was, however, a privilege of only the large companies until the early 1980s. The regula-
tion of the Directorate General of Customs and Excise in 1979 limited the production of
machine-made kreteks in small- and medium-scale enterprises to a proportion of 1:2 of
machine vs. hand-rolled kreteks. Large-scale enterprises were exempted from this regu-
lation. This regulation was targeted to secure employment in small- and medium-scale
factories by limiting machine production of kreteks. It, however, offered a competitive
advantage to large-scale firms in gaining control of the market through product innova-
tion such as production of filter kreteks by machines.

In 1987, the government introduced a tax regulation offering a preferential tax structure
in favor of hand-rolled kretek factories—5–7 percent of retail price for hand-rolled kreteks
and 35–37 percent for machine-made kreteks. Although the tax rates have been raised
over the years, the differential tax regime offering advantages to hand-rolled kreteks over
machine-made kreteks have continued until the present days.

As of 2017, the excise tax on hand-rolled kreteks is 20–33 percent of minimum retail price,
while the excise tax share is 45–51 percent for machine-made kreteks, the range depend-
ing on the production volume of factories and range of retail price. Securing employment
in hand-rolled kretek factories has been the driving force behind this lopsided cigarette

    SOCIOECONOMIC PROFILE
    OF KRETEK ROLLERS
    Kretek workers are typically female, older adults with low levels of education. Table
    A2 in Appendix A summarizes the socioeconomic characteristics of the kretek workers
    and their household members in the sample. The average age of the kretek worker is 40
    years, and about 94% of the kretek workers are female. More than half of the kretek work-
    ers obtained elementary education. About 27% of the kretek workers obtained a junior
    high school education, while only 15% of them obtained a senior high school education.

    Kretek rollers’ households rely on diverse sources for wage income. About half of
    wage workers in the kretek-rollers’ households work in kretek firms as their primary occu-
    pation (Table 1). The second largest proportion of household members (17.5%) work in the
    construction sector. Almost all kretek rollers (98.6%) reported that they have other house-
    hold members who work in different sectors other than kretek rolling, such as farming,
    nonfarm agricultural activities, utilities, mining and quarrying, construction, transport, food
    processing and sales, textile industry, trading, and different services. Thus, less than 2% of
    kretek rollers’ households depend solely on kretek rolling as their main occupation and are
    likely the most vulnerable segment of the population dependent on the kretek industry.

    While lack of skill generally limits market opportunities to be employed, there is no
    specific skill requirement to work in a kretek factory, as revealed by several FGD par-
    ticipants. Other reasons for working in a kretek factory are the proximity to home, favor-
    able working hours, and avoidance of boredom. One participant mentioned that she works
    shorter hours in a kretek factory (6 A.M. - 12 noon) than in other sectors (7 A.M. - 5 P.M.).
    The participants also mentioned that a typical wage laborer or salaried employee receives
    wages or salaries on a weekly or monthly basis, while kretek workers receive daily wages
    which offer them greater liquidity of money. Furthermore, some participants mentioned
    that they did not formally apply to work in kretek factories. They were brought in by their
    friends or relatives and became apprentices in the factories.

    About 70% of kretek workers reported that they are either in good, very good, or
    excellent health condition. Only 3.2% of workers reported poor health status. About
    35% of workers reported to have suffered from any illness or injury in the past 30 days.
    The median number of days these workers suffered from illness or injury is three. The medi-
    an number of workdays lost due to illness or injury is one. In Figure 1, we show the average
    number of days kretek workers stopped working by their health status. It appears that


                                                                                                     15

kretek workers who reported poor health conditions stopped working for about four days,
while those who did not report poor health stopped working for about two days. We find
no correlation between the number of days stopped working and age.

The employment in kretek factories is mostly localized. Most kretek workers (56%)
were born in the same place where they were working and residing. Others migrated
from their place of birth to the current place of residence primarily due to marriage
(51.6%), work (33.1%) and transfer of residence of family (9.5%). Thus, only 14.8% of all the
kretek workers migrated to work in the kretek industry.

     There seems to exist relative ease of substitution of labor across industries.
     We observe that about 40% of the kretek workers were employed in a different sector,
     such as textile, food production and processing, farming, retail sales, restaurant, tailoring,
     beauty salon, and service industries, prior to working in the kretek industry. The fact that
     nearly half of the kretek workers have prior market skills other than kretek rolling is evi-
     dence of resilience to make a transition to a different sector in the event of job loss in the
     kretek industry.

     A quarter of the kretek workers indicated that they switched to the kretek industry
     because it pays better. It is estimated that workers in tobacco manufacturing draw 14–
     16% higher wages than comparable workers in other manufacturing sectors (see Table 7
     in World Bank 2017a). In addition, 16% of kretek workers reported a better offer of benefits
     and 17% reported proximity of the kretek factory to residence as the major incentives for
     switching to the kretek industry. In the FGD, kretek workers mentioned that the benefits
     of working in a large kretek firm include religious holiday allowance (tunjangan hari raya),
     bonus for national holidays, paid maternal leave, health insurance, and severance pay. One
     FGD participant mentioned that the pay for maternal leave is equivalent to the salary for
     90 days.
     More than a fifth of the kretek workers (22.6%) reported that one of their parents or
     parents-in-law were employed in the kretek industry. Only a small proportion of kretek
     workers (4.4%) reported that their grandparents were employed in the kretek industry. How-
     ever, most kretek workers (82%) do not want their children to be employed in the kretek
     industry because they want to see their children move upward to higher paying jobs.

             LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES

O            OF KRETEK ROLLERS
             The kretek rollers in the sample work mostly in large firms that employ more than 500




N
             workers (72.6%) followed by medium firms with 151–500 workers (20.2%), small firms with
             51–150 workers (4.9%) and micro firms with less than 50 workers (2.3%). Based on the
             unconditional median wage rates (including value of in-kind benefits) reported in Table
             2 for daily, weekly, and monthly payments stratified by firm size, we find that larger kretek
             rolling firms tend to pay higher wages than smaller kretek rolling firms for daily wage
             laborers. The difference is not systematic for weekly and monthly payments.

             Most kretek workers (96%) are production line workers. Kretek workers are involved
             in different stages of kretek production. About 38% are involved in rolling paper, 33% in
             filling tobacco dust, 38% in cutting, 31% in packaging, and 13% in ticketing. About 46%




L
             of these workers are engaged in more than one task. For example, 26.8% of workers are
             engaged in both rolling paper and filling tobacco dust. There is, however, a clear division
             of labor on task combinations. Kretek workers engaged in rolling paper are also engaged
             in filling tobacco dust and cutting. On the other hand, kretek workers engaged in pack-
             aging may also be engaged in ticketing, but not in rolling paper, filling tobacco dust, or




3
             cutting. Therefore, we classify kretek workers into those who roll, fill tobacco dust, and cut
             (63%) and those who pack and place tickets (32%). There is generally no difference in spe-
             cialization in tasks between contract and casual labor, except in filling tobacco dust and
             packaging where a larger proportion of contract workers are engaged.

The Economics of Kretek Rolling in Indonesia




In the FGD, participants mentioned that the wage is different across tasks, such
as, rolling kretek (nggiling), cutting both edges of kreteks (mbathil), and packing
kreteks (nyonthong). For example, a participant who works in a large factory mentioned
that they can roll 4,000 kreteks per day and earn Rp 50,000 for rolling (nggiling) or Rp
30,000 for cutting the edge of kreteks (mbathil). On the other hand, a participant who
works in a smaller firm rolls 1,500 to 2,000 kreteks per day and earns Rp 16,000 for rolling
or Rp 11,000 for cutting the edge of kreteks.

Most workers (96%) receive annual religious holiday allowances and three-quar-
ters receive health allowance from their employers, suggesting a wide coverage of
benefits offered by the kretek industry. Moreover, over two-thirds of workers reported
that they receive masks, apparel, and hats as safety equipment in their workplace. In case
of illness, 40% of workers receive free medication from factory clinics, 67% of workers
are covered by the Indonesian National Health Insurance Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan
Sosial (BPJS), and 32% of workers receive reimbursements for medications they purchase
individually.

About 15% of kretek workers reported having a written contract, and 65% had
unwritten contracts with their firms. While there is no significant difference between
wages of contract and casual workers, a significantly larger fraction of contract workers
reported receiving nonwage benefits from their employers, such as, paid sick leave, paid

holiday/vacation, paid maternity leave and severance pay (Table 3). Note that while the
coverage of severance pay benefit is enormous (93%) for contract workers, the percent-
age of casual workers receiving this benefit (70%) is not negligible.
Kretek workers enjoy long tenure in the kretek industry. An average kretek worker
has been working in her firm for 214 months or close to 18 years. There is a positive and
significant correlation between the length of tenure and the age of workers as shown in
Figure 2. On average, the tenure of workers aged 15–30 is 7.2 years, aged 30–40 is 15.5
years, aged 40–50 is 21 years, and aged above 50 is 29 years. The observed long-term
employment opportunity of kretek workers suggests that the kretek industry offers a
sense of job security that they may not get in other occupations.

Only a third of kretek workers were working full-time in the kretek industry. The full-
time workers worked on average 2,568 hours annually, while kretek workers who worked less
than full-time worked on average 1,426 hours annually. Since two-thirds of the kretek rollers
are less than full-time employed, we estimate full-time equivalent (FTE) employment of the
kretek rollers in the sample by assigning weights to each kretek roller based on the number
of work hours they reported for the last 12 months. For the full-time employed, the weight
is 1. For the less than full-time employed, the weight is given by the ratio of the number of
hours they worked in kretek rolling to annual full-time work hours (40 hours per week × 50
weeks = 2,000 hours assuming leave of 2 weeks). The sum of these weights provides the
FTE number of kretek rollers. The FTE employment is thus 80.4% (639 FTE workers out of
795) of the actual number of individuals employed in kretek rolling. By this measure, the
307,793 workers employed in the kretek industry as of 2014 is equivalent to 247,394 full-

The Economics of Kretek Rolling in Indonesia




An FTE ratio of less than one may indicate the presence of underemployment or
casual labor, as well as willingness to provide supplementary income for total
household earning among kretek workers. Given that kretek workers are predom-
inantly female who are less likely to be household heads and more likely to have non-
market responsibilities (e.g., child care, household chores), it is typically the motivation to
provide supplementary income for the family that drives the less than full employment
nature of kretek rolling.

Labor force participation is somewhat higher among women (80%) than men (74%)
among working-age members (15–69 years) in kretek rollers’ households. The female
labor force participation rate is biased upward given the sample selection criterion of the
inclusion of households with at least one kretek roller who is predominantly female. Among
the female labor force participants, 85.5% are employed in the kretek industry, indicating the
predominance of the kretek industry as a source of employment to the female labor force in
the region. The other 14.5% female workers are employed in retail sales, the food processing
industry, services such as tailoring and beauty salon, garments industry, teaching and other
professional services, farming, restaurants, and other industries.

In what follows, we examine the determinants of labor force participation and work
hour decisions in the kretek industry. Since most workers in the kretek industry are
women (94%) and female labor supply decisions are characteristically different from male
labor supply, we have limited the labor supply analysis below to female kretek rollers only.

The labor supply decisions in kretek industry can be modeled in three stages:

   1.	 Participation in the labor market
   2.	 Choice to work in the kretek industry conditional on participation in the
       labor market
   3.	 Work intensity or number of hours worked annually conditional on labor
       market participation and choice to work in the kretek industry
In order to determine the wage elasticity of labor supply of kretek rollers, we have used a
predicted wage from a wage regression (Column 1 in Table 4) fitted with the basic socio-de-
mographic characteristics and area of residence of the female working-age (15–69) individ-
uals in the sample. The reported wages for working individuals are replaced with predicted
wages in order to address the possible endogeneity of the wage variable in the regression.

The results of estimation of the above four functions, provided in Table 4, indicate
that wage rate is not a significant determinant of women’s labor force participation
or the decision to work in the kretek industry or number of work hours (Columns 2, 3
and 4). The only significant determinant of labor force participation of women is the pres-
ence and number of young children (age 5 and below) in the family. For each additional
child, the probability of a woman participating in the labor market goes down by 0.11


22 // Labor Market Outcomes of Kretek Workers
             (Column 2). However, number of minor children is not a significant factor in the decision
             to work in the kretek industry. This finding distinguishes kretek rolling as a convenient
             source of employment for the female labor force, who prefer flexibility of work hours criti-
             cally needed for household management.

             Among the female labor force participants, older, married, divorced/separated/
             widowed, and workers with elementary or junior high school level educations are
             more likely to work in the kretek industry than in other sectors (Column 3). The
             number of annual work hours is significantly higher for married women and for the work-
             ers in larger firms (Column 4).

When asked where they would have worked had they not been working in a kretek
factory to begin with, about 35% of workers answered that they would have been a
housewife. This percentage is somewhat lower (26.8%) among the kretek rollers who are
the heads of their households and are presumably heavily dependent on their job in the
kretek industry as the principal earner of the family. Kretek workers gave similar responses
when they were asked about the type of job they see themselves having if the factory
closes.
The likelihood that a kretek roller would have been a housewife is correlated with
years of schooling and age. As reported in Column 1 of Table 5, kretek workers with
fewer years of schooling are associated with a greater likelihood of being a housewife, as
these workers are less likely to possess specific skills that are needed in the labor market.
Similarly, older workers expressed greater willingness to turn to being a housewife in the
absence of kretek rolling.
The preference of female kretek workers for reverting to the role of a housewife in
case of job loss in the kretek industry was also reflected exclusively in the FGDs. The
participants revealed that they would not look for any other job. They would rather stay
home and take care of children and household chores. Their strong preference for kretek
rolling as a job comes from the fact that it offers flexible work hours, and they can enjoy
a balance between their responsibilities at work and their households. The flexibility of
work hours in kretek factories lends support to the finding in the labor supply function
presented in Table 4, that shows the number of minor children in the household is not a
significant factor in the decision to participate in kretek rolling.
Another 25% of kretek workers reported that they would have been engaged in
home-based nonfarm self-employment activities had they not been working in a
kretek factory. These activities include, but are not limited to, opening a beauty shop,
bamboo wicker business, bird cage business, cake shop, noodle shop, clothes shop, food
stall, massage service, meatball shop, phone shop, printing shop, snack/drink stall, doing
embroidery, selling fruits, selling cooked snail, or becoming a tailor. As reported in Col-
umn 2 of Table 5, kretek workers with longer years of schooling are more likely to choose
home-based income generating activities. These workers may have gained specific skills
during their schooling years. About 9.4% of kretek workers indicated that they would have



24 // Labor Market Outcomes of Kretek Workers
been engaged in home-based farming. Thus, in total, about 35% (25% in nonfarm and
9.4% in farm activities) of kretek workers indicated that they would have been engaged in
micro or home-based enterprises had they not worked in the kretek industry.

The Economics of Kretek Rolling in Indonesia




Kretek workers were asked if they would quit their job at the kretek industry if the
government launches a re-skilling and redeployment program. About 38% of work-
ers are willing to quit their current job, while the majority (62%) are reluctant to quit. As
shown in Column 3 of Table 5, kretek workers with longer tenure at the factory are more
likely to be reluctant to quit. It is also notable that kretek workers with a higher proportion
of kretek income in total household income, who are more dependent on employment in
the kretek industry and who are more vulnerable in the event of loss of a job in the kretek
industry, are more willing to quit and join a re-skilling and redeployment program.
The critical policy relevant question is whether kretek workers are capable or
willing to find employment in alternative occupations. When asked whether they
would continue to work in the kretek industry if they have job opportunities offering
equal or higher wages than they currently make in the kretek industry, 88% answered in
the affirmative. Others indicated that they can be self-employed in household farm and
nonfarm activities.

The preference for continuing to work in the kretek industry is strongly correlated
with tenure. The largest proportion of workers (40%) reported that the main reason for
staying in the kretek industry is that kretek rolling is the only job they ever had (Figure 3).
Apparently, these workers are older and have enjoyed longer tenure. Recall that the aver-
age length of tenure among kretek workers is 18 years. The long-term nature of employ-
ment in the kretek industry suggests that the industry offers a stable and secure job to its
workers. Some kretek workers reported that they lack necessary skills for other jobs (15%),
are too old to move (13%), and prefer the work benefits (8%)—such as facilities, insurance,
and allowance. The minority of kretek workers who preferred to move to another industry
argued that working in the kretek industry is harmful to health (24%), they are willing to
learn new skills (20%), and they are not earning enough from kretek rolling (7%).

    THE LIVELIHOODS OF
    KRETEK ROLLERS
    In this section, we investigate kretek workers’ livelihoods, including their annual
    wage income, annual total household income, and total resources, per-capita
    resource and income, and poverty status.1 The summary statistics of these character-
    istics of kretek rollers’ households are provided in Table 6. It shows that an average kretek
    household earned about Rp 32,500,000 (US$2,437) of total wage income in the past year
    and about Rp 15,500,000 (US$1,162) from the kretek industry. So, for the average house-
    hold in the sample with a kretek worker, income from kretek rolling contributes a bit less
    than half of the total wage income of the household.

    The estimated poverty headcount ratio by the per-capita household resource is
    8.8% based on the individual poverty line at US$1.90 a day at 2011 purchasing
    power parity (PPP) (Table 6). This figure is quite similar to the national level poverty rate of
    8.3% in 2014 (World Bank Poverty and Equity Database). The estimated poverty rate based
    on the national poverty line of Rp 330,776 per person per month (US$22.60) is 11.2%,
    which is identical to Indonesia’s statistics estimate of 11.1% in September 2015.
    So, households with kretek-based income are no more or less likely to be poor than
    those who do not have any kretek-based income.

    The poverty rate increases to 10.7% at US$1.90 a day at 2011 PPP or 14.3% at
    the national poverty line when using per-capita household income. The difference
    in the poverty rates based on the household resource and income measures comes from
    the difference in accounting for these two measures. Household resource adds up rev-
    enue from farm and nonfarm household enterprises with wage and nonlabor income,
    and household income measure subtracts the costs of farm and nonarm activities from
    revenue and adds up the profit (or loss) with wage and non-labor income. While some of
    the households who incur losses in farm and nonfarm enterprises make up for the loss by
    cross-subsidizing from wages and nonlabor income, about 2–3% of households fail to
    do so and are pushed below the poverty line.

Note:
1. Statistics are weighted by the size of each household.
2. Household total resource is the sum of wage income, revenue from farm activities, revenue from nonfarm
activities, and nonlabor income.
3. Household total income is the sum of wage income, gross margin from farm activities, gross margin from
nonfarm activities, and nonlabor income.
4. Gross margin is defined as the difference between revenue and costs, whereas costs is the sum of production
costs for hired labor, raw materials, and other operating costs.
5. Household nonfarm revenue is generated from enterprises, such as artisan, metalworking, tailoring, repair
work, processing and selling of crops, etc.
6. Household assets are defined as the sum of current values of household durable goods (e.g., television, refrig-
erator, electronic goods, household appliances, vehicles, etc.).




30 // The Livelihoods of Kretek Rollers
The poverty status of households is significantly correlated with a lower level of
education of household heads, larger number of dependents below age 15, female
head, and higher proportion of kretek income in household total wage income
(Table 7). These characteristics can help identify the vulnerable group of households who
need immediate support or a social safety net to prevent increased impoverishment from
job loss of kretek workers.

About two-thirds of the kretek households (60.84% in the sample) reported re-
ceiving at least one form of social benefit in the past year provided by the gov-
ernment of Indonesia. These are social safety nets for poor and near poor populations
documented in the ownership of a Social Protection Card (Kartu Perlindungan Sosial, KPS
and Kartu Keluarga Sejahtera, KKS) and Health Insurance Card (Kartu Indonesia Sehat, KIS
and BPJS Penerima Bantuan Iuran, PBI). Table 8 summarizes the enrollment of households
into these programs. These benefits include cash assistance or transfer, rice for the poor
(raskin), assistance for health payment, assistance for poor students, and from the social
protection programs of KPS or KKS. About 11.9% of kretek households own a KPS or KKS
card. They are entitled to a monthly cash assistance of Rp 200,000 (US$15). We find that
enrollment in the rice for the poor program is positively and significantly correlated with
female-headed households.

More than 95% of kretek households reported having sufficient food in the past
year. Only 4.4% of households reported that they did not have enough food for their
household. About 70% of kretek households who did not have enough food received
rice from the rice for the poor program. When asked about reasons for experiencing food
insecurity, many kretek households reported job loss or inadequate income as the main
reasons. Note that 98% of kretek households purchase their staple foods, mainly rice, from
the market. Dependence on the market to obtain staple foods can make kretek house-
holds susceptible to food insecurity in a volatile job market or income uncertainties
In about a quarter of kretek households with an estimated 292,491 household
members, the share of kretek income to household wage income is 92% or higher.
About 22% of kretek households rely solely on kretek rolling for wage income. This per-
centage is much larger (40%) among female-headed kretek households. We observe that
there is a significant and negative correlation between annual household wage income
and proportion of kretek income. As shown in Figure 4, households that rely solely on
kretek income have, on average, lower household wage income. These households are,
therefore, not only heavily dependent on kretek rolling and vulnerable to the loss of a job
in a kretek factory, but also suffer from relatively low wage income compared to house-
holds that diversify wage employment of household members.

        Kretek households rely mainly on wage income and nonfarming revenue to derive
        household resources. As shown in Figure 5, the largest share of household resource
        (40%) comes from nonfarm revenue. The households with kretek workers who work less
        than full-time in the kretek industry, on average, earn higher nonfarm revenue compared
        to the households with full-time kretek workers (Figure 6). Kretek wage income contrib-
        utes about 27% and non-kretek wage income contributes about 29% of household total
        resource. The contribution of nonlabor income and farming revenue is quite small, only
        4.1% of a household’s total resource.

The contributions of different sources change dramatically when the costs of pro-
duction in farm and nonfarm activities are considered to calculate household total
income (Figure 7). The contributions of nonfarm activities reduce to 6.4%. The contributions
of kretek wage income and non-kretek wage income, on the other hand, increase to 42%
and 46% respectively. Thus, total wage income accounts for the bulk (88%) of household
total income. In order to reduce the heavy reliance of kretek households on the kretek
industry for their livelihoods, their household income composition needs to be diverted to
nonwage sources such as profitable nonfarm enterprises and nonlabor income, which in
turn calls for educating and training of kretek workers in new skills.

34 // The Livelihoods of Kretek Rollers
About 54% of kretek households reported taking a loan in the past year, and about
66% of kretek households reported having outstanding loans. The average amount of
loan taken by kretek households is Rp 11.3 million, and the average amount the households
owe including interest is Rp 14.7 million. On average, the amount of new loans is equivalent
to 31% of household total resource, while the outstanding loan in the past year is equivalent
to 41% of household total resource. More than a quarter of the loans are used to finance
consumption of daily needs. This suggests that kretek households face a liquidity constraint
or irregular income flow. Among the kretek workers who used loans for daily needs, 82% are
contract workers. Apparently, the presence of a contract in kretek industry employment does
not mitigate the liquidity constraint. Another major use of the loans is for financing purchase
of a vehicle (16%) and schooling (13%).

The most reported sources of loans are tobacco companies (16.2%), relatives (16.1%),
and micro-finance institutions (15%). Almost 93% of the loans taken from the tobacco
companies were interest bearing. The other two major sources of loans are commercial banks
and local money lenders. Most of the loans taken from relatives, neighbors, or fellow farmers
are interest free.

Households with a higher proportion of kretek income are more likely to have out-
standing loans and tend to have larger amounts of outstanding loans (Table 9). This
result can be explained by the fact that these households have lower wage income and are
more likely to be poor. Lastly, households with more dependents need credit to meet the
basic needs. However, female-headed households are not at a higher risk of having an out-
standing loan.

    POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF
    HIGHER TOBACCO TAXES
    ON KRETEK HOUSEHOLDS
    In the current agenda of improving the tobacco tax system as part of strengthen-
    ing tobacco control in Indonesia, increase in cigarette excise tax would have to be
    accompanied by simplification of the multitiered tax structure. Currently Indonesia
    has a 12-tiered specific excise tax system for hand-rolled kreteks, machine-made kreteks,
    and white cigarettes. The current system favors relatively cheap hand-rolled kreteks by
    offering lower tax rates. On the one hand, it offers affordable products to the young and
    potential smokers encouraging smoking initiation; on the other hand, it makes a cheaper
    option for current smokers to switch down to in the event of price increase. A desirable
    tax reform would gradually unify the tax rates and reduce the price gap between different
    types of cigarettes. However, with the current tiered tax structure benefiting hand-rolled
    kretek manufacturers, the required tax and price increases would not be uniform across all
    types. More specifically, the tax increase would be proportionately larger at the lower end
    for hand-made kreteks.
    In this section, we run simulations to measure the potential impacts of such
    reforms in the cigarette excise tax policy on the livelihood outcomes of handmade
    kretek rollers. This effect should be interpreted in isolation from the negative employ-
    ment effects on handmade kretek rollers’ employment that is already in place due to the
    rise in demand for machine-made kreteks relative to handmade kreteks. The growth in
    cigarette production over the past decade from 235.5 billion sticks in 2005 to 342 billion
    sticks in 2016 has been dominated by the upward trend in the demand for machine-
    made kreteks (World Bank, 2017a).

    The rise in machine-made kretek sales partly reflects shifting consumer preference
    from traditional hand-rolled kreteks to machine-made kreteks, spurred by high
    income growth of the Indonesian population. From 2005 through 2015, the annual
    per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth in Indonesia ranged from 3.3% to 5%.2
    Without matching increases in the real price of tobacco products, this income growth
    is expected to not only boost the demand for tobacco products, but also lead smokers
    to switch upward to more appealing and higher priced tobacco products. The declining
    trend in the demand for hand-rolled kreteks and loss of employment in this sector may

also be attributable in part to the mechanization of kretek production and the switching
of producers to more efficient technology. The effects of these factors have not been con-
sidered in the current simulation.

The policy scenario deemed for cigarette excise tax reform in the report,
The Economics of Tobacco Taxation and Employment in Indonesia (World Bank,
2017a), is summarized in Table 10. We considered two criteria for determining the
desired tax increases at varying rates for different categories of cigarettes: (i) the minimum
tax increase required to induce increase in cigarette price that would keep the affordabil-
ity of cigarettes from increasing, and (ii) the disproportionately larger tax increases for the
categories with lower tax rates that would help bridge the price gap between different
categories of cigarettes and reduce the number of tax tiers.

We estimate that the desired tax increase will reduce employment in the hand-

     calculated in The Economics of Tobacco Taxation and Employment in Indonesia (World
     Bank, 2017a). To estimate the effects of raising tobacco taxes on kretek households’ live-
     lihoods, we use the following procedure. First, we randomly select kretek workers in the
     survey sample so that 8.25% of them lose their job. Second, we calculate the effect of
     losing the kretek job on household total wage income, household total income, house-
     hold total resource, and poverty status. For kretek workers who lose their job, we calculate
     their households’ post-kretek wage income, total income, and total resource. Then, we
     calculate the percentage changes of these variables. We also identify whether the poverty
     status of their households changes after losing their jobs. Note that the results of the cal-
     culation depend on which worker is “randomly” chosen to be laid off. To address this con-
     cern, we draw the sub-sample of laid off workers and simulate 300 times. Table 11 reports
     the results of the simulations.

     Households whose members are laid off from the kretek industry would experi-
     ence a decrease in household resource by about 38% and in household income by
     about 41%. The decrease in wage income is estimated to be higher at 49%. However,
     households have other income sources such as farm and nonfarm resources. Thus, the
     estimated drops in household resources and income are still lower than the estimated
     drop of wage income. Nevertheless, some households would lose as much as 31–47% of
     household total resource or 27–52% of household total income. These are quite signif-
     icant as affected households would lose, on average, more than one-third of their total
     resource and income.

                                                                                                   39
The Economics of Kretek Rolling in Indonesia




Some of these affected households, particularly those without a significant sup-
port from nonwage income, would plunge into poverty. The higher tobacco taxes are
estimated to increase poverty among kretek households by about 1.8 to 2.58 percentage
points, depending on the definition of poverty. The negative tobacco tax impacts on house-
holds’ livelihoods call for government support for social safety nets for these households.

The total income loss from the reduction in employment in the handmade kretek
industry is, however, minimal compared to the revenue gain from the tax increase.
The simulation in The Economics of Tobacco Taxation and Employment in Indonesia (World
Bank, 2017a) paper based on the policy scenario in Table 10 estimates that the annual
revenue gain would be Rp 12,875 billion (Table 11 in The Economics of Tobacco Taxation
and Employment in Indonesia (World Bank, 2017a) and the employment loss in the hand-
made kretek industry would be 24,710 (Table 12 in The Economics of Tobacco Taxation
and Employment in Indonesia (World Bank, 2017a)). Given the mean annualized kretek
income at Rp 15,500,000 and the projected decrease in wage income by 48.93%, the loss
of 24,710 jobs in the kretek industry would imply total income loss amounting to Rp
182 billion, which is 1.4% of the revenue gain. This is a win-win policy change because
the tax and price increase will not only reduce tobacco use and related health costs, it will
generate additional revenue which can more than compensate for the income loss due
to a reduction in production and employment in the kretek industry.

    CONCLUDING REMARKS
    While pervasive use of tobacco and the growing number of smokers have been a
    long-standing public health issue in Indonesia, the relatively low prices and tax
    rates of hand-rolled kreteks pose an added challenge for policymakers in curb-
    ing the epidemic. Hand-rolled kreteks continue to be an affordable product for poor
    individuals. Since these individuals receive government subsidized health insurance, the
    government of Indonesia would see an increasing burden of health care costs of these
    individuals in the near future. Besides, young individuals are more likely to purchase
    cheap hand-rolled kreteks. This encourages smoking initiation which will further raise the
    already high smoking prevalence among youth. Under these circumstances, raising the
    tax of hand-rolled kreteks to push the price beyond the affordable range of the poor and
    youth population is a policy priority.

    The policymakers have, however, faced the dilemma that raising the tax and price
    of hand-rolled kreteks with the overarching goal of simplification of cigarette
    excise tax structure can reduce the demand for hand-rolled kreteks so much that it
    would imperil the livelihood of the kretek worker community. There are currently an
    estimated 307,793 workers employed in the hand-rolled kretek industry and 1.2 million
    household members dependent on them, who are potentially at risk of being adversely
    affected by the tax reform. The findings from the current study suggest that apprehension
    about the social costs associated with the potential job loss is largely overstated.

    The total income loss from the reduction in employment in the handmade kretek
    industry from the desired tax increase is minimal compared to the revenue gain
    from the tax increase. We estimate that in total around 24,710 kretek workers would lose
    their jobs as a result of the tax and price increase and the reduction in kretek consump-
    tion and production. The total income loss of kretek workers would be approximately Rp
    182 billion, which is merely 1.4% of the annual revenue gain of Rp 12,875 billion resulting
    from the tax increase. This is a win-win policy change because the tax and price increase
    will not only reduce tobacco use and related health costs, it will generate additional rev-
    enue which can more than compensate for the income loss due to reduction in produc-
    tion and employment in the kretek industry.

    These estimates represent the gross employment effect of lower cigarette con-
    sumption. When prices of cigarettes increase, consumers may shift their consumption
    to other goods and services which will create jobs in these sectors. Evidence has shown
    that the job losses in the tobacco sector (gross effect) are usually compensated with job

creation in the other sectors (the net effect). For Indonesia, Ahsan and Wiyono (2007)
estimated positive effects varying from 84,340 to 281, 135 jobs with tax increases of 25
percent and 100 percent, respectively (Ahsan and Wiyono, 2007).

We can draw two major policy recommendations—one for immediate action and
the other for longer term planning—based on the findings of this report.

      First, the most vulnerable groups in the affected population who would need
      immediate income support in the event of job loss include the workers who
      are less educated, older, heads of their households, and contribute a signif-
      icant proportion of total household income from kretek rolling. The social
      assistance programs to provide safety net and compensation for income loss can
      identify the target groups based on these characteristics of the kretek workers and
      can manage the compensation package with less than 2% of the revenue gain from
      the tax increase.

      Second, the remaining 98% additional revenue or part thereof can be allo-
      cated for re-skilling and redeployment of laid off kretek workers to smooth
      their transition to an alternative source of employment in the short to
      medium term. Nearly half of the kretek workers had different occupations and mar-
      ket skills prior to working in a kretek factory, which indicates their resilience to make
      a transition to a different job in the event of job loss in the kretek industry. Besides,
      kretek workers are predominantly female, who not only value the wage premium,
      benefits and long-term employment opportunity in the kretek industry over other
      comparable sectors, but also prefer proximity of workplace to home and the flexibil-
      ity of work hours in the kretek industry that offer them the opportunity to balance
      responsibilities between work and home-based nonmarket activities (including
      child rearing and household chores). It suggests that the female kretek workers can
      be incentivized to re-skill and move to home-based nonfarm enterprises that would
      have similar appeal to their preference for work-life balance.

In addition to government interventions, national and international nongovernmental
organizations can introduce targeted training and micro-credit programs to help the laid
off kretek workers acquire new skills and finances to invest in nonfarm self-employment
generating activities that they prefer to run from home.




44 // Concluding Remarks
The merit of this study lies in its focus on the kretek workers’ livelihood options
that led to the above-mentioned policy direction needed to tackle the unintended
employment consequences of the desired tax reform in Indonesia. The study is not
free from its limitation though. All the households included in the survey have at least
one kretek worker. This sample selection criterion limited our ability to assess the socio-
economic status and labor market outcomes of kretek households in comparison with
the rest of the population. However, we do make the observation that kretek households
are no more or less likely to be poor than those who are not dependent on the kretek
industry for their livelihood.

The vulnerability of kretek households to job loss can hardly be overemphasized.
It can even be discounted for the households which have multiple earners in different
occupations besides kretek rolling. Because these households have diversified income
sources, they have the capability to absorb transitory income shocks owing to the struc-
tural decline of one of those sources. In a broader macroeconomic framework, the reduc-
tion in demand for kreteks would be matched by increased demand for other goods and
services in the thriving sectors, which will eventually provide new and alternative sources
of employment for the displaced kretek workers in the long run. Moreover, for a growing
economy like in Indonesia, the growth in employment in new sectors can more than
offset the decrease in employment in the handmade kretek industry. The reform in ciga-
rettes excise tax policy can be reasonably viewed as a way forward for diverting resources
away from the goods that cost the health and welfare of the nation and toward the
goods that contribute to a healthier population and higher standard of living.

46 // Concluding Remarks
Appendix A: Methods of Data Collection
This study applied a mixed method to analyze the socioeconomic and labor market
characteristics of Indonesian kretek workers and their households. First, we surveyed
a sample of kretek workers in Kudus and Malang to understand their socioeconomic
characteristics, labor market outcomes, and alternative livelihood options than the kretek
industry. Second, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) among a subsample of
kretek workers in Kudus. In total, we performed two FGDs among 14 female kretek work-
ers. The FGDs aimed to complement the survey data by eliciting contextual information
not captured by the quantitative survey and by clarifying issues that weren’t sufficiently
explained by the survey.


Sampling and Survey
The survey of kretek workers was based on a multistage clustered sampling pro-
cedure with the target population of production workers employed in the kretek
industry. Central Java employs 42% of all kretek workers, followed by East Java (40%). We
selected the top employing district in each province: Kudus in Central Java, and Malang
in East Java. Out of the 92 districts listed in the 2014 Annual Survey of Manufacturing
where kretek factories were located, Kudus in Central Java was the number one employer
(14.75% of total employees in kretek), followed by Temanggung, also in Central Java
(10.45%). Kabupaten Malang in East Java was third on the list (8.57%), but if combined
with Kotamadya Malang (2.37%) , they employ more than Temanggung.Thus Kudus from
Central Java and Malang from East Java were selected as the two districts with the largest
kretek worker population for conducting the survey on kretek workers.

The 2014 Annual Survey of Manufacturing Industry and the 2014 Annual Survey
of Micro and Small Industry suggest that there are 57 kretek firms in Kudus (8%
of total kretek firms in Indonesia) and 46 kretek firms in Malang (6.5%). In Kudus,
47 kretek firms are categorized as large firms while the rest of the kretek firms are cate-
gorized as medium firms.3 In Malang, 22 kretek firms are categorized as large firms while
the rest are categorized as medium firms. Kretek workers in Kudus accounted for 40% of
total kretek workers in Indonesia, while kretek workers in Malang (including those in Kota-
madya Malang) accounted for 10.94% of total kretek workers.

The kretek factories located in these two districts were used as a proxy for clusters
(neighboring villages) where kretek workers are expected to reside. Thus, 20 fac-
tories in Kudus and 20 factories in Malang were selected as clusters. It can be seen from
Table A1 that all the kretek factories from Malang and all the kretek factories in Kudus
employing less than 500 workers were covered by the sample clusters. For the large

3
 Firms that employ 1–4 workers are categorized as micro firms, 5–19 workers as small firms, 20–99 workers as
medium firms, an more than 99 workers as large firms.

factories in Kudus employing over 500 workers, a sample of 8 clusters was selected out
of 37 factories in the district. To ensure targeted sample size per cluster, only factories
employing above 50 workers (medium and large factories) were listed for the selection
of clusters.

We first aimed at getting the sample size per cluster at 23 production workers. This
size is expected to provide more stable variances within clusters. With this sample size per
cluster, we had to exclude factories with workers fewer than 23 workers. In fact, we aimed
to exclude factories with workers fewer than 50 workers for several practical reasons. First,
it would be easier to get the sample of 23 workers out of 50 rather than the same size
of sample from a factory with 30 workers. This also minimizes the chance of replacing
factories or adding more workers in the field when a selected factory has production
workers fewer than 23.4 Second, from the survey perspective, it is always better to target a
sample from relatively large clusters. While the rule of “50” workers is arbitrary, this helped
us in reducing the number of clusters while information loss from smaller firms might be
minimal. Besides, the factories employing above 50 workers are presumed to have similar
technologies and can differ systematically in terms of production capacity from those
employing below 50 workers. However, in the survey we did pick 18 kretek workers who
reported that the factories where they worked employed less than 50 workers.

In each sample cluster (neighboring village of a factory), we obtained the list of all
sub-villages (dusun). The sub-villages were chosen randomly as the primary statistical
units (PSU) that usually had 90–120 households each. In each sub-village, we met the vil-
lage head to get a complete list of kretek workers in the area. Using this method, kretek
workers employed in small factories were covered in addition to those working in medium
and large factories.

    Although we get the number of workers for each factory from the agricultural census, the data may be measured with error.




48 // Concluding Remarks
In the next stage, we visited the listed households with kretek workers in sub-
village 1 to confirm that the households have at least one kretek worker and
inquired if they were aware of anyone else who were kretek workers. After the enu-
meration was complete in sub-village 1, we randomly selected the minimum number of
kretek workers (23) targeted for the sample from each cluster. If the available number of
kretek workers in sub-village 1 fell short of the targeted number from a cluster, we went
to sub-village 2 to repeat the same process.

The survey team approached 757 households in total and found 735 households
(97%) reporting at least one kretek worker in the household working full-time
or part-time in the kretek industry. It indicates the targeting of the sample was very
accurate. Out of the 735 eligible households, 720 households agreed to be interviewed,
showing a 98% response rate. The final sample contains 18–22 households from each
cluster. The respondents from each household, except one, were female and all of them
were kretek workers. Given the sampling method described above, the kretek households
covered in the sample are representative of the kretek population in the two kretek pro-
ducing districts, Kudus and Malang. We are unable to classify the factories into Class I, II or
III categories because kretek workers do not have information on the scale of production
of the factories where they were employed.

The survey was conducted during October–November 2016 by SurveyMeter. A
household level questionnaire was used in a face-to-face interview of kretek workers,
which lasted for about an hour. The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of
kretek rollers and their household members are summarized in Table A2.

Written or verbal consent was obtained from the respondents prior to the
interview. The confidentiality of data is maintained by separating the identifying infor-
mation of the respondent from the rest of the data file. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Morehouse School of Medicine, the IRB record for
the American Cancer Society and SurveyMeter.



Focus Group Discussion
The quantitative data collected through the sample survey was complemented by the
qualitative data collected through two Focus Group Discussions (FGD) conducted on two
groups of female kretek workers (7 in each group) in the district of Kudus in March 2017.
The average age of the participants was 44 years (minimum 27 and maximum 61 years) and
average tenure in the kretek industry was 21 years (minimum 3 and maximum 48 years),
longer tenure generally corresponding to older age. They did not have any formal occupa-
tion prior to working in the kretek factory. All of them were housewives taking care of chil-
dren and other household chores. Only five of them were engaged in embroidery.

Note:
1. There are about 10 or 12 sticks per pack of kretek cigarettes.
2. There are 10 packs of kretek cigarettes in a slop.
3. We trimmed the top 5% of reported kretek sticks rolled per day.
4. A worker works full-time if they reported working at least 2,000 hours in the past year.
5. The weight for full-time workers is 1. The weight for less than full-time workers is the ratio of total working
hours in the sector divided by 2,000 hours.

Appendix B: Calculation of Total Household Income and Resource
The data on wage income were collected for each household member by primary and
secondary jobs. Household wage income is the sum of each member’s annualized wage
income from both primary and secondary jobs. The components used in the calculation
of each member’s annualized wage income are the annual working hours and the re-
ported wage. We use a similar approach to calculate annualized household income from
kretek rolling.
Data on annual farm income, nonfarm income, and nonlabor income were collected at
the household level. We use these data to calculate total household income and house-
hold resource. There are two sources that determine the farm and nonfarm resource.
The first source is the revenue from the sale of products from farm and nonfarm activities.
The second source is the market value for the home-grown products used for household
consumption. The farm and non-farm resources were then added to household wage
and nonlabor income to obtain total household resource.

Total household income, on the other hand, is measured by the sum of household wage
income, nonlabor income, and gross margins from farm and nonfarm activities. We first
calculate total revenues and costs from farm and nonfarm activities to obtain the gross
margins. The total revenue is the market values of the sale or household consumption of
products from farm and nonfarm activities. The total costs include household expendi-
tures on hired labor, raw materials, and other operational costs. Total household income is
a better measure of household well-being. The variable reflects the amount of resources
available for household consumption after taking into account household production
costs incurred in farm and nonfarm activities.
