January 2017
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a
          longer-term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over
          the period, the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is
          intended for a wide audience, including policy makers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s
          evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for
          Indonesia. The report is compiled by the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global
          Practice team, under the guidance of Ndiame Diop, Practice Manager, and Hans Anand
          Beck, Acting Lead Economist, with inputs from Sudhir Shetty, EAP Chief economist. Led
          by Dhruv Sharma, with responsibility for Part A, and Kelly Wyett, with responsibility for
          editing and production, the core project team comprises Magda Adriani, Arsianti, Dwi

The return of global   Heightened global policy uncertainty, particularly concerning trade agreements and

risks to Indonesia’s   include: continued policy uncertainty and financial volatility, sluggish global trade
growth outlook         and subdued growth in advanced economies, and the ongoing deceleration of the
                       Chinese economy. 

However,               Indonesia has weathered recent global financial volatility well. The Rupiah
Indonesia’s recent     depreciated 3 percent in the immediate aftermath of the US election—a robust
economic               performance relative to other emerging markets. Inflation has remained close to the
performance and        bottom of BI’s target range of 3-5 percent on the back of slower growth in rice and
policy reforms can     fuel prices, allowing a spell of accommodative monetary policy. Low inflation also
help weather these     contributed to robust growth in private consumption spending in Q3. Fiscal policy
risks                  credibility has been enhanced through expenditure cuts to the 2016 Budget and
                       more achievable revenue targets in the revised 2016 and approved 2017 Budgets.
                       The 2017 Budget also features improvements in the composition of spending,
                       including sustained higher allocations for infrastructure, health and social assistance,
                       and improved targeting for energy subsidies and social programs. Finally, strong
                       FDI inflows in Q3 and ongoing reforms to the investment climate, reflected in an
                       improvement in Indonesia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey,
                       support the outlook for private investment.

                        line with the spending cuts announced in the July revised 2016 Budget and the
                        subsequent revision. Total fixed investment growth eased to 4.1 percent yoy in Q3.

The current account     The current account deficit narrowed to 1.8 percent of GDP in Q3, from
deficit narrowed and    2.2 percent in Q2, driven by an improvement in the trade balance. In quarter-on-
direct investment       quarter (qoq) and yoy terms, imports fell by more than exports. The decline in
was strong in Q3        exports values, despite increasing commodity prices in 2016, reflects a large fall in
                        export volumes. The financial account surplus expanded in Q3 from Q2, due to
                        strong net private sector inflows, particularly from direct investment. This increase,
                        combined with the improvement in the current account deficit, resulted in a
                        moderate balance of payments surplus in Q3. External government debt is
                        increasing, but the level remains modest at 17.4 percent of GDP, and the majority
                        (95 percent) of this debt is long-term (maturing in more than one year).

                        down 3.6 percent over Q4. BI’s monetary policy easing cycle halted in Q4.

Fiscal policy           While Tax Amnesty revenue contributed to a lower budget deficit in 2016, non-tax

enhanced through        non-tax natural resource revenues were all lower in nominal terms compared to
expenditure cuts in     2015. Overall, the fiscal deficit was 2.46 percent of GDP in 2016 according to
2016 and more           preliminary realization data, lower than the Ministry of Finance’s revised outlook

approved 2017           lower deficit. However, spending cuts appear to have had perverse impacts on the
Budget                  composition of spending: capital expenditure declined while material spending
                        increased in the second half of 2016. The 2017 Budget features more achievable
                        revenue targets, compared to the previous two years. Nevertheless, further tax
                        administration and policy reforms are required to meet these targets.

                        marginally in 2017 as inflation remains low and consumer confidence continues to

                       spending is low and where additional spending can have the greatest impact on
                       poverty and growth. For Indonesia, these sectors include infrastructure, health, and
                       social assistance. Second, it entails maximizing the impact of spending on desired
                       outcomes for targeted beneficiaries. This entails reallocating spending within
                       sectors, particularly in education and agriculture, to programs that have the highest
                       impacts on sectoral goals, as well as effective sectoral policies that support the
                       impact of increased spending. The 2017 Budget takes some steps towards
                       improving the quality of public spending, but further reform is required. 

Student-centered       Education spending is one area where the effectiveness of spending can be
teaching practices     improved. Indonesia is striving to improve the quality of education and to assist
result in better       students to develop higher-order thinking skills. The utilization of a student-
student learning       centered learning approach is considered to be at the core of this change. This
outcomes               involves less teacher-centered lecturing and more interactive learning, drawing upon
                       investigative and practical teaching practices with a connection to real world
                       contexts. Student-centered learning approaches were incorporated into Indonesia’s
                       education policy more than thirty years ago. However, a recent video study of
                       teacher behavior found that the adoption of student-centered learning practices by
                       teachers has been slow. The study linked its examination of teacher practices to test
                       results and found that teachers who use student-centered practices achieve better
                       student learning outcomes than those who use teacher-centered practices. The study
                       also found that teaching practices are influenced by teacher beliefs and knowledge,
                       and this relationship impacts teacher effectiveness. That is, it is not enough for
                       teachers to just start using student-centered practices, they must also develop the
                       beliefs and knowledge to enable them to implement these practices.

uncertainty and       increased international financial market volatility returned in early Q4. This
increased financial   volatility, coupled with sluggish global trade and subdued growth in advanced

                       market currencies, which fell by 3.8 percent on average.

Key commodity          Prices for Indonesia’s key export commodities improved in Q4 especially for coal,
prices showed          palm oil, base metals, and natural gas. Palm oil prices are expected to be supported
tentative signs of a   by an uptick in demand from China and India and supply pressures due to adverse
recovery               La Nina weather effects. On the oil and gas front, the latest production figures for
                       Q3 showed a marginal decline in global oil production (down 0.7 percent qoq) and
                       prices (down 0.4 percent qoq). Following the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
                       Countries (OPEC) decision to curb its combined production by 1.2 million barrels
                       per day (bpd) in 2017, the Indonesian government has temporarily withdrawn its
                       membership from the oil cartel. OPEC’s decision required Indonesia to cut its
                       production up to 37,000 bpd, or 4.5 percent of the 815,000 target in the 2017
                       Budget, which was already 5000 bpd lower than the target in the revised 2016
                       Budget.

                       These global developments represent risks to Indonesia’s growth outlook. However,
                       as the following sections outline, Indonesia’s recent economic performance leaves it
                       well placed to mitigate any significant adverse impacts.

                       consumption stemmed from spending cuts announced in the revised 2016 Budget
                       and in the subsequent revision. These cuts better aligned spending with more
                       moderate revenue collection targets and led to a welcome reduction in fiscal risk. In
                       contrast, private consumption growth remained robust, supported by low inflation
                       that remains close to the bottom of Bank Indonesia’s (BI) target range and a
                       relatively stable Rupiah. However, growth in private consumption did not outweigh
                       the contraction in government consumption. As such, total consumption growth
                       fell to 4.0 percent yoy – the slowest rate of growth for at least six years.

                         relatively low share of public investment implies that any pickup in investment
                         growth will most likely have to be predominantly driven by private investment.

                         measured by BI’s business activity survey) fell in October following two quarterly

                         recorded a contractionary reading (indicated by a reading below 50) throughout Q4.

World Bank baseline      Looking ahead, despite the slight moderation of economic growth in Q3, the World
growth projections       Bank’s baseline projections for real GDP growth remain 5.1 percent for 2016 and
remain unchanged at      5.3 percent in 2017 (Table 3). Stronger growth in 2017 will be lifted by more robust
5.1 percent for 2016     private investment following monetary easing in 2016 and ongoing investment
and 5.3 percent in       climate reforms. Early reform progress has been reflected in an improvement in
2017…                    Indonesia’s ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey (Box 1). Supported
                         by local election elections in early 2017, private consumption is expected to remain
                         robust in Q4 and is also expected to pick up marginally in 2017.

…but risks remain        The risks to the growth outlook remain firmly on the downside, especially given that
firmly on the            several of the risks identified in the October 2016 IEQ are materializing. These
downside                 include increased financial market volatility in the aftermath of the US presidential
                         elections and the increased likelihood of faster than initially expected interest rate
                         normalization in the US. World Bank estimates for emerging and developing
                         economies suggest that that a 10 percent increase in the VIX index reduces GDP

                            outlook in 2017. On the domestic front, weak fiscal revenue collection remains a
                            significant downside risk.

Box 1: Investment climate reforms have improved Indonesia’s Ease of Doing Business
Through a series of policy packages, the Government of Indonesia has set out a number of reforms designed to make it
easier for businesses to operate. These reforms have borne results. The 2017 Doing Business Report3 noted seven positive
reforms for Indonesia in the areas of: starting a business, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, paying
taxes, trading across borders, and enforcing contracts (Table 2). These reforms improved Indonesia’s Doing Business
ranking from 106 in 2016 to 91 in 2017, making Indonesia one of the top reformers both regionally and globally.

The Government envisages that Indonesia will continue to move up in the Doing Business ranking. However, meeting
the Government’s target ranking of 304 by 2019 will be quite challenging. The Government now needs to move beyond
“quick win” reforms and implement medium-term structural reforms5 to further improve Indonesia’s business
environment. To this end, it is important that the Government continues with its plan for coordinating and monitoring
the reform process.

The Doing Business Report only examined businesses in Jakarta and Surabaya. However, President Widodo is keen to
ensure that business reforms are implemented across Indonesia. This is especially important in a country as
decentralized as Indonesia, where effective and harmonious policy design and implementation at the sub-national level
are crucial for creating an investment climate conducive to starting and running a business.

Table 2: Reforms recognized by the Doing Business 2017 report
 Starting a      Indonesia made starting a business easier by:
 Business            Abolishing the minimum requirement for paid-in capital to establish small- and medium-size limited
                      liability companies
                     Encouraging the use of an online system for name reservation
                     Creating a single form to both obtain company registration certificates (Tanda Daftar Perusahaan) and
                      trading licenses (Surat Izin Usaha Perdagangan) (Jakarta only)

                 Overall, the steps and time required to start a business (average of Jakarta and Surabaya) fell by 1 procedure
                 (from 13 to 11.2 procedures) and 23 days (from 47.8 to 24.9 days), respectively. Since the first Doing
                 Business Report for Indonesia in 2004, the average time to start a business has fallen by 85 percent—from
                 168 days to 24.9 days.
 Getting         Getting electricity was made easier by:
 Electricity
                      Reducing the time for contractors to perform external work (thanks to an increase in the stock of
                       electrical material supplied by the utility)
                      Streamlining the process for a new connection request

                            3 The Doing Business Report is an annual publication of the World Bank Group. It studies business

                              regulations from the perspective of small to medium sized domestic firms and compares these
                              regulatory practices across 190 economies around the world. Regulations affecting 10 stages of the life
                              of a business are measured. For further information, visit www.doingbusiness.org.

                              Plan for 2017.
                            5 For example, in the area of resolving insolvency, existing provisions in Indonesia’s Bankruptcy Law

                              do not provide the court with the tools to examine a bankruptcy petition on its merits. Ideally, the
                              Law should encourage debtors to take advantage of the insolvency system, while also ensuring that
                              only those companies that really require relief are protected. The Law could be amended to better
                              enable the rescue of viable businesses that might be experiencing short-term financial distress without
                              resorting to bankruptcy proceedings. This would allow the businesses to continue to function, which
                              increases creditor recovery over the long-term.

 Credit        average Strength of Legal Rights Index improved by 1 point (from 5 to 6 out of a potential best score of 12).
 Paying        Indonesia made paying taxes easier by introducing an online system for filing tax returns and paying mandatory
 Taxes         health contributions (Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial, BPJS Kesehatan). Overall, the average number of
               payments and time for paying taxes fell by 11 payments (from 54 to 43 payments) and 13 days (from 234 to
               221 days), respectively.
 Trading       Indonesia made exporting and importing easier by improving the customs services and document submission
 Across        functions of the Indonesia National Single Window6. Overall, the average time and cost for documentary
 Borders       compliance for export decreased by 10.7 hours (from 72 to 61.3 hours) and USD 31.2 (from USD 170 to USD

 Enforcing     Indonesia made enforcing contracts easier by introducing a dedicated procedure for small claims for commercial
 Contracts     litigation that allows parties to represent themselves. Overall, the average Quality of Judicial Processes Index
               improved by 1.5 points (from 6.3 to 7.8, out of a potential best score of 18).

increased                     imports fell by 0.2 and 7.8 percent yoy, respectively. The fall in total exports was
                              driven by merchandise exports, notably commodity exports (despite the increase in
                              commodity prices in Q3) (Figure 6).

Net private capital           Direct investment in Indonesia increased in Q3 to USD 4.4 billion. The increase
inflows drove an              was driven by investment in the tertiary sector, particularly in the finance, and
increase in the               transportation and communications sectors. Indonesians also withdrew some direct
financial account             investments abroad for the first time since 2012. As a result, net direct investment
                              made a strong contribution to the financial account. Portfolio inflows were robust
                              at USD 6.5 billion in Q3, but government borrowing was limited following
                              frontloaded borrowing in the first half of the year. Foreign investors withdrew
                              capital from private sector debt assets but made large investments in Indonesian
                              equities, reflected in strong gains in the stock market in Q3. USD 3.5 billion in
                              government global bond issuance in December8 (pre-financing for the 2017 Budget)
                              will provide some support to portfolio investment in Q4 (Figure 8). Turning to
                              other investment, inflows into resident currency and deposit assets were strong
                              (despite typically being negative in Q3), potentially due to the repatriation of foreign
                              assets from the tax amnesty. Overall, net private (as opposed to public) capital
                              inflows dominated the capital account for the first time since 2014 (Figure 7).




                              7 This result contrasts with the larger fall in export volumes recorded in the national accounts (see
                                section A.2) because exports values were supported by increasing commodity prices in 2016.

                    case for government external debt. Total short-term debt as a proportion of foreign
                    exchange reserves has been relatively stable at 50 percent. There are some risks to
                    the outlook for external debt due to instability in global financial markets and the
                    potential for interest rates to rise and the exchange rate to depreciate further9. Both
                    would put some pressure on debt repayments, particularly in Q1 2017 (as interest
                    payments on external debt are typically highest in Q1).

                            losses seen throughout 2015, and on November 7 mining equities reached levels last

                            reasons behind the decision to hold rates constant.

for 2016                    October from 3.1 percent in September. The decline in credit growth also coincided
                            with a slowdown in deposit growth. Deposit growth was only 4 percent yoy in
                            October (the slowest pace of growth in 14 years) before rebounding sharply in
                            November to 7 percent. The sharp decline in deposit growth occurred despite the
                            stickiness of deposit rates, which have only declined marginally.

                          mitigate risks to the revenue outlook

fiscal policy has                  of 2.46 percent of GDP for 2016, lower than the MoF revised outlook and World
improved, while risks              Bank projections of 2.7 and 2.8 percent of GDP, respectively. Revenue

remain                             expenditure cuts announced in July 2016 contributed to the lower deficit. The 2017
                                   Budget, which was approved on October 28, features more achievable revenue
                                   targets (compared with the previous two years) (Figure 13) and improvements in the
                                   composition of spending, including sustained higher allocations for infrastructure,
                                   health and social assistance, and improved targeting for energy subsidies and social
                                   programs (see Part B for further discussion of the 2017 Budget). However, risks to
                                   the 2017 outlook remain. Revenue collection from the Tax Amnesty program
                                   helped ease pressures in 2016, but non-Tax Amnesty revenues in 2016 weakened.
                                   Revenue collection from VAT, excises, and natural resources non-tax revenues were
                                   lower than in 2015. The medium-term base expansion impacts of the one-off tax
                                   amnesty will depend on the capture and use of new data on participants in the

                                 spending on material expenses grew by 11 percent in 2016. On the other hand,

                                 increase in the first half of 2016 relative to the first half of 2015. This slowdown in
                                 the second half of 2016 was partly due to a base effect from particularly high capital
                                 expenditure in the second half of 2015, and partly because several 2016 multi-year
                                 capital projects were deferred to 2017.

Looking to 2017,          The Government’s 2017 Budget is more realistic (compared to the 2016 Budget)
risks to the revenue      and the fiscal deficit is forecast to be 2.4 percent of GDP (Table 5). The revenue
outlook remain            target is IDR 1,750 trillion, 2.0 percent lower than the revised 2016 Budget target,
despite a more            but 12.8 percent higher than preliminary realized revenue outturns for 2016. The
realistic revenue         projected nominal increase in revenues is mainly driven by projected increases in
target in the Budget      VAT, non-oil and gas income tax, and oil and gas revenues. The 2017 Budget
                          assumes that tax proceeds from the third phase of the tax amnesty program will be
                          minimal (IDR 5 trillion). The Government has increased the excise tax on cigarettes
                          by 10.5 percent in 2017 and expects that this will increase excise tax revenue.12

The World Bank            In line with the macroeconomic outlook for 2017 and ongoing tax policy and
projects a fiscal         administration reforms, the World Bank projects total revenues to reach IDR 1,680
deficit of 2.6 percent    trillion in 2017, 8.2 percent higher than preliminary realized revenue outturns for
of GDP in 2017            2016. This is slightly lower than the Government estimate, and depends on
                          maintaining revenue reform momentum. In 2017, the World Bank projects a fiscal
                          deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP. This is a higher than the Government’s 2016
                          preliminary realization of 2.5 percent of GDP and the 2017 Budget target of 2.4
                          percent of GDP, reflecting the lower revenue assumption and the need for higher
                          infrastructure spending to support growth.

Indonesia’s gross         Gross securities issuance needs for 2016 were increased in the third quarter in line
financing needs were      with upward revisions to the fiscal deficit from 2.4 to 2.7 percent of GDP. This
met for 2016, and are     target was met in December. As of December 6, the Government issued IDR 641
stable for 2017           trillion in bonds, representing 107 percent of its revised 2016 Budget target of IDR
                          599 trillion, and 5.2 percent of GDP. In 2017, gross financing needs are projected at
                          around 4.8 percent of GDP. The Government pre-financed some of this need by
                          issuing global bonds in December 2016.
                 7. Risks to the macro-fiscal outlook stem mainly from external factors
Global policy             Risks to Indonesia’s outlook stem from heightened global policy uncertainty,
uncertainty presents      financial market disruptions and sluggish growth in major economies – particularly
increased downside        the ongoing deceleration of the Chinese economy (World Bank estimates13 suggest
risks                     that a one percentage point decline in China’s GDP growth rate could reduce GDP
                          growth in Indonesia by 0.4 percentage points after two years). An accelerated pace
                          of interest rate normalization in the US also poses a risk to capital flows and the
                          stability of the Rupiah. However, signs of a recovery in key commodity prices
                          presents an upside risk if not outweighed by expected anemic global growth that
                          could reduce demand for exports.

Domestic downside         BI’s monetary policy easing cycle may have come to an end following 150 basis
risks related to fiscal   points worth of cuts in 2016. Given US interest rate normalization and downward
policy remain             pressure on the Rupiah, it is likely that monetary policy space is more constrained
                          than at the time of the October IEQ. However monetary policy continues to remain
                          supportive of the overall growth momentum. While the 2016 budget revisions
                          enhanced fiscal policy credibility, risks remain from weak revenue collection. The
                          focus in 2017 will remain on the quality of spending and downside risks to revenue
                          collection. There may also be some payback in the form of an improved investment
                          climate from the Government’s commitment to promoting private investment (due

                Improving the quality of public spending in Indonesia14
Public spending can      Public spending (and broader government policy) can contribute to a country’s
contribute to a          development goals—like higher growth and lower poverty—through three main
country’s                channels. First, governments use public resources to invest in infrastructure and
development goals        expand the stock of physical capital. Second, governments spend on health,
by generating            education, and social assistance to improve the productivity of human capital. Third,
physical and human       governments provide a conducive environment for the private sector to grow,
capital, and fostering   innovate and improve their productivity, for example, by investing in research and
productivity             development (R&D) or providing incentives for firms to invest in productivity
                         enhancements.

Achieving                However, in Indonesia, the impact of government spending on development has
Indonesia’s              been less than what it could have been. Partly as a result of this, progress in
ambitious                achieving growth and poverty targets has been slower than expected, and the quality
development goals        of many public services has not improved. At the same time, low levels of revenue
will require             collection mean that significantly increasing the level of public expenditure is not
significant              possible as the fiscal deficit is legally capped at 3 percent of GDP. Thus, improving
improvements in the      the quality of public spending is the main budget mechanism through which the
quality of public        Government can seek to achieve its development goals in the short to medium-
expenditure              term. Improving the “quality of spending” refers to two separate actions. First, it
                         entails improving allocative efficiency—reallocating spending towards priority
                         sectors. For Indonesia, underfunded priority sectors (those where additional public

                         infrastructure, health, and social assistance. Second, it entails improving the
                         efficiency and effectiveness of spending—maximizing the impact of spending on
                         desired outcomes for targeted beneficiaries. For Indonesia, this entails reallocating
                         spending within sectors to programs that have the highest impacts sectoral goals
                         (such as farmer welfare or learning outcomes), and effective sectoral policies that
                         support the impact of increased and reallocated spending. The 2017 Budget takes
                         additional steps towards improving the quality of public spending, following
                         improvements in the 2015 and 2016 Budgets, but further reform is required.
                      a. Fiscal policy has contributed less than it could have done to growth and
                         poverty reduction in Indonesia

In the past, fiscal      Indonesian taxes and government spending reduced poverty by 1.4 percentage
policy (including        points and inequality (as measured by the Gini coefficient) by 2.6 points in 2012.15
government               These are relatively small reductions by international standards,16 partly due to: (1)
spending) has not        low personal income tax collection, with poor compliance amongst high income
had a large impact       earners; (2) low social assistance spending; (3) low health spending, with relatively
on poverty and           little spending on primary care, which mostly benefits poorer households; (4) a
inequality               relatively low impact of education spending on inequality compared to other
                         countries;17 and (5) high spending on energy subsidies, which predominantly benefit
                         richer households. Items 1-4 are unlikely to have changed significantly since 2012.
                         However, recent fuel subsidy reform, most significantly in 2015, is likely to have
                         improved the impact of fiscal policy on poverty and inequality. In 2013 and 2014,
                         fuel price increases were accompanied by a temporary cash transfer to the poorest
                         25 percent of households. These transfers were significantly higher than the
                         increases in the cost of living associated with higher fuel prices. Given the
                         temporary nature of the transfers, their effects would also have been temporary.
                         However, the 2015 elimination of gasoline subsidies and the near-elimination of
                         diesel subsidies is likely to have a longer-term positive effect, as the permanent
                         savings to the Government were partially directed to higher health and social
                         assistance spending.

can be improved          harder to improve. For example, total education spending tripled over 2001-201418
                         in real terms. This increased spending was associated with improved access to
                         education and increasing secondary enrollment (the primary enrollment rate, already
                         over 90 percent in 2001, has not increased further). However, education quality
                         remains a challenge; Indonesian students continue to lag behind regional peers in
                         international learning assessments.19 Similarly, health spending quadrupled over the
                         same time period, ensuring that more people had access to a public health facility.
                         Yet key health outcomes, like maternal mortality and stunting, have barely changed.
                         Further, only two thirds of children under two have been immunized.20

and outcomes             Reduction (Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan, TNP2K) and
                         undertaken by the Central Statistics Agency (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS), found large
                         differences in villages’ ability to provide basic health, education, and transportation
                         services.21 More recent Susenas data paints a similar picture. For example: (i) access
                         to clean water is 100 percent in some regions, but only 4 percent in Mamberamo in
                         Papua; (ii) child immunization rates are 100 percent in some regions, but only 18

                         18 2014 is the latest year for which disaggregated subnational spending data is available.
                         19 While Indonesia’s test scores have improved recently, Indonesia still ranked 63rd, 64th and 65th (out
                           of 71 countries) in the latest (2015) PISA science, math and reading tests, respectively.
                         20 There have also been challenges in terms of readiness to provide key health services. According to

                           the latest public health facility census (2011), no public primary health facility met all 38 indicators for
                           general service readiness. Inequalities in the distribution of health workers between geographical
                           regions and provinces, and between urban and rural areas, are stark. For example, the physician-to-
                           population ratio in Kalimantan and Maluku-NTT-Papua are one-half and one-third of that in the
                           Java-Bali region, respectively. See: World Bank, 2016, “Health Financing System Assessment: Spend

                          variance in development outcomes like stunting rates, which range from 26 percent
                          in the Riau Islands to 52 percent in Nusa Tenggara Timur.23 Complicating the issue,
                          district level data show that higher per capita spending on education and health does
                          not necessarily lead to a larger improvement in service quality and development
                          outcomes.24
                       b. Public spending reform is critical to meeting Indonesia’s development goals

Improving the             In Indonesia, the Government is constrained in its ability to use public spending to
quality of public         support development. Even before the recent sharp declines in commodity prices,
spending is critical      Indonesia had one of the lowest revenue-to-GDP (14.7 percent in 2014) and tax-to-
for Indonesia to          GDP (10.9 percent) ratios, as well as one of the biggest gaps between actual and
achieve its               potential revenue (Indonesia is estimated to collect less than 50 percent of its
development goals in      potential tax revenues), among its regional and emerging market peers.25 The
the short to medium       Government is implementing a range of revenue reforms, such as: electronic VAT
term                      invoicing and return filing, income tax e-filing, unique taxpayer ID, and reducing tax
                          exemptions for VAT and the luxury goods tax. Continuing with and expanding
                          upon these revenue reform is essential to generate resources to support
                          development. However, revenue reforms will likely take a number of years to have
                          an impact, and even then they may not create sufficient fiscal space to meet public
                          spending priorities. This revenue constraint, combined with the fiscal deficit cap of
                          3 percent of GDP, mean that significantly increasing the overall level of public
                          expenditure is not possible, at least in the medium-term. As such, the Government
                          must improve the quality of its public expenditure if it is to achieve its development
                          goals.

                          and waste) before additional funding is allocated.

                        percent of GDP in 1999 to 38 percent in 2012, and the infrastructure deficit is
                        significant in every infrastructure sub-sector. For example, road length grew by only
                        35 percent in the last decade, while vehicle growth was 300 percent. This is despite
                        substantial evidence linking infrastructure investment to long-term growth.29
                        Priority spending areas within the infrastructure sector include: electricity
                        generation, urban and marine transport, water and sanitation, and affordable
                        housing.

                        programs that are most effective at reducing poverty and inequality. Among the
                        major social assistance programs, a targeted conditional cash transfer (Program
                        Keluarga Harapan, PKH) is the most effective at reducing inequality,32 while Rastra (a
                        price subsidy for rice) is the least effective. Yet Rastra’s budget (more than 0.2
                        percent of GDP) is much larger than that of PKH.33 The effectiveness of Rastra is
                        constrained by the dilution of benefits at the village level and the lack of clarity on
                        who is responsible for delivery costs between distributors and villages.34 In contrast,
                        77 percent of PKH’s beneficiaries are among the poorest 40 percent of households
                        in Indonesia. Improving coordination and the integration of social assistance
                        programs can also help improve the effectiveness of government spending.

subsidies…                  would free up fiscal space. Such reforms are already part of the Government’s
                            agenda. The 2017 Budget progresses this agenda somewhat, but much more remains
                            to be done (see section c below). Subsidy reform needs to be combined with
                            transitory cash transfers to cushion the impact of any fuel price rises on poor
                            households, as well as scale-up of permanent transfer programs like PKH in the

                            wages.35 However, it is unclear whether this is linked to any gains in productivity.
                            Removing the perverse incentive in the DAU (Dana Alokasi Umum) formula that
                            encourages sub-national governments to spend on personnel would create fiscal
                            space for sub-national governments.36 Similarly, maintaining central government

                            provide additional fiscal space.

                            Central government material expenditure has also risen rapidly (18 percent annually
                            in level terms) from 1.4 to 2.1 percent of GDP from 2010 to 2016. Notably,
                            spending on material expenditure exceeded capital spending in recent years.

                        This is partly because a        Source: World Bank COFIS database using MoF data
                        large proportion of the increase in central government spending has gone to
                        subsidize inputs (fertilizer subsidies, other agricultural subsidies, and MoA social
                        aid37).38 This proportion reached 47 percent in 2015, while only 3 percent was spent
                        on R&D and extension services.

                        A large body of research shows that government subsidies of private inputs have
                        limited impacts on agricultural production and farmer incomes. Although usage of
                        some inputs (for example fertilizer) may increase production, the impact of
                        subsidizing such inputs is often negative because it is done at the expense of
                        providing public goods (such as extension services, R&D, and irrigation) which
                        have a larger positive impact on production. For example, one international study
                        found that a reallocation of 10 percent of agricultural spending from subsidies to
                        public goods was associated with an increase in per capita agricultural income of 2.3
                        percent.39 Another study found average returns for investments in agricultural R&D
                        of 43 percent and almost 60 percent for extension services across 700 projects in
                        both developed and developing countries.40




                        37 Around 40 percent of MoA budget goes to Social Aid - direct transfers to farmers and farmer groups
                          which subsidize private inputs. For example, the Agriculture Integrated Field Laboratory program
                          (SL-PPT), initiated in 2013, and has been expanded to reach almost all regions to support the 10-
                          million-ton rice surplus goal – farmers receive full support for seeds, fertilizer, and equipment, etc.

…and education   Government spending on education has risen rapidly in recent years, rising from 11
                 to 19 per cent of total government spending over 2001-2014.41 Over this period
                 learning outcomes—as measured by Program for International Student Assessment
                 (PISA) scores— have fluctuated but risen somewhat overall (Figure 21). The
                 increase in education spending went mainly to hiring teachers, teacher certification,
                 and converting contract teachers to civil servants. As a result, teacher salaries and
                 allowances increased to more than 60 percent of total education spending by 2015
                 (Figure 22). Although this is not a particularly high share by international standards,
                 the increased spending on teachers has not been spent effectively. To begin, the
                 increase in teachers lowered student to teacher ratios (STRs) such that Indonesia’s
                 now has one of the lowest average STRs in the world.42 However, domestic and
                 international studies have found little to no effect of STRs on learning outcomes,
                 unless classes are considerably large.43 Further, the 2005 Teacher Law allowed
                 certified teachers to receive a certification allowance equal to their base salary. Yet a
                 rigorous study of the program found that it had no impact on learning outcomes.44
                 Clearly, reforms are required to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
                 spending on teachers. Such reforms include: improving teacher deployment and
                 allocation, performance evaluation, and training facilitation. These reforms could
                 improve the efficiency of public spending by better allocating funds to priority
                 education services with high returns, particularly early childhood development.




                 41 For central government spending only, the constitutional mandate that 20 percent of the budget
                   goes to education has been met.
                 42 In part, the low STRs in Indonesia can be explained by the large number of small schools due to the

                 low population density of many of its islands. However, school size is not the only explanation, as low
                 STRs is not only a small school phenomenon.

                           differences do not
                           overcome the inbuilt bias in favor of regions with small populations. The DBH
                           revenue sharing formula allocates a greater share of revenue to natural-resource
                           producing regions over non-producing regions, but does not account for population
                           in either type of region. For the DAK formula, the measurement of fiscal capacity is
                           absolute, not per capita; regions that raise the largest absolute amounts of revenue
                           are considered richer (and less in need of DAK).

                           These policies were crafted specifically to address long-standing concerns about
                           allocating too high a proportion of fiscal resources to populous Java. Yet the
                           consequence is that the distribution of fiscal resources is skewed in favor of small
                           rural districts, at the expense of Indonesia’s growing urban areas, which are
                           responsible for much of the country’s GDP growth. Emerging secondary cities

                        need financing for urban infrastructure to maximize their productive capacity and
                        deliver services to their growing populations (Figure 23). Most other countries
                        normalize measures of expenditure needs, and fiscal capacity, as per capita
                        amounts. In the DAU formula, this would then be adjusted by measures of
                        differences in need (driven by, for example, more poor people, more children under
                        5 and more elderly people or a high unemployment rate) and differences in the cost
                        of inputs (driven mainly by diseconomies of scale in small jurisdictions, remoteness,
                        and highly dispersed populations). Changing to a new formula is a medium-term
                        objective; it should be phased in gradually. There may also be a need to provide top
                        up allocations to allow losing regions to make the gradual adjustments required to
                        accommodate the new formula.

Improving horizontal    Public spending in many sectors involves multiple line ministries and multiple levels
and vertical inter-     of government (central, provincial, and district). This makes coordination difficult,
governmental            which often leads to inefficient spending. For example, responsibility for the

reform                  Such an approach requires teachers to use more non-traditional instruction methods

                        The push towards student-centered learning was strengthened recently by a
                        significant reform program to improve the quality of teachers through the
                        promulgation of the Teacher Law (2005). A major requirement under this law is for
                        all teachers to have a four-year degree and to undergo a process of certification, as a
                        minimum standard.52 Although the law was well-intentioned, a recent randomized
                        controlled trial evaluation of the certification program found no evidence of a

 Box 2: Personnel politics: elections and teacher hiring in Indonesia
 Beginning with decentralization reforms in 2001, the Indonesian government invested enormous fiscal and
 bureaucratic resources to improve its education sector. In 2002 the constitution was amended to commit the
 Government to spending at least 20 percent of its fiscal resources on education. As this amendment was implemented,
 the management and allocation of a large influx of fiscal resources led to a dramatic increase in the number of teachers,
 creating one of the lowest student-teacher ratios in the developing world.i A 2005 reform law also modernized the
 teaching profession by increasing professional standards, salaries, and school oversight. Despite these efforts,
 Indonesia has had limited success in improving student learning outcomes. While Indonesia’s test scores have
 improved recently, Indonesia still ranked in the lowest quintile of 71 developed and developing countries in the latest
 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) science, math, and reading tests. Further, cheating in national
 exams is rampant and teacher absenteeism is common.ii Why is the increase in public spending on education not
 translating into substantive improvements in the quality of education?

 To help to answer this question, an analysis was conducted to examine how local electoral accountability, that is, the
 introduction of pilkada in 2005, has affected the hiring of PNS (civil servant) and contract teachers, the certification of
 PNS teachers, and student learning outcomes.iii Beginning in 2005, pilkada was phased-in across Indonesia’s sub-
 national governments following an idiosyncratic schedule. This allows for a comparison of outcomes in districts with
 local elections to districts that had yet to experience elections. Leveraging this natural experiment, the study analyzed
 detailed teacher censuses and student test scores in math, science, Indonesian, and English for over 80,000 students in
 20 districts.

 First, the analysis assessed whether pilkada impacts the hiring of contract and civil service teachers. Findings show that
 the introduction of pilkada increased the total number of contract teachers by 1,200 per district on average. More
 specifically, evidence points to a marked increase in the number of contract teachers on the payroll in the year in which
 a district is undergoing pilkada. Further, on average, there were 800 more contract teachers per district on the payroll in
 election years than in nonelection years. Some of this short-term hiring of contract teachers ends after the election. By
 comparison, there was no similar effect for civil service teachers, likely due to the constraints on hiring civil servants.
 That is, districts can hire teachers as permanent civil servants, but this requires teachers to fulfill certain minimum
 standards and pass a civil service exam. Further, district hiring of civil servants is constrained by central government
 quotas for civil service jobs. In contrast, hiring contract teachers is more flexible, and local district heads can also re-
 assign contrast teachers to different schools, independently of educational needs.iv

 Second, the study examined whether pilkada affects the certification of civil service teachers. Civil service teachers who
 have earned a four-year degree and submitted a teaching portfolio (or have taken part in a special training course) can
 become certified, which entitles them to a special professional allowance, dramatically increasing their salary. District
 governments are in charge of the certification process including evaluating the teaching portfolios and administering

 the training course. Findings suggest that in the run-up to an election, the certification rates of civil servant teachers
 rise. In election years, the probability that a teacher will receive certification increases by 3 percentage points.

 Third, the study assessed whether pilkada impacts student learning outcomes. Out of the 36 districts for which there
 were student learning data, pilkada had a negative effect on student learning in ten districts, a positive effect in five
 districts, and no effect in the remaining districts. This suggests that elections can, at least for some districts, disrupt the
 standard operation of schools and negatively affect student learning.

 Taking these finding together, the study helps explain why the Government's increased spending on education is not
 translating into improvements in student learning outcomes.

Classrooms in the            Lesson structure: The proportion of time spent on mathematical activities in
comparator countries         Indonesian classrooms was on average 89 percent in 2007, declining to 86 percent
spend 95 to 98               in 2011 (Figure 24). By comparison, the average proportion of time spent on
percent of the time          mathematical activities amongst comparator countries ranged from 95 percent to 98
on mathematical              percent. Lesson content: the most common use of mathematics teaching time in
activities compared          Indonesia was to introduce new content (Figure 25). On average, in 2011, 59
to 86 percent in             percent of time was dedicated to introducing new content, 26 percent to practice
Indonesian                   and 15 percent to review. The most striking difference is how much more time
classrooms                   teachers in other countries dedicate to review. Instructional practices: Indonesian
                             mathematics teachers were found to predominantly use a traditional or teacher-
                             centered learning approach. In 2011, 61 percent of time on average was dedicated to
                             exposition or lecturing; 22 percent to problem solving; nine percent to discussion;
                             seven percent to practical work; and one percent to investigation (Figure 26).

Indonesian                     Of the public (whole-class) interaction time in Indonesian classrooms, most lesson
classrooms spend               time was spent on teacher only interaction, typically involving lecture-style
relatively less time           presentations. This type of interaction made up 74 percent of all public interactions
solving problems               in 2011 (Figure 28); whereas teacher and student interaction accounted for only 11
                               percent, and student only interaction 15 percent. In all surveyed countries, most
                               lesson time was spent solving mathematical problems. However, classrooms in
                               Indonesia spent the least amount of time on problem solving compared to
                               comparator countries (64 percent in 2011 compared to at least 82 percent in other
                               countries) (Figure 29).

The video study                What do these key findings tell us about the major trends in Indonesia’s mathematics teaching
found that the use of          practices? Traditional teacher-centered teaching practices are increasingly being used
traditional teacher-           by Indonesia’s mathematics teachers. Correspondingly, the use of non-traditional
centered learning              student-centered learning practices—the approach that the past and current
practices is                   curriculum advocates—is falling. There was an 8 percent increase in the use of
increasing                     lecturing by Indonesian mathematics teachers over the study period. Further, the
                               proportion of lesson time used for group work and seat work (private interaction),
                               which is considered a cornerstone of student-centered learning, decreased by 6
                               percent. A 12 percent decrease in problem solving time also indicates a decrease in
                               the use of student-centered learning approaches. Finally, time spent solving non-
                               routine complex problems decreased from 12 to 4 percent, while the use of real
                               world contexts in problem solving decreased from 11 to 7 percent.

There is a tension          What are the likely factors behind these trends? These trends may be influenced by an
between teaching            inherent tension between the different learning approaches emphasized by the
practices                   annual student National Examination (which has traditionally promoted the use of
emphasized by the           problems with a procedural and closed focus that do not require higher-order
national examination        thinking skills to solve), and the national curriculum (which encourages the use of
and those promoted          non-routine problems, open-ended questioning, inquiry-based approaches, and
by the national             higher-order thinking). Another possible influence is teacher beliefs. For example,
curriculum                  teachers may believe that teacher-centered learning approaches will lead to better
                            student learning outcomes. They may also believe that student-centered learning
                            approaches take more time and effort than teacher-centered learning approaches,
                            while also having less of a direct link to what might be tested in an examination.

                            58 The results described in this article were all found to be statistically significant after controlling for

                              various student, teacher, school, and community characteristics. Multiple regressions were run using
                              different models, but with a particular focus on multi-level modeling. This takes advantage of the
                              hierarchical nature of education, that is, students nested within classrooms, teachers nested within
                              schools, schools nested within districts, and so on.

A clear relationship     What are the impacts of teacher beliefs on student learning outcomes? The video study

                        practices relationship was then developed to try to better understand the dynamics
                        of this relationship in regard to teacher effectiveness (Figure 30).

                        The data mining analysis showed that: (i) teachers are most effective when the
                        practices they use align with their beliefs and knowledge (they know from a subject
                        and pedagogical standpoint how to use the practice), represented by the ‘Congruent
                        Zone’ in the model; (ii) teachers are least effective in using practices that do not
                        align with their knowledge or beliefs, represented by the ‘Dissonant Zone’; and (iii)
                        the effectiveness of a teaching practice is relative and contextual.

…understanding this     What are the implications of this relationship for improving the effectiveness of mathematics teachers
relationship can help   in Indonesia? Understanding the relationship between teacher practices, beliefs and
improve teacher         knowledge provides an opportunity to improve teacher effectiveness through
effectiveness           professional development programs. For teachers to effectively implement student-
                        centered learning practices, they need continual support to progressively build the
                        knowledge and beliefs necessary to utilize the new practices. That is, it is not enough
                        for teachers to just start using student-centered practices; they must also develop the
                        beliefs and knowledge to enable them to implement these practices effectively.

Key findings from       Key findings from the video study have been utilized to develop and pilot an in-

used to develop a       groups at primary and secondary schools. The impact evaluation of the pilot showed
teacher training        that teacher beliefs about the teaching and learning process changed, and that
course, which had a     subject and pedagogical knowledge was strengthened. Importantly, there were
positive impact on      indications of teachers changing their practices in the classroom after the course.
teaching practices      Indonesia’s Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) has made the course
                        available online, while trying to retain its interactive and discussion-orientated
                        philosophy.

                        The video study’s findings could also be used to refine the tests MoEC uses as part
                        of their Teacher Professional Management System (TPMS), such as the minimum
                        standards in professional pedagogical competency test. Improving teaching
                        standards and teacher practices is particularly pressing given the recent increase in
                        hiring of contract teachers, many of whom lack the necessary four-year degree for
                        permanent civil service positions.61
