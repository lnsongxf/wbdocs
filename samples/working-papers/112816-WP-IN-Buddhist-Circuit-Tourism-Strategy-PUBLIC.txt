                          Context

Bodhgaya, Bihar, India.
         Overview
         India is one of the world’s great reservoirs of history, cultures, philosophies and religions. Global
         interest to visit and experience these assets puts India amongst the most desired destinations
         for tourists and pilgrims. The Buddhist Circuit is a route that follows in the footsteps of the
         Buddha from Lumbini in Nepal where he was born, through Bihar in India where he attained
         enlightenment, to Sarnath and Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh in India, where he gave his first
         teachings and died. This iconic route only includes places where the Buddha actually spent
         time, and these sites – all of which are over 2500 years old – are among the most significant
         and revered for all Buddhists. The Buddhist Circuit is an important pilgrimage destination for
         the 450 million practicing Buddhists as well as travelers interested in history, culture or religion.

         Investing in the Buddhist Circuit is the result of first-time collaboration between the Government
         of India’s Ministry of Tourism, the State Governments of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the private
         sector, Buddhist monasteries and sects, and the World Bank Group. The work was led by the
         International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group.

         Extensive on-the-ground data collection, consultations and analysis were conducted. The
         outcome is a framework for public and private sector investment that secures and enhances
         the experience of the sites while unleashing the full job creation potential of tourist spending at
         the towns and sites, and along the Buddhist Circuit. The most important places are:

              •	   Lumbini (in Nepal) – where he was born.
              •	   Bodhgaya (in Bihar) – where he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi Tree.
              •	   Sarnath (in Uttar Pradesh) – where he delivered his first sermon.
              •	   Nalanda and Rajgir (in Bihar) – where he lived and taught, and Nalanda, in particular,
                   became the center of Buddhist learning and teaching.

                                                                                                                                sites and link that to the potential of tourism to deliver sustainable and inclusive economic growth
                                                                                                                                through job creation and income generation opportunities for micro and small enterprises and

          While monks and devotees visiting sites along the Buddhist Circuit are doing so for
          pilgrimage, the experience for most tourists lacks interpretation and is low in quality.
          Destinations along the Buddhist Circuit need to transform into interpretive and learning
          contact points, which in turn will stimulate demand, promote longer stays, and generate a
          desire to visit other sites and lead to growth in goods and service providers. There is scope
          to enhance the visitor experience beyond trips to monuments and temples; however, this
          requires specific interventions in planning, skills development, market access, and access
          to finance. The strategy outlined in this document seeks to grow the economic impact of
          tourism along the Buddhist Circuit by attracting higher-spending tourists and linking them
          to local goods and service providers. This strategy recognizes that both public and private
          sector investment is required to drive demand and improve quality of experience while
          respecting, preserving, and enhancing the religious value and significance of the sites.



          Diagnostic Approach
          The diagnostic approach outlined in Figure 2 is based on global best practices and
          principles for destination development. The process starts with an analysis of the current
          tourism situation, a vision for a desired future, demand assessment, and an analysis of the
          gaps that need to be filled and the challenges faced to progress the vision. The following
          activities were carried out to inform this document:

          Summary and Analysis of the Current Situation
          The major strengths of the Buddhist Circuit are:

               It is “known” to Buddhists
                     •	   Already well-established as a major pilgrimage route
                     •	   A global market of 450 million Buddhists
                     •	   All countries with strong Buddhist cultures have monasteries on the circuit
                     •	   The importance of the Buddhist Circuit makes it attractive to non-Buddhists

                               •	    Stupas and temples date back over 2000 years
                               •	    There are high quality relics in museums in Sarnath, Bodhgaya, and Patna[1]
                               •	    We have the actual corporal relic casket of the Buddha in Patna and other relics
                                     found in the relic stupa of Vaishali

                         Already established facilities for pilgrims and tourists
                               •	    Tour operators provide a range of pilgrimage packages
                               •	    There are a range of accommodation options from monasteries up to 3-star hotels

                         Within reach of major destinations in Northern India
                               •	    The circuit is connected by road, rail and air to Agra, Delhi and Varanasi

        The major weaknesses identified are:

             Limited brand recognition and market reach
                •	   Generally known among the communities linked to the monasteries, but limited
                     awareness in the wider global Buddhist community and even less awareness among
                     non-Buddhist tourists and independent travelers to India
                •	   Sold mostly by specialist Buddhist Circuit operators and not by the general tour
                     operator community
                •	   No clear brand identity – fragmented among private and public-sector role-players
                •	   Very limited online marketing
                •	   High seasonality linked to weather conditions as most pilgrims/tourists come during
                     the more pleasant cooler season
                •	   Low standard of tourist-related services and products
                •	   No accommodation facilities above 3-star level (only a total 300 3-star rooms across
                     the circuit)
                •	   Limited tourist-quality restaurants, coffee shops, shopping, and services
                •	   Limited multi-lingual guided and visitor interaction
                •	   Lack of land for new developments
                •	   Few amenities such as picnic and recreation areas for day visitors and tourist relaxation
                •	   Limited opportunities to shop for authentic local arts, crafts and other goods
                •	   Restricted opening times of attractions such as museums, public parks, etc.
                •	   Lack of evening entertainment: lectures, talks, films on Buddhist related topics
                •	   Limited tourist activities beyond Buddhist sites. For instance, hiking Buddha trails,
                     picnic places, nature engagement, cultural and village experiences, mind-body-spirit
                     programs, archaeology and geomorphology, agro-tourism, and adventure
                •	   Limited tours and activity packages beyond pilgrimages


            Limited interpretation and uncreative exhibition of circuit history and story line
                •	   Museums display relics but offer limited interpretation of the rich heritage behind them
                •	   Limited involvement of global Buddhist community in site enhancement and
                     operations (only in Bodhgaya through the Temple Management Committee)
                •	   Unsatisfactory public infrastructure and facilities at sites
                •	   Destinations generally not planned to allow for large visitor flows, with limited
                     pedestrian access, and few visitor spaces
                •	   Limited seating, shade, meditation areas, etc.
                •	   Restrooms of poor standard
                •	   Tourist information centers poorly managed




14 |   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit
   Road and rail infrastructure and services limited
       •	   Road quality poor in many places making travel arduous, time-consuming, and,
            often, dangerous
       •	   Lack of wayside amenities exacerbate discomfort over long travel distances and times
       •	   Inconvenient rail schedules between sites.
       •	   Few opportunities to engage with local community
       •	   Few operators offer community interactive experiences
       •	   Local community organisations, monasteries, local bodies and other government
            authorities seldom engaged in joint planning and partnerships
       •	   Limited local awareness and understanding of benefits and responsibilities associated
            with tourism growth


The opportunities are:

    Tapping into unexplored and underdeveloped markets and segments
       •	   Potential to attract the large Buddhist population from nearby Asian countries – year
            on year only 0.005% of source market Buddhists visit the Buddhist Circuit
       •	   Location allows for mainstreaming the Buddhist Circuit as an extension to northern
            India foreign tourist circuit
       •	   Potential to provide rail and road access and transport to the growing independent
            travel market
       •	   Attracting tourists with special prices and events during shoulder season could
            expand market share.

   Increased tourism investment and business prospects
       •	   As market grows investment opportunities will increase for higher quality hotels,
            restaurants, and wellness resorts
       •	   Packaging the Buddhist Circuit “story” and heritage more creatively will facilitate
            accelerated growth and tour operating opportunities.

   Creating local jobs and incomes
       •	   Offering experiences beyond pilgrimage sites
       •	   Developing local supply chains and income generating opportunities through tourism
       •	   Developing unique local shopping opportunities for arts, handicrafts, food, and
            clothing.

   Demonstration effect
       •	   This project is a first-time collaboration across states, multiple state government
            levels and with the Union government; there are valuable lessons for improving the
            delivery model for Indian government resources

        Threats to the Buddhist Circuit are:

            Destruction and pollution of Buddhist heritage
                •	   Population pressures and competition for resources may lead to encroachment of
                     Buddhist sites
                •	   Traffic congestion around sites potentially hazardous
                •	   Air pollution may damage ancient relics (this is already happening in some places)
                •	   Destruction of relics and sites due to a lack of awareness and sensitivity towards
                     fragility of ancient sites

            Conflict of traditions and practices
                •	   Buddhist sites set in Hindu and Muslim dominated communities may dilute
                     Buddhist character and experience
                •	   Lack of understanding among locals and pilgrims of respective lifestyles, needs,
                     and traditions may cause insensitivity and conflict

            Compromised visitor safety
                •	   Hazardous road conditions may compromise transportation safety of tourists
                •	   Lack of hygiene and poor food safety standards may threaten visitor health and
                     taint the circuit’s brand.

             Overlapping government mandates result in inaction

                     federal with unclear and in some cases overlapping mandates over sites on the
                     Buddhist Circuit, aspects of connectivity, infrastructure development and market
                     development; this threatens the viability of collective actions that might contribute

Performance objectives
The success of the strategy will be measured in the success of the following performance
objectives:

    •	   Growth in target visitor segments (to be decided) to key destinations/sites on the
         circuit.
    •	   An average 20 percent growth in accommodation occupancy levels in Bodhgaya,
         Rajgir, Sarnath, and Kushinagar.
    •	   Fifty percent growth in tourism revenues and visitor expenditures at target
         destinations/sites.
    •	   One thousand new tourism-related jobs created at target destinations.
    •	   Two thousand individuals trained in tourism-related service.
    •	   Indian rupees 500 crore ($100 million) in public investment in infrastructure and site
         improvements from 2014 to 2018.
    •	   Indian rupees 500 crore ($100 million) in new private sector investment along the
         Buddhist Circuit from 2014 to 2018.



Positioning and branding
Expanding tourism along the circuit involves occupying, promoting, and developing a market
position that appeals to a spectrum of potential visitors and capitalizes on the variety of
resources and assets offered in the area.



Selling proposition
The following three experience pillars contribute to a unique market positioning and selling
proposition for the circuit:

    •	   Pilgrimage: The religious significance and holiness of the area for Buddhists, given
         that the Buddha spent his entire life here and that the Dharma and the Sangha
         originated here, and that the Buddha suggested his disciples both lay and monastic to
         visit the places associated with his life.
    •	   Ancient heritage: Many of the circuit sites and relics date back as far as 300 BC
         and the location of the circuit in and around the historic Ganges Valley provides for
         an exceptional experience of ancient history, traditions, and architecture. Many of
         these ancient places compliment the spiritual experience and showcase India’s diverse
         cultural and heritage tourism offering.
    •	   Mind, body, spirit: The character, ambience, and history of the sites and the traditions
         of Buddhist communities on the circuit offer Buddhists and non-Buddhists the perfect
         environment to engage in healthy, therapeutic practices like meditation and self-
         reflection, yoga and other exercises, and healthy eating.

          These three pillars (figure 3) can be summarized in a selling proposition as:
                                           “In the Footsteps of the Buddha”

Brand
The following elements can be used to communicate the Buddhist Circuit brand:

    •	   The term “Buddhist Circuit” is already a well-established name for the route and
         should be retained as a brand name. Variations of the name such as Buddha’s Path,
         Buddha’s Way, and Buddha’s Route could be used for a web domain should www.
         buddhistcircuit.org be unavailable.
    •	   The logo can be used as a stamp of recognition of the brand, to mark and signpost the
         circuit and to endorse products and services affiliated to the circuit.
    •	   The proposed logo design is a rendering of the lotus flower, one of the most recognized
         symbols of Buddhism accompanied by the “Buddhist Circuit” wording. The following
         versions could be considered to brand the circuit:
    •	   The logo can be used by and on behalf of all public and private sector stakeholders:




                          In the
                          Footsteps of
                          the Buddha
         ––   As a common identity on printed and electronic promotional materials used to
              market the circuit. The logo can be complimented by suitable “look and feel”
              design imagery, based on a standardized colour palette.
         ––   As a mark of affiliation for all businesses, attractions, monasteries, non-
              government organizations, and other stakeholders.
         ––   As a trail and route marker to indicate attractions, sites, routes, and
              destinations that are part of the circuit.
    •	   The logo and graphic design can be complemented by suitable photographic and
         artistic imagery that supports the market positioning of:
         ––   Pilgrimage (pilgrims patronising the circuit, stupas, and temples)
         ––   Mind, body, and spirit (meditation, yoga, and reflection)
         ––   Heritage (relics, ancients sites, journeys of Bodhisattvas, Xuan Zang).




                                                                  Investing in The Buddhist Circuit   | 21
          Target markets
          While the circuit is patronized almost exclusively by Buddhist pilgrims, their numbers are
          limited in relation to the large numbers of Buddhists globally. Also, the majority of pilgrims
          are relatively low spending travelers. Non-Buddhist travel on the circuit has been very limited
          when compared to overall leisure travel to India. Current non-Buddhist travel is primarily of a
          backpacking, budget nature.

          The majority of visitors to the circuit are of the following four types:

              •	   Budget pilgrims: Devout Buddhists committed to visiting all sacred sites where the
                   Buddha was born, became enlightened, taught, and died. This segment travels under
                   tight budgets and prefers basic, simple facilities and services. They mostly travel in
                   large groups by road and sometimes by train.
              •	   Comfort pilgrims: Devout Buddhists committed to visiting the full circuit or at
                   least part of it, especially the four most sacred sites of Buddha’s birth (Lumbini),
                   enlightenment (Bodhgaya), first sermon (Sarnath) and death (Kushinagar). The
                   segment requires greater travel comfort and often travels on tighter time frames than
                   budget pilgrims. They travel in both large and smaller parties and often prefer to travel
                   more independently than the budget pilgrims.
              •	   Budget explorers: Non-Buddhists on a backpacking, independent budget trip or
                   domestic family holiday in northern India. They visit a few of the circuit sites as a
                   quick-visit component of a wider itinerary, or they could make the circuit an important
                   component of their itinerary and spend a substantial portion of their itinerary here.
              •	   High-end explorers: Includes high to medium-end foreign packaged tourists and
                   independent “flashpackers” on a wider India itinerary, as well as domestic leisure
                   travelers on a holiday break. They mostly visit a few selected sites on the circuit (for
                   instance, Sarnath, Bodhgaya, and/or Rajgir/Nalanda) and require comfortable and
                   good-quality facilities, services, shopping, and recreation.

in table 2.

difficult to capture) These are wealthy local and international tourists. Very few visit the circuit,
                      as is evidenced by the lack of higher-quality tourist facilities. The circuit
                      could be added to itineraries of higher spending travelers to other parts
                      of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and neighboring areas; however this will require
                      significant investment in suitable infrastructure, attractions, and facilities.

Comfort pilgrims      Cultivate by improving current products, facilities, infrastructure, and

difficult to capture) These are wealthier Buddhist pilgrims who may or may not have the time to
                      travel the entire circuit, who would prefer better quality hospitality facilities
                      and services, and who are able to spend more than the average pilgrim on
                      local goods and services. While there is already a significant demand by
                      this segment as is demonstrated by the growth in 3-star accommodation
                      in Bodhgaya and other locations, the higher end of the segment remains
                      largely untapped. Since the motivation to visit the circuit should be high
                      it should be possible to attract these travelers to the circuit in the shorter
                      term. Expansion of this segment will require improvement in quality of
                      services and facilities over the short to medium term.

                      on the circuit for non-pilgrimage purposes. There is already a significant
                      demand from this segment and, as an early adopter or frontier segment,
                      the immediate growth potential and return on investment of this segment
                      could be substantial.

Budget pilgrims       Maintain by providing basic services, facilities, and infrastructure.

                      groups over extended distances on the entire circuit and require good
                      wayside facilities and basic public amenities. The segment is currently the
                      “bread and butter” of tourism on the circuit. Basic improvements are
                      required in various facilities that they avail.

Conclusion


This document provides an integrated framework to fast-track tourism growth on the circuit by
focusing on critical challenges and opportunities along the destination value chain.

It should serve as a guiding framework for investment in tourism development on the circuit
over the next five years. Its success will depend on:


           The strategy being adopted as the official strategic framework for tourism
           development on the circuit by public sector tourism authorities, relevant
           departments and ministries, the private sector, the religious community,
           and other interested and affected parties.

           Adequate finances being made available by the government of India,
           the state governments of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and other financing
           partners.

           Adequate institutional and human capacity being allocated to implement
           the strategy.

           Further specialized studies and detailed plans being conducted in support
           of key projects identified in the strategy

           The strategy being regarded and treated as a flexible, guiding framework
           that should be continuously adapted and updated.

           Effective measurement and evaluation systems being implemented to
           monitor success and impact.

          This section takes stock of current trends in tourism demand, resources and products, access,
          supportive facilities, and organizational capacity on the Circuit.



          Tourism demand
          Buddhist source markets
          There are about 450 to 480 million Buddhists across the world[1]. They practice different
          branches of Buddhism:

               •	    Mahayana Buddhism, including East Asian Buddhism, with 185 million followers. This
                     is the predominant form of Buddhism practiced in China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan,
                     Singapore, and Vietnam.
               •	    Theravada Buddhism, with over 125 million followers, is the form of Buddhism predominantly
                     practiced in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos P.D.R., Sri Lanka, Myanmar and India.
               •	    Vajrayana Buddhism has approximately 20 million followers. This form is practiced in
                     the greater Tibetan and Mongolian regions, the Himalayas, Bhutan, parts of western
                     China, the Russian Federation, and Nepal.

At least eight countries (Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos p.d.r., Myanmar, Bhutan, Mongolia
and Vietnam) have unambiguous Buddhist majorities. Depending on how one calculates Chinese
and other East Asian adherents, this figure could include several more countries. In addition,
Buddhism is the state religion of Cambodia and Bhutan, and receives prominent mention in the
constitutions of Thailand and Sri Lanka. The religion severely declined during the first millennium
in northern India and Nepal, where Buddhism was born.

Table 3 compares foreign tourist arrivals in India from Buddhist countries with total tourist arrival
for 2009 to 2011. The following trends emerge:

    •	   Arrivals from Buddhist countries comprised more than 18 percent of total foreign tourist
         arrivals to India in 2011. The growth in arrivals from Buddhist countries in 2011 was
         substantially higher than the overall growth in arrivals.
    •	   Whereas shares of total arrivals of some Buddhist countries like Sri Lanka (4.9 percent),
         Thailand (1.5 percent), China (2.3 percent), Japan (3.1 percent) and South Korea
         (1.7 percent) were significant, countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, and Taiwan had limited
         market shares.


            India has only scratched the surface in attracting a meaningful share of
            religious Buddhist travelers. Arrivals to India from Buddhist dominated
            countries comprised a mere 0.005 percent of all Buddhist adherents.	
            Since the Buddhist Circuit is the area where Buddhism originated and where
            the Buddha lived, the potential for Buddhist tourism expansion is enormous.

                        Both domestic and foreign tourism on the Circuit has grown exceptionally
                        well in the recent past, indicating potential for growth.
                        Bodhgaya, Sarnath, Rajgir, Nalanda, and Kushinagar, are clearly the main
                        attractions on the Circuit and could become important catalyst locations
                        for an accelerated growth strategy.
                        The high seasonality in visitor arrivals is a major challenge that negatively
                        affects expansion potential, business viability, and sustainable employment
                        creation on the Circuit. Strategies are needed to overcome this.

          The following trends emerge from the survey:

              •	   The majority of Indian visitors cited spiritual/religious travel as the reason to visit the
                   Circuit, 34 percent cited leisure and entertainment. At some sites, such as Rajgir,
                   Nalanda and Sarnath, leisure and entertainment were cited by a large number of
                   visitors (between 40 and 50 percent).
              •	   A large majority (72 percent) of international visitors travelled the Circuit for
                   spiritual/religious purposes. The exception was Sarnath, where the majority (51 percent)
                   cited leisure and entertainment and only 33 percent said they were visiting for spiritual
                   and religious reasons.


                     Although Indian travelers primarily visit the Circuit for spiritual and religious
                     purposes, some centers on the Circuit, such as Sarnath, Rajgir, and Nalanda,
                     are important holiday and recreation areas. The needs and expectations of
                     Indian leisure travelers should be kept in mind when developing these sites.

                     The Circuit attracts mostly religious travelers from Buddhist countries. The
                     situation is different in Sarnath, where proximity to Varanasi, an important
                     leisure holiday location, clearly acts as a stimulus for leisure and educational
                     tourism. The captive leisure market in Varanasi and Sarnath offers an
                     opportunity to draw more visitors to the rest of the Buddhist Circuit.



          Demographics
              •	   Age: The average age of domestic tourists visiting the Buddhist Circuit was between
                   30 and 31, lower than the average age of international tourists of 38 to 39 years.
                   Moreover, with international tourists, the average age of religious travelers was higher
                   than that of the non-religious travelers. Sri Lankan, Thai, Japanese, and Myanmar
                   tourists had the highest average age among tourists.
              •	   Profession: Students and traders/business formed the largest proportion of the
                   sample among the domestic tourists, international tourists consisted of a mix of
                   traders/ businessmen, students, and self-employed professionals.
              •	   Education: International tourists had relatively higher levels of education than
                   domestic tourists. The highest education level for a sizeable proportion of domestic
                   tourists was high school; whereas a majority of international tourists were
                   college/university graduates.
              •	   Income: The average income of international tourists was more than seven times
                   that of domestic tourists. However, considering the sensitivity of the issue, a sizeable
                   portion of respondents refused to disclose their incomes, and some respondents may
                   have misquoted their incomes.

           Broadening the markets of the Buddhist Circuit beyond the pilgrimage
           segment will mean catering to a younger, more educated audience. This
           will attract higher income and higher spending travelers.


Travel behaviour

Sites visited
Table 5 shows the sites visited by domestic and international travelers. The following trends are
evident:

    •	   The majority of domestic travelers interviewed travel independently. Bodhgaya was the
         preferred destination for domestic religious travelers, possibly due to its proximity to
         Gaya (a major Hindu pilgrimage center), while non-religious domestic travelers often
         combined Bodhgaya with Rajgir and Nalanda in a sub-Circuit.
    •	   Domestic religious travelers were more likely than non-religious travelers to extend their
         journey from the main centers of Bodhgaya and Sarnath to the rest of the Circuit, such
         as Kushinagar and Lumbini.
    •	   Eighteen percent of international survey respondents visited only a single site when
         compared to 27 percent of domestic tourists visiting only one site. Lumbini and Sarnath
         were exceptions where single-site travelers comprised of 20 to 25 percent of international
         respondents. These could be considered site visitors rather than Circuit visitors.
    •	   International independent/non-packaged travelers focused mainly on Bodhgaya and
         Sarnath and were less inclined to visit the rest of the Circuit, whereas packaged tours
         tended to cover all major Buddhist sites.
    •	   Similarly, international non-religious travelers mainly visited Bodhgaya and Sarnath, with
         a limited number visiting other sites.
    •	   There was a tendency among international travelers to begin and conclude their trips at
         Bodhgaya and Sarnath because Gaya and Varanasi have airports.

              •	     The three routes followed by a majority of tourists are:
                     1.	 Bodhgaya–Rajgir-Nalanda- Kushinagar-Varanasi/Sarnath-Bodhgaya;
                     2.	 Bodhgaya–Rajgir-Nalanda-Sarnath-Kushinagar-Varanasi; and
                     3.	Varanasi/Sarnath-Kushinagar-Bodhgaya-Varanasi.
              •	     Apart from this, sub-circuits existed where tourists covered Bodhgaya-Rajgir-Nalanda
                     or Sarnath-Kushinagar in one stretch.
              •	     Other sites were largely used as middle-of-the-trip centers. However, Lumbini was
                     sometimes an exit point for tourists, especially those coming from India.


                       The survey results indicate that domestic visitors mainly travel
                       independently and that the Bodhgaya-Rajgir-Nalanda area is most sought
                       after by domestic travelers, with non-religious travelers having a particular
                       interest in this area. Among international travelers there is a clear
                       distinction between packaged and non-packaged travel movements, with
                       packaged tours generally covering the wider circuit and non-packaged
                       (independent) Circuit travelers focusing mainly on Sarnath and Bodhgaya.
                       Similarly, the majority of non-religious international travelers only visit
                       Bodhgaya and/or Sarnath.




38 |   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit
Source of awareness about Buddhist Circuit
Awareness among domestic tourists was largely through word of mouth, travel literature, and
newspapers. Among international tourists however, awareness was largely through Buddhist
organisations and teachers, websites, travel literature, word of mouth, and, to some extent, tour
operators.



Incidence of travel and booking mode
    •	   A majority of the tourists surveyed (both domestic and international), were first-time
         visitors to the Buddhist Circuit. Incidence of repeat visitors, however, was marginally
         higher among domestic students. Apart from this, the most common entry/exit point to
         the Buddhist Circuit was Bodhgaya.
    •	   A majority of domestic tourists in the Buddhist Circuit travel without any pre-booking.
         For international tourists, however, since travel distances are more, and overall duration
         of a trip is less, a planned trip with prior booking is the rule. Booking the trip through
         internet/ travel agents/ tour operators was most preferred.


Mode of Arrival
Figure 8 shows that most domestic travelers arrive by road (in personal/rented cars) and rail.
International tourists utilize a range of transport modes.

              •	    Due to its proximity to Gaya railway station, at least 30 percent of international visitors
                    to Bodhgaya arrive by train. Visitors to Sarnath use a mix of transport modes (including
                    taxi) due to its proximity to Varanasi. Visitors to outlying sites like Rajgir, Kushinagar,
                    Lumbini, and other sites to the north depend on road travel by tour buses/vehicles.


          Activities
              •	    Since the primary purpose of travel for a majority of the tourists was spiritual/religious
                    in nature, key activities included visiting temples, praying/meditating, and visiting
                    museums and historic relics. This is listed in table 6. In contrast to other destinations,
                    Lumbini is a center for a variety of activities, both religious and recreational, for both
                    international religious and non-religious travelers. This involves attending religious
                    ceremonies, festivals, and sports events. Souvenir shopping is not a major activity,
                    except in Lumbini and Bodhgaya, where the shops have more to offer.

40 |   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit
                                              Participating in non-spiritual/religious activities is limited across the Circuit.
                                              However, table 6 demonstrates that alternative activities such as attending
                                              ceremonies, shopping, hiking/trekking, festivals, visiting communities,
                                              and attending art and music performances (in Lumbini, for instance) are
                                              popular among tourists if available. This suggests that the lack of product
                                              offering rather than lack of market interest may be the prime reason for
                                              low participation levels at Bodhgaya and elsewhere on the Circuit.

                                     •	   The length of stay in the Buddhist Circuit was longer for international tourists with a
                                          majority staying between five to thirteen days, compared to domestic tourists and those
                                          from Nepal who stayed between two to ten days.
                                     •	   Tourists who arrived on packages stayed longer than those who did not. Independent
                                          travelers were more inclined to visit just a section of the Circuit, while package tours
                                          covered a larger part of the Circuit.
                                     •	   International visitors from Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar spent an average of
                                          eleven to thirteen days on the Circuit, at least three days more than those from the west
                                          and Japan.

          Visitor expenditure
          Table 7 indicates expenditure by various traveller types. These are some important findings:

               •	    As expected, international visitors spent much more than domestic travelers.
                     International visitors on packages spent up to five to ten times more than their domestic
                     counterparts while it was up to twenty times for independent foreign travelers.
               •	    Packages for religious tourists are generally more expensive than those for
                     non-religious visitors; this may be due to the longer duration of tours for pilgrims.
               •	    While there is a lack of information on the nature and extent of expenditure leakages
                     (the portion of money paid for travel packages accruing outside of the Buddhist
                     Circuit), this is an important factor to consider as leakages in the form of repatriation
                     of profits, commissions withheld, and imports are significantly higher for packaged
                     travel than for independent travel.
               •	    Donations to temples and monasteries comprise a substantial portion of additional
                     expenditure by both religious and non-religious packaged travelers. This may, among
                     others, be in return for accommodation and other hospitality services offered by
                     monasteries.
               •	    The most lucrative spenders (both packaged and independent) are travelers from
                     Western countries and China, whose total cost of travel is around 30 percent more
                     than that of other international markets. Independent travelers from Western countries
                     generally outspend other independent travelers. Buddhist pilgrims (religious travelers)
                     from Thailand and Myanmar are relatively high spenders, while the expenditures of
                     non-religious travelers from these countries are limited.

    •	   While it is not possible to calculate daily expenditure accurately, figures indicate that
         package costs on the Buddhist Circuit range from around $100 per day (budget) to
         $300 (upmarket). Major discretionary expenditures such as shopping and donations to
         temples and monasteries vary substantially and are often not related to the cost of the
         package. Spending of non-package tourists on hospitality services like accommodation,
         restaurants, and shopping is relatively high. Religious tourists surveyed from Myanmar
         also recorded high expenditure.

                        The survey results indicate that the Buddhist Circuit attracts a range of
                        expenditure segments, with large expenditure variations among country
                        markets and between religious and non-religious tourists. As a rule the
                        “short circuit” (Bodhgaya-Sarnath-Patna triangle) attracts visitors across
                        the expenditure range from budget to upmarket, while the broader
                        Circuit generally attracts budget to middle-market travelers, the majority
                        being pilgrims.



          Status of branding and promotion
          The integrated Buddhist Circuit concept has a brand image and visual identity that highlight its
          uniqueness, distinguishes it from other Circuits and destinations in India, and can be used to
          signpost the Circuit and build a sense of place. The Circuit brand has been largely developed and
          packaged by individual private tour and facility operators and there is no collective framework
          or initiative to promote the Circuit concept.

Country level
   •	   At the country level the Ministry of Tourism, under the brand banner of Incredible India,
        has paid special attention to Buddhist tourism, mainly through the production and
        co-production of high quality information materials. These include:
        ––   Foldout map of Buddhist sites in India with information on key sites. The map
             is informative, but does not clearly define the Circuit and various sub-circuits of
             Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
        ––   Walking with the Buddha, a comprehensive, impressively documented and well
             designed handbook on the origins, development, practices and sites of Buddhism
             in India. Apart from detailed and well-researched generic information, the book
             contains valuable tips and contact information on services and facilities along the
             Circuit.
        ––   A section on the Incredible India website where the Buddhist Circuit is one of
             13 themes to be discovered.
        ––   Information materials, available in English and Hindi only, with no particular focus
             on addressing different requirements of various cultures and countries.
   •	   Promotional materials (high resolution images, advertising clips, videos, print
        advertisements) to market the Buddhist Circuit are limited, and coverage of Buddhist
        travel is confined to a few images as part of broader adverts. There does not appear to
        be any dedicated promotional elements specifically aimed at marketing the Buddhist
        Circuit in its totality and promoting India as a pilgrimage destination in Buddhist
        countries.
   •	   The ministry has “Incredible India” representative offices in three Asian and South East
        Asian countries, namely Japan (covering Japan, Korea and Taiwan), China (covering
        China/Hong Kong) and Singapore (covering all South East Asian countries). In addition to
        acting as coordination points for above-the-line activities associated with the Incredible
        India campaign, the offices attend a variety of media and travel trade education and
        promotion programs, mainly at trade and consumer tourism fairs and workshops. Their
        activities include:
        ––   Japan Office: Consumer and trade fairs – Korea: three events, Taiwan: two
             events, Japan: three events.

                     ––     These offices and activities cover the Buddhist pilgrimage markets. The extent
                            to which the Buddhist Circuit, in particular, is promoted during these events is
                            unclear. The extent and depth of coverage and information provided requires
                            further scrutiny.

          State level
          Specific marketing initiatives by state tourism departments to highlight and promote the
          Buddhist Circuit are limited and there is a need to strengthen efforts.



          In Bihar
              •	   The Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC) website strongly presents
                   a Buddhist image; however the site focuses on individual destinations and BSTDC
                   services and facilities but does not reflect the Circuit concept.
              •	   The Bihar Tourism Department website has a limited Buddhist Circuit presence; the
                   Buddhist Circuit is listed among a range of other Circuits (Hindu, Jain, and Sufi). The
                   listing of destinations in the Buddhist Circuit landing page is combined with various
                   non-Buddhist destinations.
              •	   It is unclear what proactive marketing initiatives the state tourism authority engages in
                   to promote the Circuit; indications are that such initiatives are limited.


          In Uttar Pradesh
              •	   The Uttar Pradesh tourism website does not reflect a focused effort to promote the
                   Buddhist Circuit. The various Buddhist site locations are listed with all other destinations
                   and the picture gallery contains good images of the various destinations all over Uttar
                   Pradesh (including the Buddhist destinations). While there is a separate page dedicated
                   to tourism Circuits in Uttar Pradesh (Mahabharat Circuit, Ram Van-Gaman Yatra
                   Circuit, Circuit related to First War of Independence in 1857, Jain Circuit, Sikh Circuit,
                   Sufi Circuit, Christian Circuit, and Handicraft Circuit) this page does not mention the
                   Buddhist Circuit as an option.
              •	   Like Bihar, it is unclear what proactive marketing initiatives the state tourism authority
                   engages in to promote the Circuit; indications are that such initiatives are limited to
                   some printed brochures, however the distribution of these is questionable and no
                   printed materials could be found at official tourism information centers.


                          The integrated Buddhist Circuit has no formal brand identity and is
                          portrayed and packaged in a fragmented and inconsistent manner.
                          Despite the unique status of the Circuit and the enormous international
                          market size of Buddhist travelers, proactive and coordinated destination
                          marketing efforts are limited and the Circuit is primarily promoted by
                          individual operators and religious bodies.

                                Tourism resources
                                Attractions at a majority of sites on the Circuit stretch beyond its core landmarks. Tourists interact
                                with the broader environment, which include urban and rural landscapes and natural and cultural
                                resources of the main towns and locations on the Circuit.

                                An enjoyable and impactful travel experience depends on more than physical landscapes and
                                heritage – services rendered by locals and the ambience and aesthetics of the travel environment
                                are equally important aspects of an attractive and sustainable tourism destination. The following
                                are key challenges and opportunities related to current resources on the Circuit.



                                Buddhist sites and other attractions
                                Buddhist heritage sites and surroundings are managed by a variety of agencies. Each site has its
                                own challenges, but the following concerns are applicable across most sites:

                                       •	    The majority of relics and landmarks (such as stupas, water bodies, and monasteries)
                                             associated with the life of the Buddha are protected by the Archaeological Survey of India
                                             (ASI) or institutions set up for the purpose such as temple management committees. The
                                             sites are generally well maintained and preserved.
                                       •	    Most sites lack quality visitor facilities, such as shaded seating for meditation and rest,
                                             modern well-maintained restrooms, pathways, and lighting.

              •	   ASI site opening hours are, in many cases, restricted and do not allow after-hours
                   visits. Since pilgrims are on tight schedules, this restricts the quality of the experience.
              •	   Interpretation of the history, events, and context of Buddhism is lacking. ASI operates
                   museums at most sites, which contain numerous valuable, high quality relics and
                   displays. But these are mostly static and museums do not follow themes or storylines.
                   Opportunities for visitors to interact and engage are very limited.
              •	   Visitor information and signage throughout the Circuit is inadequate.
              •	   The sacred sense of place is often tainted by commercial, human, and vehicular
                   intrusion. Not only does this take away from the spiritual experience but pollution
                   poses severe threats to the structural quality and integrity of the sites.
              •	   Entertainment, shopping, and relaxation in and around the sites are extremely limited
                   and opportunities to enjoy a relaxing meal or beverage, listen to music, or participate
                   in cultural activities are few.
              •	   Aesthetic, practical integration with the surrounding urban environment is mostly
                   absent. In many instances there are no, or very limited, visitor friendly transition zones
                   between the sites and its surroundings. This means that, once outside site boundaries,
                   the hustle and bustle of daily life is often “in the face” of those who seek spiritual
                   contemplation and peace.
              •	   Opportunities to interact with and experience the culture and lifestyle of local
                   communities are limited and except for purchases from local informal traders, the
                   majority of Buddhist Circuit visitors are removed from local communities.
              •	   The sites and their surrounding visitor environments are often under the control of
                   a variety of institutions such as the ASI, tourism departments, forest departments,
                   temple management committees, and local traders. Inclusive coordination and
                   planning is rare.


                      The Buddhist Circuit contains the most valuable and unique locations
                      for Buddhist pilgrims throughout the world. The sites are generally well
                      preserved. However, the locations have been neglected from a tourism
                      and visitor perspective and there are very few attractive opportunities
                      on the Circuit to leverage and enhance visitor enjoyment, experience,
                      and value beyond the monuments and temples. Current attractions are
                      not seamlessly packaged; for instance, visitors require separate tickets
                      for each entry and product packaging and pricing practices in the two
                      states also vary.

                           Human resources
                           Studies are yet to be made on the employment impact of tourism on the Buddhist Circuit. The
                           following findings are based on industry interviews, workshops, and available literature:

                               •	   Employees in the hotel industry are generally well trained in basic hospitality services.
                                    According to national statistics, around 80 percent of employees of registered hotels
                                    have had at least a one-year certificate in hospitality management or some focused
                                    in-house training.
                               •	   Apart from managers of higher quality hotels, few locals are trained to deal with
                                    the unique requirements of Buddhist nationalities such as foreign languages, food
                                    preferences, cultural habits, and spiritual practices. There does not appear to be
                                    formalized cooperation between country monasteries and local tourism authorities
                                    to address foreign visitor requirements. Foreign groups are generally accompanied by
                                    guides and tour leaders from countries of origin.
                               •	   The quality and availability of Indian tourist guides specializing in the Buddhist Circuit is
                                    limited, possibly due to the group pilgrimage nature of travel on the Circuit. As a result,
                                    visitor interaction and interpretation is limited or lacking.

               •	    Local communities are unaware of the behavior, requirements, and economic
                     contributions of Buddhist travelers. This may lead to misperceptions and even conflicts.
                     Outreach and awareness programs to educate and inform locals and visitors about the
                     benefits, requirements, and responsibilities associated with Buddhist tourism are few.
               •	    Although informal traders throughout the Circuit sell handicrafts and souvenirs, the
                     quality and authenticity of such products is inconsistent. There is opportunity to sell
                     higher quality crafts, souvenirs, and other locally produced items. Most sites lack
                     suitable shopping and market areas, and trading is mainly concentrated at entrances
                     to historical sites.


                         There is clearly scope for a focused local awareness, skills training, and
                         entrepreneurship development drive to maximize local economic and
                         employment impact of the Buddhist Circuit.

Intangible resources
The intangible elements and characteristics of the Buddhist Circuit experience are important in
fulfilling expectations and delivering experiences sought by visitors. Since the architecture and
tangible relics are less impressive than that of other religious locations, visitors are in search
of a unique spiritual experience. This requires a suitably serene environment. There are many
challenges here:

    •	   The Buddhist Circuit experience encourages inward reflection and meditation, among
         other things. The social, cultural and religious environment in India is not always
         conducive and few spaces around the Circuit are suitable for quiet contemplation.
    •	   Spiritual serenity and meditation require an unpolluted and healthy environment. Sites
         on the Circuit suffer from high levels of air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion,
         and littering.
    •	   Personal safety is of primary concern to all tourists. The introduction of tourist police at
         some of the sites is a positive development. Coordinated safety and crisis management
         and effective health care are limited. Specific areas requiring attention are:
         ––     Improvement of visitor safety at the more adventurous sites such as the Rajgir
                ropeway, especially for older tourists.
         ––     Emergency health care in proximity of sites.
         ––     Harassment of tourists.


              There is a need for an integrated and coordinated management approach
              among the various entities involved at local levels to ensure an unpolluted,
              serene, and safe environment.




                                                                     Investing in The Buddhist Circuit   | 51
          Support services and infrastructure
          Access and connectivity
          Seamless entry and movement for visitors between various locations is important for the Circuit
          to be a success. Easy mobility encourages tourists to cover the entire Circuit, and has a major
          effect on the length of stay and dispersion of travelers across the two states.


          Air
          Airport infrastructure is improving. The plans to develop an international airport at Kushinagar
          will add to air access. Unfortunately flights to Gaya remain seasonal and this may well be the
          case with the new Kushinagar airport, unless proactive steps are taken to drive traffic through
          the airport and to lengthen the season.

such as Varanasi, Patna, and Lucknow. There is only one flight a day to Gorakhpur. A focused
effort will be required to position the upcoming airport at Kushinagar as a major entry hub.

Gaya airport provides an indication of the high degree of seasonality. Five international airlines fly
direct to Gaya Airport during the season from various hubs in Asia, in addition to a daily domestic
flight from Delhi. As many as 150 aircraft land at the airport each month during the tourist
season the tourist season (September to March). The majority of these flights are discontinued
during the off-season.

          Rail
          Rail connectivity can play an important role in improving access through the Circuit. The
          Mahaparanirvana Express Buddhist Circuit train is dedicated to pilgrimage groups; however it
          follows a fixed itinerary, comes at a fairly steep price, and leaves limited room for flexibility in
          terms of Circuit combinations. The existing rail service could provide flexible access, but services
          and facilities are of inconsistent quality, the rail station and train environment is often chaotic
          and overcrowded, and the system does not allow for pre-booking and payment from foreign
          countries.

          A special tourist ticket with additional services on specific scheduled trains and key routes
          (for instance, New Delhi to Gaya, with possible stops in Varanasi, Gaya, and Rajgir) would be
          useful. This could go with facilities such as tourist-assigned ticketing up to 24 hours in advance
          of departures, tourist waiting rooms at stations with well-maintained bathrooms and seating,
          a concierge service to provide information and show tourists the way, and optional catering
          service on trains. Trains like the Shramjevi Express and the Budhpurnima Express are good
          possibilities and connections for such a scheme.

54 |   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit
                                While rail and air services bring tourists up to certain key points, full-circuit travelers rely on
                                road transport for large sections of their journeys. Road infrastructure is constantly improving
                                and most state-level roads are in fair, if not good, condition. A planned JICA-financed[5] road
                                improvement project from Rajgir to Bodhgaya will upgrade another state-level road link. The
                                longest stretches of road travel around the Circuit are, however, on national highways and these
                                are unfortunately, for the most part, not in good condition. Several road sections are particularly
                                problematic and are major obstacles for tour operators and visitors. Table 10, on the next page,
                                provides a summary of road conditions.


                                                Appropriate access, transport, and connectivity are critical factors for the
                                                growth of the Circuit. Transport infrastructure and facilities should lead
                                                the Circuit development strategy. Airport infrastructure is improving and
                                                joint marketing programs should be launched with local and foreign
                                                airlines to grow air traffic to the main airports on the Circuit and
                                                lengthen the tourist season. Available rail services should be leveraged
                                                for tourism and a phased program of road and wayside improvements
                                                should be part of the strategy.

Accommodation
Accommodation on the Circuit largely reflects the nature and extent of market demand.
Accommodation is available in the following categories:

   •	   Private hotels: All main sites on the Circuit offer one or more private hotels. These
        are mostly 2-star and below, with the exception of a few 3-star hotels. There are no
        4 or 5-star hotels in any of the main locations on the Circuit, other than those in nearby
        Lucknow, Varanasi and Patna. Private hotel supply at 3-star level and lower appears
        to be in tune with market conditions (in particular pilgrimage budgets and tastes, and
        seasonality). There does not appear to be a shortage of this type of accommodation
        along the Circuit.
   •	   Private bed-and-breakfast and guest houses: The main pilgrimage centers offer
        a range of low cost accommodation, especially in Bodhgaya. These cater to budget
        conscious local travelers and international pilgrims.
   •	   Government hotels: The state tourism corporations of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have
        government-owned hotels at all Buddhist locations. These range from dormitory
        accommodation to tourist standard en-suite rooms and cater to the entry level of
        the market. Facilities are generally quite dated and in need of recapitalization and
        refurbishment. At several locations, government-owned hotels are located on prime land.
        Operations of some government-owned hotels are outsourced to private individuals;
        observations indicate that the state corporations outsource the more marginal facilities
        and manage the more viable ones.
   •	   Monasteries: The various country monasteries mainly provide accommodation to their
        own nationals. However, many monasteries also take in tourists and nationals of other
        countries. While they are not allowed to charge specific rates, guests are expected to
        make a donation in return.




                                                                  Investing in The Buddhist Circuit   | 57
                         While there is ample budget and tourist class accommodation on the
                         Circuit there are no 4 and/or 5-star hotels. Attracting higher-spending
                         pilgrims and non-pilgrims will require improving hotel standards and
                         stimulation measures should be considered.
                         Seasonality heavily impacts the feasibility of hotel development. Every
                         effort should be made to stretch the visitor season by, for instance,
                         improving infrastructure and facilities, staging events and conferences,
                         and conducting special promotions.
                         Limited land availability limits accommodation expansion. Suitable land
                         parcels should be acquired for development of tourist hubs/parks in line
                         with the twelfth 5-year plan.
                         Government hospitality facilities are often well located but are of a limited
                         standard. An audit should be conducted of government land and hotels to
                         identify opportunities for leveraging these resources for tourism growth.
                         Many monasteries act as pilgrim accommodation facilities and because
                         they are regarded as charities, are exempt from taxes and duties. Study
                         is required on the contribution of monasteries to local economies and to
                         identify further opportunities for economic linkages.

Activities and amenities
In order to leverage the potential of tourism as a driver of economic growth and job creation,
activities along the Buddhist Circuit need to be improved and amenities need to be upgraded.
Some of the more urgent issues are:

    •	   Difficult road conditions for long driving distances when visiting multiple sites.
    •	   Seasonal tourist patterns, dictated by extreme weather conditions during shoulder and
         down seasons.
    •	   Sites are “islands” in Hindu and Muslim majority areas, with limited contact between
         locals and visitors.
    •	   The Circuit’s attractions are derived more from history and spiritual engagement than
         from tangible and impressive architecture, construction, or physical evidence.


            The Circuit’s wider success will depend on providing wayside amenities,
            visitor comfort facilities (shading, seating, and drinking water),
            opportunities to interact with local people and lifestyles, and interesting
            interpretation and storytelling.




Wayside amenities
With pilgrims and tour groups traveling long distances over difficult road conditions, comfortable
and clean stop-over restrooms are critical to make the trips comfortable and enjoyable. Figures 7
and 8 indicate major wayside needs and opportunities.

Uttar Pradesh (See black triangles in figure 10)
    •	   Between Gaya and Varanasi: Restrooms are in poor condition. At least one new facility
         needed between Bodhgaya and Varanasi.
    •	   Between Kushinagar and Shravasti, a 250 km (6 hours) journey: No wayside facilities.
    •	   Between Shravasti and Lucknow, 165 km (5 hours): No wayside facilities.
    •	   Between Lucknow and Sankisa (where Sri Lankan tourists usually go), 250 km (6 hours):
         No wayside facilities.
    •	   From Varanasi to Shravasti and Varanasi to Gorakhpur: Wayside amenities needed
         urgently.
    •	   On all the other important routes barring Kushinagar to Lumbini, Gaya to Varanasi,
         Kushinagar to Varanasi, Lucknow to Varanasi, and Shravasti to Varanasi: Wayside
         amenities exist but need to be upgraded or new ones need to be added.

                                 Appropriate wayside amenities are urgently required at suitable points.	
                                 The following locations are priorities:

                                 development of facilities in association with major petroleum companies
                                 could provide opportunities for public-private partnerships.

          Site amenities and facilities
          Providing suitable visitor facilities at and around the Buddhist sites is important to ensure a
          pleasant and peaceful experience in tune with the context of the Circuit. The following important
          amenities and facilities require improvement:


             Amenities                                              Issues
          Clean public         Restrooms are generally available at Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)
          restrooms            sites; however maintenance and operations need improvement. Facilities in
                               urban areas around sites such as Bodhgaya, Sarnath, Nalanda, Vaishali, and
                               Kushinagar are inadequate and require significant improvement.

          Shade, seating, and While there is some shade and seating at most sites, it is inadequate. These
          landscaping         need to be planned and executed in an aesthetically pleasing manner and
                              should allow visitors to spend quality time and to meditate. Open spaces and
                              parks around sites such as the Mahabodhi temple in Bodhgaya and the deer
                              park and zoo area in Sarnath need to be landscaped and planned to provide
                              peaceful visitor experiences.

          Walk spaces and      Pedestrian spaces such as sidewalks and pedestrian trails are inadequate
          lighting             in most locations and haphazard traffic and pollution are growing threats.
                               Bodhgaya and Sarnath have major roads running through the site areas and
                               pilgrims walking to the temples and stupas have to dodge heavy traffic.
                               Various landowners such as the ASI, forest department, temple management
                               committees, and local bodies have fenced their sites, limiting pedestrian
                               movement.

          Shopping and         Apart from local hawkers selling Buddhist paraphernalia and street food,
          restaurants          shopping is limited. There is also a lack of quality restaurants and coffee
                               shops. Attempts to move local hawkers to alternative spaces outside of the
                               core site areas have failed in Bodhgaya. It may be more prudent to improve
                               facilities close to the sites. In addition, entertainment can add variety to visitor
                               programs and will require suitable spaces with seating.

          Visitor activities   Activities on the Circuit are limited to visiting Buddhist temples and stupas.
                               Opportunities to experience local lifestyles, engage in health and wellness
                               activities, and undertake broader cultural tours are limited. Features such as
                               the Rajgir ropeway, the caves, hot springs, and walking trails require further
                               improvement and could attract non-Buddhist visitors, pilgrims wanting to
                               spend more time at specific destinations, and local recreational visitors.

          Interpretation       While pilgrims are generally well acquainted with the significance and history
                               of the Circuit, they may be unaware of the broader history, events, and
                               circumstances around the Ganges basin. Non-Buddhists need interpretation
                               and storytelling to derive optimal value and understanding of historical
                               significance. Existing ASI museums provide interesting displays of relics. The
                               rich heritage of the Ganges basin and the life and travels of the Buddha
                               should be told and displayed more creatively if more tourist are to be
                               attracted.




62 |   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit
                         Buddhist sites on the Circuit are limited in size but patronized by large
                         numbers of pilgrims and tourists during the season. Many sites are
                         located within fast-growing urban populations. Creative urban design
                         and planning is needed to retain their character and peacefulness
                         in accordance with Buddhist practices. Pedestrianizing the sites and
                         surroundings, providing adequate seating and shade, landscaping, and
                         ensuring adequate sanitation are some aspects that require attention
                         at most sites. A detailed audit of individual sites will help identify exact
                         problems and specific improvements.

                         Related activities like shopping, eating, village tours, general health and
                         wellness experiences, and trails and ropeways are limited. These could
                         be developed to make the Circuit more attractive and stimulate local job
                         creation, economic activity, and entrepreneurship.

                         While museums on the Circuit contain impressive examples of Buddhist
                         relics and art, interpretation of the Ganges heritage and the journeys of
                         the Buddha and his followers is limited. Creativity here could add major
                         value to the Circuit for both Buddhist and non-Buddhist travelers and
                         increase the overall length of tourist stays.

          Industry competitiveness
          Overall industry structure
               •	    The tourism industry on the Buddhist Circuit has built up a solid foundation that
                     can now be leveraged for expansion. However, there are barriers for the entry and
                     expansion of new businesses.
               •	    A majority of visitors are budget-conscious pilgrims travelling in groups on tightly
                     packaged itineraries. This requires substantial accommodation and transport capacities
                     at affordable rates. As a result, accommodation is concentrated in monasteries and
                     budget hotels.
               •	    A limited number of ground handling operators results in most of the travel
                     arrangements and services being vertically integrated and provided by a single supplier.
                     As a result, most spending is concentrated within a limited number of operators.
               •	    New entrants find it difficult to enter the market due to well-established relationships
                     and distribution channels and scarcity of land.
               •	    A majority of packaged itineraries allow for only one night or a maximum of two
                     nights per destination. This limits opportunities other than site visits and prayers.

    •	   Transport and visitor facilities are not geared toward independent travelers and special
         interest market segments.
    •	   Different government agencies such as state tourism departments, tourism development
         corporations, ASI, and forest departments typically manage sites. Joint planning and
         coordinated development is limited and, as a result, visitor access and movement is fairly
         fragmented.


            Pilgrimage agencies in association with local tour operators and suppliers
            have laid a solid foundation for tourism expansion on the Circuit. The
            market has been captured by a limited number of players. Rapid tourism
            growth beyond current demand and capacity will require expansion of
            current operations, entry by a greater variety of players, growth in leisure
            and independent travel segments, and creative investment by local and
            international entrepreneurs.

            There is a need for greater collaboration and coordination among public

Investment and business environment
Rationalizing the tax system for Buddhist Circuit tourism
A favorable business environment that supports the tourism industry attracts investments to
the sector, spurs growth, and has positive impact on poverty reduction. According to surveys
in several economies, most tourism operators consider taxes (both in terms of high rates and
compliance costs) as substantial obstacles to business and investment. Streamlining the tax
regime can stimulate growth by reducing costs for businesses to start up and operate in the
sector.


Taxation
The tourism sector can be taxed, either by taxing businesses or tourists directly. Through the
general tax system, profits and sales can be taxed. Through special taxes imposed on “tourist”
activities, particularly entry and exit taxes and taxes on hotels the visitors can also be taxed. In
most developing countries, the important taxes on tourism are taxes on hotel services, whether
levied as part of a general sales tax or as special “excise” taxes.

In principle, the tourism industry should be taxed like any other. The case for any exemption from
income tax is extremely weak, with the caveat that there should be no bias against the tourism
industry. The same applies to the employed and self-employed work force in the industry. A
few countries have addressed issues relating to market failures and other investment climate
constraints by introducing special fiscal incentives for tourism. These include tax holidays,
accelerated depreciation on buildings, initial capital allowances, and exemptions of customs




                                                                   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit   | 65
          duties. These incentives raise returns and offset actual or perceived differences in the cost of
          doing business and investing in a location.[6]

          In India, the Income Tax Act allows special deductions and concessions to the tourism industry
          in general. These include:
          i.	 Capital expenditure for hotels of two stars and above: immediate full deduction of capital
              expenditure (except expenditure on land, goodwill, and securities), where operations
              commenced after April 1, 2010.
          ii.	 Five-year profits and gains deduction for hotels and convention centers that commenced
               construction or operation between April 1, 2008 and March 31, 2013.
          iii.	 Ten-year tax holiday for infrastructure including roads, rail, and utilities required for tourism.
          iv.	 Accelerated depreciation for hotel buildings at 15 percent as against the general rate of
               10 percent.

          These benefits are available for Buddhist Circuit tourism. However, the efficacy of these
          incentives is yet to be evaluated so it would be inappropriate to make further recommendations.

          Countries with general sales taxes, particularly value-added taxes, extend these taxes to hotel
          accommodation and other tourist activities, sometimes at reduced rates due to competitive
          reasons. In developing countries, however, as a rule only a limited range of services are subject
          to so-called ‘general’ sales taxes. Instead, special taxes are applied to services provided by tourist
          hotels, such as hotel accommodation, rental cars, entertainment, and restaurants. Since they
          approximate to the general level of sales tax/VAT they do not, in substance, constitute industry-
          specific taxation. Because tourism development is an integral part of anti-poverty strategies,
          VAT or other indirect taxation should not be relatively higher so as to impede growth. Further, in
          the context of VAT-type indirect tax regime, the cascading effect of multiple taxes on the hotel
          industry in particular should be totally eliminated.

          The most significant tax on tourism is, invariably, that on accommodation (and related catering).
          Hotel accommodation in India is subject to luxury tax by the states at rates ranging from
          4 to 20 percent. The levy is imposed on printed tariffs to prevent mis-declaration of actual
          tariffs. Since actual tariffs in lean seasons are substantially lower than printed tariffs, effective
          tax rates increase up to 30 percent. Further, disparity in rates of luxury taxes across states adds
          to dissatisfaction of tourists and compliance costs by tour operators.

          Under the Bihar Taxation on Luxuries Act, 1988, and the Uttar Pradesh Taxation and Land
          Revenue Laws Act, 1975, both Bihar and UP impose taxes on luxuries that cover various goods
          and services regarded as non-essential, including hotels. In Bihar, hotel accommodation, being
          a service, is liable to luxury tax but exempt from VAT. Luxury tax is 5 percent if the room tariff
          is more than Indian rupees 500 ($8) but does not exceed Indian rupees 1000 ($16). However,
          if the tariff is more than Indian rupees 1000 ($16), the rate is 10 percent. Consequently, the
          hotelier cannot claim any input tax credit of state-VAT on inputs used (including capital goods).
          This increases the cost of providing hotel services. It is recommended that full input tax credit for

          [6]	 For example, Mauritius successfully managed to attract tourism investment by offering incentives in the 1980s and removed
               them once the sector gained momentum. Today, low tax rates are evenly applied across all sectors.



66 |   Investing in The Buddhist Circuit
                   state-VAT should be allowed against luxury tax. Further, the threshold tariff should be increased
                   to Indian rupees 1000 ($16) so as to align with service tax. Similar changes need to be carried
                   out in Uttar Pradesh.

                   In addition, the central government levies service tax at the rate of 12 percent on room tariff if it
                   exceeds Indian rupees 1000 ($16). A taxpayer has the choice of either claiming input tax credit
                   on actual basis or on the basis of abatement of 40 percent of tariff value. In the hotel industry,
                   a major component of expenditure relates to civil works for construction of the hotel. No input
                   tax credit is allowed for tax paid on civil works. Consequently, the embedded input taxes become
                   a cost for the hotel investor. This increases the cost of constructing a hotel by at least 5 percent,
                   which in turn implies higher borrowing costs. It is recommended that full input tax credit of civil
                   works should be allowed on actual basis in lieu of abatement.

                   Many popular tourist circuits require inter-state movement. Tourist coaches/cars traveling
                   inter-state circuits are liable to road and passenger taxes. While moving between states, tourist
                   vehicles pay road and passenger taxes that vary across states. Such levies are often a significant
                   part of the cost of tour packages.[7] The absence of a centralized tax payment facility leads to
                   collection of taxes at each entry/state border. This leads to harassment, undue delay in travel,
                   dissatisfaction among tourists, and encourages rent-seeking behavior. These taxes should be
                   abolished in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.




Mahabodhi temple Bodh Gaya, India

                   [7]	 According to estimates made by the Indian Tourist Transport Association (ITTA), the total road and passenger tax paid accounts for
                        23 percent of the cost of a three-day package for the Delhi-Agra-Jaipur Circuit.



                                                                                                               Investing in The Buddhist Circuit             | 67
          Air travel in India is subject to the multiple levies including tax on air turbine fuel (ATF)
          (ranging from 20 to 38 percent across states), which undermines the competitiveness of Indian
          destinations. Some of these levies are in the nature of user charges and need to be continued.
          However those in the nature of taxes are cascading in nature and substantially increase the
          incidence of tax. Further, there is lack of transparency in collection of these taxes because they
          vary across airlines. This leads to dissatisfaction among the customers. It is recommended that
          the rates of ATF may be reduced to the general VAT rate to improve air connectivity.

          The package of measures recommended above is consistent with the goods and services tax
          (GST) regime under discussion between the center and the states. If implemented, it would
          significantly reduce the cost of setting up and operating hotels in Bihar and UP, and improve
          the competitiveness of the sector in these states. Further, it would also provide inducement to
          airlines to operate more flights to these states, improving connectivity.


          Investment conditions
          Overall policies relevant to tourism investment are set at both central and state levels.

                •	    Investment policies: The India Investment and Privatisation Policy and the Consolidated
                      Foreign Direct Investment Policy allow 100 percent foreign investment in hotels and
                      tourism. An on-going general policy allows disinvestment in central public state
                      enterprises, including hotel and tourism enterprises.[8] Under the Bihar Industrial
                      Incentive Policy – 2011, tourism is included as an industry where development is to

            be encouraged with the full range of incentives available for all priority industries. The
            Uttar Pradesh Industrial and Service Sector Investment Policy – 2012[9] targets transport
            infrastructure, micro, and small enterprises in the handicraft sector, and disinvestment
            and privatisation of state-owned hotels and guesthouses.[10]
      •	    Foreign direct investment (FDI) is allowed through a range of channels including investing
            in Indian companies, share investment, equity in partnerships, and venture capital funds.
            Government approval is required in restricted sectors and circumstances through the Foreign
            Investment Promotion Board, which provides a single window clearance for ministerial
            or cabinet approval, depending on the size of investment and other circumstances
            (the government route). Where there are no restrictions, government approval is
            not required (the automatic route). Sectors where there are no restrictions and up to
            100 percent FDI is allowed include construction, which expressly includes hotels, resorts,
            and recreational facilities, subject to special conditions. In other sectors where no specific
            restrictions have been set, FDI is permitted up to 10 percent subject only to applicable
            laws/regulations, security, and other conditions. This covers tourism. Generally, proceeds
            of sale of shares and securities can be remitted; dividends and interest can be freely
            repatriated after taxes.
      •	    The general tax incentives relevant to tourist investment have been discussed above.
      •	    Tourism parks: The ministry of tourism has developed a strategy for the twelfth five-year
            plan to promote investment in tourism parks to increase the duration of tourist stays.
            Key features include:
             ––     Tourism parks should be developed adjacent to existing, developing or
                    underdeveloped destinations with high potential.
             ––     Minimum area to be developed is 50 acres. The land will be provided by the state
                    governments or private sector.
             ––     Ministry of tourism will set up a core committee on tourism parks, with
                    representatives of ministries and various stakeholders.
             ––     State government to develop external road infrastructure.
             ––     Internal infrastructure will include site development, internal roads, water supply,
                    sewerage, drainage, street lighting, landscaping, power distribution, common
                    sewage treatment plants, and common solid waste management facilities.
             ––     Development, operation ,and maintenance of internal distribution infrastructure
                    will be ensured for a period of 20 to 25 years through a special purpose vehicle.
             ––     Commercial tourism activities within the tourism park will be left to private
                    entrepreneurs.
             ––     Commercial tourism activities within the park can include budget hotels, resorts,
                    convention centers, mini golf courses, retail spaces, food plazas, entertainment,
                    and amusement.

                       ––     A single window clearance mechanism can be set up at state and central
                              levels to expedite clearances of tourism park investment.


          Public Private Partnerships[11]
                •	    The government of India has developed a detailed National Public Private
                      Partnership (PPP) policy, the preamble of which reads:
                              “Government of India is committed to improving the level and the quality of
                              economic and social infrastructure services across the country. In pursuance
                              of this goal, the Government envisages a substantive role for Public Private
                              Partnership (PPPs) as a means for harnessing private sector investment and
                              operational efficiencies in the provision of public assets and services.”

                •	    While tourism is not mentioned in the policy, the passenger road and rail
                      infrastructure proposals are relevant to tourism investment.

                •	    A recently published government of India Task Force Report[12] has strongly
                      endorsed the PPP model as a better means to finance, maintain, and develop
                      airports, aeronautical services, and complementary facilities. The task force noted
                      and endorsed the PPP proposal to develop the greenfield Kushinagar airport.[13]
                      It also recommended that 15 operational non-metro airports, including Gaya,
                      be privatized through PPP concession arrangements in phase 1 (2012-2014) and
                      Varanasi in phase II (2014-2016).



          Institutional arrangements
          Although tourism authorities of India, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Nepal are all engaged in
          initiatives to promote and develop the Buddhist Circuit, these attempts are uncoordinated
          and not based on an integrated strategy.

          A dedicated and impartial institutional capacity and financial allocation is needed to
          coordinate and drive implementation of an integrated strategy across states and countries.
          This capacity should be agreed upon by various parties and established as soon as possible
          since the successful implementation of the Buddhist Circuit strategy will depend on this.


                            Public, private, and community stakeholder cooperation and
                            coordination is important for the success of a common strategy,
                            establishing of a Buddhist Circuit stakeholder forum, and common
                            brand identity.
