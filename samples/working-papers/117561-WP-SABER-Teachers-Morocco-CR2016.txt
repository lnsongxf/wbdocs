    1. Setting Clear Expectations for Teachers
       Clear expectations exist for what students should learn and what teachers are
       supposed to do. Yet teachers’ official duties do not explicitly include any non-
       teaching tasks related to instructional improvement that occur outside the
       classroom.

    2. Attracting the Best into Teaching
       Additional policies to motivate the best candidates to apply and enroll in Teacher
       Certification Centers could be beneficial.

    3. Preparing Teachers with Useful Training and Experience
       Although Teacher Certification Programs have been restructured and include
       internships and one year of classroom experience prior to becoming a certified
       teacher, they may not be sufficiently effective in providing prospective teachers
       with the necessary skills to succeed.

    4. Matching Teachers’ Skills with Students’ Needs
       Official systems are in place to identify critical shortage subjects, though they
       should be strengthened to address teacher shortages in those subjects and to
       motivate effective teachers to teach in hard-to-staff schools.

    5. Leading Teachers with Strong Principals
       Despite improvements in training, principals are still not expected to monitor
       teacher performance or to support teachers in improving their instructional
       practice.

    6. Monitoring Teaching and Learning
       Teachers are trained to assess student achievement, and systems are in place to
       assess student learning, but these systems do not appear to be informing
       teaching at the classroom level.

    7. Supporting Teachers to Improve Instruction
       Although a coaching system is being developed, teachers are not assigned to
       receive in-service teacher training based on perceived needs and teachers are
       not required to engage in professional development activities.

    8. Motivating Teachers to Perform
        Promotion opportunities are partially linked to teacher performance, but
        mechanisms to hold teachers accountable could be strengthened. Teacher
        compensation is not linked to performance.

identify the strengths and weaknesses of the teacher

areas for improvement. For a more detailed report on

Teachers is on policy design, rather than policy
implementation. SABER–Teachers analyzes the teacher
policies formally adopted by education systems.
However, policies on the ground, that is, as they are
actually implemented, may differ quite substantially
from policies as originally designed. In fact, they often
do differ, due to such factors as the political economy of
the reform process; lack of capacity of organizations in
charge to implement the policies; or the interaction
between these policies and specific contextual factors.
Since SABER–Teachers collects limited data on policy
implementation, the assessment of teacher policies
presented in this report needs to be complemented with
detailed information that describes the actual
configuration of teacher policies on the ground.

classifies how education systems perform on each of the
eight teacher policy goals, using a four-category scale
(latent, emerging, established, and advanced) The
ratings describe the extent to which a given education
system has in place teacher policies that are known to be
associated with improved student outcomes.

This four-tiered rating system represents a continuum,
ranging from systems with more comprehensive,
developed policies that are oriented toward learning to
systems with no policies at all (or, in some cases, policies
that are detrimental from the perspective of encouraging
learning). SABER–Teacher ratings can be defined in the
following manner:

       Advanced—Systems are rated as being
        “advanced” on a particular policy goal when they
        have multiple policies conducive to learning in
        place under each of the policy levers used to
        define that policy goal.

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
       systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
       associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
       teachers, and parents to policymakers and business people—an
       accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of teacher
       policies.
