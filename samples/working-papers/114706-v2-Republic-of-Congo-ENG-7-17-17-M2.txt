xii   Republic of Congo – Poverty Assessment Report
                                                   Executive Summary




T      his poverty assessment analyzes recent trends in monetary and nonmonetary aspects of
       poverty and economic vulnerability in the Republic of Congo (ROC), based on two nation-
       ally representative and broadly comparable household expenditure surveys conducted by
the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) in 2005 and 2011. The study determines the drivers of
poverty reduction by systematically looking at demographic, labor, and human capital dimen-
sions. The report also discusses cross-cutting issues relevant for poverty reduction, such as service
delivery, marginalization of autochthons, and others. This study aims to provide policy makers
with the knowledge needed to improve the effectiveness of their programs to reduce and finally
eradicate extreme poverty in the Republic of Congo.3


Between 2005 and 2011, the Republic of Congo experienced
a strong macroeconomic performance that was driven by oil
revenues

The country’s history has been characterized by ups and downs related to the performance
of the oil sector, changes from communism to market economy, civil war, and social unrest.
Since the 1960s, the country has experienced four economic phases: 1960–1972; 1973–1984;
1985–1999; and 2000–2014. These periods correspond, respectively, to the pre-oil economy; the
first oil boom; the oil price crisis; and the second oil boom (World Bank 2016a). The country
also experienced social unrest with a military coup and civil war. The various governments, also in
line with the cold war, have moved back and forth from communism towards a market economy.
All these affected the economy and people’s perceptions, especially toward the importance of the
state as the main job provider.
       Dutch disease followed the discovery of oil. In the 1960s, the economy was diversified,
but with the discovery of oil followed the reduction of the relative importance of other sectors.
Most importantly, the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors shrank due to reduced competi-
tiveness. As a consequence, the country imports most of its goods, even food.

 Economic growth, economic diversification job creation and poverty reduction are at the core of the National De-
velopment plan (Republic of Congo 2012a, 2012b).

       poverty and economic vulnerability in Republic of Congo (ROC), based on two nation-
       ally representative and broadly comparable household expenditure surveys conducted by
the NIS in 2005 and 2011. The study determines the drivers of poverty reduction by systemati-
cally looking at demographic, labor, and human capital dimensions. The report also discusses
cross-cutting issues relevant for poverty reduction, such as service delivery, marginalization of
autochthons, and others. This study aims to provide policy makers with the knowledge needed
to improve the effectiveness of their programs to reduce and finally eradicate extreme poverty in
the Republic of Congo.


History has been marked by political instability and
dependency on the oil sector

The country’s history has been characterized by ups and downs related to the performance
of the oil sector, changes from communism to market economy, civil war, and social unrest.
Since the 1960s, the country has experienced four economic phases: 1960–1972; 1973–1984;
1985–1999; and 2000–2014. These periods correspond, respectively, to the pre-oil economy; the
first oil boom; the oil price crisis; and the second oil boom (World Bank 2016). The country also
experienced social unrest with a military coup and civil war. The various governments, also in
line with the cold war, have moved back and forth from communism toward a market economy.
All these affected the economy and people’s perceptions, especially toward the importance of the
state as the main job provider.
       Dutch disease followed the discovery of oil. In the 1960s, the economy was diversified,
but with the discovery of oil followed the reduction of the relative importance of other sectors
(Figure 1). Most importantly, the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors shrank due to reduced
competitiveness. As a consequence, the country imports most of its goods, even food.
       The Republic of Congo experienced strong economic growth between 2002 and 2015.
This strong economic growth was driven by higher oil prices and political stability. On average,
during this period, the Republic of Congo’s growth rate stood at 4.5 percent (Figure 2). Between
2005 and 2011, the country grew strongly at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent mainly driven
by high oil revenues from oil production and the decision of the Government to step up its invest-
ment in infrastructure in 2006.

T       his poverty assessment analyzes trends in monetary and nonmonetary aspects of poverty and
        economic vulnerability in Republic of Congo (ROC), based on two nationally representative
        and comparable household expenditure surveys conducted by the NIS in 2005 and 2011.
The study determines the drivers of poverty reduction by systematically looking at demographic,
labor, and human capital dimensions. The report also discusses cross-cutting issues relevant for
poverty reduction, such as service delivery, marginalization of autochthons, and others. This study
aims to provide policy makers with the knowledge needed to improve the effectiveness of their
programs to reduce and finally eradicate extreme poverty in the Republic of Congo.
        This report examines the Republic of Congo’s progress in reducing poverty over the last decade,
with a specific focus on the period 2005 to 2011. The focus on this period is due to data avail-
ability. The Republic of Congo’s progress in reducing poverty from 2005 and 2011 is substantial.
Still, empirical evidence to sustain this claim is limited. Annual reductions in the national poverty
rate of 1.5 percentage points resulted from strong growth driven by oil prices and investments
in services and infrastructures, especially in the two metropolises (Brazzaville and Pointe Noire).
        The Republic of Congo is one of the most urbanized countries in the world. This has many
implications on issues related to shared prosperity and poverty. Latest estimates suggest that 61.8
percent of the population live in urban areas, with a bigger concentration in the two metropolises
(Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). A concentration in urban areas makes it easier to provide public
service to the population. At the same time, there is a risk that those living rural areas will be left
out. This is exactly what is happening in the Republic of Congo. Between 2005 and 2011, all the
poverty indices increased in rural areas.
        Unfortunately, data collection effort has been low in the Republic of Congo and as a con-
sequence, the country has only two household consumption surveys: the 2005 and 2011 ECOM
surveys. The core analysis undertaken in this report uses two series of surveys: (a) The ECOM
undertaken in 2005 and 2011 and (b) the DHS undertaken in 2005 and 2011/2 (henceforth
referred to as 2005 and 2012). All these surveys are a nationally representative cross section and it
is from this series that the official monetary poverty and other MDGs estimates are derived. Data
from the WDI are also used to assess the country’s performance compared to its peers.
        Despite lack of availability of recent data, the exercise of conducting this poverty assess-

1.1 Introduction

The Republic of Congo (ROC) experienced strong macroeconomic performance between
2002 and 2015. Between 2002 and 2015, the Republic of Congo’s economy grew at an average
rate of 4.5 percent per year. During the sub-period 2005–2011, the country was among the top
performers in Africa with an average annual growth rate of 5.4 percent.
      The strong growth performance was accompanied by substantial improvements in
living standards. For instance, under-five mortality rate dropped by two-thirds between 2005
and 2011. A notable improvement was also registered in many other dimensions of well-being,
including primary school enrollment and completion, access to improved water, access to
electricity, and so on. Monetary poverty headcount followed the general trend, with the share
of population living below the national poverty line dropping from 50.7 percent in 2005 to
40.9 percent in 2011.
      This chapter will use several sources of data to paint a detailed picture of the evolution
of poverty and household living standards in the Republic of Congo, with a focus on the
period for which household surveys are available, that is between 2005 and 2011. The chapter
has seven parts. In the first part, we will revisit the country context. In the second part, we will
offer a rationale for updating the poverty and inequality figures. In the third part, we will offer a
detailed description of the evolution of poverty using data from the only two available surveys.
The fourth part will present a detailed description of the evolution of inequalities. Shared pros-
perity will be discussed in the fifth part. Trend in nonmonetary dimensions of well-being will be
presented in the sixth part. The last part will rely on microsimulations to illustrate the challenging
path the country will have to follow to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.


1.2 Country context

The country’s history has been characterized by ups and downs related to the performance
of the oil sector, changes from communism to market economy, civil war, and social unrest.
Since the 1960s, the country has experienced four economic phases: 1960–1972; 1973–1984;
1985–1999; 2000–2014. These periods correspond, respectively, to the pre-oil economy; first oil

2.1 Introduction

Despite the substantial poverty reduction described in Chapter 1, many challenges remain,
including poverty pockets in the main cities, a growing urban-rural dichotomy, and vul-
nerability. At the national level, poverty indices went down substantially, but this performance
was concentrated in Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. Monetary poverty increases in rural areas and
poverty pockets in big cities remain. Moreover, some groups of the population are lagging behind.
These include autochthons, youth, elderly, women, and disabled.
      This chapter will illustrate some of the apparent drawbacks of the current trend in pov-
erty reduction. The chapter has five parts. In the first part, we will analyze the growing urban/
rural dichotomy. The second part describes migration flow and possible implications for welfare.
In the third part, we will look at the pockets of poverty in the two main cities. In the fourth part,
we will describe the vulnerability from a monetary poverty point of view. The last part will look
at vulnerable socioeconomic groups.


2.2 A growing urban-rural dichotomy

As pointed out in the previous chapter, poverty is becoming an increasingly rural phenom-
enon, and this should be a much larger reason for concern. Most of the poverty reduction
was observed in the two largest cities of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. What was most worrisome
was an increase in poverty headcount as well as in the number of poor people in rural areas. In
rural areas, the poverty headcount went up by 4.6 percentage points from 64.8 in 2005 to 69.4
in 2011. In rural areas, the depth and severity of poverty has also increased, that is, the rural
poor have become poorer. Between 2005 and 2011, the number of poor in rural areas increased
to 951,000 up from 795,000.
       The story that emerges from these estimates is that of a dual economy. As it will be
illustrated in Chapter 4, difference across the main cities, the remaining urban areas, and the
rural areas account for a big part of the overall inequality. Over time, rural areas account for a
lower share of the population but a larger share of the poor. Figure 2.1 shows the distribution
of the population by ventile of welfare and location (each ventile accounts for 5 percent of the

3.1 Introduction

The two previous chapters summarized the poverty and inequality dynamics between 2005
and 2011. The country experienced a substantial reduction in poverty, but growing inequality and
dichotomy between urban and rural areas are of concern. More alarming is the fact that poverty
indices are on the rise in rural areas.
       This chapter will focus on providing a detailed profile of the poor in terms of a range
of sociodemographic characteristics. We are interested in the most recently available charac-
teristics of the poor. Therefore, this chapter will focus on data from the 2011 ECOM survey to
derive the poverty profile. At times, the 2005 ECOM survey will be used to provide trends of
key changes over time.
       This chapter focuses on the univariate profile of poverty in the Republic of Congo. A
(univariate) poverty profile is a set of tables giving the probability of being poor or other measures
of poverty according to various household characteristics, such as the geographic area in which a
household lives or the level of education of the household head. In addition to measuring poverty
by household characteristics, it is also useful to assess the correlates of poverty using regression
techniques. This multivariate analysis will be done in the next chapter on determinants and driv-
ers of poverty reduction.
       This chapter has six parts. In the first part, we will revisit the relationship between poverty
and location in the Republic of Congo. The second part analyzes the link between demographic
characteristics (disability, gender, ethnicity, and age). The third part looks at the relationship
between household size—including household composition—and poverty. The fourth part dis-
cusses education characteristics along the welfare distribution. The fifth part analyzes the relation-
ship between poverty and the sector of activity. The last part will look at housing characteristics
and assets ownership along welfare distribution.

Poverty has a strong regional dimension. As mentioned in Chapters 1 and 2, there are
large differences in poverty by location. There was a much lower and more rapidly decreasing

 Box 3.2: Ethnicity and poverty: The case of the autochthons (Pygmies)
 The Pygmies are considered to be among the oldest inhabitants in Central Africa. Their seminomadic lifestyle has remained largely
 unchanged for thousands of years, living by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild fruits and nuts. In the last two or three decades, however,
 under the influence of multiple factors, these populations have gone through a process of semi-sedentarization. Traditionally, the Pygmies
 in Central Africa were closely attached to the rain forest. They were the “Forest People” (Turnbull 1961) and the forest was the source
 of their religion, their livelihood, and their protection. They used to lead a nomadic life in camps of 30 to 40 families, which maintained
 regular links and exchanges with each other. Their mostly egalitarian and horizontal society acknowledged the wisdom of elders who
 preserved the community’s knowledge of the sites, plants, animals, ghosts, and spirits as well as their entire cultural heritage (rituals,
 music, dances, holy sites) and practices (pharmacopeia, hunting, and fishing). Elders occupied prominent positions within the community
 and settled disputes. They lived in simple huts made out of leaves and branches. This traditional lifestyle should not necessarily be
 equated with a life of poverty. It had its own dignity, noblesse, and coherence and it is part of the universal heritage of humanity. Yet
 today, the traditional Pygmy lifestyle is in danger: as a population, they are losing what constitutes their identity and the richness of their
 culture and knowledge due to gradual sedentarization. Their access to the forest as well as to land for cultivation is increasingly at risk.
     Estimates by Wodon et al. (2012) for the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and Gabon suggest that Pygmy
 populations tend to be very poor. Many children are not enrolled in schools and adult literacy is low. Health outcomes are weak and
 vulnerability is high. In addition, qualitative data from the Democratic Republic of Congo suggest that many among the Pygmies perceive
 themselves negatively, in part because aspects of their culture (type of housing, religious beliefs, rites, and practices) are considered
 “bad” by their Bantu neighbors. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Bantu and state institutions may not treat the Pygmies in
 a fair manner that would allow them to make informed changes and adaptations to improve their general living conditions and live in
 harmony with their neighbors while preserving their own culture (World Bank 2009). In the Republic of Congo, the ECOM 2005 survey
 did not identify Bantus and Pygmies separately, but the 2011 ECOM survey did. The results suggested patterns of disadvantage among
 Pygmy populations similar to those observed in other Central African countries.

4.1 Introduction

The objective of this chapter is to use several methods, including econometric analysis and
standard decomposition methods, to quantify the contribution of different factors toward
poverty reduction and inequality. The chapter has three parts. The first part will provide evi-
dence of the correlates of poverty using multivariate econometrics models. In the second part
we will take a closer look at some of the factors that have been associated with the reduction in
poverty or associated with poverty increase in the case for rural areas. Based on the findings from
previous chapters, we will focus on three key factors: households’ composition, education, and
the type of occupation. The last part will provide evidence on factors that play a significant role
in explaining inequality.


4.2 Correlates of poverty

The univariate profile of poverty provided in the previous chapter is a useful step but has
some limitations. The previous chapters suggest that a number of household characteristics are
associated with a higher or lower probability for the household to be poor. Providing univariate
profiles of poverty is a useful step to identify the characteristics of the population groups that are
poor, but it is not sufficient to measure the impact at the margin of various household characteristics
on poverty. The limitation with a poverty profile lies in the fact that it provides information on
the probability of being poor according to various household categories, but this cannot be used
to assess the magnitude of the correlates of poverty at the margin, controlling for other variables.
      Multivariate analysis based on regression techniques are a more robust way of assessing
correlates of poverty. For instance, the variation in poverty measures across regions may be due
to regional effects, but it may also be due to differences in household characteristics in various
regions, and these differences in characteristics may have a larger effect on poverty than broader
and specific characteristics of the regions themselves. To sort out the correlates of poverty and
the impact (loosely speaking) at the margin of various variables on the probability of being poor,
regression analysis is needed. When estimating such regressions, it is better to rely on linear regres-
sions for the correlates of consumption per equivalent adult than on categorical regressions for
the poverty status of households. This is because using a probit or logit model for poverty status

 Box 4.1: Growth and inequality decomposition
 Changes in poverty rates can also be decomposed into changes due to economic growth (or mean income) in the absence of changes
 in inequality (or income distribution) and changes in inequality in the absence of growth. Denoting by P(μt , Lt), the poverty measure
 corresponding to a mean income in period t of μt and a Lorenz curve Lt, the decomposition is

                                                                                                    ∆P = [P(µ2, Lr) – P(µi, Lr)] + [P(µr, L2) – P(µr, L1)] + Rr
                                                                                                                            |                     |                       |

    The first component is the change in poverty that would have been observed if the Lorenz curve had remained unchanged, while the
 second component is the change that would have been observed if mean income had not changed. The last component is a residual
 (Datt and Ravallion 1992), but in subsequent decompositions it has been shown that this residual can be avoided.

 Box 4.2: Sectoral decomposition
 Two main decompositions have been used in the literature to analyze changes in poverty over time. The first decomposition deals
 with shifts in poverty between sectors or groups (Ravallion and Huppi 1991). The second decomposition deals with the contribution of
 growth and changes in inequality to changes in poverty (Datt and Ravallion 1992; Kakwani 1997).
     Consider first the sectoral decomposition. Poverty measures of the FGT class are additive. This means that the poverty measure
 for the population as a whole is equal to the weighted sum of poverty measures for population subgroups, with the weights defined by
 the population shares of subgroups. This property makes it feasible to analyze the contribution of population subgroups to changes in
 overall poverty over time. Assume that households or individuals can be classified according to various sectors in the economy. These
 may be industrial sectors, geographic sectors (urban versus rural), or any other sectors that the analyst may suggest. The overall change
 in poverty over time can be decomposed into (a) changes in poverty within specific sectors or intra-sectoral changes, (b) changes in
 poverty due to changes in the population shares of sectors or inter-sectoral changes, and (c) changes due to the possible correlation
 between intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral changes, or interaction effect. Denote by Pit the poverty measure in sector i at time t; there
 are m sectors (i = 1,…, m), with population share ni in sector i and two periods (1 and 2). Then, the overall change in poverty is equal to

80         Republic of Congo – Poverty Assessment Report
Box 5.1: The financial market is almost nonexistent in the Republic of Congo
The only available global data set on financial inclusion—Global Findex—shows that only 16.7 percent of the adult population in the
Republic of Congo own an account at a formal financial institution. This places the Republic of Congo way below the SSA average
(29 percent), as well as far below the lower-middle-income countries average (42 percent). As expected, there is a big gap in financial
inclusion between the bottom 40 percent and the top 60 percent of the population. Only 6 percent of the adult population in the bottom
40 percent has access to a formal financial institution (compared to an average of 24 percent in the top 60). The gap by education level
is also wide, with about 23 percent of those with secondary or higher education banked versus just 10 percent for those with primary
education or lower. Gender differences exist and are quite important as well, about 5 percentage point difference.
    Lack of access to the formal financial market makes it difficult for households to cope with short-term shocks such as illness, loss
of employment, drought/irregular rains, landslides, and so on. It may also be a significant barrier to their ability to invest to build human
and other physical assets or to start and operate a small business. Estimations from the 2011 ECOM survey suggest that the majority
of the population rely on their own savings or on their parents to start and run their economic activity.

6.1 Introduction

Understanding dynamics in access to and quality of basic social services can provide a valu-
able complement to monetary measures of poverty. Access to basic infrastructure services is
paramount for meeting basic needs and improving human capital indicators related to health
and education. Given that it has direct linkages with other dimensions of well-being, access to
improved sources of drinking water and sanitation services is very crucial, particularly for the
poor. A connection to the electricity or piped water network eases access to time-saving technol-
ogy and therefore reduces domestic work, especially for women.
      Education and health are key priorities sectors for the Government of the Republic
of Congo. The development of a wealthier, literate, and healthy society is a fundamental goal of
the Republic of Congo’s NDP 2012–16 and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) 2012–16.
Reaching the education and health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), institutional
strengthening of both education and health systems, and improving the quality of service deliv-
ery in education and health provision are thus key aims of the NDP and PRSP 2012–16. The
Congolese authorities have been developing and implementing policies and programs aimed at
achieving such objectives (World Bank 2014).
      This chapter will use data from the two ECOM surveys, the DHS, and the WDI to
provide a diagnostic of key social sectors in the Republic of Congo. Following Gable, Lofgren,
and Osorio-Rodarte (2015), econometric techniques are used to show that in many aspects, the
country performs below expectations compared to its peers. The chapter has five parts. In the first
part, we will offer a diagnostic of the education sector. The second part analyzes the health sector,
including nutrition. The third part presents the country status in terms of access to electricity.
The fourth part covers access to water and sanitation, with an emphasis on residential network
water. The last part assesses the country performance on roads and ICT.


6.2 Education

The link between education, well-being, and social development is not a new phenomenon.
As shown in previous chapters, education is a strong correlate of poverty in the Republic of Congo.
Those with higher level of education are more likely to access quality jobs. Human capital theory

106   Republic of Congo – Poverty Assessment Report
                                                                             Annexes


Annex 1: Consumption Aggregate

To compute poverty measures, three ingredients are needed (see, for example, Coudouel, Hentschel,
and Wodon 2002). First, one has to choose the relevant indicator of well-being. Second, one has
to select a poverty line—the threshold below which a given household or individual will be clas-
sified as poor. Finally, one has to select a poverty measure for reporting for the population as a
whole or for a population subgroup only. This annex documents choices made for the estimation
of the household-level welfare aggregate as well as some issues of comparability between the two
surveys and whether the issues are major or not.

Changes in Questionnaires

A number of changes in survey questionnaires were made between 2005 and 2011. These changes
make it impossible to estimate household expenditures in exactly the same way in both years. At
the same time, however, these changes are not so severe as to invalidate poverty comparisons over
time based on the two surveys.
       A first change in the questionnaires relates to the frequency of acquisitions of food items. In
2005, the questionnaire had two questions to capture the frequency of purchases. One question
captured the number of times that a household bought a good, while the second question captured
the period considered (daily, weekly, monthly, and so on). In 2011, instead of two questions, the
questionnaire collapsed the two questions into a single one (Figure A1.1).
       Another difference in the questionnaires for the two years relates to the way in which infor-
mation on durable goods was collected. In 2005, the questionnaire included a question on the
number of durable goods owned by the household. In 2011, that question was removed, so it is
not possible to know the number of items owned by the households (see Figure A1.2). This omis-
sion is likely to have a negligible effect on poverty measures for two reasons. Most poor do not
own (many) durable goods. In addition, in 2005, most households who did own durable goods
only owned one item per category (with exceptions for chairs, beds, in some cases air condition-
ers, eyeglass frames, and crutches, but these exceptions are not too significant).
