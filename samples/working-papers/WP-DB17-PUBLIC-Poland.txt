This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      registration. Additional required information should be submitted
      directly to the authorities after the registration. After registration of the

      well as the presence of at least one shareholder and management
      board members with electronic signatures or ePuap profile. Also, the
      electronic system provides for a very simplified template of articles of

      Register for taxes and VAT

      A newly registered business entity will be required to file a new form
      (NIP-8) containing supplementary data with the head of the tax office
      within 21 days after the entity is initially entered in the National Court
      Register, or in the case of changes in the supplementary data within 7
      days of occurrence of the circumstances justifying the change.

      The company must register for VAT by the date when the company
      carries out VAT-covered business activities for the first time. The
4     registration must be submitted with the Tax Office. The company must             7 days       no charge
      provide information on (a) its business name and legal form; (b) the
      REGON (statistical number); (c) start date for its business activities; and
      (d) the address of its registered office.
      If the Company is planning to conduct future foreign trade activities
      within the European Union, the company must register as an EU VAT
      taxpayer. The company must submit that application before
      commencing foreign trade activity within the European Union. However,
      before registering as an EU VAT taxpayer, the company must be
      registered as a regular VAT taxpayer.

        Obtain current geodesic map

        Obtaining a current geodesic map is necessary for preparing a
        building project. According to the Building Code, a building
        project should consist of an architectural project; a major
        planning scheme of the plot; declarations of energy, water and
        sewage, and other suppliers, if applicable; a declaration by the
        administrator of the public road about the possibility of
        connecting the plot to the public road; the results, if applicable,
        of the geological examinations; and a specification of the
        geotechnical conditions of the property.

        One of these documents, the major planning scheme of the plot,
        should be corrected by an expert on a copy of the most recent
        geodetic map. Such a map is collected by the division of the
   1    County Office (Starostwo) or, as in Warsaw and some other cities,          21 days               PLN 2,000
        by the relevant division of the city administration. This map is
        valid for only about 6 months, which explains the need for it to
        be constantly updated. Once obtained, the map need to be
        updated by a private surveyor or by the and approved by the
        local administrative office of surveyors (Municipality of Warsaw).

        In practice majority of companies hire a private surveyor who
        obtains the map from the municipality (or online) and makes the
        necessary corrections on the outdated map. This will cost around
        PLN 2000 which includes administrative fees payable to the
        municipality.

      The opinions, adjustments, and permits mentioned above should
      be acquired by BuildCo or its attorney. In practice, they are
      obtained by the architect who prepares the project.

      The building project should be accompanied by a document
      certifying that the project designer is registered as a building

      application is to be signed and filed by an authorized
      representative, an authorization should also be attached.

      The legally allowed time for making an administrative decision
      granting a building permit is 30 days (Administrative Code,
      General Administrative Regulations, Art. 35.3), but Article 35
      Section 6 of the construction law provides 65 days for resolving
      difficult cases. Even so, the administration frequently reviews a
      case for a few months as it can sometimes requests many new
      documents and an explanation from the applicant and can
      suspend proceeding with the application until these documents
      and explanations are submitted.

      Formally, the time to validate the administrative decision is 14
      days from the date it was delivered to the parties. In practice, the
      investor should expect that other parties, such as neighbors and
      ecological organizations, will appeal against this decision. Appeal
      cases may take a few years.

      Therefore, making an administrative decision can take from 60
      days (legally) to 365 days (in practice), while validation takes
      from 14 days (legally, and with no trouble arising) to 4 years (in
      case of appeals).

      Since February 1, 2013, the Mayor’s office must enter the date of
      application and the date the permit was delivered. It is
      electronic and the application can be tracked down.

        Once the design has been approved by RWE, the engineering company

        municipality. For instance, for a 140kVA power connection, an
        underground cable is necessary and in order to lay the cables, the
        engineering company needs to get municipal approval for the external
        connection works.

        Meanwhile, RWE hires a construction company to build the connection in
        the field and construct the connection including excavation and the use

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

 Indicator        Answer                                        Explanation
                                  Under Article 21 of the Law on Bankruptcy and Reorganization, debtor's
                                 management is obligated to file for bankruptcy within 2 weeks of the date
                                   when the debtor becomes insolvent. Although the bankruptcy law has
                               provisions on reorganization, in practice, such proceedings are very rare and
                                  most bankruptcy cases are resolved through liquidation. Once the hotel
Proceeding      liquidation      management commences bankruptcy proceedings, the judge will have to
                               decide whether to proceed with liquidation or with reorganization. The judge
                                        will most likely order the opening of liquidation proceedings.
                               After the reform in January 2016, a few cases have been filed under the new
                                restructuring proceedings, which are likely to become more common in the
                                                                     future.

                                 Because the value of an operating hotel is higher than selling its assets
                              piecemeal, it is most likely that BizBank and Mirage management will agree
Outcome       going concern
                            that it is in both of their best interest for the hotel to continue operating, which
                                                     will enable sale as a going concern.

                               It will take 2-3 weeks for Mirage to prepare the bankruptcy application. After
                              the application is submitted, it will take approximately 2 months for the court
                                   to appoint the judges and for the judges to review the case and issue a
                              declaration of bankruptcy. After the declaration is issued, it must be published
                                 in the official gazette and at least one local newspaper (14 days). After the
                                  announcement is published, it may take up to 2 months to hold the first
                              hearing with all the creditors present. The participants are likely to agree that
                                      the hotel should continue operating and the court will appoint an
                              administrator to supervise the operations (up to 2 months). The creditors will
                                   then submit their claims to the administrator, who will prepare a list of
                              creditors to be approved by the court. This process can take up to 11 months.
 Time (in                      After that, the court will likely decide that the company should be liquidated
                    3.0
years)                         and will appoint a liquidator (up to 4 months). The liquidator must inventory
                                and appraise the assets, which is a lengthy procedure and may take up to a
                               year, because all participants can express opinions on the value of the assets
                                and several appraisers may need to be hired to satisfy the objections of the
                                  debtor and creditors. After all the assets are appraised, the liquidator will
                                organize an auction for the sale of assets. Usually, at least two auctions will
                              take place, because most buyers will wait for the second auction, as the price
                                 at the second auction will be dropped by 30%. That is why this process of
                                 auctioning off the assets may take up to 4 months. BizBank can receive its
                                            portion of the sale proceeds within 30 days of the sale.
                                  The time estimates may change when the new restructuring proceedings
                                                             become more common.

market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
