the oyo state solid waste
management authority
The Oyo State Solid Waste Management Authority
(OYOWMA) is the main regulator of waste man-
agement activities in Ibadan.1 Although OYOWMA
currently operates waste collection and transfer ser-
vices, it is not meant to. With the transfer of waste
collection to the Local Governments in October
2015, OYOWMA is less involved in the waste col-
lection operations, but still removes waste from all
areas immediately along the main federal express-
way that transverses the city, i.e. the toll gate to
Ojoo end of the expressway, and intervenes when
the LGAs are not able to perform their waste col-
lection functions in their jurisdiction. In addition
to this, OYOWMA manages the four dumpsites in
Ibadan. The stated main role of OYOWMA is to set
the rules related to waste management, enforce
them and verify that they are well-respected.




1	 OYOWMA was referred to as Ibadan Waste Manage-
ment Authority (IWMA) between 1998 and 2008.

These costs per ton are not really cost-effective es-
pecially given the low cost of labor in Nigeria, but
are comparable with costs observed in other coun-
tries with similar per capita GDP.

It was noted that due to limited budgets, the public
sector in Ibadan does not have adequate capacity
to handle the increasing amount of solid waste. The
Local Government Councils are financially handi-
capped. It is also noted that the private collectors
are not able to access the finance they need to im-
prove the quality and efficiency of their operations.

Possible areas for improvements were discussed
with the Private Refuse Contractors Association
operating in Ibadan, and according to the Associa-

productivity:


•	 Policy and regulation

    •	 Better cooperation from the population in
       relation to disposing waste properly, storing
       waste for waste collection and paying waste
       management fees;

•	 Equipment, facilities and infrastructure

    •	 Installation of bins in front of the houses to
       improve the packing of the waste and help
       the collection;
    •	 Smaller trucks to access the unplanned ar-
       eas and slums;
    •	 The construction and use of transfer stations
       in close proximity to the collection areas;
    •	 Better maintenance of the dumpsites;

•	 Human resources, skills and competences

    •	 Capacity building and training for the work-
       ers;

•	 Waste management services

    •	 Better waste treatment and recovery of re-
       sources;

•	 Finance

    •	 Improvement of their cash flows;
    •	 Access to loans from the banks.

                                                        services in those areas.

       nates from public areas such as bins posi-
       tioned closely to markets and waste gath-
       ered from public highways. Management of
       this category of waste is usually assigned to
       public waste operators.


       •	 Domestic Operators: Local Govern-
       ment Areas in Lagos State, for the purposes
       of PSP operations are divided into wards.
       Domestic Operators who deal with domes-
       tic waste are therefore usually awarded
       franchises in respect of these wards.


       •	 Commercial Operators: LAWMA out-
       sources management of commercial waste
       to commercial operators. However, pay-
       ments for these services are directly remit-

       a certain percentage (between 20%-40%) as
       a fee and then remit the outstanding bal-
       ance to the PSP operators. The percentage
       deducted by the government varies be-
       tween 20%-40% and depends on a variety
       of factors including the types of facilities
       utilized by the operator, etc.

1.	 	Duration of Contracts
An employee of OGX also confirmed that the dura-
tion of PSP contracts are negotiable. They, however,
stressed the importance of performance which he
highlighted as a key factor in determining the du-
ration of contracts. They specifically mentioned by
way of example, that a contract of 3 (three) years
could be shortened/withdrawn should an operator
fail to perform to a satisfactory standard. The World
Bank team was informed that the contract may be
revised upon complaints by residents in the area
allocated to the PSP operators. Examples of perfor-

        •	 Areas where waste operators face difficulty
           in collecting payment for services rendered,
           the Oyo State Government may provide
           guarantees and subsidize expenses in-
           curred by the operators to ensure that they
           continue to provide waste management ser-

        •	 There are no transfer stations in Ibadan
           which increases the cost for waste trans-
           portation. Oyo State should establish trans-
           fer stations around the metropolitan area
           as they are the most efficient solution to
           quickly improve the current performance.
           The transfer stations would enable the col-
           lection vehicles to remain longer in the col-
           lection areas every day and to reduce the
           risks of damage to the collection vehicles on
           their way to the landfills. Larger and more
           robust waste truck could be used to trans-
           port waste from the transfer stations to the
           landfills;

CONCLUSION
The Oyo State Government recognizes the impor-
tance of legislation as an instrument for ensuring
an effective and integrated waste management
system. However, as stated above, the current laws
on solid waste management are not adequately en-
forced. Therefore, enforcement of existing laws and
regulations is vital to improving solid waste man-
agement and increasing interest and profitability of
private sector participants.

Furthermore, there is room for growth in the area of
solid waste management in Oyo State, for example
the area of waste treatment is virtually unexplored.
Notwithstanding the apparent saturated list of pri-
vate sector participants, much of this is in relation
to waste collection and disposal. There are very few
waste treatment plants being operated in Nigeria
as such, this is an area that private sector partici-
pants in Oyo State could further explore.

                     or a number of separate Waste Services Agreements covering
                     smaller areas within Ibadan).

                     The interface between the contracting Authority and other

                            was anticipated) then the Authority would need to ensure
                            that the Waste Company had the appropriate property rights.

                must always comply with applicable legislation).

                The WSA could also pass other maintenance and replace-
                ment obligations onto the Waste Company, for instance
                any waste receptacles used by low income households as
                primary waste delivery points (as an increased number of
                receptacles is likely to increase waste management within
                poorer areas and provides a partial solution until the road
                network is sufficient in all areas to allow door to door collec-
                tion). However, it would be important to understand how the
                Waste Company would be paid in respect of such additional
                maintenance or replacement obligations.

                The Authority may want the right to undertake surveys of any
                equipment or facilities to ensure that the Waste Company is
                complying with its obligations
Payment         This is a key area. The Waste Company will have difficulty
                being able to offer an increased service level above the level
                that is currently being experienced if it is expected to take
                the risk of recovery of any monies from third party users. The
                ideal and recommended position for the Waste Company is
                that all payments are made directly by the Authority to the
                Waste Company and that the Authority then puts in place
                mechanisms to recover relevant amounts from end users
                (whether through direct taxation, linking payment to utility
                bills or another method). Non-voluntary payments are likely
                to require Government assistance in relation to the poorer
                households as they may be unable to pay for such services.
                In order to limit this risk it would be possible to have a
                non-voluntary basic service level, with a voluntary enhanced
                service level that more affluent households can pay for them-
                selves if they require.

        provision
                          If the Authority is unwilling or unable to guarantee payments
                          to the Waste Company in respect of the waste collection
                          service then the WSA can specify that recovery risk remains
                          with the Waste Company. However, as noted above, this re-
                          flects the current system and is therefore unlikely to allow for
                          a significantly increased service delivery as non-recovery by
                          current waste companies remains high. It is also likely to be
                          a barrier to larger waste companies bidding to enter into the
                          WSA and to obtaining external funding. For these reasons,
                          this approach is not recommended.

                          Where any capital payments would be required to be made,
                          the Authority would need to consider whether these will
                          be expected to be funded by the Waste Company and then
                          recovered by the Authority (over the term of the WSA or over
                          some other shorter period) or whether the Authority will
                          fund such capital payments. In either case, ideally the Waste
                          Company should be required to carry out the works and
                          then recover the payments but if they do not have sufficient
                          funds or availability of debt then this may not be possible. In
                          this case the Authority would take the risk of the money not
                          being properly allocated and having to seek recovery against
                          the Waste Company.
        Performance       An important element of a WSA should be that payment is             The Operation Permit requires records to be sub-
        Monitoring        performance based. The WSA should set out any key perfor-           mitted monthly by the Waste Company and for
        and Key           mance indicators in respect of the Services. These key per-         audited records to be provided to the Authority for
        Performance       formance indicators are the service standards that the Waste        review.
        Indicators        Company is expected to meet.

                          In order to measure performance, the Waste Company should
                          be expected to provide all necessary records to the Author-
                          ity and to provide summary reports on their performance
                          at regular intervals (monthly, for instance). The Authority
                          should also have the right to undertake its own performance
                          monitoring of the Waste Company to ensure the Waste Com-
                          pany is complying with its obligations (including its reporting
                          obligations)
        Penalties for     Failure to meet any of the key performance indicators re-
        non-perfor-       ferred to above would ordinarily result in a financial penalty
        mance             on the Waste Company. This penalty would be made by
                          reducing any amounts payable by the Authority or by seek-
                          ing recovery against the Waste Company. The exact process
                          for the application of penalties is dependent on how the
                          payment mechanics are expected to work. It may be that
                          non-collection simply equates to non-recovery of the amount
                          otherwise payable in respect of the collection but if the ser-
                          vice is to be enhanced such that additional key performance
                          indicators are to be imposed on the Waste Company then a
                          more detailed penalty regime is likely to be more appropri-
                          ate.

provision
Incentive     Where the Waste Company performs above anticipated levels
Payments      it may be appropriate to include bonus payments in order
              to incentivise such increased performance. This approach
              would also recognise the potential additional risk accepted
              by the Waste Company where key performance indicators are
              included in addition to a simple mechanic whereby non-deliv-
              ery equals non-payment.

              It is important that the incentive payments are not simply
              based on increased collection that is then passed onto end
              users as there is a point at which the end users would not
              benefit from such increased collections and may not be able
              to meet any increased payments.
Financial     Depending on the Waste Company and the potential for any
Security      security to be provided, the Authority may want to consider
              whether it would require any bonds or guarantees covering
              the obligations of the Waste Company.
Relief from   The WSA should contain any agreed relief from obligations
Obligations   required by the Waste Company so as to avoid either a penal-
              ty for non-performance or a termination for Waste Company
              default. The exact list of relief will need to be agreed but is
              likely to include elements such as:
              (i) a breach by the Authority of its obligations under the WSA,
              (ii) war, terrorism or armed conflict,
              (iii) fire, flood or other natural disaster,
              (iv) general strikes or fuel shortages, or
              (v) closure of an Authority controlled site (where responsibili-
              ty is not passed across to the Waste Company).

              Further types of relief may be required in circumstances
              where the WSA would include the operation of the existing
              landfill sites and/or the construction of new facilities.

              Where certain matters beyond a Party’s control (such as war
              or natural disaster) continue for an extended period of time
              and the Parties have been unable to agree how to deal with
              such matters, either Party should have the right to termi-
              nate the WSA on a no fault basis. This would mean that no
              compensation would be payable by either party (unless the
              Authority would be unjustly enriched by the Waste Company
              returning equipment or new or enhanced facilities to the Au-
              thority that it had not paid for (or not fully paid for), in which
              case the Authority would be required to make an appropriate
              payment to the Waste Company in respect of such equipment
              or facilities.

                            Waste Company during collection and transport). If the ser-
                            vices include the control of the landfill sites then it may be
                            more appropriate that the ownership of waste transfers to
                            the Waste Company.

                            Where the Waste Company owns the waste it may be possi-
                            ble to consider the extent to which income can be received
                            through enhanced recycling and whether such income could
                            be used to enhance the economics of the WSA (i.e. can recy-
                            cling income be used to help reduce the levels of payment
                            expected from the Authority).
        Termination for The ultimate sanction for a failure by the Supplier to perform
        Supplier Default would be a right for the Authority to terminate the WSA. The
                         exact list of defaults would need to be agreed but would be
                         likely to include:

Termination for   The right for the Waste Company to terminate the WSA for
Authority De-     Authority Default should be very limited. It would include:
fault
                   ( i )	 failure of the Authority to pay amounts (over a cer-
                          tain threshold) due to the Waste Company;

                           assets without due cause;

                   ( iii )	 breach by the Authority of its obligations under the
                            WSA which frustrates the Waste Company from per-
                            forming the Services for an extended period of time;

                   ( iv )	 transferring the WSA to another party that does not
                           have the capability of performing the Authority’s ob-
                           ligations under the WSA.

                  Any defaults which are rectifiable would be subject to a cer-
                  tain rectification period before the right to terminate took
                  effect.
Compensation      On a Waste Company default, the Waste Company will be
on Termination    liable for all losses incurred by the Authority as a result of
                  such default (including any increased costs of performing the
                  Services, any re-tendering costs, any temporary measures
                  required prior to any re-tender, any relevant break costs and
                  any necessary rectification costs). As mentioned in more
                  detail below, this may be subject to a cap on liability.

                  On an Authority default, the Authority will be liable for all
                  breakage costs properly incurred (including any redundancy
                  costs caused by no longer needing any relevant employees
                  and not being able to re-locate them to other contracts or
                  services), plus a certain amount of the Waste Company’s
                  expected profit (usually between 6 months and 2 years) to
                  reflect the fact that the Authority has defaulted on a long
                  term contract.

                           repaid by the Authority but hasn’t been (or hasn’t fully been)
                           repaid at the point of termination (for instance in relation to
                           the purchase of equipment that is to revert to the Authority
                           or any maintenance of construction of relevant facilities), the
                           Authority will still be responsible for making such payments
                           (even following a Waste Company default), subject to any
                           adjustments needed to reflect the fact that the equipment
                           or facilities may not be in the condition expected under the
                           WSA as a result of the Waste Company not complying with
                           the terms of the WSA.



        Insurance          The Waste Company should take out all insurances as re-             Specialist insurance advice would usually be ob-
                           quired by law. The Authority may want to specify certain            tained in relation to this area.
                           insurances and/or insurance provisions that the Waste Com-
                           pany should obtain.

                           The insurance package will depend on whether the Waste
                           Services Agreement includes responsibility for existing
                           landfill sites and/or construction of new facilities. Additional
                           insurances are likely to be required in these circumstances.
        Changes in Law     The Waste Company would be expected to take the risk of
                           general changes in law affecting the services unless the rel-
                           evant authority brought in a law specifically to discriminate
                           against the Waste Company or the obligations under the
                           WSA.

                           Where the Waste Company takes responsibility for the
                           landfill sites or for any new facilities, the Waste Company is
                           unlikely to be able to take responsibility for all changes in
                           law which result in material additional capital expenditure
                           being incurred (albeit larger waste companies may be able to
                           take some risk here, on an agreed cost sharing basis with the
                           Authority). Subject to any cost sharing agreement, this ex-
                           posure would be something that the Waste Company would
                           expect the Authority to cover. In reality the exposure for the
                           Authority here is no different than if it had retained control of
                           the facilities as it would still need to comply with all applica-
                           ble laws.
        Indemnities        The Waste Company should compensate the Authority for
                           any losses caused to the Authority as a result of death or
                           injury to any person, loss or damage to any property, or third
                           party claims being made against the Authority, in each case
                           where these losses were caused by the Waste Company.

                    circumstances where construction was included within the

                    would need to be agreed but would be likely to include:

                    Where the Waste Company employs sub-contractors, the

                    with such sub-contractors which would be triggered in the
                    event that the Waste Company was in default of the WSA, so
                    the Authority could step in and instruct the sub-contractors
                    directly.

        3.	 From your experience, what are the key challenges to overcome for a successful PSP in waste management in Nigeria / Oyo

                                The key financial challenge that PSPs have is in the area of financing and cost recovery.

4.	 From your experience, what are the key challenges to overcome for a successful PSP in waste management in Nigeria / Oyo
    State / Ibadan? (Operational challenges)
                      The tenement structure of some parts of Ibadan (lack of proper definition of streets), will make it difficult to
                     §	
                      operate a door-to-door structure and as such a communal waste collection strategy will work better.

Richbol               The private collection companies are too small in capacity and lack the wherewithal in terms of financial and
                     §	
Environmental         technical capability. Also, the areas allocated to private collecting companies are too small. This places the
Services Ltd.         capability of the overall sector on a micro level.

                      There is a lack of equipment on the part of the collectors. Trucks and other equipment are expensive and
                     §	
                      facilities are not readily available from financial institutions.
                      The key issue we have identified is bureaucracy. There are a lot of bottle necks in the system that makes

                      There is no adequate infrastructure on the part of government. For instance , there are no adequate landfills
                     §	
                      and the dumpsites being used in their place are in such bad condition that they cause trucks to breakdown
Waste-Point Lim-
ited                  Also, there needs to be strong will on the part of government that will translate into creating enabling envi-

                      by the government
                      The only issue we have noticed is the attitude towards waste management. For instance some of our collec-
                     §	
                      tors, even though they are nicely dressed and operate with tricycles, still do not want to go to neighbour-

                      hoods where they know people. They do not want to be associated with “dirt”. Nevertheless, we get cooper-
                      ation from the public because their participation is incentivised by the redeemable points
                      Some waste management government agencies try to plunge into more advanced back-end process like
                     §	
                      waste to energy, integrated waste management facilities and world standard landfills too early. It is a com-
Nigeria Infra-        plicated process that can quickly become a burden if not managed properly. In the beginning stages, more
structure Advisory    emphasis should be placed on getting the collection, disposal and general recycling right. Waste to energy
Facility (NIAF)       can be done in smaller scales e.g. having specialized arrangement with large companies who require the
                      energy or recycled products for their operations. When the whole waste management process has mature,
                      then full-scale waste to energy can be done.
                      A major challenge for waste management in Ibadan is that the topology of the state is hilly and not flat like
                     §	
                      Lagos hence it is difficult for PSP to collect waste and take it to the dumpsites. Most of the waste disposal

                      Another operational challenge is that there are no adequate and appropriate tools in place for an efficient

                      and effective system of managing waste.

    legal challenges related to psp in waste management
        5.	   From your experience, what are the key challenges to overcome for a successful PSP in waste management in Nigeria / Oyo
              State / Ibadan? (Legal challenges)
        Richbol                 A big issue in this area is cost recovery and the ability to enforce. Most PSPs are unable to recover their cost

                                The key issue here is on the part of cost recovery and enforcement. In the case of my business, we have been
                               §	
                                able to manage because we did a thorough enumeration of the area. Also, the cost for commercial residents

        ited                    er, we have noticed that the public is willing to pay when services are prompt and efficient.

                                Another legal issue is on sorting of waste by the public. However, Nigeria is not mature enough for that yet
                               §	
                                but it is also something that can be achieved with proper legal framework and enforcement
                                A key issue that can be resolved with legal backing and enforcement is proper sorting of waste at the point of
                               §	
        Wecyclers               generation in households. However, we think Nigeria is not that mature and might not get full public support.
                                The first stage will be to ensure the public dispose of general waste properly and pay for such services.
                                A legal challenge we have noticed is cost recovery and enforcement. The PSPs do not have the power to
