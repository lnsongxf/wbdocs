FOREWORD
In November 2016, two tropical trough systems produced heavy rains in Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, which resulted in intense flooding across the island chain. The torrential rains, ensuing
flash flooding, and landslides resulted in widespread damage to road, bridges, water infrastructure,
and housing.

Our extreme vulnerability to natural disasters and the impacts of climate variability continues to be
of grave concern.

This ‘Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Rapid Damage and Loss Assessment, November 9–11 and
November 28, 2016 Floods’ Report serves as a reminder and proof of the Government’s resolve and
commitment to risk reduction as well as the well-being of our people.

The Government recognizes the necessity to better understand our climate and disaster risk context
and is continuing the battle to reduce this risk and improve resilience across all sectors.

This report provides a rapid damage and loss assessment of the affected sectors, with particular
focus on infrastructure damage to inform the Government’s recovery, reconstruction, and financial
planning. It also includes short- and medium-term recommendations designed to further
incorporate disaster risk reduction and management into land use and physical planning decision-
making processes so that we continue to develop into a country that is more resilient to natural
disasters and climate change.

                    The Honourable Dr. Ralph E. Gonsalves
                              Prime Minister and Minister of Finance

      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      From September through November 2016, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) experienced a
      series of significant rainfall events beginning with the passage of Hurricane Mathew in September
      2016 and culminating with the passage of two trough systems on November 9 and November 28,
      2016. Due to the consistent rainfall over the period, ground conditions were largely saturated which
      set the stage for intense flash flooding associated with the two troughs. A single death was reported
      from Bequia.

      As a result of intense rainfall, numerous landslides were triggered, resulting in significant damage
      to national road infrastructure. Flash floods, several of which were associated with debris flows,
      damaged bridges and private property with particularly devastating impact to lower-income
      communities. These effected were particularly focused in the northeastern and northwestern
      portions of the island of Saint Vincent (mainland).

      On November 22, 2016, the Government requested support from the World Bank Group for
      developing a Rapid Damage and Loss Assessment (DaLA). Working closely with Government
      agencies, preliminary assessment data were collected to characterize the impacts of the disaster.
      In summary, presented in table 1, the transport sector accounted for 67 percent of the impact
      experienced because of the two events, accounting for approximately US$24.3 million (EC$65.7
      million) of the total US$36.3 million (EC$97.9 million) in assessed damage and losses.

                                                                                                    DECEMBER 16, 2016


The housing sector accounted for US$4.6 million (EC$12.3 million) of the total damage and losses,
with a total of 189 houses affected. While accounting for only 13 percent of the total damage and
losses suffered, the impact is particularly severe as low-income families who are least capable of
recovering from disaster events were disproportionately affected.

Finally, Industry and Commerce (I&C) impacts of US$4.9 million (EC$13.1 million) are reflected
primarily as losses due to closure of the airport, businesses, and Government offices during the
disaster event which resulted in the inability to conduct business and reduced productivity. The
final economic impact is expected to be higher as the disaster events occurred during a period that
is seasonally high for the retail industry as it is before the Christmas season when commerce usually
increases.

The macroeconomic impact of the floods and landslides will take longer to become apparent. The
possible increase in the imports of food, agriculture supplies, material for the reconstruction or
rehabilitation of public infrastructure such as roads and bridges, and private infrastructure such as
houses could result in a worsening of the BOPs. Moreover, given the increase in the demand for
labor for civil works, it is expected that there will be an increase in the cost of labor, thereby
increasing construction costs, all of which may contribute to a worsening of macroeconomic
conditions. Further analysis is required to fully quantify the impact on the BOPs.

In the fiscal sector, some of the increased expenditures were accommodated by making use of the
Government’s budget framework, which allows for the reallocation of funds. Funds budgeted for
existing programs would have to be diverted to cover the immediate expenditures for emergency
response. The total estimated costs of the disaster represent approximately 49.5 percent of the
projected 2016 capital budget (US$73.2 million or EC$197.7 million) and 10.7 percent of the total
budget US$338.1 million (EC$912.9 million)1 programmed for 2016.

This report summarizes the findings of the Rapid DaLA, which was prepared using information
available within the first month after the disaster event. It is a rapid assessment and presents what
is certainly a low estimate of the total impacts of the two events, particularly with respect to losses
incurred. The currency conversion factor used throughout this report is EC$2.7 to US$1.0.

1 COUNTRY OVERVIEW
1.1 COUNTRY CONTEXT
Demographic. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) is a small island developing state with an
estimated population of 110,255 (2015) and a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of US$6,691
(2015). Females account for 49.5 percent of the total population while males account for the
remaining 50.5 percent. The urban population, now at 50.5 percent, continues to grow as people
migrate to the urban areas predominantly in the south of the country.2 The archipelagic state in the
Eastern Caribbean comprises a mainland island, Saint Vincent, which is 344 km2, and a chain of 32
islands and cays for a total area of 390 km2 (World Bank Group 2016).

Economic. The GDP in 2015 was US$737.7 million with the tertiary sector accounting for 75 percent
of the GDP, industry for 17 percent, and the primary sector accounting for the remaining 7 percent.
About 80 percent of the GDP is generated from the national capital in Kingstown.3 Over the past
two decades, the economy has been transitioning away from the agricultural sector toward tourism
and related services as well as construction. Economic recovery from the last global financial crisis
was adversely affected by a series of natural disasters, sluggish global demand, and slow
implementation of key infrastructure projects (IMF 2016). GDP grew by 1.3 percent in 2012 and 2.5
percent in 2013 but only by 0.2 percent in 2014,4 partially due to the negative impact of the floods
on agriculture and the disruption of transport infrastructure. The economy is slowly rebounding
with GDP growth of 0.6 percent5 in 2015. Public debt, at 74 percent of GDP in 2015, has increased
steadily primarily due to the impact of the global financial crisis, construction of the new
international airport, and rehabilitation costs associated with three back-to-back natural disasters
(IMF 2016). Table 2 shows select socioeconomic statistics.

1.2 VULNERABILITY TO NATURAL HAZARDS
SVG is exposed to high levels of risk to meteorological (high wind, excess rainfall, hurricanes, and
drought) and geophysical (seismic, volcanic, tsunami) hazards, which have significant negative
impacts on economic development, fiscal stability, and communities. These natural hazards are
being exacerbated by the adverse impacts of climate change, which put increased stress on coastal
investments, national infrastructure, water availability, and livelihoods, especially of the poor and
vulnerable groups. Of the disasters regularly affecting SVG, hydro-meteorological (hydromet)
events occur most frequently and represent a significant source of average annual losses, which
from 1996 to 2015 were estimated to be around 1.2 percent of GDP (ranked 16th globally) (Kreft et
al. 2016). More recently, the trough in December 2013 resulted in extensive physical damage and
economic losses estimated at approximately US$108.4 million (15 percent of GDP). The trough hit
at a time when SVG was just showing signs of recovery from the global financial crisis, and the
natural disasters exerted further strain on an already challenging fiscal context.

Given its geographic location, small land mass, and topography, the entire nation is highly
vulnerable to natural disasters. Because of its volcanic origin, steep slopes dominate the islands’

landscape and tilted volcanic layers define the             FIGURE 2: PRINCIPAL RIVERS AND WATERSHEDS
geology and soils (DeGraff 1988). It has more
than 40 rivers and tributaries, which originate
in the central mountains and discharge to the
Caribbean Sea or the Atlantic Ocean (DLN
Consultants 2006). These are distributed
among 15 principal watersheds, as shown in
Figure 2.

The combination of tropical temperatures and
abundant rainfall leads to slope instabilities and
the high potential for landslides. In 1988,
DeGraff produced an analysis of landslide
susceptibility (Figure 3) and during the study
identified about 475 landslides, covering about
1 percent of the country’s surface. The most
common type of landslides in SVG are debris
avalanches, which are defined as rapid
movements of an unconfined mass of soil and
rock falls. Depending on the topography,
another common type of landslide is debris
flow, for which the movement of debris is
confined to a channel. In SVG, debris flow is
usually associated with river channels in the         Source: DLN Consultants, 2006.
mountainous sections of the country. Debris
flows can travel long distances, particularly when river flooding has occurred. They approach quickly
and exhibit a considerable destructive force. Volcanic eruptions have affected the country in 1789,
1812, 1902, 1971, and 1979 (NEMO 2005). SVG is located in the Atlantic hurricane belt and has
suffered periodic damage from past events, for example, from Hurricane Allen (1980), Hurricane
Lenny (1999), and Hurricane Tomas (2010).

SVG is highly vulnerable to flash flooding. The extreme topography coupled with short (6 km)
distances from the coast to the center mountain ridge creates a hydraulic system where stream
concentration times are short (nominally 30 minutes). High rainfall, such as rain associated with a
thunderstorm, quickly concentrates in stream channels, promoting rapid flooding. In this type of
system, early warning of an actual flood event cannot be accomplished by monitoring stream levels
because once they rise, it is too late. Any warning would need to be based on rainfall observations
to trigger an alert.

Climate vulnerabilities are further exacerbated by the country’s limited human and financial
resources as well as highly exposed social and economic infrastructures—much of which are located
in low-lying coastal areas. The considerable economic dependence on primary production and the
service industry further contributes to such vulnerabilities as the success of both sectors is heavily
influenced by climate.

The Government has been taking steps to address                  FIGURE 3: LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY ZONES
these risks by implementing multiple projects around
disaster risk management and climate change
adaptation, including the Regional Disaster
Vulnerability Reduction Project (RDVRP). The project
is a combination of risk reduction investments and
emergency reconstruction activities and institutional
strengthening and capacity building to better collect,
manage, and apply climate risk and spatial
information in development and planning decision
making. Through the RDVRP, the Government has
leveraged Climate Investment Funds, under the Pilot
Program for Climate Resilience, to specifically target
interventions aimed at reducing its climate risk. The
Government has also participated in the Climate Risk
Information Program, which has increased its
baseline data on risks.

1.3 OVERVIEW OF THE DISASTER
As result of the passage of two low-pressure trough systems on November 9 and November 28,
2016, SVG experienced heavy and sustained rainfall that resulted in several flash flooding events
and numerous landslides principally affecting mainland Saint Vincent.

On September 28, 2016, Tropical Storm Mathew passed over SVG, depositing over 203 mm of rain
over a 24-hour period, resulting in one fatality, damage to infrastructure, flooded rivers, and
landslides around the island. This was the first in a series of systems that served to hydrologically
saturate the island, a condition that remained constant through the months of October and
November. According to records from the National Meteorological Service, monthly rainfall totals
recorded at the E.T. Joshua Airport for September, October, and November were 326.3 mm, 170.7
mm, and 691.2 mm, respectively. Of note is November 2016, which recorded the second highest
monthly rainfall of all months since 1979 (Figure 4). A total of five trough systems passed over Saint
Vincent during the month of November 2016.

On November 9, 2016, a low-pressure system (trough) passed over the islands, resulting in three
days of heavy rain and thunderstorms. Given the already saturated condition of the islands’ soils,
most of the rainfall was converted to runoff, which resulted in flash flooding and numerous
landslides throughout the mainland. This event affected the southern portions of the island more
than the northern areas, as well as the Grenadines. Following that system, a second trough arrived
on November 28, again resulting in heavy rains and thunderstorms that lasted from November 28
through December 1, 2016. With an already saturated landscape and previous damage experienced
from the November 9, 2016 event, existing damage was compounded and additional damage from
flash flooding and landslide accumulated. Significant damage resulted particularly in the
northeastern and northwestern portions of the island.

A meteorological trough is a linear low-pressure band that, in the tropics, is usually associated with
increased convection activity (thunderstorms) and significant rainfall. In the case of the eastern
Caribbean islands, these systems interact with the mountainous landscape (orographic effect),
which serves to locally amplify the intensity of rainfall and thunderstorm activity.

Mainland Saint Vincent is of volcanic origin and is characterized by a deeply dissected terrain and
mountainous interior. As the island is nominally 13 km wide (east-to-west), distances from the high
elevations in the center to the coast are relatively short, approximately 6 km. On the north end of
Saint Vincent, elevations (Figure 5) vary from sea level to over 2,000 ft. over a 4-km distance. This
topographic variability promotes rapid rainfall runoff concentrating in streams with very high
velocities. Flash flood development occurs in less than 30 minutes, depending on the intensity and
duration of a particular rainfall event. Additionally, due to the topography, rainfall is highly
localized. As weather systems interact with the landscape, the mountainous terrain facilitates the
formation of local thunderstorms and increased rainfall intensities. For this reason, for example,
the southern portion of the island may be experiencing a sunny day while there are floods and
landslides in the north though the island is only about 29 km long (north-to-south).

The aforementioned factors contributed greatly to the level and distribution of the damage
associated with the two trough systems.

During the November 9, 2016 trough, rainfall intensities
were generally greater in the southern portion of Saint
Vincent. The rainfall event lasted about 96 hours, from
November 9 to November 11, 2016. Rainfall recorded at
the E.T. Joshua Airport totaled 297.8 mm. The Central
Water and Sewage Authority (CWSA) maintains a
system of rain gauges located throughout SVG and, on
mainland Saint Vincent, maintains a constellation of 14
gauges. Accumulated rainfall for the interior areas in the
southern portion of the island, as observed by the
CWSA, was in the range of 265 mm over the 48-hour
period, November 9 to 10, 2016. Based on their inter-
station analysis, presented in Figure 6, most of the
central southern interior experienced this level of
rainfall intensity. In contrast, northern areas
experienced considerably less rainfall generally in the
range of 17–60 mm over the two-day period. This is a
more representative accounting of the distribution of
rainfall for the island.

On November 28, 2016, an easterly trough arrived,
bringing heavy rains and thunderstorms, producing the
most intense rainfalls in the northern portion of the island,
where the highest elevations are encountered, and
affecting the east and west coasts. The three-day event
rainfall measured at the E.T. Joshua Airport totaled 102.1
mm; however, the airport was not in the region where the
intense rainfall developed. Based on the CWSA
observations (Figure 7), accumulated rainfall for two days,
November 28 and 29, 2016, was more than 300 mm over
much of the northern half with the southern portions
receiving amounts generally less than 100 mm over the
same two-day period.

1.3.3.2 C OMBINED T ROUGHS - I NDIRECTLY A FFECTED P ERSONS

Combined, the impact of the troughs indirectly affected about 80.5 percent of the population (Table
4) due to the flooding, landslides, damage to homes, loss of electricity, loss of water supply, and
obstruction of roadways, as well as the closing of the airport, schools, government offices, and
businesses. As a result of landslips, the population above the Sandy Bay area was completely cut
off from the rest of the country and water trucks were unable to reach the communities in Owia
who had lost their water supply due to damage to the system. The impact of the November 9, 2016
trough was concentrated in the southern part of the country where the center of commerce and
the airport are located; as a result, the macroeconomic impacts are expected to be high. Conversely,
the impact of the November 28, 2016 trough was concentrated in zones where the economic
activities focus on agriculture, fishing, and services, with high levels of poverty, such as Georgetown
(55.6 percent) and Sandy Bay (55.6 percent).8 A more detailed social assessment would be required
to determine the full social impact of the disaster.

1.4 THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE

1.4.1 NOVEMBER 9, 2016 TROUGH

On November 9, 2016, the National Emergency Council of the National Emergency Management
Office (NEMO) activated the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) to coordinate
emergency response. Three emergency shelters were opened for 10 persons. The Government
closed all schools and asked nonessential personnel to remain at home. The only airport in Saint
Vincent, the E.T. Joshua Airport, was closed for a full day to remove silt and debris. In addition, all
stores and business places were closed in Kingstown, one of the hardest hit areas. Within the first
few hours, the Buildings, Roads, and General Services Authority (BRAGSA) had started clearing
landslips from the main road from South Central Windward through to North Central Windward as
well as in Colonarie (near the low-income houses), La Croix, Fairbaine Pasture, Belmont, and Ratho
Mill. As a result of the damage, the Government requested support from the World Bank Group for
technical assistance in conducting the damage assessment.

1.4.2 NOVEMBER 28, 2016 TROUGH

The Barbados Meteorological Services, through the SVG Meteorological Services initially placed a
flood warning from 6:00 p.m. on November 28, 2016, to 12:00 p.m. November 29, 2016; however,
they extended the warning until 8:00 a.m. November 30, 2016. The NEOC was activated and NEMO
coordinated the emergency response activities, which included opening five emergency shelters to
accommodate 180 persons. The Government closed all schools during this period and asked non-
essential personnel to remain at home.




                                                                                                                  16

                                                                                        DECEMBER 16, 2016



1.5 THE RAPID DALA APPROACH
Rapid DaLA preparation. After the initial assessment of the damage by the Government, it was
concluded that the infrastructure had been severely impacted. On November 22, 2016, the
Government requested the technical assistance of the World Bank Group to conduct a Rapid DaLA
and to support reconstruction efforts in the country. In response to the Government’s request, the
World Bank Group mobilized a team of experts to conduct the Rapid DaLA on December 5, 2016.
On November 28, 2016, days before the start of the mission, another trough hit the country,
bringing with it more torrential rains. The team worked jointly with the national authorities, visited
the affected areas, gathered information, and analyzed the results. The information in this report
reflects the results of the assessment and information available as of December 13, 2016; however,
the team notes that given the limited time since the passage of the November 28, 2016 trough,
damage and losses are expected to increase significantly as more data becomes available.

Rapid DaLA Methodology. The Rapid DaLA methodology calculates the damage and losses as well
as the social, economic, and environmental impacts of a disaster. This report provides—based on
the available information—a close approximation of damage to assets and losses to the economic
flows and provides some inputs to summarize the total macroeconomic impacts.

The Rapid DaLA methodology uses the country’s system of national accounts and involves all
macroeconomic sectors including productive (agriculture, tourism, commerce, and industries);
infrastructure (transportation, electricity, and water supply and sanitation); social (housing,
education, and health); and cross-cutting issues (for example, the environment and gender).

        Damage is defined as the monetary value of fully or partially destroyed assets. It is initially
        assumed that assets will be replaced to the same condition—in quantity and quality—that
        they had before the disaster. In cases where the conditions are below United Nations (UN)
        standards, the damage amount reflects the cost to restore assets to minimum UN living
        standards. In the case of infrastructure, damage also includes the cost of building back
        better.

        Losses are defined as the changes in the flows of goods and services that will not be
        forthcoming in the affected area until full economic recovery and reconstruction has been
        achieved. They include production of goods and services that will not be obtained or
        provided, higher costs of operation and production, and the cost of the
        humanitarian/emergency assistance activities. Losses are expressed in current values.

 2 RAPID DAMAGE AND LOSS ASSESSMENT
 2.1 RAPID DAMAGE AND LOSS SUMMARY
 According to the summary of the data reported from each affected sector, the November 2016
 trough events and the associated landslide and flash flooding resulted in total damages and losses
 of US$36.2 million (EC$97.9 million), equivalent to approximately 5 percent of the country’s GDP
 (2015). Most of the flood damage (figure 8) was sustained in the infrastructure sector, including
 utilities (70 percent), followed by the social sector (17 percent) and productive sectors (13 percent).
 Figure 8 presents a detailed summary of losses and damages by subsector.

 This Rapid DaLA is based on the initial estimates provided by the Government and losses will
 continue to accrue throughout the recovery phase. Damage costs will also likely rise as repair and
 reconstruction activities progress. A major factor affecting these costs is the potential for
 discovered damage, not observable during the initial assessment. Such damages are often
 discovered during the active construction phase and can result in as much as 25 percent increase
 in estimated costs for a particular construction project.

2.2 DAMAGE AND LOSSES BY SUBSECTOR
The following report is based on estimates from national authorities in each sector using the same
template and the same Rapid DaLA methodology. It will be presented by sectors under categories
of infrastructure, productive sectors, social sectors, and cross-cutting sectors.

Damage from the two trough systems was primarily due to landslip and flash flooding. Principal
sectors affected were transport, water, housing, and electricity. Agricultural damage was isolated
and crops were marginally affected; however, there was damage to local agricultural infrastructure
and blockage of farm-to-market roads.




                                                                                                                            19

2.2.1 TRANSPORT AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE
                                FIGURE 9: WINDWARD HIGHWAY - ARGYLE ROAD RECONSTRUCTION




During the two trough events, damage to the transportation sector was primarily due to flooding,
landslip, and rock fall. On Saint Vincent, road blockages were the predominant impact; however,
bridges and culverts suffered significant damage, particularly along the upper east coast. Road
failure occurred in several locations including along the main east coast highway to the west of the
Argyle Airport, 9 where a section of road (figure 9) failed completely, requiring a major
reconstruction. This resulted in the rerouting of traffic along the old coast road that is currently
serviced by a temporary one-lane bridge, which is also the focus of emergency construction
activities.

As a result of flash flooding events, 18 bridges suffered damage or were left in a vulnerable
condition due to scouring and exposure of foundation elements. In the latter case, the bridges
appear unaffected, but the underlying damage increased the vulnerability of the structures to
future events, including increased river flows simply due to normal weather events. Northern
portions of the island are particularly susceptible to debris flows, which greatly increase the damage
potential of the flooding event. Other works identified relate to landslip protection and river
stabilization to protect infrastructure and minimize risk of future deterioration.




9   During October–December 2016, the Argyle Airport was not opened for use.

                                                                                                                  20

Based on the assessment provided by the MoTW, a total of 62 infrastructure reconstruction or
rehabilitation projects were identified relating to the transport and public infrastructure sector
(Table 6). These works include bridge replacement and repair works, road repair replacement and
associated protective works, and protective works to stabilize landslips and river erosion
threatening property and communities. Protection works include bank stabilization for landslip,
river training, and bank protection such as gabions, concrete walls, and other measures. Notably,
of the 18 bridge-related works, 7 of the projects require the complete demolition and replacement
of existing structures.

Damage costs (table 7) are broken down by area affected and type of works. As a result of the
storms, damages are estimated at a total of US$23.5 million (EC$63.5 million).

BRAGSA spearheaded the cleanup works by employing local labor to accomplish the required labor-
intensive activities and providing heavy equipment to assist with the efforts. Specific activities
primarily involved clearing of landslides and drainage structures. With respect to BRAGSA, losses
incurred are estimated to be US$211,111 (EC$570,000). However, this is considered a low estimate
and actual losses are expected to rise significantly as more data become available. Losses in this
sector, related to costs of temporary cleanup activities to restore access, have not been well
captured.

Other losses incurred relate to lost vehicles, increased transport costs in lost time and fuel, ongoing
vehicle damage from poor road conditions, and increased maintenance costs resulting from
deteriorated infrastructure. Losses of this nature have not been quantified.

Finally, apart from the costs associated with engineering design and construction of infrastructure,
additional studies will be required where floods and landslide are to be mitigated. These are
specialized studies designed to provide a design basis for engineering interventions and include
hydrology and hydraulic analysis, slope stabilization analysis, and other studies designed to
characterize the issues to be addressed during the engineering phase of a project. Based on
previous projects requiring such analysis and the number of sites requiring interventions, it is
estimated that these supporting studies will require a budget of approximately US$600,000 (EC$1.6
million).

2.2.2 HEALTH, WATER, AND SANITATION

2.2.2.1 H EALTH

Damage in the health sector was generally limited to water and sanitation (W&S) services. A
summary of the health impacts is listed:

    •    A clinic in Sandy Bay was flooded but was rapidly cleaned up and returned to operation.

    •    Few injuries were reported.

    •    A boiled water alert was issued for areas without piped water services.

    •    Psychological counseling services were provided for those who required them.

No significant disease-related issues were identified, such as potential for transmission of vector-
borne disease or increased potential for water-borne illness.

During the two events, three graveyards in Old Park Hill, London, and Rose Bank were overwhelmed
by floodwaters and land failure. Some graves were scoured, discharging their contents to the sea.
Although there were no public health consequences, the psychological impacts are high,
particularly given the socio-cultural implications of the loss. For example, on November 1 and 2
each year, family members remember their deceased and place flowers on their tombstones.

It is expected that the Government will spend US$518,500 (EC$1.4 million) to move the 200 graves
that have been compromised, provide memorial tombstones for the 70 graves that were lost,
provide counseling services to the affected families, and stabilize the slopes at the graveyards
including conducting geotechnical and pre-engineering studies as well as the public consultations.

It is noteworthy that these graveyards are located in a section of the country where local fisherfolk
collect a small, seasonal fish known locally as Tri-Tri (Sicydium plumieri). This is a local delicacy, and
the harvest season is limited owing to their migration schedule. Due to the graveyard damage, there

is a general reluctance on the part of the population to purchase Tri-Tri from the affected areas,
owing to the belief that they may be contaminated. While it is seasonal and relatively short-lived,
this harvest is a significant source of income for the fisher folk involved.

2.2.2.2 W ATER AND S ANITATION

The Ministry of Health, through the CWSA, administers the W&S infrastructure, supplies piped
drinking water, manages solid waste, and provides limited wastewater treatment services. Over 98
percent of the population has access to piped water.

2.2.2.2.1 W ATER

Impacts from both troughs resulted in the interruption       FIGURE 10: NOVEMBER 28, 2016 TROUGH WATER SERVICE
of piped water services to the affected localities. While                         OUTAGES
some pipe breakages in the transmission system were
experienced, most of the damage was experienced in the
abstraction system owing to sediment accumulations at
the abstraction points. Four main abstraction points
were particularly affected, leaving their service areas
(Figure 10) without piped water for varying periods up to
one week. Following the November 9, 2016 trough,
water supply was rationed in some areas for weeks due
to the damage to the water system. Table 9 summarizes
the population affected by these outages.

2.2.2.2.2 T EMPORARY W ATER D ISTRIBUTION

Water trucks were used to distribute water to the affected communities during the emergency
construction period for the water systems. However, in the Owia District, trucks were unable to get
to the communities due to the road blockages from landslips. Total costs from the distribution of
water were not estimated at the time of this report.

2.2.2.2.3 S ANITATION

Sanitation services were largely unaffected. Most of the island inhabitants have private septic
systems (soak-aways), several of which throughout the island were damaged due to flooding. Solid
waste was slightly affected due to the inability to temporarily provide collection services due to
roadway blockages. Service was quickly restored once the roads were reopened. Disposal facilities
were unaffected.

Damages to the electricity sector were largely associated with hydropower generation. Landslips
claimed several local transmission lines, but these were quickly restored. Hydropower represents
about 12 percent of the total grid production capacity (details presented in Table 11). Although the
generation stations were not damaged during the events, in two cases, hydro-generation was
suspended due to pending repair to the water supply system. In the case of Cumberland, a landslip
damaged a feed pipe, which was quickly repaired. In the case of the Richmond hydro-generation
station, the water intake was damaged and the access road was rendered impassible due to flood
damage (Figure 11).

Due to the events, the Richmond facility (20 percent of the hydro-generation capacity) suffered a
significant damage. Access to the water intake is blocked and the access road needs to be
rehabilitated. This includes the construction of long-term flood protection to account for the change
in riverbed characteristics caused by the flooding events. The road is now susceptible to flooding
even during normally occurring rainfall events.

The intake to this system suffered damage due to silting and battering by rocks and debris. A
temporary repair has been provided to restore the system to operation; however, the intake needs
to be reconstructed to account for changes in the river characteristics and current damage to the
structure.

While the interruptions in availability of electric power were negligible, the impact of the loss of
hydro-generation capacity served to increase fuel demand as the system compensated with
increased diesel generation. This results in an increased cost of production that is ultimately passed
to the consumer through a fuel surcharge.

Finally, a landslip at the central fuel storage facility (Figure 12) resulted in minor damage to storage
infrastructure. Nonetheless, because of the slide, the facility is at increased risk from future landslip
due to the decreased slope stability resulting from the slide. Apart from the cleanup of the
immediate slide, slope stabilization measures will need to be taken to mitigate the present unstable
condition. This Government-owned site is where Saint Vincent Electricity Services (VINLEC) stores
much of its fuel.

2.2.4 AGRICULTURE

Based on the findings of the Population and Housing Census Report 2012, the agriculture sector
contributes approximately 7 percent to the GDP and employs about 11.8 percent of the employed
workforce. This sector has experienced significant stresses over the past decade owing to recurrent
exogenous shocks, storm damage, plant disease, and economic losses associated with the loss of
preferential access to European markets. As of 2012, an estimated 8,000 ha were under cultivation
with an additional 2,000 ha in pasturelands, representing approximately 25 percent of the land area
available in SVG. Based on an estimated 2015 GDP of approximately US$737.7 million, 10 the
agricultural sector is estimated to contribute US$51.6 million.

                                                                                                    DECEMBER 16, 2016


Based on the assessment provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, damage in the agriculture sector
relates primarily to direct crop damage and loss of agricultural land due to flooding and landslide.
Direct damage to physical infrastructure such as farm buildings and related structures was minimal;
however, loss of arable land has yet to be quantified. Per the current assessment, an estimated 37
ha of cultivated land were affected because of the passage of the two trough systems. Livestock
loss was minimal but agricultural damages were highest among the vegetable crops, particularly
with respect to tomato and cabbage produce, as presented in Table 13.

Important losses are largely due to farm-to-market road blockages and damage. Roads, in some
cases, were blocked by landslip and debris and, in other cases, washed out due to flooding. The
extent of road damage is being assessed and continuing losses due to lack of access to cultivated
fields are accruing but cannot be assessed at this time. Over 1,619 ha were estimated to be
inaccessible due to access road damage. This represents an estimated 20 percent of the cultivated
croplands for SVG.

Finally, in the agriculture sector, high-impact damage and losses are particularly important among
the lower-income and disadvantaged population segment. These groups typically cultivate gardens
for personal consumption (kitchen gardens) selling surplus yields for additional income. Numerous
families lost these gardens due to flooding, resulting in loss of food products and incomes generated
from sales of excess production. While the macroeconomic impact is negligible, the impact to the
affected families is significant as many rely on these gardens for food and supplemental income.

2.2.4.1 F ORESTRY

Damage and losses in the forestry sector is estimated at EC$900,000 (US$333,333). This is largely
due to soil loss, damage to drainage, loss of forest, and damage to contouring mainly in
Perseverance, Troumaca, Richmond, and Fancy in the Georgetown and Sandy Bay areas. Damage
was also noted in the Congo Valley, Cumberland Bay, and Coulls Hill. Additional losses will accrue
as forest rehabilitation efforts commence, particularly with respect to clearing of felled trees and
replanting efforts to restore forest resources and stabilize landslips. Much of the interior remains
to be assessed as it requires an aerial survey to quantify damages and estimate losses. As of this

writing, the aerial survey has not been started. It is expected that damage and losses in the forestry
sector will total in the several millions of dollars (EC$) when the damage assessment is completed.

2.2.5 EDUCATION

Damage to the infrastructure in the education sector was minimal, as the sector reported no
structures damaged by flood or landslip. The primary cause of damage and losses to the sector was
from the use of schools as shelters, which resulted in loss of teaching days.

All schools throughout the country were closed for three teaching days in November 2016 because
of the heavy rainfall. Schools that were used as emergency shelters lost up to four weeks of teaching
days. This came at a particularly crucial time when students were preparing for their end-of-
semester exams. In addition, some parents had to take time off from work to take care of their
children, resulting in decreased national productivity.

In the Sandy Bay area, one of the poorest in the country, the impacts were high to families that
participate in the school feeding program that provides students with a hot lunch each day.
Anecdotally, for some students, it is their one complete meal of the day, and so the loss of this meal
for up to four weeks would have implications on their health and welfare.

Recommendation: Administrators in schools that are used as emergency shelters should inform
NEMO whether they have school feeding programs so that appropriate arrangements could be
made to ensure that no student goes without a proper meal because of emergency response.

2.2.6 HOUSING
                             FIGURE 13: HOUSE IN SANDY BAY DAMAGED BY LANDSLIP




Damage within the housing sector is estimated at US$4.3 million (EC$11.5 million) exclusive of any
costs associated with land acquisition to support relocation requirements. Losses for the sector are
not available but include furniture replacement, costs associated with alternative housing, loss of
savings kept on the property, and in some cases, loss of livelihood for home-based businesses.

Damage to housing stock occurred on both the leeward and windward sides of the island due to
the two troughs. Areas particularly affected on (a) the leeward side were Spring Village, Dark View,
Chateaubelair, Petit Bordel, and Fitz Hughes and (b) the windward side were Pepper Village,
London, Trench Town, Sandy Bay, Sion Hill, and Back Street. Table 14 presents the summary for
housing infrastructure damage by area affected using a four-tiered system of classification to
describe the extent of damage to housing.

The MoTW provided the cost estimates for damage based on their damage survey and assessment
of the works required to restore both the structure and the surrounding property. This focused on
damage resulting from the November 28 event. A partial assessment was conducted by the Ministry
of Housing, Informal Human Settlements, Physical Planning, and Lands and Surveys (MoH)
capturing damage from the November 9 trough. For most cases of level 4 damage, where the
structure was destroyed, reconstruction on the original site is not possible due to the site's
vulnerability to future flooding or landslip. In these cases, relocation will be required. A summary
of cost estimates for the housing sector damage is presented in table 15. These costs do not include
the cost associated with land acquisition in the case of relocation.

The Government, through NEMO, organized assistance and established shelters for 180 people who
sought refuge at five emergency shelters opened in response to the November 28, 2016 trough.
Emergency shelters accommodated families, particularly female-headed households, and other
individuals whose homes had incurred damage. At the time of this report, 20 persons were still
occupying four emergency shelters. In Sandy Bay, the emergency shelter was a school facility; as
such, students were unable to attend classes since the November 28, 2016 trough. The cost to
operate an emergency shelter is approximately EC$1,000 per week for 20 or less people. The direct
costs associated with operating the emergency shelters are listed in Table 16.

    •    Damages to housing sector were based on survey data provided by the MoH and the
         MoTW. Contingency amount for house repair at reconstruction was valued at 20 percent.

    •    Relocation estimates assume a standard lot of 1,000 sq. ft. at US$1.85 per sq. ft. (EC$5.00
         per sq. ft.)

    •    Where houses were destroyed, a standard replacement value of US$5,600 (EC$15,000) for
         furniture was used as a minimum requirement.

2.2.7 TOURISM

The Ministry of Tourism reported that no significant structural damage was sustained in the tourism
subsector. Cruise ship traffic was uninterrupted and hotels continued business as usual. Losses were
largely incurred by those engaged in providing local excursions as road closures, in particular the
damage to the Dark View Falls Park access road, prohibited tourist visitations. Losses have not been
fully quantified and Dark View Falls (a popular local destination) will remain closed 1 to 3 months,
pending road clearance and rehabilitation of the damaged bridge. Remaining tourism activities,
including the sailing component, were unaffected. Table 18 shows the preliminary assessment.

2.2.8 INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE

Due the torrential rains, all Government offices, the airport, schools, and commerce were
completely shut down for three days on November 2016 in Kingstown and environs, which resulted
in a loss of productivity and revenue. Based on information provided by the MoEP, economic
activity in Kingstown, the center of commerce, contributed 80 percent to the total national GDP
(US$737.7 million). Therefore, as a direct result of the excess rainfall and subsequent shutdowns,
the economic loss is calculated as the following:



                                                                                                                       32
                                                                           RAPID DAMAGE AND LOSS ASSESSMENT
                                                                                         DECEMBER 16, 2016


    •   Total national GDP: US$737.7 million (MoEP)

    •   Daily national GDP: US$737.7 million/365 days

    •   Kingstown’s contribution to national GDP: 80 percent (based on estimates from the MoEP)

    •   Number of days for which Kingstown was completely shut down: 3 days

    •   Loss to GDP due to shutting down of Kingstown: US$737.7 million/365 days x 80 percent x
        3 days = US$4.85 million (EC$13.1 million)

Moreover, with further analysis, the loss in the I&C sectors will increase once the following are
considered:

    •   November is a crucial commercial period with the upcoming Christmas season. Given the
        seasonal nature of major shopping in SVG, the loss of shopping days may have higher
        financial impacts to the commerce sector.

    •   Closing the airport for a full day may have compounding affects.

    •   Some people were unable to go to work due to lack of access to water or loss of electricity.

    •   Some people were unable to get to work due to landslides and road failure.

    •   Some parents were unable to get to work because they need to take care of their children
        who had their schools closed for additional days because of the disaster. This issue is
        ongoing for families whose children attend schools that are being used as emergency
        shelters.

    •   Reduced productivity as commute times to work have increased due to road failure,
        worsened road conditions, and detours on smaller roads not intended for two-way traffic.


2.3 MACROECONOMIC IMPACT
The macroeconomic impact of the floods and landslides will take longer to become apparent. The
increase in the imports, food, agriculture supplies, and materials for the rehabilitation of roads and
bridges as well as for the reconstruction of houses may result in a worsening of the BOP. In addition,
given the increase in the demand for labor for civil works, it is expected that there will be an increase
in the cost of labor, thereby increasing construction costs.

In the fiscal sector, some of the increased expenditures were accommodated by making use of the
Government’s budget framework, which allows for the reallocation of funds. Funds budgeted for
existing programs would have to be diverted to cover the immediate expenditures for emergency
response. The total estimated costs of the disaster represent approximately 49.5 percent of the

                                                                                                 DECEMBER 16, 2016


projected 2016 capital budget (US$73.2 million or EC$197.7 million) and 10.7 percent of the total
budget US$338.1 million (EC$912.9 million)11 programmed for 2016.

Poverty levels may also increase given that the impact of the November 28, 2016 trough was
concentrated in zones where the economic activities focus on agriculture, fishing, and services, with
high levels of poverty, such as Georgetown (55.6 percent) and Sandy Bay (55.6 percent). 12
Moreover, in the agriculture sector, the impact is particularly important among the lower-income
and disadvantaged population segment who typically cultivate gardens for personal consumption
and may have lost these as a result of the disaster.

Further analysis is needed to assess the impact in BOP, fiscal sector, and poverty level.

3 RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION PLAN
The two troughs highlight the need for improved hydrologic analysis and planning, strengthening
infrastructure designs, and enhancing territorial and land planning activities. While forecasting is
generally adequate, the localized nature of weather interactions with the landscape is extremely
variable from event to event. The extreme topography of the island, as it interacts with weather
systems, is responsible for highly localized rainfall and thunderstorm events. These are spontaneous
in nature and cannot be predicted at the watershed level. To establish an effective flood early
warning system, observed rainfall is the only useful trigger. This requires real-time monitoring. As
such, it is recommended that the CWSA seeks to retrofit its existing rain gauge network to support
telemetric reporting. This has been difficult in the past owing to communications limitations. The
Government is currently considering the installation of a robust radio repeater network. It is
recommended that the CWSA’s rain gauge network be considered for integration into that network.
These events provide a strong impetus to better understand the localized relationship between
rainfall rates and runoff volumes and the system response with respect to flood and landslide
events within watersheds. Improving this understanding will be useful in the application of more
advanced hazard and risk modeling methodologies to inform the future investment activities and
engineering designs.

The following recovery and reconstruction framework is proposed to provide a prioritized and
flexible action plan to guide the recovery and reconstruction process that is anchored in
comprehensive disaster risk management, in particular flood risk management.

3.1 SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (1 YEAR)
    •   Repair and clean up damaged houses and infrastructure—including roads, river protection
        works, drainage, schools—and recover agriculture production.

    •   Conduct a detailed post disaster needs assessment (PDNA) focused on livelihoods.

    •   Develop or update the river basin flood risk maps and calibrate concentration times for
        important steam systems; watershed calibration curves; and intensity, duration, and
        frequency curves from the CWSA data collected since 2009.

    •   Update the landslide susceptibility maps to include other interacting risks (for example,
        flood, rockslide, mudslide, change of river course) with particular attention to areas left
        unstable after the flood event.

    •   Evaluate and ensure the effectiveness of operation and maintenance (and in some cases
        immediate improvement) of drainage network based on informed hydrologic analysis.

    •   Strengthen emergency communication network.

3.2 MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM ACTIONS (1–5 YEARS)

    •   Address critical data gaps needed to generate hazard and risk assessment, particularly with
        respect to hydromet monitoring systems.


                                                                                                     35
                                                                       RAPID DAMAGE AND LOSS ASSESSMENT
                                                                                     DECEMBER 16, 2016


•   Formalize and standardize damage assessment protocols and reporting among ministries,
    designate staff to form the national damage assessment team under the national response
    plan; provide formal training in conducting damage assessments.

•   Formalize the national hydromet data management system (including the conversion to
    real-time reporting of all rainfall and stream gauges) managed by the CWSA, building on
    the Government/EU water resources project. Improve interagency data sharing and
    archiving and formalize the establishment of a national hydromet center of expertise.

•   Incorporate watershed and flood risk modeling in the national land-use planning process
    and to support improved resilience in engineering designs.

•   Identify and act on the development of required legislation to manage and enforce land-
    use practices, particularly high-risk areas.

•   Adopt a watershed management legal framework.

•   Invest in transportation infrastructure and preventive maintenance and establish formal
    requirements for new infrastructure design with respect to expected service life and
    disaster resilience requirements (for example, survives 100, 200, 500 rainfall events, wind,
    flood, seismic events).

•   Advance and adopt risk reduction-based building codes and strengthen training and
    enforcement.

•   Identify capacity gaps and provide tailored training for staff in key ministries in disaster risk
    management and response.

•   Install additional meteorological and stream gauging stations at a density to accommodate
    engineering scale analysis for design and planning and support gridded rainfall analysis.

•   Strengthen disaster monitoring and early warning systems.

•   Continue to fund and expand public education with respect to hazard avoidance,
    particularly with respect to flood awareness. Include hazard awareness in outreach
    activities among the various ministries (for example, health, agriculture, works) and seek to
    add disaster preparedness themes to the national education curriculum.

•   Provide engineering and non-engineering solutions for vulnerable embankments in the
    upper watershed and land-use practices.

•   Strengthen social protection systems to provide rapid social response following disasters.

•   Develop risk transfer options for Government assets and private sector losses.
    Considerations should include activities such as setting aside a capital reserve,
    (Government self-insurance), purchase of insurances, and insurance requirements for the
    private sector. Recommend that this begins with a comprehensive multi-sectoral fiscal
    vulnerability analysis and an analysis of needs for periodic rehabilitation of public
    infrastructure to mitigate direct budget impacts of recurrent disaster events in the future.

                                                                                                    36
                                                                                RAPID DAMAGE AND LOSS ASSESSMENT
                                                                                              DECEMBER 16, 2016


    •   Advance findings under risk transfer analysis to policy and/or legislation.
