Abstract: Pakistan faces a formidable challenge in eliminating the polio virus from the
country. With transmission of the polio virus substantially slowing in the Africa region, the
only two countries worldwide with ongoing endemic polio transmission may soon be
Pakistan and Afghanistan. A substantial number of the polio cases or infant paralysis
occurring in Afghanistan is linked to cross-border transmission from Pakistan. The ongoing
cycle of polio infection is not just a tragedy for the children of Pakistan, it is a global public
health emergency constituting one of the final barriers to permanently eradicating polio.

The outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Pakistan result in significant costs to
individuals and to society. These include costs associated with visits to health care
providers, hospitalizations, disability, and premature deaths. Despite a slow decline over
the past 10 years, the under-five mortality rate in Pakistan remains high, with more than
400,000 deaths annually in this demographic over the past twenty years. Pakistan is
lagging behind other South Asian countries in improving this indicator.

This paper demonstrates clear economic benefits and efficacy of the National
Immunization Support Project (NISP), which is financing interventions in terms of DALYs
saved, and establishes that this approach is affordable and economically effective with a
high rate of return. In addition to increased investment, the effectiveness of the Expanded
Program on Immunization can be enhanced by improving the capacity building of health
professionals, as well as by improving logistics of program interventions to reach
marginalized populations, remote areas, and pockets of resistance. An increased financial
investment alone will be insufficient to address the root causes of persistent under-
coverage of immunization in Pakistan. It is imperative that ample attention and resources

capacity, and reporting mechanisms, among other capacity improvements.

                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Immunization is one of the most important advances in public health. Over the last century,
more lives have been saved by the global expansion of immunization coverage than any
other health intervention. Ample evidence attests to the success of immunization
programs. Vaccination is a cost-effective method to improve aggregate health status and
it improves the fairness of resource distribution. Public investment in vaccination helps
change the distribution of health in favor of deprived segments of the society. Because
the greatest gains from vaccination may accrue to sections of the population that are
disadvantaged in terms of their existing health or socioeconomic status, expanding access
to immunization interventions reduces health inequalities and strongly supports the twin
goals of the World Bank Group for poverty reduction and inclusive development.

Despite the clear array of benefits that stem from nationwide vaccination, Pakistan
continues to experience outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases due to problems in
the immunization program that lead to low coverage. The outbreaks result in significant
costs to individuals and to society. These include costs associated with visits to health
care providers, hospitalizations, disability, and premature deaths. Despite a slow decline
over the past 10 years, the under-five mortality rate in Pakistan remains high, with more
than 400,000 deaths annually in this demographic over the past twenty years. Pakistan is
lagging behind other South Asian countries in improving this indicator.

To achieve the Millennium Development Goal 4 of reducing child mortality, Pakistan
needed to sustain a reduction in child mortality rates (CMRs) of 4.2 per annum between
2000 and 2015. However, Pakistan only achieved a rate of 1.13 per annum as of 2012. 1
In large part, this gap in CMRs is a function of low immunization coverage in Pakistan.
Approximately 43 to 62 percent of children are estimated to be fully vaccinated. And this
estimate varies considerably across geographic, social, and cultural boundaries.

Historical data highlight three issues of concern with the national immunization coverage.
First, progress in expanding coverage of childhood vaccination countrywide continues to
be slow. The latest Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS 2012-13) indicates
that less than half of all children are fully immunized in Pakistan. 2 The proportion of fully
immunized children aged 12 to 23 months in Pakistan increased by only 19 percent in the
20 years preceding 2012-13.

Second, the follow up for second and third waves of vaccination for children remains
inadequate. For example, the BCG vaccine, which is administered at birth, constitutes 85
percent of all vaccines administered in the country. Although more than 75 percent of
children in Pakistan received the first dose of DPT, only 65 percent subsequently were




1 The authorsâ calculations are based on estimates from the following studies: âNeonatal, Post-neonatal,
Childhood, and Under-5 Mortality for 187 Countries, 1970-2010: A Systematic Analysis of Progress Towards
Millennium Development Goal 4.â 2010. The Lancet and Building Momentum: Global Progress towards
Reducing Maternal and Child Mortality. 2010. IMHE, University of Washington.
2 Children were considered âfully immunizedâ when they had received one dose of BCG, three doses of DPT,

three doses of polio, and one dose of measles vaccine.


                                                  ix
inoculated with DPT3. Immunity against measles is especially low in Pakistan. Only about
two-thirds (61 percent) of children have received the first vaccine dose.

Third, there are marked and alarming variations in immunization coverage across
provinces, districts, and genders. For example, the 2012-13 PDHS shows that the
proportion of fully immunized children in Sindh and Balochistan has dropped from 35
percent to 16 percent and from 37 percent to 29 percent since 2006-07, respectively.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab have shown slow but steady progress on the same
metrics. Gender variations are also evident in the data. Gender variations also exist:
immunization rates among boys is 56 percent â five percentage points higher than for
girls, at 51 percent. This trend prevails in provinces.

Pakistan faces a formidable challenge in eliminating the polio virus from the country. With
transmission of the polio virus substantially slowing in the Africa region, the only two
countries worldwide with ongoing endemic polio transmission may soon be Pakistan and
Afghanistan. A substantial number of the polio cases or infant paralysis occurring in
Afghanistan is linked to cross-border transmission from Pakistan. The ongoing cycle of
polio infection is not just a tragedy for the children of Pakistan, it is a global public health
emergency constituting one of the final barriers to permanently eradicating polio. The
Government of Pakistan has urgently prioritized improving the performance of the
Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) to interrupt polio virus transmission and to
deliver routine immunization services as a fundamental public health service.

Why is progress in improving immunization in Pakistan slow and fragmented? Several
demand and supply side challenges are among the causes. On the supply side, for
instance, the prioritization placed on EPI has been inconsistent, particularly funding and
technical assistance relative to other public health campaigns. A lack of capacity of
available human resources, or local-level planning, management, logistics, and
monitoring, evaluation, and surveillance has resulted in poor EPI performance. Moreover,
the recent devolution of health service management to the districts and provinces has
impeded national coordination and planning. Specifically, the EPI has not been able to
sustain its human resources for several reasons, including poor worker motivation due to
low remuneration, political interference, underutilization of vaccinators and Lady Health
Workers, and reduced opportunities for in-service staff capacity building in logistics,
monitoring, evaluation, and surveillance.

On the demand side, various social and political factors diminish EPI effectiveness.
According to the Ministry of Health (2003), about 10 percent of Pakistani families are
unwilling to vaccinate their children. Some communities expect door-to-door service by
female staff, while others categorically reject immunization on cultural grounds. The gap
in f immunization knowledge among the community impedes them from actively seeking
immunization services. Recent targeting of polio workers and staunch opposition to
immunization campaigns in selected areas of Pakistan emerges as a new barrier,
threatening coverage in areas that have been particularly affected by the polio virus. As a
consequence of these supply and demand side constraints, Pakistan continues to battle
endemic circulation of polio, alongside outbreaks of diseases such as measles and
diphtheria, which have been largely suppressed in other countries.




                                               x
The current political context of Pakistan presents additional challenges and opportunities
to improve EPI performance and overcome constraints. Overcoming the challenges will
require strong leadership, good governance, and effective managementâparticularly at
the district and provincial levels. Although the management of health services, including
immunization, has devolved to the provinces, the federal level stewardship function for
EPI is maintained within the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and
Coordination (MONHSRC). However, the extent to which federal roles like policymaking,
oversight, and monitoring and evaluation will be managed by the MONHSRC remains
unclear. Despite the existence of serious concerns about the capacity of provincial
programs, the devolution nevertheless has created clear opportunities for increased
access, accountability, ownership, and equity in national immunization programs.

The EPI programs in Pakistan also suffer from financial fragmentation, with multiple
sources of financing from federal and provincial development budgets and from the
considerable international support that flows off-budget. This fragmentation causes
inefficiencies due to the delayed flow of funds and unpredictable resource projections. In
addition, it limits accountability due to failures of accounting and reporting. The financial
sustainability of the EPI is threatened by the continued reliance on the development
budget and off-budget international support. Program governance and accountability
mechanisms are weak and fragmented among federal, provincial, and district levels.
World Bank analysis indicates an average annual loss to Pakistan of PKRs 4 billion due
to inefficiencies in vaccine procurement and program management.

Given the highlighted challenges and internationally demonstrated cost-effectiveness of
immunizations, Pakistan is embarking on enhancing the scope and coverage of its
immunization program as articulated and endorsed by the Government of Pakistan in a
new Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (CMYP). The National Immunization Support Project
(NISP) is under preparation as a financing mechanism for the CMYP. The NISP will
coordinate results-based financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi), the
World Bank, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). When the cost of vaccine
purchase is subsidized, some members of the population may be able and willing to pay
out-of-pocket to be vaccinated, which would reduce the financial burden on the health care
system. The generation of private demand could improve the affordability and financial
sustainability of immunization programs. Critical to the success of the program, however,
will be ensuring that vaccines are available to members of the population who are unable
to pay user charges.

This report answers the following questions: How much financing would be required if
Pakistan wants to achieve its target of full immunization against preventable diseases for
children between 0 and 23 months? And, what would be the subsequent economic
benefits of intervention? Although it is established both globally and nationally that
immunization has been the most cost-effective public health intervention, it is nonetheless
imperative to measure the affordability of immunizations. Pakistan spends less than 1
percent of its GDP on health and it seems crucial to increase fiscal space for health. As
the government aims to move to UHC, and needs to prioritize investments in the health
sector, it is important to have information about the costs and impacts of investments in
order to inform allocation of limited resources.

By estimating the unit cost of immunization and combining this with coverage data from
various rounds of the PDHS and the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement
Survey (PSLMS), two immunization coverage scenarios are constructed to calculate cost-
effectiveness ratios for Pakistan and its provinces. The unit cost estimates of vaccination
are built for future years and cover all aspects of program functions. Based on these unit
cost estimates, the authors built scenarios with and without interventions for the overall
cost and benefit analysis. Ultimately, the findings demonstrate clear economic benefits in
terms of DALYs saved due to expanded immunization in Pakistan. The proposed
intervention is affordable and economically effective with a high rate of return. In addition
to increased investment, the effectiveness of national EPI programs could be enhanced
by increasing the capacity building of health professionals, and managing the logistics of
the interventions to reach marginalized populations, remote areas, and pockets of uptake
resistance.

                                          INTRODUCTION

Immunization is one of the most important advances in public health. Immunization saves
more lives worldwide than any other health intervention. Immunization programs are
responsible for the eradication, elimination, containment, and control of infectious
diseases that were once common globally. Although people can benefit from immunization
at any stage of the life cycle, due to their immature immune systems, infants and young
children particularly benefit from the protection offered by immunization against vaccine-
preventable diseases (VPDs). Immunization offers dual benefits: vaccinated individuals
are directly protected and if a sufficient proportion of the population is vaccinated against
the disease, âherd immunityâ results. 3 According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
immunization annually averts two to three million deaths, in addition to preventing illness
and disability.

Immunization is one of the most cost-effective public health interventions that exist. For
every dollar, invested in childhood immunization, $16 can be saved in health care costs,
wages and productivity due to illness and death. If the full value of people living longer,
healthier lives is taken into account, the return on investment rises to $44. In total,
immunization will yield more than $586 billion in economic benefits from 2011-2020
worldwide (Ozawa et al. 2016).

The cost of implementing an immunization program is typically much less than that of
treating the disease that would otherwise occur (WB 2010). Mounting evidence indicates
that immunization against disease is the most potent tool to reduce the burden of disease
and the single most cost-effective public health intervention. Yet despite the proven public
health benefits of vaccines, inefficient and under-resourced public immunization
interventions in many parts of the world, including Pakistan, result in VPDs that continue
to pose significant and unnecessary costs to individuals and society. Such costs include
those associated with visits to health care providers, hospitalizations, and premature
deaths. To build on the success of the smallpox eradication program, the WHO initiated
the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in 1974 to expand childhood vaccination
worldwide based on global guidelines and standardized vaccination schedules. The EPI
was launched to ensure that all children, in all countries, benefit from life-saving
vaccinations. Pakistan launched the EPI in 1978.

In accord with international standards and through its EPI, Pakistan aims to immunize all
children between 0 and 23 months against eight VPDs, including tuberculosis,
poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenza type b
(Hib), and measles. Newer vaccines that will further extend the EPI are either in the
process of rollout, for example, pneumococcal vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine, or
they are under consideration, for example, rotavirus vaccine, inactivated polio vaccine,
with support from Gavi.

3 Herd immunity or herd effect, also called community immunity, describes a form of immunity that occurs

when the vaccination of a significant portion of a population (or herd) provides a measure of protection for
individuals who have not developed immunity. See T.J. John and R. Samuel. 2000. âHerd immunity and herd
effect: new insights and definitions.â Eur. J. Epidemiol. 16 (7): 601â6. Herd immunity theory proposes that in
contagious diseases that are transmitted from individual to individual, chains of infection are likely to be
disrupted when large numbers of a population are immune or less susceptible to the disease. The greater the
proportion of individuals who are resistant, the smaller the probability that a susceptible individual will come
into contact with an infectious individual.

                                                      13
Immunization coverage in Pakistan remains low and consistently lags behind the regional
median, for reasons explained below. To narrow the gap in coverage, the proposed
Comprehensive Multi-Year Program (CMYP) seeks to increase access to routine
childhood immunization in Pakistan by building upon the EPI framework, and particularly
by focusing on coverage, equity, and quality.

This report presents an economic analysis of EPI. The primary aim of this study was to
assemble evidence for the National Immunization Support Program (NISP) as a financing
tool for the CMYP and to gauge the necessary level of investment to enhance national
immunization coverage under the proposed plan. The authors also provide estimates of
unit cost per child to attain full inoculation against VPDs. The unit cost analysis also
presents aggregated program costs and an economic analysis based on divergent
immunization coverage scenarios. The analysis presented here is disaggregated by
province to inform policymaking at the provincial levels.

The results of this analysis are supported by a global and local literature review of the
economic analysis of immunization. Secondary data from the Pakistan Demographic and
Health Survey (PDHS) 2012-13 and various rounds of Pakistan Social and Living
Standards Measurement Survey (PSLM) are used to build future immunization coverage
scenarios for each province and for Pakistan at the aggregate level. Primary data collected
on the unit cost of immunization is also presented. The WHO methodology for cost
estimation is used and all aspects of program functions are considered as part of the unit
cost of a fully immunized child (WHO 2002). The analysis was enriched by a review of
global immunization commitments and collating local evidence of EPI achievements to
identify neglected areas in the context of financing for immunization. The finding of

                                       BACKGROUND
Pakistan is the worldâs sixth most populous country with a population of 180 million and a
gross national income (GNI) per capita of USD $1,440 in 2015. 4 The under-five mortality
rate remains high, despite a slow decline over the past 10 years. In the last two decades,
more than 400,000 child deaths have occurred annually in this age group. Pakistanâs
decrease in infant and under-five mortality rates lags behind other South Asian countries.

To achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 of reducing child mortality,
Pakistan needed to sustain a reduction in child mortality rates (CMR) of 4.2 per annum
between 2000 and 2015. However, Pakistan only achieved a rate of 1.13 per annum as
of 2012. 5 Because Pakistan has missed immunization targets for VDPs, it consequently
missed CMR rate reduction targets. Immunization coverage in Pakistan remains low. The
proportion of children who are fully immunized is between 43 and 62 percent. The
percentage of immunized children varies considerably across geographic, social, and
cultural boundaries. 6 As a consequence, Pakistan continues to face endemic circulation
of polio and outbreaks of diseases such as measles and diphtheria, diseases which are
almost unheard of in many other countries.

A principal reason for Pakistanâs low immunization coverage rates is inefficiencies in the
health system and inadequate spending on health and education. The combined public
expenditure on these two important sectors was less than 2.5 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) in FY 2012-13âone of the lowest in the region. The entire public
expenditure on health in Pakistan constitutes less than one percent of national spending.
Notably, while Pakistanâs population continues to grow at 2 percent per annum, it has
undergone a major demographic transition over the last 40 years. Its dependency ratio
has declined from 90 percent in the early 1960s to 68 percent today. The immediate
implication of this falling dependency ratio is the increased proportion of the working-age
population. But even the increase in working-age individuals will not translate into a driver
of economic growth if only limited resources continue to be devoted to education and
health, thereby lowering the quality of available human capital in terms of health and
productive skills.

Pakistanâs current political context presents challenges and opportunities to improve
immunization coverage and expand investments in health. Meeting these health
challenges will require strong leadership, good governance, and effective management,
particularly at the provincial and district levels. In the context of the 18th Amendment to
the Constitution, which was passed by Parliament in April 2010, a particular set of issues
remains to implement fundamental reforms, restructure institutions, and strengthen
systems. While the 18th Amendment enhanced provincial autonomy and fiscal space by
devolving federal legislative powers and responsibilities to the provinces, it did not clarify
the federal governmentâs role in national health planning and coordination. In addition, the
EPI campaign faces the emerging concerns of attacks on immunization workers and the

Health service management, including immunization, is now the responsibility of the
provinces. The EPI stewardship function at the federal level is now with the Ministry of
National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination (MONHSRC). Yet, the extent to
which federal roles like policymaking, oversight, and monitoring and evaluation will be
managed by the MONHSRC remains unclear. Despite the existence of serious concerns
about the capacity of provincial governmentsâ EPI programs, the devolution has presented
clear opportunities for increased access, accountability, ownership, and equity in
immunization programs.

PERFORMANCE OF THE EPI

Infant and under-five mortality rates in Pakistan are alarmingly high. The most recent data
indicate that of 1,000 live births, 74 infants and 89 children under five die before their first
and fifth birthdays, respectively. 7 A significant proportion of these deaths are preventable
by immunizing pregnant mothers and children. Since 1978, the EPI has been responsible
for the nationwide immunization of children in Pakistan (Hasan et al 2010). 8 In the early
phase of the program, less than 2 percent of Pakistani children were fully immunized in
1982. This figure quickly rose to 59 percent in 1984 (Ministry of Health 2003). In 1985, the
program was re-launched as the Accelerated Health Program (AHP).

Immunization coverage decreased to 47 percent in the mid-1990s due to donors
withdrawing their financing in early to mid-1990s without commensurate increase in
domestic resources. Coverage, however, improved in 1996 (Ministry of Health 2003).
Another milestone was achieved with the introduction of Gavi support of two new vaccines
in the late 1990s and in 2001, the Hep-B and Hib vaccines. In 2008, the program
introduced the Pentavalent vaccine, which simplifies the schedule for full vaccination to
five visits during the childâs first year of life (WHO). 9, 10

In Pakistan, different data sources show distinct coverage figures for available vaccinesâ
particularly the PSLMS and the PDHS (see Table 1). Even as the PSLMS results indicate
that polio vaccination rose from 58 percent in 1995-96 to 83 percent in 2006-07, PDHS
data show higher figures for polio coverage in Pakistan (see Table 1).11 Though the
program is still far from attaining adequate immunization coverage,12 it is encouraging
that only 5 percent of children did not receive any vaccination in 2012-13, a significant
drop from 28 percent in 1990-91 (PDHS). Undoubtedly, the program can reach the
desirable targets with proper implementation.

Three notable concerns with national immunization coverage can be identified from this
data. First, the results show slow improvement in the proportion of children receiving all
the recommended vaccinations. The latest PDHS 2012-13 demonstrates that just over
half of all children are fully immunized in Pakistan (see Table 1). 13 According to the PDHS,
the proportion of immunized children in Pakistan has increased from 35 percent in 1990-
91 to 54 percent in 2012-13.

Second, the follow up on children for the second and third waves of vaccination is
inadequate. The BCG vaccine administered at the time of birth, for example, constitutes
85 percent of all vaccines administered in the country. While more than three-fourths of
children received the first dose of DPT, only 65 percent were inoculated with all three
doses. Moreover, although 90 percent of children received the first polio vaccine, only 80

11 In PDHS, the respondent is a mother while it is the head of household in PSLM. See Khan and Khan
2012.
12 The objective of the EPI was to achieve 90 percent full immunization coverage and to eradicate measles

by 2010 and interrupt polio virus transmission by 2005.
13 Children are considered to be âfully immunizedâ when they have received one dose of BCG, three doses of

DPT, three doses of polio, and one dose of measles vaccine.

                                                   17
percent received the third dose. Immunity against measles remains most fraught. Only
about two-thirds (61 percent of children from all over the country received the first dose of
the vaccine. These shortcomings are reflected in the recent outbreaks of measles and the
emergence of polio cases in multiple areas of Pakistan. In 2012, officials reported 14,984
confirmed cases of measles to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE). To
mitigate these outbreaks, more systematic and sustained immunization efforts are
required.

Third, marked variations in immunization coverage exist across provinces and districtsâ
as well as by gender (see Table A.8 in Annex I). For instance, the PDHS 2012-13 shows
that the proportion of fully immunized children in Sindh and Balochistan provinces fell from
35 to 16 percent and 37 to 29 percent since 2006-07, respectively (see Table A.10 in
Annex I for full details). As much as one-fifth of infants and children in rural Balochistan
have received any vaccinations (PDHS 2012-13). In contrast, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)
and Punjab provinces have shown steady progress in child immunization rates. The
findings in the PDHS are corroborated by trends shown in PLSMSs, which also reveal
declines in immunization coverage within Balochistan and Sindh in recent years. As
recorded by both PDHS 2012-13 and PSLMS 2011-12, most of the decreased coverage
in Balochistan is attributed to significant drops in coverage for all vaccines except for polio.

The PDHS 2012-13 displays a five percentage point difference in national vaccination
coverage by gender: 56 percent versus 51 for boys and girls. Gender differences within
many provinces are even more significant. A study conducted in four districts of Pakistan
shows that male children in Khairpur were 1.4 times more likely to be vaccinated than
female children, after controlling for all background characteristics (Cockcroft et al 2011).
Urban and rural differentials are just as notable. At the national level, 66 percent of children
in urban areas are vaccinated compared to just 48 percent in rural areas. The figures are
particularly alarming for Sindh and Balochistan. In Sindh province, 51 percent of children
receive vaccines in urban areas, compared to just 14 percent in rural areas. In Balochistan,
these figures are 36 percent and 12 percent, respectively.

CAUSES OF LOW IMMUNIZATION

There are myriad reasons for the persistence of low immunization coverage in Pakistan,
on both the demand and supply side. On the demand side, limited access to immunization
servicesâdue mostly to an inadequate number of vaccinatorsâand lack of information
on the part of parents were found to be the most important reasons for low vaccination
coverage in Pakistan (Hasan et al 2010). According to the Ministry of Health (2003), about
10 percent of families were unwilling to vaccinate their children. Some communities expect
door-to-door service by female health workers, known as Lady Health Workers, while
others categorically reject immunization. The dearth of immunization knowledge among
communities impedes them from actively seeking immunization services.

On the supply side, the poor performance of EPI in Pakistan has been well documented,
particularly in the realm of program governance, performance management, and
accountability. Two studies that reviewed program performance attest that reduced
attention to capacity building of available human resources, local-level planning,
management, logistics, monitoring, evaluation and surveillance has resulted in poor EPI




                                              18
performance (Pildat 2010 and Masud 2012). 14 Additionally, the EPI has not been able to
sustain its human resource development for several reasons, including poor worker
motivation due to low remuneration, political interference, and underutilization of available
human resources, for example, vaccinators and Lady Health Workers, as well as reduced
opportunities for in-service staff capacity building in logistics and monitoring, evaluation,
and surveillance. Moreover, worker fatigue due to regularly conducted campaigns against
polio and other diseases have reduced the worker hours available for EPI. These factors
have resulted in overall underperformance of the program. Furthermore, anecdotal
evidence suggests that program management has also deteriorated over the last decade
due to increased political interference. The recent violent targeting of polio workers and
the staunch opposition against immunization campaigns in selected areas of Pakistan has
emerged as a new barrier, threatening coverage in areas that are particularly affected by
the polio virus.

Lower capacity is also reflected in procurement problems, also contributing to poor EPI
performance (Masud 2012). Procurement of vaccines and other required items, cold chain
monitoring, and maintenance of equipment for the EPI has been poorly managed. With
limited available resources, the procedures and mechanisms needed to manage the
logistic system have been lacking. With the implementation of the 18th Amendment in July
2011âand given the possibility of limited capacity of the provinces for procurementâthis
problem is likely to be aggravated and result in stock-outs, poor quality vaccines, and
overall negative effects on coverage outcomes. World Bank analysis indicates that
Pakistan incurs an average annual loss of PKRs 4 billion due to such inefficiencies in
vaccine procurement and program management, in addition to declines in the quality and
equity of immunization services.

The resource shortage is yet another problem contributing to poor EPI performance.
Additional resources are needed for recurrent expenses, human resource expansion,
capacity building, training, and social mobilization. Even beyond increasing gross
investment, streamlining and consolidating existing financing schemes is necessary to
fundamentally improve EPI performance. The current fragmented financing, which
encompasses multiple funding sources and delayed funding flows reduces program
accountability and threatens financial sustainability.

EXPENDITURES ON IMMUNIZATION

Like many developing countries, out-of-pocket payment is a dominant mode of healthcare
financing in Pakistan. The government expenditure on health does not exceed 0.9 percent
of GDP (Figure 1), while the share of out-of-pocket payment is 1.7 percent of GDP and
86.8 percent of private expenditure on health (World Bank 2014). Experts believe as much
as 0.12 percent of GDP is required to achieve a herd immunity threshold (Ministry of
Health 2003). Health expenditures in Pakistan are low compared to other South Asian
countries. Only Bangladesh and Nepal spend less on health than Pakistan does (see
Table 3). The gap between expenditures in Pakistan and the average expenditures in
South Asia is quite large. Maldives is an outlier among these countries, spending $408.8
per capita on health. Compared to Pakistan, India spends almost double, and Bhutan and
Sri Lanka almost triple. The difference in expenditures is reflected in health indicators such

worse indicators than Pakistan.

After devolution in 2010, responsibility for the EPI shifted to the provincial governments.
The federal EPI cell now has limited responsibilities for procurement, coordination, and
technical guidance (Government of Pakistan 2012-13). The EPI is implemented through
2,649 fixed health centers, 4,564 outreach health teams, 98 mobile teams, vaccination
camps, and trained Lady Health Workers (LHWs) from the provincial departments of
health. The program is financed by the government budget with support from WHO,
UNICEF, Rotary International, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)
along with Gavi.

The EPI immunizes approximately five million children every year. The 2008 cost of
immunization was USD $104,313,977, roughly USD $24.51 to fully immunize a child
(Hasan et al 2010). 15 The cost of immunization can be reduced considerably by achieving
universal immunization coverage due to the external benefits of herd immunity and scale
economies. The 2014 cost of the EPI was estimated at USD $137.5 million (Federal EPI
Cell 2009), using the 2001-15 Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (CMYP) to estimate the
total costs of the national program. This study adopted a different approach to collecting
primary data by aggregating data for each of the program components from all provinces,
using the PIFRA and other secondary documents.




15The study assumed 77 percent coverage rate as per PSLM 2004-05 and a target of immunizing 5.8 million
children.

 PROPOSED MITIGATION THROUGH CMYP AND NISP

 The Government of Pakistan has endorsed a national comprehensive multi-year plan for
 immunization (CMYP) to align coverage with global best practices and to mitigate the
 difficulties discussed above. The National Immunization Support Project (NISP) is being
 prepared as a financing mechanism for the CMYP, and it is coordinating results-based
 financial support from Gavi, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
 (BMGF). NISP seeks to bolster the existing EPI initiative through financial investment,
 programmatic reform, and efficiency correction. Each of these mitigation measures is
 addressed in turn.

 First, the NISP includes an infusion of financing through a single platform to coordinate
 international support to expand immunization coverage. Increased investment is coupled
 with the use of standard government budgetary and accounting mechanisms to track and
 record expenditures over time, thereby promoting transparency in fund flows. The majority
 of funds will be administered directly by the Provincial Departments of Finance to reduce
 financing delays and improve disbursement efficiency. Administering financing through
 standardized pipelines will streamline national access to donor funds and improve
 accountability and sustainability.

 Second, the NISP focuses on bolstering programmatic governance, performance, and
 accountability. Its performance-based financing structureâincluding the use of
 disbursement linked indicators (DLI)âaligns incentives for success in health and finance
 throughout the district, provincial, and federal levels by linking fund flows to an array of
 results indicators. A portion of the programâs concomitant investment is allotted to building
 management and reporting systems provincially. These systems are to be paired with the
 provision of finance at the federal level to build coordination, standards, and reporting
 capacity nationwide.

 Third, a core goal of the NISP is to correct inefficiencies in the present immunization
 program and increase public expenditures on immunization. The focus will be primarily on
 strengthening procurement systems for current and new vaccines. Procurement

                                                   21
improvements will be paired with accurate tracking systems of vaccine stocks, which will
ensure an uninterrupted feedback loop for inventory and cold chain management. NISP
also will build management capacity at the federal and provincial levels. These
improvements will allow the program to reap economies of scale and reduce wastage,
thereby decreasing the overall unit cost of immunization relative to the baseline.

The CMYP proposes a substantial expansion of coverage and a programmatic overhaul
of immunization services in Pakistan. To quantitatively model this proposed expansion,
we offer below an economic analysis of the EPI, both at baseline extrapolation and with
predictions, including the investments proposed under NISP, and the total amount of
investment needed to meet NISP goals for enhancing national immunization coverage.
The analysis provides unit cost measures per child to achieve full vaccination against
VPDs. The unit costs enable top-level deduction of aggregated program costs, alongside
a country-level fiscal analysis of divergent immunization coverage scenarios. The analysis
is further disaggregated at the provincial level to inform policymaking under the newly
devolved framework.

The cost and financing measures produced by this analysis are critical to the sustainability
and impact of the CMYP. Not only can these assessments facilitate federal and provincial
preparation for coverage expansion, but they can also facilitate programmatic planning on
a range of dimensions, including fund flows, resource mobilization, and system design. To
illustrate, provincial variations in unit costs of vaccinationâwhich, as demonstrated below,
can be significantâcan inform disbursement levels throughout the country. Understanding
also can improve the precision of the budgeting process for immunization, thereby
enabling finances to be directed towards issues of highest need. Furthermore, cost
estimates will provide benchmarks for intermediate and end-program evaluations, thereby
ensuring that funds are being accountably and sustainably spent. Perhaps most crucially,
these estimates can guide the overall level of investment made by the NISP by identifying
the precise level of funds required to meet the coverage enhancement targets.

              INVESTIGATION INTO UNIT COST ANALYSIS

We approximated the unit cost of immunization for coverage across regions in Pakistan.
The estimates were used to build scenarios regarding equitable coverage for
immunization against preventable diseases for children between 0 and 23 months and
subsequently to estimate the economic benefits of intervention. Given that Pakistan
spends less than 1 percent of its GDP on health, an increase in EPI coverage will increase
public expenditures, even with a highly favorable cost-effectiveness ratio of intervention.
Keeping in view the meager resource available to the health sector, it is essential for
program managers and policy makers alike to estimate the total and incremental cost of
coverage expansion in Pakistan. It bears noting that the focus of the NISP financeâand
accordingly, the analysis hereâis on routine immunization (RI), as opposed to
supplemental or acute immunization campaigns. RI involves regular, programmatic
outreach on a year-around basis, in contrast to the sudden, short-term initiatives often
conducted in response to epidemics or disease outbreaks.

METHODOLOGY AND APPROACH TO ESTIMATE UNIT COSTS
This section describes the methodology adopted to estimate the unit cost of delivering
child immunization services in Pakistan and its provinces. The unit costs are estimated as
per the WHO methodology (see Appendix A for details). In brief, this standardized method
involves isolating programmatic inputs, quantifying them, and weighting them by unit
prices and the utilization rates to derive an aggregate cost measure. The PIFRA database
at the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) officeâwhich consolidates health
expenditures data at the federal, provincial and district levelsâis the main source of unit
costs. Unit cost data include personnel, vaccine, supply, medical equipment, delivery
system, salaries and wages obtained from DDO level data. In addition, the analysis is
conducted keeping in view the post 18th Amendment scenario in which provincial
governments are responsible for preparing and implementing their own coverage plans.
Therefore, the authors made several visits to provinces to collate cost data on
immunization from respective EPI officials.
The data on cost was collected using a top-down approach (see Figure 2). The existing
immunization program mechanism in Pakistan takes the shape of a pyramid. The federal
government is responsible for developing national policy, hosting technical advisory group
meetings, procuring vaccines, and managing central control storage. Provincial and
district governments are responsible for immunization program execution and all operating
costs. The data collection exercise began with the Federal EPI cell to obtain all information
pertaining to existing implementation arrangements. Relevant financial information was
obtained from the PIFRA system available at the AGPR office. The immunization program
expenditures are also available from NAM Chart of Accounts, which are classified on the
basis of input costs identified in the terms of reference.

The representation of the information collection approach in Figure 2 helps to define the
boundaries of the program, to explain the distribution of roles among provinces, and to
indicate the immunization process flow in the country. A function-input cost approach (see
Figure 3) is adopted by linking cost components to specific functions within the
immunization process, thereby ensuring that each step of the immunization process has
been accounted for and all input costs have been incorporated into the final unit cost (see
Annex II, Table A.1).

UNIT COST OF VACCINE DELIVERY PER IMMUNIZATION
Based on provincial primary data for 2011-12, the
cost of fully immunizing a child in Pakistan is          Table 4. Unit Cost (USD/ FIC)
estimated at USD $64. Estimates for different
provinces are produced in Table 4. The aggregate          Unit Cost     Base 2011-12
cost figure for Pakistan is derived from a weighted
average of provincial costs by population size, which     Pakistan           64.2
varies substantially across provinces. Punjab has the
                                                           Punjab            60.8
lowest unit costs for fully immunized child (FIC) at
USD $61, while Balochistan has the highest at USD          Sindh             65.4
$81. The principal reason for this difference is
population density. The more densely populated               KP              69.7
urban areas require lower per capita resources to Balochistan                80.9
provide health facilities and incur lower travel costs
while reaching a higher proportion of the local population with immunization services.
Rural facilities also have greater cold chain and vaccine management challenges, which
increase wastage rates. Balochistan is the least dense, most rural, and largest province
in Pakistan. Therefore, it is unsurprising that it has the lowest and most stagnant
vaccination coverage with the highest immunization unit cost of any province.
The unit costs are also linearly projected for future periods as well (see Table 4.1). For
instance, in FY 2019-20, the cost of a FIC in Pakistan is projected to be USD $99. In the
terminal year of the analysis (FY 2029-30), the cost of FIC is projected to reach USD $169
in Pakistan and USD $212 for Balochistan). The cost increase projection incorporates
expected depreciation of local currency, expected inflation, and population-demographic
trends.

      PROGRAM COST AND ECONOMIC RETURNS ANALYSIS
METHODOLOGY AND DATA USED
The methods applied and the assumptions used to create two scenarios at the national
and sub-national levels in our economic analysis are described here. Both service and
survey statistics are obtained through sources that are identified under each table and in
the figures presented below. The unit cost estimates and the projections presented in the
previous section are used here as inputs (see Tables 4 and 4.1).
The following steps were undertaken in preparation of the analysis:
   1. Birth cohort projections based on demographic data were prepared.
   2. Vaccination actual coverage was estimated based on representative national
      surveys.
   3. Burden of disease information was incorporated in terms of DALYs.
   4. Vaccine efficacy was incorporated based on expert opinion and past studies.
   5. Provincial data were assembled on the unit cost of vaccine and the delivery
      required for full immunization.
   6. Cost in terms of USD $and coverage data for each province was combined.
   7. Gap in coverage in terms of numbers of births and its cost was estimated.
   8. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the vaccination program was
      estimated using alternative scenarios.
   9. Return on investment was estimated.
Population and birth cohorts were based on One Health software that takes into account
a host of variables from the latest PDHS. Provincial population shares were made using
data from the Population Council (see Provincial Profiles 2013, Annex Table-A.2). The
One Health software projections are based on age-specific fertility rates (ASFR),
population age structures, and annual population growth rates from Pakistanâs 1998
population census. Demographic data used in this study includes successive annual birth
cohorts and are not adjusted for death rates. WHO methodology is adopted in the analysis,
which suggests that for the purpose of forecasting vaccine supply, the total number of
births is recommended as the denominated benchmark for population scaling. This
generates the safest estimate and thus ensures that sufficient vaccine is procured (WHO
guidelines 2002).
The noteworthy implication of falling fertility rates on population projection is that future
birth cohorts in Pakistan will start to fall gradually after FY 2016-17 (Kugelman and
Hathaway 2009). This will affect our analysis in two ways: (1) proportional coverage will
improve as the target population will be reduced by 20,000 to 40,000 annually until 2020;
(2) the real impact of declining fertility will be felt after the completion of the current CMYP
financed through NISP, when Pakistan will reach replacement level fertility.
To determine the future cost of immunization for Pakistan and its provinces, two coverage
scenarios were built starting from FY 2014-15 to 2029-30. The first scenario (S1) is based
on past provincial trends as noted in the PSLM and PDHS. It assumes that no significant
additional efforts are made to improve coverage rates and that provinces will maintain the
status quo after devolution. In this scenario, coverage rates are accordingly assumed to
increase by 0.05 percentage points annually for each province. The second scenario (S2)
assumes implementation of the CMYP for immunization, including NISP financing, where
additional funding and capacity building efforts are designed to improve immunization
rates through 2030. The provinces of Balochistan and Sindh are assumed to adopt a faster


                                              27
pace of immunization adoption, an additional 8 and 6 percentage points, respectively.
These scenarios are based on expert opinion and past observed trends and behavior of
provinces. The base year values for both scenarios remain the same as in S1 (see FY
2011-12, Table 7). Finally, the cost effectiveness ratios are calculated for each FY using
following formula:




The ICER is suitable where decisions are to be made on alterative scenarios. It is
calculated in USD $per DALYs savedâa measure of effectiveness. The WHO has set
thresholds for different regions to grade interventions as âvery cost-effective,â âcost-
effectiveâ or ânot economically viable.â In accordance with these guidelines, if the ICER is
less than per capita GDP, then it is âvery cost-effective,â and if it exceeds three times per
capita GDP, then it is deemed ânot economically viable.â Incremental cost-effectiveness
analysis requires two or more options to construct net cost and net benefits of alternate
scenarios.
Table 5 provides specific details on different parameters used to obtain economic
analyses for this report, including a per capita GDP threshold for Pakistan. 16 Provincial
GDP figures are referenced in the base year 2005-06, and a 6 percent growth rate is
assumed after 2017. 17

shows the percent of children who will be fully immunized given assumed scenarios. If

18 Disability-adjusted life year (DALY). One DALY means one lost year of healthy life. DALYs were first used
in The Global Burden of Disease and Injury (GBD) study, a joint study of the World Bank, the World Health
Organization (WHO) and Harvard School of Public Health. DALY is a standard measure used in quantifying
societal burden of disease. Data source for DALY is taken from Pakistan Global Burden of Disease Study

past trends are followedâand no additional intervention is undertakenâthen Pakistan will
fully immunize 52 percent of children in 2014-15. In the case of intervention through the
CMYP supported by NISP, an estimated 60 percent of children will be immunized in the
same year. It is assumed that the 80 percent coverage targets for all provinces in FY19-
20 will be achieved.

Table 8 shows total coverage costs under the two scenarios, as well as additional costs
incurred as a result of improved coverage, with respect to the coverage differences in S2
and S1 scenarios. Pakistan will require expenditures of USD $257 million to USD $412
annually until 2025 if it follows scenario S2. In contrast, to reach 90 percent coverage
targets, Pakistan would need an investment of USD $731 million in the terminal year of
this analysis (see Table 8). If the past trend (S1) continues and minimal increases in
coverage rate are achieved, then Pakistan will require USD $218-288 million for the next
five years until FY 2018-19. This in effect constitutes baseline spending on vaccination.
Therefore, an additional USD $38 to 111 million per annum are necessary to increase EPI
coverage of the country from 57 percent in 2014-15 to 76 percent in FY 2018-19 to achieve
S2 targets. This increased investment estimate reflects declining FIC unit costs due to
wastage reductions, which is explained further below.
These estimated unit costs vary by province. For example, because Punjab is the most
populated province, it would require a comparatively larger investment. According to the
projected financial outlays, Punjab would require USD $155-216 million to increase
coverage under S2. Notably, if NISP intervention (S2) is adopted to achieve higher targets,
then the gap between costs under S1 and S2 widens in future periods. However, to sustain
S2 targets in the last year of the project, Balochistan would have to spend three times
more than its S1 expenditure. For Sindh, doubling S1 expenditures would be necessary.

Figure 4 shows EPI expenditure as a percentage of GDP under different scenarios for
Pakistan and its provinces. Notably, the expenditures remain below 0.2 percent
throughout the period of analysis for Pakistan and for all provinces under both scenarios.
Over time, the EPI outlays increase due to rising annual birth cohorts in initial years, and
then gradually fall as total fertility rates decrease and the size of birth cohorts consequently
falls as well. Though the impact of decreases in fertility rates is more prominent in Punjab,
where outlays fall as a percentage of GDP, these have significant impact at the national
level as well. Because of this decrease, even after doubling the cost of immunization, EPI
expenditures as percent of GDP would remain less than 0.40 percent.

  Table 9 presents resources needed to achieve different coverage targets for FY 2014-15.
  The cost of fully immunizing 60 percent, 65 percent, and 70 percent of children nationwide
  is estimated, and then differences in coverage scenarios are tabulated. Pakistan needs
  an additional USD $44 million to immunize 60 percent of its children, USD $65 million for
  65 percent of the children, and USD $85 million to immunize 70 percent of its children. If
  the target of 60 percent is achieved, then about 3.41 million children will be immunized.
  These figures are 3.69 million and 3.98 million for the 65 percent and 70 percent targets.

  EFFICIENCY GAINS THROUGH COVERAGE IMPROVEMENTS
  The WHO and UNICEF guidelines indicate that national immunization programs must
  cover all districts. Reaching national-level targets is meaningless if even a few districts lag
  behind. In Pakistan, even though national level coverage is improving at a very slow rate

                                                32
   in a number of districts, the situation is deteriorating. Although 10 districts have shown
   improvements in coverage, 22 districts have immunization rates below 20 percent (see
   Table 10). Substantial variation in coverage exists across individual districts but the reality
   is hidden beneath provincial and national figures. Pakistanâs first priority should be to
   eliminate the differentials in coverage across districts. An essential first step will be to
   improve the mechanisms for tracking and verifying data on coverage and program
   performance. The efficiency of the program will increase if the provincial EPI offices
   convert the current high-level EPI plans into digitized micro-level plans that contain much
   greater detail. The aim must be to produce revised, computerized micro-plans for at least
   80 percent of union councils at the district and provincial levels, and then to ensure that
   all districts report on progress via integrated management information and evaluation
   systems to ensure completeness in coverage.

   The expansion program can improve its effectiveness with online surveillance, including
   zero-cost reporting for VPDs, and an adverse effects following immunization (AEFI)
   system for 80 percent of all district health facilities. Micro plans that have area maps,
   estimations of the target population in each community, vaccine logistics, and HR
   requirements are essential to equitable planning. Calculations for target coverage,
   identification of high-risk areas, and procurement of vaccines and syringes should be
   facilitated by effective planning and management, which would also reduce waste. Timely
   aggregation at the union council level will improve management function. Thus, data will
   be readily available for monitoring and analysis of union-council coverage and can be
   aggregated upstream to observe tehsil and district level coverage. Integration of
   computerized micro plans into existing health management information system (HMIS) will
   improve management function and evidence-based decision making, thus bringing
   positive returns in terms of improved coverage at lower costs.
   The success of immunization programs depends heavily upon vaccine inventory
   management, including proper storage and handling of vaccines. As per specifications, all
   health facilities require at least 95 percent of functional cold chain equipment at all levels.
   This will increase the benefits of vaccination. The failure to adhere to cold chain
   requirements may reduce vaccinesâ efficacy, resulting in lack of protection against VPDs
   despite inoculation. The loss of vaccine effectiveness due to nonfunctional cold chain is
   cumulative, permanent, and irreversible. The proposed intervention will prove to be a cost

                                                         33
saving strategy since vaccines may be wasted if they are exposed to extremely low or
high temperature, resulting in increased costs to replace the wasted vaccines, human
services, and specialized transportation. Indirectly, this intervention is also expected to
bring net positive economic returns through improvement in system efficiency.
Efficiency gains are possible through awareness campaigns on electronic media,
disaggregated by provinces. The low coverage ratio in Pakistan pertains not only to supply
side problems, but also serious demand side issues as well. For instance, a significant
number of parents, especially in rural and tribal areas, are non-literate or uneducated
about health issues, particularly the importance of vaccination. Data reveals that among
non-immunized children, 45 percent were not immunized due to misconceptions about the
efficacy of immunization, fear of side effects, and lack of knowledge about immunization
(see Table 11). Parents ignore the importance of vaccination against VPDs and are
generally unaware of the consequences of not immunizing their children. As such, many
children are vaccinated only if the facility is provided at their doorstep, as parents do not
assume responsibility to immunize their children. Some parents reject the immunization
of their children, even if the government provides the service.

Moreover, due to security threats for vaccinators in Pakistan, workers are unable to
provide services in higher-risk regions unless protected by local communities. Only when
reluctant parents are willing to vaccinate their children can efforts to improve coverage be
increased. Addressing these issues through behavioral change communication
campaignsâparticularly addressing misconceptions and mythsâwill facilitate
immunization coverage. This component, in alignment with supply-side intervention, is
expected to bring positive economic returns through improved coverage and greater
DALYs saved.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF INTERVENTION
For the economic evaluation of intervention, two criteria were used. First, the cost of one
DALY saved was compared with per capita GDP. And second, if relevant, the cost of one
DALY saved is compared with a higher threshold set at three times the per capita GDP.
As described above, incremental cost-effective ratios are calculated using net costs as the
numerator (S2 â S1 cost) and net benefit as denominator (S2 DALYS saved â S1 DALYs
saved). It can be seen from Table 12 that the cost of one DALY saved is significantly less
than the per capita GDP of Pakistan, and this holds true for all provinces. The cost per
DALY saved is highest in Balochistan followed by KP, Sindh and then Punjab. Even in
Balochistan, however, the incremental cost of coverage is less than half of per capita GDP.
Results thereby remain below both threshold values and, most importantly, effectiveness
increases with increases in coverage during the project life cycle.

RETURNS ON INVESTMENT UNDER NISP
The net present value of the proposed interventions, though difficult to estimate, is
positive. Within the CMYP, the proposed NISP program will improve immunization
coverage in a number of ways: (1) by strengthening management, governance, and
stewardship functions (2) by addressing the fundamental systemic weaknesses that
underlie poor performance and accountability of EPI in Pakistan; by improving service
delivery performance through increasing equitable access to EPI services at the union-
council (UC) level by improved planning, management of human resources and
strengthened supply chain management at the point of service delivery; (3) by demand
generation through exploring and expanding innovative strategies to empower
communities to access immunization services and promote positive behaviors for
acceptance and seeking of immunization services; and (4) by improving capacity in
technical areas for increased immunization coverage through strengthening of the federal
EPI cell in national coordination, project management, and analytic capacities as well as
health system strengthening elements.



                                              35
The NISP financing model is designed to address current weaknesses in immunization
financing by:
     a)   Providing a single financing platform to coordinate multiple sources of
          international support for Routine Immunization e.g., World Bank, Gavi, the Gates
          Foundation, and USAID,
     b)   Using standard government budgetary and accounting mechanisms to deliver the
          majority of funds directly to the federal Ministry of Finance and provincial
          Departments of Finance.
     c)   Introducing a performance-based financing structure to incentivize outcomes
          which are aligned with the endorsed national comprehensive multi-year plan for
          immunization.
     d)   Addressing serious program inefficiencies by building management capacity,
          accurate tracking of vaccine stocks, and immunization coverage.
The current proposed financing package comprises: (1) USD $50M World bank IDA credit,
(2) USD $25M buy-down from the Gates Foundation: conditional on results, which would
convert the USD $50 million IDA loan into a USD $31.3 million loan free of interest and
service charges, (3) A multi-donor trust fund held at the World Bank and disbursed
together with the IDA credit, with initial contributions of a USD $80M grant from Gavi and
a USD $10M grant from USAID (to be confirmed) and (4) a USD $20M grant from the
World Bank Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) supported by the Department
for International Development, United Kingdom (DfID) and the Government of Norway in
year two.
Excluding the ultimate increase in coverage ratio, the benefits of the projectâespecially
in terms of demand generation, enhanced capacity of the concerned staff, and improved
governanceâcannot be easily translated into monetary terms. Therefore, this economic
analysis makes use of quantitative data along with qualitative analysis. The overall
benefits of the project include better use of public and donorsâ funds for immunization,
improved service delivery, result-based management, better micro-plans based planning,
and enhanced demand for immunization. The project aims at improving capacity in
technical areas and improving human resource management, both of which will improve
internal capacity, resulting in a more qualified workforce available to run the federal EPI
cell. Furthermore, more informed decisions in planning at the UC level would be taken.
The strengthened supply chain management, along with positive behaviors of
communities for acceptance and seeking of immunization services, will increase the
overall coverage ratio.
NISP intends to increase the coverage ratio from 54 percent in 2012-13 (PDHS) to 80
percent in 2019-2020, as the success of immunization programs more generally depends
heavily upon high immunization coverage ratios of the target group. To this end, the
project sets coverage targets for the next five years, and the following economic analysis
is based on three scenarios of burden of disease from VPD for the under-five population.
This analysis assumes three scenarios with different DALYs: (i) a low scenario of 39,156
DALYs per 100,000; (ii) a mean scenario of 56,984 DALYs; and (iii) a high scenario of
85,229 DALYs per 100,000. 19

According to the high scenario the project will save about 1.16 million DALYs 20 over five
years (see Table 13). The minimum discounted 21 economic value of this achievement is
USD $1,719 million, 22 and total present value of the benefits would be many times higher
than the above figure since benefits will increase beyond the allotted five-year period,
even as costs decline. For instance, total DALYs saved over the next 16 years until 2030
are estimated 3.34 million, which would contribute in present value terms USD $5,491
million. The estimated DALYs averted, according to the mean scenario, are 0.4 million
over the next five years and about 1.7 million by the end of 2030. The corresponding
figures of economic gains are USD $590 million and USD $2,816 million. Finally, under
the low scenario, the project is expected to save 0.27 million DALYs over the life of the
project and 1.17 million by the end of 2030. The corresponding monetary gains are USD




20 Calculations of DALYs are based on the projectâs target of 80 percent coverage.
21 Economic analysis assumes 3 percent discount rate.
22 DALYs saved are multiplied by the discounted value of per capita GDP. The maximum gain can be found

by multiplying DALYs saved by three times per capita GDP.

economically feasible. 23

COST-SAVING AND EFFICIENCY GAINS
In addition to the return on investment cited in Table 14, additional savings can be
generated from improvements in EPI coverage and resultant declines in unit costs. For
example, the needs assessment for vaccine procurement under the present arrangements
is based on an estimation of total annual births. This assumption incorporates intrinsic
wastage in vaccine procurement and administration by procuring greater levels of supplies
than required in practice. Since not all children actually become immunized, wastage of
procured vaccines results due to overestimating the required procurement levels. And
since vaccine supplies in excess of demand simply turn to waste, the resultant overhead
costs can be reduced substantially by increasing coverage through planning, diligent
monitoring, and governance. These adjustments will directly result in unit cost declines
from improving vaccine utilization.
The total extent of savings can be tabulated through differences in coverage between the
S1 and S2 scenarios. The S2 scenario incorporates waste reductions. Wastage rates are

assumed to be a constant 5 percent for vaccines per annum. Nonetheless, the estimates
likely understate potential savings. Wastage rates are typically higher for monovalent
vaccines due to the increased storage required per FIC among other reasons. Additional
potential savings from reducing waste in the NISP intervention amount to nearly USD $90

23The analysis in main text assumed 17 percent vaccine efficacy. Nonetheless, if we assume higher vaccine
efficacy then economic benefits would increase. For instance, at 30 percent vaccine efficacy, above discussed
high, mean, and low scenarios would yield $7432 million, $4969 million and $3414 million respectively.

million during the project period, assuming that all waste is eliminated (see Figure 5).
Among the provinces, savings are higher for Sindh and Balochistan, primarily because
coverage rates are low in these regions relative to the population size, meaning that
wastage rates are comparatively high. Overall, as can be seen in the following graph, the
rate of saving increases with each year of the project and continues beyond the formal
length of the intervention, given that systems put in place by NISP will be sustained beyond
the life of the project.
Even beyond direct wastage reductions, there is reason to expect declines in unit costs of
FIC over time. Improvements in vaccine and cold chain technology will continue to reduce
spoiling of vaccines and create lower-cost supply chains. As vaccine multivalence
increases, FIC unit costs will also decline, as noted above. Innovations in delivery could
reduce transport costs of renewed supplies. These trends are not explicitly modeled here
to ensure a conservative savings estimate, but nonetheless the cost-efficacy of the
proposed intervention over the ensuing years is even more favorable than estimated.

                                   CONCLUSIONS

Based on available data on public finance and health outcomes, the authors sought to
understand the financial cost of the CMYP and NISP intervention that aims to fully
immunize children between 0 and 23 months against preventable diseases. Efficiencies
delivered under the NISP financing mechanism were particularly considered. The analysis
demonstrated clear economic benefits and efficacy of this intervention in terms of DALYs
saved. The analysis also established that the proposed intervention is affordable and
economically effective with a high rate of return. The minimum discounted value for this
project is USD $435 million and the maximum is USD $1,719 million, based on low to high
DALYs saved by the end of the project in 2019-20. Such benefits would climb even higher
by 2029-30, at an estimated USD $1,796 million to USD $5,491 millionâfigures that far
exceed the costs of the intervention. All cost-effective ratios remain well within the WHO
thresholds set for this region.
Based on these results, increased investment in immunization is affordable and would
generate substantial economic returns for Pakistan. It is worth noting that this intervention
is economically feasible even with conservative assumptions of benefitsânamely, where
the estimate of DALYs saved is low and vaccine efficacy is assumed at only 17 percent.
Thus, the program can yield higher returns if vaccine storage can be improved, which can
be achieved by establishing and reinforcing online surveillance, improving monitoring of
vaccine logistics, and building staff capacity. Finally, reductions in vaccine wastage can
save nearly UD$86 million over the life of the project. These projections rest on
conservative assumptions that set aside expected unit cost declines of FIC by way of
technological development.
Nevertheless, the report highlighted that in addition to increased investment, the
effectiveness of the EPI could be enhanced by improving the capacity building of health
professionals, as well as by improving logistics of program interventions to reach
marginalized populations, remote areas, and pockets of resistance. As the estimated
affordability of enhanced coverage suggests, increased financial investment alone will be
insufficient to address the root causes of persistent under-coverage in Pakistan. It is
imperative that ample attention and resources be diverted to strengthen the procurement
systems, local and provincial management capacity, and reporting mechanisms, among
other capacity improvements. Such improvements would increase the value for each
dollar spent and augment the intervention along dimensions of quality and equity.
The economics analysis also suggests the need to weigh a broader array of
considerations to effectively target the intervention. For example, the higher FIC unit costs
in rural regions suggest the need for a particular allocation of funds and focus within the
program on these areas of Pakistan. Balochistan, for instance, showed a FIC that is
roughly 30 percent higher than the countrywide medianâa figure larger than per capita
GNPâfor reasons that rest in part on cultural variations in the local perception of
immunization services. The reasons for higher wastage in such areas are not entirely
economic. Understanding the phenomenon will be crucial for a project that seeks
fundamentally to increase demand for vaccination services, lest wastage costs climb too
high. Already, FIC unit costs exceed previous literature averages of approximately $24-28
(Brenzel and Politi 2012 and Hasan 2010). These differences stem from a variety of
factors, spanning political economy constraints, as increased devolution has hampered
coordination and scale economies; cultural reductions in willingness-to-vaccinate,
resulting in increased wastage; and even currency fluctuations that alter supply costs, to


                                             40
name just a few. Integrating this interplay of sociological, political, financial, and cultural
drivers with economic factors will strengthen the reach and efficacy of national efforts to
enhance EPI.
Finally, regional and gender disparities will have to be challenged. Data reveals that while
10 districts have increased immunization coverage, there are 22 districts that still possess
immunization rates below 20 percent. The priority should be to address differentials in
coverage across districts and regions to ensure equitability. Most importantly, different
provinces have cited distinctions in cultural motivations for declining to vaccinate children.
The program must reach these marginalized segments of society and devise plans to
overcome societal resistance. This is a matter as much of efficiency as equity.

UNIT COST OF FULLY IMMUNIZED CHILD
Table A.1 presents the unit cost in USD dollars for a FIC for Pakistan as a whole and for each
province from 2013 until 2030, assuming a 5.5 percent annual inflation rate. The methodology
used to derive unit cost is explained in Annex II. The unit cost is lowest in the more densely
populated province of Punjab and highest in Balochistan. The unit cost in 2030 is approximately
two and half times more than the current cost.

PROJECTION OF ANNUAL BIRTHS IN PAKISTAN
Table A.2 presents successive birth cohorts, that is, the annual number of births for Pakistan and
its provinces. The current year figures are from the most recent nationally representative surveys.
Population projection software is used for future birth cohort projections. The data in Table A.2
estimate the size of interventions needed to achieve the target coverage ratio. About 5.6 million
children born each year in Pakistan need to be vaccinated. More than half of these expected
births will occur in Punjab. Data in Table A.2 also show that the birth cohort is expected to decline
after 2016 due to lower fertility rates, which will also lower the burden of immunization. In the
province of Punjab, where fertility regulation is high, the fertility rate is lower, despite its dense
population. Declining provincial annual birth rates will be reflected in a decreased birth cohort in
Pakistan overall.

COVERAGE RATIO AND THE TARGET POPULATION
Two scenarios are assumed with regards to immunization coverage. The first scenario (S1)
assumes that the past trend of increase in coverage will continue in the future. The second
scenario (S2) is built under the NISP intervention, which is expected to significantly increase
immunization coverage. The past trend is estimated on the basis of various rounds of Pakistan
Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS 1991, 2007, 2012) and Pakistan Social Living Standards
Measurement Survey (PSLM 2000 to 2012). The past trend shows that immunization rates
increase by 1 percentage point annually. However, under NISP intervention, an annual increase
of 3-8 percentage points is assumed. Combining the target population from Table A.2 (above)
with the following Table A.3 will help to build various coverage scenarios and the estimated
expenditure to immunize children in Pakistan. The scenario of coverage data on immunization
will determine the level of effort that is required to eliminate vaccine preventable disease in
Pakistan.

Results in Table A.2 and A.3 are further combined to find the target population in numbers under
the two scenarios. The data in Table A.4 reflect incremental effort required to increase
immunization each year. By the end of year 2030, nearly 130,000 additional children in Pakistan
will be immunized compared to the previous year.

COST OF IMMUNIZING CHILDREN
The above tables show that the number of children increases with the increase in immunization
coverage ratio, which will require additional resources to immunize the increased number of
children. Table A.5 shows the expenditures required to immunize the number of children
presented in Table A.4. In the base year 2012, these expenditures were 173 million USD.
Assuming an increase in the price of vaccines and an increase in the immunization coverage
ratio, this amount is expected to increase to USD 534 million under S1, during which 67 percent
children will be immunized. In S2, however, about 90 percent of the children targeted to be
immunized will require expenditures estimated at USD 731 million.

BENEFITS OF IMMUNIZATION
The benefit of immunization can be measured by the number of DALYs saved by effective
immunization. One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life. The DALYs per birth from VPD are
taken from the burden of VPDs data for Pakistan, published by Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation (IHME 2013) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 1990-2010. Three scenarios with
respect to DALYS are built: Low (39,156/ 100,000 births), Medium (56,984/ 100,000 births) and
High (85,229/ 100,000 births). The IHME GBD data is available for all child deaths. It was further
assumed that only 17 percent of child deaths are preventable through vaccines, that is, vaccine
preventable deaths (VPD). Therefore, DALYs were deflated to 17 percent to arrive at the
conservative figure used in the analysis (see Table A6).

The economic benefit of immunization can be approximated by multiplying the countryâs per capita
GDP by the DALYs saved by immunization. Table A.7 presents the current and future projected
GDP per capita of Pakistan. Table A.7 shows that the ICER of immunization for the terminal year
of this analysis will remain below the WHO threshold for Pakistan.

UNIT COST ESTIMATION
            Data Collection Method and Approach to Estimate Unit Cost
The data on cost is collected using a top down approach. Pakistanâs existing immunization
mechanism is pyramid shaped. The federal government is responsible for developing
national policy, hosting technical advisory group meetings, procuring vaccines, and
controlling central storage. The provincial and district governments are responsible for
executing vaccinations and all operating cost. The data collection exercise started by
obtaining all information pertaining to the existing implementation arrangement from the
federal EPI cell. The financial information was obtained where available from the PIFRA
system, which is maintained at the Accountant General Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) office.
The immunization program expenditures are also available from the NAM Chart of
Accounts, which are classified on the basis of input cost identified in the terms of
reference. The following approach was used for information gathering.

The structure depicted in Figure B.1 helps to define the program boundaries, clarify the
distribution of roles among provinces, and document the flow of the immunization process
in the country. The associated cost components for each activity within the process flow
include, e.g., procurement of vaccines and the associated cost components, including the
price of vaccines, freight, insurance, etc. The function-input cost approach links the cost
components to activities/ functions within the immunization process and ensures that
every activity/ function of the immunization process is accounted for and all input costs
are incorporated into the final unit cost (see Table B.1).

 Unit Cost Estimation
 Unit costs are defined as the cost of immunizing a child once with a single antigen. The unit cost is
 calculated on a full cost basis, taking into account all resources being employed for immunization. For the
 purpose of costing, we employ the financial cost method, which measures resources in terms of
 expenditures incurred or money paid for the actual resources consumed. Therefore, opportunity cost will
 not figure in this unit cost of immunization. The annual average unit cost is calculated as follows:
      Average unit cost per annum = Total cost incurred for delivery of vaccine injection to child
                                               Number of contacts* during the year
      Total cost incurred for delivery of vaccine to child = Direct cost + Apportioned indirect cost
      Direct cost = Cost for which benefit is directly traceable to the final output. (e.g., price of vaccine, salaries
                         of vaccinators, etc.)
      Indirect cost = All overhead costs, including utilities, management costs, etc.
 *A contact is defined as vaccine injection delivery to the child through a fixed center, outreach, and mobile
 teams. It is the basic unit of output for which cost is to be ascertained. In our analysis, immunization is a
 function of the number of contacts. Thus, if there are six contacts per child as per the national immunization
 schedule, the total immunization cost per child will be worked out as six times the unit cost per contact.



Cost Classification
In the analysis, the immunization cost is classified on the basis of input, which is the
simplest, most manageable, and widely understood method. The basic input
classifications relevant to the unit cost analysis include: (i) Personnel; (ii) Vaccine and
Supplies; (iii) Medical Equipment and Transport, and (iv) Other Costs. The cost is further
divided into capital and recurrent. It is important that all costs are presented on an annual
basis, which requires spreading capital costs over the useful life of the assets. The
annualizing of capital cost is done using the straight line method. The third dimension is
to categorize cost into direct and indirect costs with respect to the cost objective, i.e., the
cost of a fully immunized child. The direct cost would be directly attributable to the

immunization, while indirect cost will be apportioned based on the nature of the cost item.
The following classification scheme is used.

Data Collection
Under the existing arrangement, the role of the federal government is restricted to
procuring vaccines and disposables. The expenditure is reflected in its budget. The
procured vaccines are dispatched to each province through a cold chain delivery system
that extends to the district level. The provinces are financing EPI through their
development budget and have opened a separate DDO (cost center) for the EPI Program
in their respective Annual Development Program (ADP). At the district level, the EPI has
been integrated into the existing preventive program, which is financed from the current
budget.
The preliminary review of EPI implementation in Pakistan suggests that it varies across
provinces. Since the devolution of health, each province has developed its own formula to
distribute the responsibilities between provincial and district governments. The financing
responsibilities for each cost component also vary by province and district. The data
sources are separately identified within each province depending upon the prevailing
practice.
In addition to providing budget support for the EPI, donors have also provided in-kind aid
such as purchasing equipment and providing training, etc. These in-kind contributions are
not captured in the government budget and information relating to them is directly obtained
from the donor agencies or from the EPI cell. The following templates were used to collect
information from country financial management system Project to Improve Financial
Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA).

Non-Financial Information
In each province, the following non-financial information is also gathered to facilitate the
calculation of the unit cost of a fully immunized child.
   a.   Targeted population (number and percentage).
   b.   Immunization coverage (number and percentage).
   c.   Number of annual vaccines procured.
   d.   Number of annual contacts.
   e.   Percentage of wastage.
   f.   Number of vaccinators.
   g.   Asset record for cold chain equipment.
   h.   Number of vehicles.
Limitations on Unit Cost Estimation
   a. No information on EPI expenditure from district health budget.
   b. In Punjab, 95 percent of expenditure relates to salaries.
   c. There is no reporting on number of contacts. Coverage by the antigen can be a
      basis for determining the number of annual contacts.
   d. There is no annual vaccine consumption report by districts at the provincial level.
      Coverage by the antigen can be a basis for determining number of annual
      contacts.
   e. It is difficult to isolate EPI expenditure at district level. Salaries of vaccinators are
      combined under salaries and wages head.
   f. The cost of facility used by EPI staff is difficult to ascertain; however, the cost is
      negligible.
   g. The donor in-kind aid needs to be quantified.
   h. Syringes and disposable costs are procured by the Federal EPI cell, MONHSRC.

Pakistan faces a formidable challenge in eliminating the polio virus from the country. With transmission of the
polio virus substantially slowing in the Africa region, the only two countries worldwide with ongoing endemic polio
transmission may soon be Pakistan and Afghanistan. And a substantial number of the polio cases or infant
paralysis occurring in Afghanistan is linked to cross-border transmission from Pakistan. The ongoing cycle of
polio infection is not just a tragedy for the children of Pakistan, it is a global public health emergency constituting
one of the final barriers to permanently eradicating polio.

The outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Pakistan result in significant costs to individuals and to society.
These include costs associated with visits to health care providers, hospitalizations, disability, and premature
deaths. Despite a slow decline over the past 10 years, the under-five mortality rate in Pakistan remains high, with
more than 400,000 deaths annually in this demographic over the past twenty years. Pakistan is lagging behind
other South Asian countries in improving this indicator.

This paper demonstrates clear economic benefits and efficacy of the National Immunization Support Project
(NISP) financing intervention in terms of DALYs saved and establishes that this intervention is affordable and
economically effective with a high rate of return. In addition to increased investment, the effectiveness of the EPI
can be enhanced by improving the capacity building of health professionals, as well as by improving logistics of
program interventions to reach marginalized populations, remote areas, and pockets of resistance. An increased
financial investment alone will be insufficient to address the root causes of persistent under-coverage in Pakistan.
It is imperative that ample attention and resources be diverted to strengthen the procurement systems, local and
provincial management capacity, and reporting mechanisms, among other capacity improvements.
