1    Introduction
The tradeoﬀs associated with redistributive policy are well-understood. On
the one hand, if the marginal utility of consumption is higher at low income
levels, then instituting transfers from rich to poor improves social welfare
(from a utilitarian perspective). On the other hand, providing appropriate
incentives for people to work puts limits on the eﬃcient amounts of redistri-
bution.
    The characterization of the optimal redistributive policy has been shown
to depend crucially on many aspects of the economic environment which
may be diﬃcult to measure, such as higher moments of the distribution of
idiosyncratic productivity shocks (see, for example, Golosov et al. [2016]).
Rather than characterizing the optimal policy, this paper studies the welfare
implications of a simple perturbation to existing tax schemes. A calibration
suggests that, for most countries, a small increase in transfers ﬁnanced by a
uniform increase in labor income taxes would improve social welfare.
    Methodologically, the approach is similar to the pioneering work of Golosov
et al. [2014], who develop a perturbation method which can be used to study
a wide class of tax reforms. Here, I apply their method to the question of
redistribution in a simple small open economy setting. The gains from redis-
tribution can be calibrated based on the joint distribution of labor income
and consumption, the elasticity of labor supply, the administrative cost of
transfers, the labor income share, the share of taxes in GDP and the coef-
ﬁcient of relative risk aversion. While there is some controversy regarding
the appropriate calibration of some of these parameters, I show that, in most
countries, even conservative assumptions deliver positive welfare gains from
additional redistribution.
    The conclusion regarding the optimality of increasing tax revenues to ﬁ-
nance additional government transfers is fairly robust. A related question is
whether, given existing tax revenues, social welfare can be improved by shift-
ing government spending from government investment programs to govern-

                                      2
ment transfer programs. To address this question, the model is extended to
include government capital that augments labor productivity. Here, the con-
clusions are more mixed: under a conservative parameterization, the welfare
gains from additional government investment exceed the gains from addi-
tional redistribution. However, there are some realistic parameterizations for
which the welfare gains from additional cash transfers are roughly equivalent
to those of a government investment project with an annual rate of return of
20 percentage points. These estimates are broadly in the range of estimated
rates of return to government investment, though these are notoriously im-
precise (see Gramlich [1994] for a review). From a policy perspective, the
ﬁndings suggest that while there is a strong case for increasing government
spending through additional taxation, the optimal allocation of spending be-
tween transfers and government investment projects is sensitive to parameter
values and the rate of return to government capital.


2    Model
There is a continuum of price-taking households indexed i ∈ [0, 1]. The
household supplies labor, li,t , and accumulates savings, ai,t .
    In most models, inequality is generated by idiosyncratic shocks. It is
therefore useful to assume that households face some uncertainty, captured
by stochastic variables denoted {si,t }i,t . The stochastic variables aﬀect the
disutility from labor. In this formulation, si,t can be thought of as an indi-
vidual productivity shock: a negative shock makes it more costly to supply
the same amount of eﬀective units of labor. It will be useful to denote the
history of shocks by sti = (si,0 , ..., si,t ).
    Household i faces a proportional tax of τt (li,t ) ≥ 0 on its labor income
and receives a government transfer of bt (li,t ) ≥ 0. Note that taxes and trans-
fers may depend only on the household’s current labor income and not on



                                       3
past labor income. This assumption is made mainly for simpliﬁcation.1 In
addition, it will be useful to assume that at any time t, the set of possible
state variables {ai,t , sti }i∈[0,1] is ﬁnite.
    While there is idiosyncratic uncertainty that generates inequality, I as-
sume that there is no aggregate uncertainty. Thus, wages and aggregate
quantities do not depend on the shocks {si,t }i,t .
    In principle, household decisions and state variables depend on the history
of shocks, sti . However, to simplify notation, I will omit the dependence on
                                              t−1
st                           t
 i and write li,t = li,t (si ), ai,t = ai,t (si ), etc.
    Utility from consumption and leisure is separable. Households maximize
expected utility subject to a budget constraint:
                                                                              ∞
   Vi (ai,0 , {wt , rt , bt (·), τt (·)}∞
                                        t=0 )   =        max             E[         β t (u(ci,t ) + g (li,t , si,t ))]
                                                    ai,t+1 ,li,t ,ci,t
                                                                              t=0


s.t. ai,0 and:

                ci,t + ai,t+1 = (1 − τ (li,t ))wt li,t + (1 + rt )ai,t + bt (li,t )

where β ∈ (0, 1) is the time discount factor. It is useful to denote the set of
optimal labor supply decisions by Li (ai,0 , {wt , rt , bt (·), τt (·)}∞
                                                                       t=0 ).


Production. There are two production inputs: capital (Kt ) and labor
        1
(Lt = 0 li,t di). The production function, Ft (Kt , Lt ), exhibits constant re-
turns to scale and satisﬁes the standard Inada conditions. Factors are paid
their marginal products. The wage rate, wt , and the capital rental rate, Rt ,
are given by:
                        ∂Ft (Kt , Lt )          ∂Ft (Kt , Lt )
                   wt =                and Rt =                             (1)
                             ∂L                     ∂K

      See Golosov et al. [2007] for a more general treatment.

Capital markets. I assume a small open economy in which the the global
interest rate, rt , pins down aggregate capital supply:

                                   (1 − τtk )Rt + 1 − δ = 1 + rt                                               (2)

where τtk is the tax on capital income and δ ∈ [0, 1] is the capital depreciation
rate.
   Note that, given the constant returns to scale assumption, the factor
payments Rt and wt depend only on the capital-labor ratio, which is pinned
down by equation 2. Consequently, changes in labor supply will be met by
proportional changes in capital, and will thus have no eﬀect on equilibrium
wages.

Social welfare. Given a tax and transfer schedule, {τt (·), τtk , bt (·)}, a se-
quence of interest rates, {rt }∞                                    ∞
                               t=0 , and a sequence of wages, {wt }t=0 , social
welfare is given by:
                                                            1
    W ({τt (·), τtk , bt (·), rt , wt }∞
                                       t=0 ) =                  Vi (ai,0 , {wt , rt , bt (·), τt (·)}∞
                                                                                                     t=0 )di   (3)
                                                        0


    The government’s problem is to choose a tax and transfer schedule and
a sequence of government debts, {xt }∞t=1 , to maximize social welfare, subject
to x0 , equations 1-2, the government budget constraint:
                  1                                1
         1
                      bt (li,t )di + xt+1 =            τt (li,t )wt li,t + τtk Rt Kt + (1 + rt )xt             (4)
         µ    0                                0


the incentive compatibility constraints:

                      {li,t }∞                                          ∞
                             t=0 ∈ Li (ai,0 , {wt , rt , bt (·), τt (·)}t=0 ) for all i                        (5)




                                                            5
and the targeting constraint:

                           bt (l) = bt (lt ) for all l ≤ lt                   (6)

    The parameter µ denotes the transfer multiplier: it costs the govern-
ment 1/µ dollars to ﬁnance a transfer of 1 dollar. For example, if there are
administrative costs, µ < 1.
    The targeting constraint (equation 6) states that it is impossible to per-
fectly target transfer recipients. The government must give the same transfer
to all workers with li,t ≤ lt , where lt is exogenously given. It is useful to de-
note by It the set of workers for which li,t ≤ lt .
    The following assumption will be crucial for the analysis that follows:

Assumption 1 Given existing taxes and transfers, the solution to the house-
hold’s optimization problem is unique. This unique solution will be denoted by
a∗        ∗        ∗
 i,t+1 , li,t and ci,t (with the understanding that the optimal plan is a function
of the state variables).

    This assumption is in the spirit of Assumption 2 in Golosov et al. [2014].
However, it is not innocuous. It is possible to construct examples in which it
will not hold at the optimal policy. In particular, depending on parameters,
the optimal policy may implement an equilibrium in which some agents are
indiﬀerent with respect to two diﬀerent choices of labor supply. Appendix A
presents an example to illustrate the conditions under which this Assumption
1 is plausible.
    In general, an optimal tax code may or may not satisfy the uniqueness
assumption. However, this assumption will be crucial for the analysis that
follows as it guarantees that labor supply decisions are continuous with re-
spect to small changes in tax policy.
    An additional assumption will be made:
                             1   ∗      ∗
Assumption 2 Let Tt = 0 τt (li,t   )wt li,t di + τtk Rt Kt denote the government’s
tax revenue. Then, given prevailing tax rates, a marginal change in the trans-

                                          6
                                                                           ∂Tt
fer size bt has no eﬀect on current or future equilibrium tax revenues:    ∂bt
                                                                                 =0
for all t ≥ t .

    This assumption is reasonable, at least as an approximation, if trans-
fer recipients generate a small share of aggregate labor income, especially
if their labor income is taxed at a low (or zero) rate. Note that even if
transfer recipients do not pay any taxes, their labor supply decisions may
aﬀect equilibrium tax revenues through capital taxation: lower labor supply
would imply a lower capital stock which, if τtk > 0, would generate lower tax
revenues. However, this general equilibrium eﬀect will be small if transfer
recipients supply a small share of aggregate labor inputs (note that labor
inputs are speciﬁed in eﬀective units - thus, the assumption is that labor
supplied by transfer recipients is relatively unproductive). Alternatively, if a
large proportion of households are transfer recipients, then the assumption
is a reasonable approximation if, for more productive households, transfers
constitute a small share of income and thus an increase in transfers does not
lead to a large change in the incentives to work.
    Note that while Assumption 2 rules out scenarios in which transfers are
distortionary, it does not preclude the possibility that there are distortions as-
sociated with the taxation used to ﬁnance those transfers. The distortionary
costs of taxation operate through the labor supply elasticity: higher taxes
reduce the incentives to work, resulting in lower equilibrium labor supply
and, consequently, lower equilibrium capital supply.
    It will be useful to introduce the following notation to describe diﬀerent
                                                           ∂ ln(Lt )
aggregations of the labor supply elasticity. Let L,t = ∂     ln(wt )
                                                                     denote the ag-
                                                    ∂ ln(l∗ )
                                                       i,t
gregate elasticity of labor supply, and let i,t = ∂ ln(w t)
                                                            denote the individual
elasticity of labor supply. Note that both elasticities are equilibrium objects
that may depend on the tax code and that, given Assumption 1, the elas-
ticities are well-deﬁned. The results will focus on ˜L,t , which is deﬁned as
the maximum of the aggregate labor supply elasticity and a tax-weighted

                                                0 i i


Note that the assumption of a ﬁnite set of state variables guarantees that
the set of elasticities { i,t }i∈[0,1] is ﬁnite, so the integral exists.
                                                                         ∗
    It will be convenient to introduce the notation τi,t = τt (li,t        ) to denote
equilibrium average tax rates. Given a sequence of capital tax rate {τtk }∞              t=0
                                   ∞
and a sequence of deﬁcits {xt }t=0 , it is said that the taxes {τi,t }i,t are feasible if
there exist a sequence of tax schedules {τt (·)}∞                               ∗
                                                      t=0 such that τi,t = τt (li,t (τt (·)).
    The analysis that follows focuses on the welfare gains from implementing
a tax schedule that induces a uniform shift in average tax rates, {τi,t + η } for
some η > 0. Note that a uniform increase in the existing tax schedule of the
form τ ˜t (·) = τt (·) + η does not necessarily deliver the equilibrium tax rates
{τi,t + η }, because a uniform shift may have diﬀerential eﬀects on individual
labor supply decisions at diﬀerent tax brackets. Achieving an equilibrium in
which the average tax rates are {τi,t + η } might necessitate a non-uniform
adjustment of the tax code.
    Before proceeding, it is worth motivating the focus on this particular
perturbation of the tax code. In particular, one might ﬁnd it more natural
to discuss issues of redistribution by perturbing the tax schedule in a way
that is more targeted at the very rich. One example is greater taxation of
capital income, which is highly concentrated among wealthy households. In
the small open economy setup considered here, capital taxation would be
equivalent to labor taxation (in a closed economy setup, this equivalence
would hold at the steady state). The reason for this is that the rate of return
on capital is pinned down by global market conditions. Thus an increase in
capital taxation would lead to a decline in the capital stock and, subsequently,
a decline in wages. This would result in a decline in household income that is
proportional to its labor income. Because the general equilibrium eﬀects are


                                             8
similar, I chose the more direct approach of analyzing an increase in labor
taxes.
    A second example of a perturbation that is more targeted at wealthy
households is an increase in top tax rates (see Saez [2001]). While such a
perturbation may be feasible and desirable, a uniform increase in tax rates is
more likely to satisfy the incentive compatibility constraints. Intuitively, an
increase in the top tax rate will have a smaller eﬀect on the labor supply of
highly productive households when lower incomes are taxed at a higher rate
as well. In the context of this exercise, the focus on a uniform tax increase is
more conservative. Countries that are shown to beneﬁt from such a scheme
would also beneﬁt from a more progressive tax reform, assuming that such a
reform is feasible.
    The following proposition provides a suﬃcient condition for the desirabil-
ity of greater redistribution of labor income:
                              1
Proposition 1 Let sT = ( 0 τ (li )wli di + τ k RK )/Y denote the share of tax
revenue in output, and let (1 − α) denote the equilibrium labor income share.
If the following condition holds:

then it is possible to improve welfare by an increase in transfers ﬁnanced by
a uniform increase in labor taxes: τi,t → τi,t + η for some η > 0.

    The proof is provided in the appendix. Intuitively, the optimality of in-
creasing labor taxes depends on the elasticity of labor supply. The elasticity
of labor supply governs the extent to which an increase in tax rates reduces
labor inputs. A more elastic labor supply implies that an increase in taxes
generates a smaller increase in tax revenues and, consequently, smaller in-
creases in transfers and equilibrium welfare.
    Additionally, the welfare gains from increasing transfers depend on the

To illustrate, note that if µ = 1 and there is no consumption inequality,
then the condition above is violated, and there are no gains from increas-

ciently large, the left hand side will be positive, which is a necessary but not
suﬃcient condition for the inequality to hold.
     Note that the condition in Proposition 1 depends on a weighted average
of marginal utilities, where weights are given by the individual shares of
labor income (li /L). An increase in transfers ﬁnanced by a uniform increase
in labor taxes is primarily ﬁnanced by those whose labor income is higher.
The amount of additional tax revenue collected from any given household
is proportional to its labor income. Thus, the welfare cost of redistribution
depends on the joint distribution of consumption and labor income.


2.1     Calibration
This section assesses the condition in Proposition 1 for a sample of countries.
Table 1 summarizes the calibration approach.


                                           10
     To calibrate the joint distribution of consumption and labor income, I
use data from Lakner and Milanovic [2016]. The data set contains survey-
based measures of either household consumption or disposable income by
decile. The calibration requires the joint distribution of labor income and
                                          1
consumption for computing the term 0 u (ci,t )li,t /Lt di. I will assume that,
for the bottom 9 deciles, consumption is given by disposable income and
that income consists only of labor income (ci,t = (1 − τt (li,t ))wt li,t ). The top
10% is assumed to have no labor income and consumes only capital income.
Formally, using q ˆi to denote the estimated consumption or income of decile
i, I approximate:

                            1            l           9                 ˆi
                                                                       q

                                u (ci,t ) L          i=1      qi )
                                                           u (ˆ       9
                           0                                              ˆi
                                                                      i=1 q
                                            t
                                                ≈           I
                                                                                         (9)
                        E [u (ci,t )|i ∈ It ]        1

                                                                  u (ˆ

    Note that ignoring the labor income of the top 10% vastly understates the
beneﬁts from additional redistribution. The highest decile likely receives a
relatively large share of aggregate labor income, and has the lowest marginal
utility of consumption. Thus, instituting transfers from this group to the rest
of the population is highly desirable from a welfare perspective. By ignoring
the top 10%, the burden of ﬁnancing the transfers falls only on the bottom
90%, which is less favorable. The assumption that the top decile receives no
labor income is thus highly conservative in this context.2
    In addition, if taxes are progressive, then the approximation li /L ≈
ˆi / j q
q       ˆj understates the beneﬁts from additional redistribution. Under the
assumption that taxes are progressive, disposable income is more equally
distributed than gross labor income. Note that the marginal beneﬁts from
   2
     At the same time, including the top 10% under the assumption that ci,t = (1 − τi,t )li,t
may overstate the beneﬁts from redistribution. The reason is that the top decile is likely
to receive some capital income, which tends to be highly concentrated among the rich.
Consequently, both the consumption level and the level of disposable income likely exceed
labor income. The assumption ci,t = (1 − τi,t )li,t would therefore overstate the extent to
which an increase in labor taxes would tax the rich. The most conservative approach is
to ignore this group.


                                                11
additional redistribution depend on gross labor income shares rather than on
disposable labor income shares.
   I assume that the marginal utility of consumption takes the form:

                                  u (c) = c−γ                               (10)

Harsanyi [1955] establishes that, for the purpose of welfare analysis, it is
appropriate to interpret γ as the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion (rather
than, for example, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution or a parameter
that governs the degree of altruism). I choose γ = 0.5, a highly conservative
estimate of risk aversion. The macro literature typically uses γ = 2, and
much larger values are often used in the ﬁnance literature, which documents
that large levels of risk aversion are necessary in order to account for the
equity premium puzzle.
    Estimated tax shares, sT , are based on data from the World Development
Indicators (WDI). Estimated labor shares, (1 − α), are taken from the Penn
World Tables (PWT). I assume that µ = 0.6, which is highly conservative
given estimates of the administrative costs of cash transfer programs.
    As a conservative benchmark, I assume that the targeting constraint does
not allow any targeting of poor households, and that the government must
transfer the same amount to every household. This is conservative because
the welfare gains from cash transfer programs are higher when they target
those who have higher marginal utilities of consumption.
    Finally, there is substantial controversy regarding the labor supply elas-
ticity. The micro literature typically ﬁnds an elasticity in the vicinity of 0.3,
while the macro literature ﬁnds that a much larger elasticity of between 1
and 2 (see Keane [2011]). I take a conservative approach and assume that
˜L = 2. Note that a high elasticity of labor supply implies that taxes are
more distortionary.

Results. Despite its highly conservative assumptions, the calibration sug-
gests that 103 out of the 111 countries in the sample satisfy the condition
of Proposition 1, suggesting that there is too little redistribution in these
countries. The exceptions are Botswana, Gabon, Mongolia, Norway, New
Zealand, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago and Turkey. Note that Proposition
1 provides a suﬃcient rather than a necessary condition; thus, additional
redistribution may be desirable even in countries for which this condition is
not satisﬁed, especially given the highly conservative calibration.


3    Extension: Government investment
This section extends the model to allow for productivity-augmenting gov-
ernment investment. The purpose of this extension is to address the policy
question of how government spending should be allocated between invest-
ment and cash transfer programs. Especially in developing countries, the
ability to raise taxes may be limited but there may be more ﬂexibility in how
to allocate government spending and foreign aid.
    To extend the model, assume that, in addition to private capital and
labor inputs (K and L), output depends on the level of government capital,
G. The production function takes the form:

                     Ft (Kt , Lt , Gt ) = At f (Gt )h(Kt , Lt )         (11)

where h is a constant returns to scale production function. This speciﬁcation
guarantees that there are no rents and that, when capital and labor are
paid their marginal products, the sum of factor payments is equal to output
(provided that the services of government capital are free of charge).
   The government budget constraint is modiﬁed as follows to include gov-

    The government’s optimization problem is to maximize social welfare sub-
ject to the government budget constraint, the incentive compatibility con-
straints and the targeting constraint, taking taxes as given:

                                                 1

Proposition 2 Assume that (a) for all t, it is strictly optimal to set bt (li,t ) >
0 for i ∈ It ; (b) the production function is Cobb-Douglas in K and L
(h(K, L) = K α L1−α ), and (c) There is common elasticity of labor supply
( i,t = L ). Then, at the optimum, the rate of return to government invest-
ment is:

      ∂Ft+1                                      µ(rt+1 + δ )
            −δ =            1      u (ci,t+1 )       (1−τi,t+1 )li,t+1
                                                                                                  −δ   (14)
       ∂G                                                              di       + µsT 1+ L

    The proof is in the appendix. Note that, similar to the condition of
Proposition 1, the rate of return on government investment implied by the
welfare maximization problem depends on a weighted average of marginal
consumption utilities. However, in contrast to the condition in Proposition
1, weights are proportional to disposable labor income and do not necessarily
sum to 1. Intuitively, an increase in government capital increases labor pro-
ductivity, which increases disposable labor income. The welfare gains from
government investment are thus proportional to disposable rather than to
gross labor income. Similar to equation 9, for the purpose of the calibration,

    To calibrate the optimal rates of return to government investment implied
by proposition 2, it is necessary to take a stance on the values of rt+1 . I
assume that rt+1 is given by the Euler condition, which relates the interest
rate to the rate of consumption growth.3
    The calibration based on the conservative parameterization described by
Table 1 suggests that the optimal rate of return on government investment
should be negative in most countries, and always below 2%. Given that
most estimates suggest high rates of return to government investment, the
conclusion is that, given current tax revenues, governments should divert
resources from cash transfer programs to government investment projects.
    However, this conclusion is a result of the highly conservative parameteri-
zation, and may not hold up in the presence of less conservative (and perhaps
more realistic) parameters. Table 2 illustrates how the optimal rate of return
to government capital varies with alternative calibration parameters.
    Depending on the parameterization, the average optimal rate of return on
government investment can be as high as 21%. This estimate is in the range
of plausible estimates of rates of return to government investment projects,
although those are notoriously imprecise. The calibrated optimal rates of
return vary somewhat by country, and are reported in Appendix C.
   3
    The Euler condition is β (1 + rt+1 ) = u (ct )/u (ct+1 ). I assume that the rate of con-
sumption growth is given by the rate of GDP per capita growth, which is calibrated based
on data from the World Development Indicators.

4    Conclusion
This paper establishes that, even under highly conservative assumptions,
there is a strong case for further redistribution. In theory, the gains from
redistribution depend on a variety of structural parameters, such as the social
aversion to inequality; the ability to target transfers at the poor; and the
administrative costs of transfer programs. The calibration establishes that
even at very low levels of inequality aversion, an un-targeted transfer program
in which transfer recipients receive only 60 cents on the dollar would improve
social welfare. The implication is that under any realistic parameterization,
there are gains from further redistributive policy.
    The analysis relies crucially on two assumptions that guarantee the fea-
sibility of increasing transfers and tax revenues. The ﬁrst assumption states
that, given prevailing tax policy, optimal individual labor supplies are uniquely
pinned down. While this assumption seems plausible, it may be violated un-
der an optimal policy. The second assumption states that an increase in
transfers (holding taxes ﬁxed) has a negligible eﬀect on tax revenues. This
framework therefore refocuses the debate on the optimal extent of redistri-
bution. Given that further redistribution is desirable even under the most
conservative parameterizations, opponents of further redistribution must ei-
ther argue that, although desirable, increasing tax revenues is not feasible,
or that increasing transfers would result in a large drop in tax revenues.
    When total government spending is ﬁxed, whether or not it is optimal to
increase transfers to the poor depends on the welfare gains from other forms of
government spending. I extend the model to include productivity-enhancing
government investment, and establish that the optimality of diverting pub-
lic funds from government investment projects to cash transfer programs is
highly sensitive to parameter values.
    To conclude, this paper refocuses the debate on the optimal scope of re-
distribution. First, it establishes that this debate is viable only in cases in
which increasing tax revenues is not feasible. Otherwise, further redistribu-

                                      17
tion is desirable under any realistic parameterization. Second, it establishes
that, when increasing tax revenues is not feasible, the optimality of divert-
ing funds from government investment projects to redistributive programs
depends on the rate of return to government investment, the administrative
cost of transfers, the elasticity of labor supply and the social aversion to
inequality.

A      An example to illustrate the conditions un-
       der which Assumption 1 holds
Example 1. Consider the following simple example in which ai,0 = 0 for
all i and there are only two permanent states, si,t ∈ {0, 1} (where si,t = si,0
for all t). The utility function takes the form:
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 
                                                  φ ln(1 − li,t ) if si,t = 1, li,t ∈ [0, 1)
                                                 
 u(ci,t ) = (1 − φ) ln(ci,t ), g (li,t , si,t ) = 0                if si,t = li,t = 0
                                                 
                                                 
                                                 −∞
                                                 
                                                                   otherwise

     In this example, only agents with an si,t = 1 shock are able to supply
labor. Agents with si,t = 0 are unable to supply any labor, because any
positive amount of labor supply results in utility of −∞. In addition, given
that shocks are permanent and initial wealth is set to 0, they cannot borrow or
consume out of savings. Thus, an optimal policy would allow them to choose
li,t = 0 and provide them with some government transfers to consume.
     Assume that β (1 + rt ) = 1 for all t. Under this assumption, a time
invariant tax and transfer policy is optimal and the equilibrium can be solved
in a static framework. Households with si,0 = 1 choose their permanent labor
supply, li,t = l, subject to a tax rate τ , and households with si,t = 0 consume
the government transfer. Assuming a production function with no capital
inputs (F (K, L) = L), the transfer is given by b = µτ l.

   The si,t = 1 household solves:
                                                        
                                                        (1 − τ )wl   if l > 0
     max(1 − φ) ln(c) + φ ln(1 − l) s.t. c =                                         (16)
        l,c                                             b            otherwise

The optimal labor supply decision in the region l > 0 is:

                                           lo = 1 − φ                                (17)

The optimal labor choice, l∗ , is then given by:
              
              l o     if (1 − φ) ln((1 − τ )wlo ) + φ ln(1 − lo ) ≥ (1 − φ) ln(b)
    ∗
    l =                                                                              (18)
              0       otherwise

   Of course, the government will not be able to ﬁnance any transfers unless
l∗ = lo > 0. The size of the transfer is limited by the government budget
constraint b = µτ l∗ . Under the constraint that the government must induce
productive agents to choose l∗ = lo , the government’s optimization problem
can be written as:

                      max(1 − φ)(ln((1 − τ )wlo ) + ln(b)) + φ ln(1 − lo )           (19)
                       τ,b


s.t. b = µτ lo and the incentive compatibility constraint:

                     (1 − φ) ln((1 − τ )wlo ) + φ ln(1 − lo ) ≥ (1 − φ) ln(b)        (20)

    Ignoring the incentive compatibility constraints yields an optimal tax rate
of τ = 0.5 (note that given log utility, it is optimal for the government to
spend an equal share of aggregate labor income on each household). The tax
rate τ = 0.5 is consistent with the incentive compatibility constraint only for
µ suﬃciently small. To see this, note that b = µτ lo and hence the incentive



                                               20
compatibility constraint is satisﬁed only when:

            (1 − φ) ln(0.5wlo ) + φ ln(1 − lo ) ≥ (1 − φ) ln(µ0.5wlo )      (21)

Or:
                          φ ln(1 − lo ) ≥ (1 − φ) ln(µ)                     (22)

Note that both sides of the inequality are negative. The inequality is satisﬁed
for φ > 0 suﬃciently small and µ < 1 suﬃciently small. If we assume that
the disutility from labor is low and that the administrative cost of transfers
is large, then the incentive compatibility constraint will not be binding and
the si,t = 1 household will strictly prefer the choice l = lo over the choice
l = 0.
    However, it is easy to see that this will not be the case when µ = 1. In this
case, τ = 0.5 is not a feasible policy choice because productive households
will prefer not to work and receive the government transfer. The optimal tax
rate, τ , is then given by the incentive compatibility constraint:

          (1 − φ) ln((1 − τ )wlo ) + φ ln(1 − lo ) = (1 − φ) ln(µτ wlo )    (23)

Thus, under the optimal policy, the solution to the productive household’s
optimization problem is not unique: it is indiﬀerent between l = lo and
l = 0. To see this, note that if the household strictly prefers l = lo , then the
government can implement a small increase in the size of the transfer and in
the tax rate. Given that τ < 0.5, this alteration will improve social welfare.
    To summarize, Assumption 1 holds in this example only when transfers
are relatively costly (µ is small) and when the disutility of labor is not large
(φ is small).

B      Proofs
Proof of Proposition 1. Let λt denote the Lagrange multiplier on the
government’s budget constraint at time t. Applying the envelope theorem
and ignoring the targeting constraint, the government’s ﬁrst order condition
                     t
with respect to bt (li ) yields:

                                                       1   ∂Tt
                                u (ci,t ) ≤ λt (         −     )                         (24)
                                                       µ ∂bi,t

Thus, given Assumption 2 the targeting constraint implies that:

                                                        1   ∂Tt    λt
                     E [u (ci,t )|i ∈ It ] ≤ λt (         −     )=                       (25)
                                                        µ ∂bi,t    µ

Or:
                                    µE [u (ci,t )|i ∈ It ] ≤ λt                          (26)

   Consider the government’s optimization problem with respect to labor
                                                                                ∗
taxes, τt (·). It will be convenient to introduce the notation τi,t = τt (li,t    ).
This formulation assumes that the government can directly choose the tax
rate faced by agent i, rather than the tax schedule. Note that τi,t must satisfy
some incentive compatibility constraints, that induce agent i to “reveal his
type” - in other words, there must exist some tax schedule τt (·) such that,
                                     ∗
given that tax schedule, τi,t = τt (li,t ).
   The assumption that the solution to the household’s optimization prob-
lem is unique and that the set of state variables at any time t is ﬁnite implies
that, for a suﬃciently small η¯ > 0, it is possible to increase all labor tax rates
by any η ∈ (−η     ¯) and distribute the tax receipts among agents in It .

   Let W (η ) denote the welfare obtained from a uniform tax increase of η :

                W (η ) =            Vi (ai,0 , {wt , rt , bi,t , τi,t + η, τi,t }t=0 )   (27)

 t is such that that the increase in taxes and transfers is budget neutral.
    The government can improve welfare by choosing η > 0 if W (η ) > 0.
Note that given the small open economy assumption, the capital labor ratio
is pinned down by global market conditions, and hence both Rt and wt do
not respond to changes in labor taxes. Thus, using the envelope theorem,
this condition can be written as:
                                               1
                                                                                 ∂Tt

       Using equation 26, this condition holds if:
                             1
                                                                                        ∂Tt

   Note that taxes are given by T = 0 ((τi + η )wi li + τk Rt Kt )di, and thus,
using the observation that wt and Rt are pinned down by global market
conditions and do not respond to changes in labor inputs or taxes:

Proof of Proposition 2. Using λt to denote the Lagrange multiplier on
the government’s time t budget constraint, an application of the envelope
theorem implies that the ﬁrst order condition with respect to Gt+1 is:

                                                                  ∂Tt+1
                               − λt + βλt+1 (1 − δ +                    )+             (42)
                                                                  ∂Gt+1
                           1
                                                                    ∗
               βEt [           u (ci,t+1 )(1 − τi,t+1 )wt+1 (Gt+1 )li,t +1 ] = 0
                       0

where wt+1 (Gt+1 ) is the derivative of equilibrium wages with respect to gov-
ernment capital. Note that this ﬁrst order condition relies on the result that,
for any t > 0, wt+t does not depend on Gt .
     To simplify notation, it will be convenient to write u (ct ) = E [u (ci, t)|i ∈
It ]. Assuming that positive transfers are strictly optimal, the inequality in
equation 26 holds with equality. Combining the two ﬁrst order conditions
yields:
                                                    ∂Tt+1
                    µu (ct ) = βµu (ct+1 )(1 − δ +        )+                    (43)
                                                   ∂Gt+1
                                   1
                                                                            ∗

                               0

   To solve for w (G), note that, using the constant returns assumption and
the assumption that factors are paid their marginal product:

                                        wL + RK = F (K, L, G)                          (44)

Using L (G) and K (G) to denote the derivatives of equilibrium labor and
capital with respect to G, taking a derivative of both sides of the above




                                                         25
equation with respect to G yields:

                                               ∂F   ∂F         ∂F
     w (G)L + wL (G) + RK (G) =                   +    L (G) +    K (G)        (45)

Note that R is pinned down by the global equilibrium condition. As factors
are paid their marginal products, w = ∂F
                                      ∂L
                                         and R = ∂K∂F
                                                      . Hence:

                                                    ∂F
                                         w (G)L =                              (46)

                   µu (ct ) = βµu (ct+1 )(1 − δ +                    )+        (47)

   To calibrate the term      ∂G
                                 ,   it is useful to note that:

                                         ∂T        ˜
                                              ∂T ∂ A

                                              ∂A

where A˜ = Af (G). Note that household decisions depend only on factor
                                                ˜ rather than as a function
payments, which can be written as a function of A
of A and G. Thus, tax revenues depend only on A ˜.

   The government’s optimization problem with respect to xt+1 yields the
standard Euler condition:

                                               1 u (ct )
                                                           = 1 + rt+1                                              (56)

                                                             27
   Thus, equation 55 can be rewritten as:

                 ∂F                       µ(rt+1 + δ )
                    =    1 u (ci,t+1 ) (1−τi,t+1 )li,t+1            ∂ ln(T )
                                                                               (57)
                 ∂G                                      di   + µsT ∂    ˜)
                        0 u (ct+1 )         Lt+1                      ln(A


   To conclude the proof, it is left to show that, under the Cobb-Douglas
assumption:
                      ∂ ln(T )     ∂ ln(T )   1+ L
                                =           =                        (58)
                      ∂ ln(A˜)     ∂ ln(A)    1−α
   To see this, note that the equalization of the marginal return to capital
with the market rate implies that:

                                                K α− 1
                      (1 − τk )αAf (G)(           )    −δ =r                   (59)
                                                L

Rearranging yields the following expression for the capital-labor ratio as a
function of A:
                         K      (1 − τk )αAf (G) 1−1
                            =(                  ) α                       (60)
                         L            r+δ
Note that the derivative of the capital-labor ratio with respect to A is:

             ∂K
              L       1      (1 − τk )αAf (G) 1−
                                               1       1    K
                =          (                 ) α =                             (61)
             ∂A   (1 − α)A         r+δ             (1 − α)A L

and hence:
                                  ∂KL
                                          K
                                        = L                                    (62)
                                ∂ ln(A)  1−α
   Wages are equal to the marginal product of labor:

                                                        K α
                          w = (1 − α)Af (G)(              )                    (63)
                                                        L

Taking logs:

                                                                        K
                 ln(w) = ln((1 − α)f (G)) + ln(A) + α ln(                 )    (64)
                                                                        L


                                           28
The elasticity of the wage with respect to A is therefore:

                ∂ ln(w)      ∂ ln( K
                                   L
                                     )      α     1
                        =1+α           =1+     =                               (65)
                ∂ ln(A)      ∂ ln(A)       1−α   1−α

   As taxes are given by T =           τi wli di + τk RK ,

    ∂ ln(T )   ∂T A  1                 ∂w         ∂li ∂w             ∂K

Note that the equilibrium rental rate, R, does not depend on A because the
capital stock fully adjusts to meet the global rate of return. Rewriting yields:

C     Optimal rates of return on government cap-
      ital, by country
The conservative calibration of the optimal rate of return to government
investment uses the parameter values reported in table 1. The column labeled
”Not Conservative” reﬂects an alternative calibration in which µ = 1; γ = 2;
  = 0.3; and transfers are targeted at the bottom decile of the distribution.
