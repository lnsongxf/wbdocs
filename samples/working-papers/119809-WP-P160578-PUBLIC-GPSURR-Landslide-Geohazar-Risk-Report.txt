1. Workshop Overview
The World Bank’s Disaster Risk and Climate Change Unit of the South Asia Region organized a regional
workshop to build the capacity of policymakers and operational or technical government counterparts in
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka to integrate geohazard risk manage-
ment into their infrastructure programs—thus helping to ensure the safety of people and property as well as
the sustainability of such investments.1

2. Workshop Approach
To achieve its desired South-to-South learning outcomes, the workshop agenda incorporated various meth-
ods of engagement: opening addresses and presentations by leaders and resource persons; country-specific
poster presentations; a site visit and discussion; round table discussions with the resource persons; reviews
of country-specific action plans; a commentary, question, and answer session; and finally, a workshop evalua-
tion.

3. Experiences on Key Issues, Challenges,
and Solutions, by Country
South Asian countries are affected by numerous geohazards, as most of these countries are located in seismi-
cally active zones. The situation is further aggravated by the rugged mountainous terrain. Landslides, rock-
slides, rockfalls, debris flow, mud-flows, avalanches, flash floods, and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs)
are the main hazards encountered. Landslides, rock-slides, and rockfalls could be triggered by rainfall, snow-
fall, or earthquakes.

4. Guidance Notes on a Solution Process
The disruptions to the transport infrastructure from geohazards will have severe economic setbacks and
affect citizens’ access to critical facilities .These disruptions may take place in segments of the network con-
necting a country’s major economic centers. If significant time is taken for rectification, economic growth
will be impeded because of uncertainties created in the minds of the citizens and investors. With the change
of climatic conditions, high-intensity, short-duration rainfalls or prolonged rainfalls could become frequent

6. Conclusions and
Recommendations
South Asian countries experience a variety of geohazards triggered by excessive rain-
falls, snowfalls, and earthquakes. Management and mitigation of these geohazards
are challenging tasks, especially in countries with rugged mountainous terrain such as
Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Nepal. A stepwise approach to road geohazard risk management
and proper institutional setup are key elements of any strategy to ensure safe roads. Ef-
forts must be made to integrate road geohazard risk management into the national devel-
opment plans for sustainable road management and safety of the stakeholders.

       precipitation and coastal ﬂoods

cyclones causes devastating damages

Landslide is a serious problem for hilly
           area with increasing trend of

       Institutional arrangement and legal framework are in
   place to tackle disaster. National and Sub-National levels
        disaster committees down to the grass root level are
   there. Disaster Management Act has been promulgated.
    Records of highest ﬂood is kept. New roads and bridges
   are being constructed considering highest ﬂood level. In
      some low lying area submersible roads are also being
     constructed. Under WB funding LGED are constructing
       multipurpose school cum cyclone shelters in Coastal
   belt. More administrative actions are being taken to stop
  cutting slope and prevent building dwelling on the slope.

    As outcomes, institutional capacity, to prepare for and

           improved and capacity of the public, to protect
    themselves from natural disasters and recover quickly,
      shall be enhanced. This Project also supports India’s
      major policy shift to proactive risk management and
 allows the implementation of a demand-driven program
            speciﬁcally enabling translation of national risk
            mitigation strategies into e ective policies and
   strengthening the capacity of institutions for improved

   important lessons to be shared with other countries in
    their e orts to systematically address the reduction of
                                          multi-hazard risks.

       Challenge
  AJK’s peculiar geographic location
        makes it vulnerable to natural
     calamities. AJK faces plethora of
       challenges, impeding progress
       towards achieving sustainable
     development. The key factors at
         play are the climate change,
 poverty, small land holdings, limited
   ﬁnancial resources and relocation
 of huge chunk of population readily
        living on hazard prone areas.

                                    Results
 The primary outcome of DCRIP initiative is to save and
    prevent needless su ering of the population, protect
   vital infrastructure, and resources from disasters. The
  deliverables from its various activities are envisaged to
 help state machinery and all stakeholders to e ectively
          mitigate natural calamities and devise proactive
strategies for the future. These activities are being taken
              through participatory approach involving all
stakeholders including Government Institutions such as
                 Land Use Planning, Central Design O ce,
           Communication and Works, SDMA and Forests
Department. This includes identiﬁcation of multi-hazard
risks which would inform the development of a Climate
                       Resilience Action Plan for the state.

           Workshop on “First Annual South-to-South Learning Workshop on Landslide and
           Geohazard Risk”

           November 15–17, 2016

           Kandy, Sri Lanka

           Activity:
           Exhibit or Poster Presentation or Marketplace

           Rationale:
           South–South cooperation comes in various forms such as sharing of experiences
           through knowledge exchange and mutual learning through workshops, learning
           events, field visits, educational activities, and so on. The upcoming Workshop on
           First Annual South-to-South Learning Workshop on Landslide and Geohazard Risk
           is an opportunity for South-to-South learning for South Asian countries. To further
           enhance the mutual learning benefit, an exhibition of knowledge products will be
           organized as a side event. This is a complementary activity to maximize resources
           and learning opportunities.

           Objectives:
           Enable the participants from the seven countries to not only hear about good prac-
           tices but also to read about and see depictions of those practices.

           Showcase to fellow learners the chosen knowledge and other products produced by
           the participating countries.

           Activities:
           Bring a selection of good knowledge products, which could be in the form of promo-
           tional materials such as brochures, posters, books, reports, cards, pins, manuals, videos,
           training materials, and so on that the organization or country is willing to share, give, or
           sell.

           Products can include handicrafts or other materials that are produced by the country—
           either from livelihood or from cultural, trade, and social activities—that you are willing to
           share, give, or sell. These products showcase cultural aspects of the countries. Exhibits
           can also include other materials or instruments that illustrate any learning topic of the
           workshop.

           Communicate to the event coordinator what you are going to bring so it can be taken
           into consideration in planning the venue.

           A place in the workshop venue will be allocated for the exhibits. This could include
           walls, tables, and chairs. Tapes and pins will also be available. You will be the one to
           post or organize your products in the venue, either once you arrive or the morning
           before the workshop. The exhibition will last during the whole duration of the work-
           shop.

     At the end of the workshop, leftover materials should either
     be taken back or given to whoever wants to take them home.
