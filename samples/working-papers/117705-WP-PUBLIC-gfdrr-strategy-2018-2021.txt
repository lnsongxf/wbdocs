  n	Cities    are engines of socioeconomic growth and smart land-use and urbanization planning should be priorities for rapid and
       balanced development. If such planning integrates measures to manage and account for disaster and climate risks—for instance,
       by steering urban development toward safe areas and away from flood prone areas—they can also be critical risk-reduction
       instruments.4 However, rapid urbanization can also be the main driver in the increase of risk and disaster losses if these risks
       are disregarded in the development planning process5 or if such planning is largely absent in the face of poor governance and
       uncontrolled migration.

  n	Achieving     universal access to infrastructure and basic services, such as education, health care, drinking water, sanitation,
       telecommunications, and electricity, is a development and poverty-reduction priority. People with access to such services are
       less vulnerable to natural hazards if infrastructure is well-designed. Appropriate sanitation reduces flood risk by removing
       waste that would otherwise block drainage systems and contributes to reduced water pollution after flooding, mitigating
       negative impacts on health—especially for children and the elderly. Telecommunications and electricity improve access to
       information and help early warning systems save lives. However, in situations where governance is poor, investment in such
       infrastructure is insufficient or does not consider that disaster risk, infrastructure damage, and service interruptions can have
       a cascading and compounding effect with devastating impact on economic growth.

  n	   Financial inclusion, disaster risk financing and insurance, social protection systems, and social safety nets have a proven positive
       impact on poverty and development. Conditional cash transfers contributed to a rapid poverty decrease in Latin America, and
       the approach is now being used in many developing countries. When structured as ‘adaptive social protection,’ these systems
       can help people and communities recover more quickly from disasters, reducing the likelihood of humanitarian crises. However,
       if disaster and climate risks are disregarded in the design of these instruments, they may create an unsustainable burden on
       public finance and inadvertently magnify the consequences of disasters.
