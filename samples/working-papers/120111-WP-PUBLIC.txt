Overview
Highlights
Data and evidence are the foundation of development policy and effective program
implementation, and countries need data to formulate policy and evaluate progress. This
evaluation’s objective was to assess how effectively the World Bank has supported
development data production, sharing, and use, and to suggest ways to improve its approach.
This evaluation defines development data as data produced by country systems, the World
Bank, or third parties on countries’ social, economic, and environmental issues.
At the global level, the World Bank has a strong reputation in development data and has been
highly effective in data production. It produces influential, widely used data and cross-country
indicators that fill important niches, benchmark countries, and stimulate research and policy
action.
The World Bank has also taken a prominent leadership role in global data partnerships so far.
However, the World Bank needs to determine its future role carefully because the global
partnership landscape is becoming more uncertain—as old partnerships phase out, the
complementarity of new partnerships is unclear. This makes the World Bank’s future role
especially pivotal because the sustainability of funding from global data partnerships at both
the national level and for some global data efforts is at risk. Without sustained funding, past
progress will be in jeopardy, as observed in some countries where data quality worsened when
trust fund support ended.
At the national level, the World Bank has been mostly effective at fostering its client
countries’ data production through its own financing and through financing from small trust
fund grants. It has been less effective in promoting data sharing; while the World Bank has
used its leverage in some of its client countries, it needs to do a better job at encouraging other
countries to share data. The World Bank has been even less effective in promoting data use by
governments and citizens.
The World Bank’s systemwide approach to building the capacity of national statistical
organizations yielded significant successes in countries where it was deployed, and it should
now add a focus on building subnational capacity and strengthening client countries’
administrative data systems.
Big data offers big opportunities, but it also has risks. The World Bank needs to make sure it
clearly understands when and how big data can complement traditional data in answering key
development questions related to its mission, and use big data analytics appropriately to
underpin its own decisions and to ensure that it supports its country clients effectively in big
data use. The World Bank still needs to address the implications for organizing big data work
internally, entering into corporate agreements with private providers (typically the producers
of big data), and seriously considering and addressing privacy and ethical concerns related to
big data use.

1. Evaluating Data for Development
Data and evidence are the foundation of development policy and the effective
implementation of programs. To varying degrees, countries use data for economic and
sectoral policy making and for planning, implementation, monitoring, targeting, and
administration of policies and programs. The global community also uses data to
varying degrees for programming assistance and tracking progress. Much research on
development issues relies on data. The agenda first set by the Millennium Development
Goals (2000–15) and now by the Sustainable Development Goals (2016–30) has ramped
up the demand for data to monitor progress toward targets.

The supply of data often has not kept up with demand. Half of the World Bank’s
member countries lack the data necessary to measure progress toward the twin goals of
ending extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity (Serajuddin and
others 2015). Data users have serious concerns about data quality and timeliness,
especially in low-income countries, and demand is unmet for disaggregated data for
local planning.

The World Bank has a long history of promoting data. The World Development
Indicators database began as a statistical appendix to the 1978 World Development Report
(added at President Robert S. McNamara’s urging, almost as an afterthought); it is now
“the most widely used knowledge product of the World Bank” and, thanks to the
World Bank’s Open Data initiative, its data are freely accessible to all (Besley and others
2015). Building on the start made in the 1970s, the World Bank’s role in promoting
development data became more prominent through the years, driven, for example, by
President James D. Wolfensohn’s 1996 vision of the World Bank as a Knowledge Bank,
efforts to monitor the Millennium Development Goals in the 2000s, and a movement
toward managing for results and evidence-based policy making. The country rankings
in Doing Business, an annual report launched in 2004, are a benchmark that receives
close attention from governments around the world.


Evaluating Data Production, Sharing, and Use
There is no policy or corporate procedure on development data in the World Bank
except a longstanding Operational Policy on debt data and an ongoing process to
produce: (i) a procedure governing the new Development Data Hub, (ii) a Procedure on
Data Acquisition (from vendors, other international organizations, and countries) and
(iii) an Open Data strategy.




                                                                                          1
CHAPTER 1
EVALUATING DATA FOR DEVELOPMENT
The World Bank has an Actions Program to address data gaps: Strategic Actions Program
for Addressing Development Data Gaps (World Bank 2015). As part of the Actions
Program, four Action Plans have been completed (civil registration and vital statics
(CRVS), price data, household surveys, and geospatial data), three Action Plans are in
preparation (economic statistics, gender, and population census), and two Action Plans
are planned (jobs data and firm-level data).

This evaluation asks, “How effectively has the World Bank supported the production,
sharing, and use of development data?” It reviews World Bank support for developing
countries’ capacity and data systems, data for the national and global public good,
engagements in international partnerships, and technological innovations, particularly
relating to big data. The World Bank supports data production, sharing, and use
through lending, technical assistance, and trust fund grants. This evaluation covers all
three forms of support, though not in equal depth. (Appendix A describes IEG’s
methodology for this evaluation.) The reference period is from 2004 (since the launch of
the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics) through the end of 2016, a period in which the
World Bank’s approach to data support underwent change (World Bank 2011). The
World Bank’s own use of data for decision-making purposes is not the primary focus of
this evaluation, mainly because other recent audits and evaluations are summarized in
Results and Performance of the World Bank Group 2016 (Managing for Development
Results). Compared with the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provide relatively little data support
and are outside the scope of this evaluation.

COUNTRY DATA SYSTEMS
This evaluation defines development data as data produced by country systems, the
World Bank, or third parties on countries’ social, economic, and environmental issues.
Development data come in several forms. Administrative data are the by-product of
routine public services delivered by either local or central government (registration of
births, marriages, and deaths; issuing drivers’ licenses; registration of land titles; and
recording vaccinations). Census and survey data are data collected periodically for the
whole population and purposively for a sample. Economic data on prices and interest
rates, employment, trade, and national income are in a category of their own. Big data
derive from data sets distinguished by size and the speed of their generation. The
private sector often generates big data. Open data refers to features including open and
free availability, access, and reuse.

To guide its inquiry, the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) developed a list of
ingredients for successful national data systems of the future (table 1.1).

METHODOLOGY
The evaluation is based on an intervention logic that was iteratively reconstructed in
dialogue with the literature review, the portfolio analysis, and evidence from case
studies (figure 1.1; appendix A). Briefly, the logic implies that to nurture data use, the
type of data supplied must be relevant to user needs. Supply can potentially elicit data
use and demand, though it is not a sufficient condition for it. If data are of good quality,
relevant to citizen needs, and widely shared, their uses might proliferate. People will
use data more and become demanding consumers. As rising demand boosts supply, a
feedback loop (or virtuous circle) develops that leads to a self-sustaining, user-centered
data culture. However, this will happen only if governments and their partners ensure
that the data produced are in line with user priorities and if governments commit to
sharing data with their people and are willing to use it for policy making.

Better data and greater data use can influence decision making and development
outcomes positively. How and when that happens depends on a host of complicated
factors (including political) that this evaluation did not pursue. The overarching

evaluation question inspired four lines of inquiry that guided the data collection and
analysis and the framing of findings and recommendations (box 1.1). The evaluation
reviews the World Bank’s contributions to development data in individual client
countries and its support to data production and partnerships serving the global
community, based on the premise that development data are an essential global public
good that could be under-produced if left to individual countries.


 Box 1.1. Four Lines of Inquiry Guiding the Evaluation
 ▪   Has the World Bank contributed effectively to data for the global public good and data
     partnerships? (chapter 2)
 ▪   How effectively has the World Bank helped countries strengthen data production?
     (chapter 3)
 ▪   How effectively has the World Bank promoted data sharing and use in countries?
     (chapter 4)
 ▪   Is the World Bank keeping up with technological innovations, particularly those relating
     to big data? (chapter 5)


The evaluation’s initial building blocks consisted of a literature review, development of
a theory of change, World Bank staff interviews with key informants, and a portfolio
review. The findings from this foundational work informed the selection of evaluation
instruments and country case studies and helped frame the survey questions. At the
global level, the evaluation conducted a structured review of development data
partnerships, and structured surveys of targeted World Bank staff (721 responded, or 30
percent) and country stakeholders (506 responded, or 26 percent). A questionnaire
obtained the views of 31 development partners. At the country level, the evaluation
included 11 case studies of the World Bank’s role in country systems involving statistics
production, sharing, and use. Various data collection and analysis modalities underlie
the cases (field-based and desk-based cases, and project performance assessment
reports (PPARs)). IEG purposively selected the countries where case studies took place
based on criteria such as the level of World Bank funding, the diversity of support
(from lending to advisory services), and the inclusion of large and small countries. The
countries selected were Afghanistan, Bolivia, Ghana, Jordan, Kenya, India, Indonesia,
Peru, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Ukraine. Furthermore, IEG conducted a structured survey
of stakeholders in the national statistical systems of 24 countries that yielded 506
respondents, a 26 percent response rate. Appendix A provides further details on the
evaluation methodology.

2. Global Development Data
 Highlights
 ❖ The World Bank has been an effective leader and partner in development data for global audiences,
    achieving synergy between producing data for the global public good and serving country clients.
 ❖ Support for data production was more intense than for data use.
 ❖ The World Bank should articulate clear goals for its engagements in global data partnerships and
   maintain a coherent, focused approach.

In 1990, development professionals looking for globally comparable data would buy the
World Development Report to access its statistical appendix, which contained the World
Development Indicators. The 1990 World Development Report also presented the first
estimates of global poverty, based on household surveys for only 22 countries (World
Bank 1990). Today, a simple Internet search gives people access to the relevant World
Development Indicators in milliseconds, and more than 1,000 household surveys from 159
countries—more than 2 million randomly sampled households representing 87 percent
of the developing world’s population—are the basis of global poverty estimates (World
Bank 2017). The World Bank has been at the center of a quantum leap in the past 25
years in the quantity and availability of development data.

This chapter addresses the World Bank’s role and contributions to the global data
agenda. It explores the World Bank’s role and accomplishments on supporting data as a
global public good as well as its support to global data partnerships (chapters 3 and 4
cover support to individual countries).1


Development Data for the Global Good
The World Bank’s position as a leader and valued partner in development data is
broadly recognized and appreciated. IEG’s structured surveys and literature review
found that the World Bank is generally expected to use its global reach and financial,
analytical, and convening powers to support data, which is widely seen as an essential
but underprovided public good. In interviews, surveys, and country case studies, staff
and stakeholders generally expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the World
Bank’s global data contributions, and expectations that it should do more to ensure
high-quality data for all countries.

In IEG’s structured survey of World Bank staff and country stakeholders, more than 60
percent rate the World Bank as highly effective or effective in making key data sets
available globally. About half of respondents in each group rate the World Bank as

highly effective or effective in developing standards and protocols to ensure global data
quality. Between one-third and half of the respondents gave favorable ratings to the
World Bank’s performance in supporting global data innovations (such as open data,
big data, or the use of mobile devices for surveys) and in bringing development
partners and governments together to discuss global data issues (figure 2.1).

The World Bank produces influential, widely used global data and cross-country
indicators that fill important niches, benchmark countries, and stimulate research and
policy action. Examples include Doing Business, the Global Findex database, global
poverty indicators, the Statistical Capacity Indicator (SCI), and the International
Comparison Program (ICP) produced by a dedicated partnership program housed at
the World Bank which is possibly the largest statistical operation in the world and
allows price comparisons across countries and time through purchasing power
parities.2 Though controversial at times and criticized by some on methodological
grounds, all of these data and indicators are influential in their respective areas and
may have contributed to greater data usage at the global level. Doing Business attracts
unrivaled media and high-level attention. The Evaluation Panel Review of the
Development Economics Vice Presidency (DEC) noted that the World Bank’s
“leadership in the ICP project shows the potential for the World Bank to create a
position at the heart of the global statistics community.” It recommended that the
World Bank “commit to the ICP, which is a flagship example of global cooperation in
data and statistics work where the World Bank Group plays a leading role” (Besley and

others 2015). The global poverty measures, Global Findex, and the SCI fill data gaps and
provide useful platforms for assessing poverty, financial inclusion, and statistical
systems, respectively, in a manner that is comparable across countries. The World
Bank’s work on household surveys, including the Living Standards Measurement
Study, propelled a virtual explosion of multipurpose surveys that help fill the void
created by the weakness of other statistics sources.3

The global practices and regional vice presidencies lead or take part in many informal
and organizational data partnerships that support data production, dissemination, and
use sectors and topics. The IEG team identified 34 such partnerships (based on a web
search, interviews, and information from DEC). Of these, the World Bank housed 12
partnerships and the other 22 reside elsewhere or are simply informal alliances that
work on data issues. Partners include the International Monetary Fund (IMF), other
multilateral development banks, and United Nations (UN) entities.4 The partnerships
housed at the World Bank focus mostly on data collection, dissemination, and
benchmarking in health, energy, education, and other sectors.

The United Nations Statistical Commission is at the apex of the global statistical system
and has a broad mandate to promote statistics, coordinate specialized agencies,
improve methods, and also the adoption of global standards for statistics.5 The World
Bank is positioned in this global landscape as a member or observer in many
international statistical bodies, a major program funder and implementer, and a support
provider for statistical capacity. Although it has wisely avoided formal data standard
setting, the World Bank has helped foster good practices (for example, on poverty
measurement and survey design, where it has helped harmonize indicators and
standards).6

Using its convening power to support global statistical efforts, the World Bank helped
establish (and is a member of) data partnership programs that made important
contributions and balanced global and national data needs well (box 2.1). The World
Bank had a significant role in thought leadership and coordination, and provided
technical, operational, and administrative expertise and staff time. Since 1999, it has
provided $50.9 million of funding through its Development Grant Facility, 54 percent of
which went to partnerships housed outside of the World Bank—Partnership in Statistics
for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) and Open Data for Development. The
rest of the funding went to the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics (MAPS) secretariat
and the ICP housed at the World Bank. Interviews and external evaluations of DEC and
global data partnerships hosted there show that DEC has been a strong anchor for much
of this effort and a competent host for prominent global data partnerships.7

CHAPTER 2
GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT DATA
The World Bank fostered successful innovations in data collection, sharing, and use, in
particular, pertaining to household surveys, demonstrating the complementarities
between research and support for data production, sharing, and use. PovcalNet is an
extremely popular online tool that automates poverty calculations and allows users to
replicate the World Bank’s estimates. The World Bank helped develop and promote
Survey Solutions, a free, computer-assisted personal interviewing software that
eliminates the need for pen-and-paper surveys, incorporates automatic data consistency
checks, and speeds up the time from fieldwork to publication of data. The World Bank
conducts extensive research on survey methodology. With its partners in the
International Household Survey Network, the World Bank developed tools and
guidelines for data cataloging and archiving and engaged more than 60 countries in the
Accelerated Data Program to document, archive, and disseminate microdata. It
developed ADePT, a software platform for economic analysis that automates and
standardizes the production of analytical reports from various types of surveys, thus
raising efficiency and reducing human errors. These innovative tools are free to
download, well disseminated, and respected by professionals in the field. In country
visits, IEG saw several examples of counterpart uptake of these tools.

During 2007–16, the World Bank Group considerably stepped up its efforts to increase
the availability and use of gender data by supporting the capacity of client countries to
produce gender statistics, preparing tools to help produce and analyze gender data, and
establishing partnerships. The World Bank’s Gender Action Plan bolstered the gender
data focus, along with a commitment made as part of the 17th Replenishment of the
International Development Association (IDA17). That commitment, to “roll out
statistical activities to increase sex-disaggregated data and improve gender statistical
capacity in at least 15 IDA countries” between fiscal years 2015 and 2017, was met. The
World Bank is an active member of the UN-convened Inter-Agency and Expert Group
on Gender Statistics and has provided financial and technical assistance to national
statistical offices (NSOs) and line ministries to collect and use gender data. The World
Bank made financial contributions to the UN Statistics Division’s gender statistics
program through the MAPS program. More and better data disaggregated by gender is
a key part of the World Bank Group’s current gender strategy (many SDG indicators
require gender disaggregation).

 Box 2.1. Major Partnership Programs for Development Data
 IEG selected nine data partnerships for review because they are formal, relatively prominent, and meet
 one or more of the following criteria: have a pivotal role in statistical capacity building, address
 important data gaps in the global statistical landscape, and promote new or innovative approaches.
 1968: International Comparison Program is a partnership of the statistical offices of up to 199
 countries, housed at the World Bank. The program produces internationally comparable price and
 volume measures for gross domestic product.
 1980: The Living Standards Measurement Study Program is a household survey program focused on
 generating high-quality data, improving survey methods, building capacity, and facilitating the
 household survey data use.
 1999: Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building is a multidonor trust fund that aims to improve the
 capacity of developing countries to produce and use statistics, with an overall objective of supporting
 effective decision making for development. The trust fund supports projects aiming to strengthen
 national statistical systems in priority areas and develop statistical capacity sustainably, including data
 openness and accessibility in line with the Open Data Initiative and innovative approaches to improve
 data collection.
 1999: Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) is a partnership to
 promote better use and production of statistics throughout the developing world. PARIS21, a
 worldwide network, is committed to evidence-based decision making through the improvement of
 institutional and technical capacity, thus stimulating, meeting, and improving national demand
 through comprehensive national plans for improvement.
 2004: Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics is a global plan for improving development statistics,
 agreed to at the 2004 Second International Roundtable on Managing for Development Results in
 Morocco. Eight programs have been developed with the UN and other international agencies to put
 the identified actions into practice.
 2009: Statistics for Results Facility is a World Bank–managed multidonor initiative to support
 statistical development in developing countries. The initiative and its catalytic fund promote statistical
 capacity building and support better policy formulation and decision making through improvements
 in the production, availability, and use of official statistics.
 2011: The Global Financial Inclusion (Global Findex) database is a comprehensive database on
 financial inclusion that provides in-depth data on how individuals save, borrow, make payments, and
 manage risks. The first Global Findex database was launched in 2011 in partnership with Gallup and
 with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and a second edition was launched in 2014.
 2014: Open Data for Development is a program designed to help developing countries use open data
 standards, and understand and exploit the benefits of open data. Its objectives are to support
 developing countries in planning, executing, and running open data initiatives; increase open data use
 in developing countries; and grow the evidence base on open data’s effects for development.
 2015: The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data is a network of governments, civil
 society, and businesses working together to strengthen the inclusivity, trust, and innovation in how
 data are used to promote sustainable development around the world.


The World Bank Open Data website is a preeminent global clearinghouse for
development data, containing an extensive and user-friendly compilation of indicators,
microdata, tools, and guidelines that attracts high web traffic.8 The World Bank’s two

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT DATA
most visited websites are the English and Spanish language data sites, which account
for around one-third of all traffic to World Bank websites, and five of the World Bank’s
12 most visited websites pertain to data. The Open Data Initiative, launched in 2010,
was a milestone for free data sharing in development. The World Bank also publishes a
range of globally oriented publications that monitor and analyze poverty, shared
prosperity, progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and other
indicators.


Partnerships for Statistical Capacity Building
Over the period 2004–11, the World Bank played a pivotal role in defining the global
support architecture for statistical capacity building in its client countries. It
spearheaded MAPS in 2004 and the Busan Action Plan for Statistics in 2011 (both of
which provided coherence to global statistical capacity–building efforts), contributed to
PARIS21, and established the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building and the
Statistics for Results Facility. All of these programs emphasized the processes and
systems underlying the development of statistical capacity. External evaluations and
IEG’s Global Program Review show that these partnership programs performed well
and made progress toward their goals to improve the capacity of developing countries
to compile and use statistics to support management for development results (World
Bank 2011). The strongest progress was on production of statistics and on national
statistical development strategies.

The major data partnerships housed at the World Bank have collectively received $250
million in donor contributions from 2000 to 2016, for which the World Bank has been
the trustee and the implementing agency. The single biggest donor (65 percent of total
contributions) is the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), which
focused on general statistical capacity building. The next largest donor is the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation (21 percent), which focused on the Living Standards
Measurement Study and Global Findex.

These partnership programs provided knowledge, networking, technical assistance,
and advocacy at the country level; some also allocated grant funding that supported
more than 80 countries and regional initiatives. The Regional Program for Improving
Household Surveys and Measurement of Living Conditions in Latin America and the
Caribbean is often cited as a successful partnership that made a difference in promoting
household survey production (for example, Beegle and others, 2016).

External evaluations (World Bank 2011; PARIS21 2015) and interviews show that
PARIS21 has been a small but key actor in statistical capacity building. It gained the

                                                                   GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT DATA
trust of statistical offices through its training and diagnostic work, developed a strong
network, and broadly delivered on its mandate: it was successful at raising awareness
of the importance of statistics, helped countries develop national statistical data
systems, and is a valuable and value-adding part of the architecture of data and
statistics development and cooperation. The World Bank provided financial support to
PARIS21 through the Development Grant Facility, but the facility has now ended (as
part of a larger cost-cutting exercise), putting the ability to sustain the programs’
achievements in jeopardy (the facility provided direct grant support for high-value,
innovative global partnership programs to client countries that other funding sources
could not adequately support.)

In conclusion, the World Bank channeled support for statistical capacity building
through partnership programs it helped convene, support, and execute. These
partnerships represented a relevant, coherent articulation of efforts in the past and
aligned well with the global development agenda and the World Bank’s country
priorities. Support was more intense for national statistical data systems and data
production than for data use and data users in developing countries. The literature
review, interviews, and country cases suggest that engagement with data users was
either feeble or nonexistent, and no strategies existed for stimulating demand for data
from government, civil society, private sector, academia, and media.


New Partnerships for Data: Innovation and Proliferation
The World Bank is also a member of a newer generation of partnerships focused on
data innovation and housed elsewhere. Much of this effort is experimental with no clear
architecture and funding mechanism.

The Open Government Partnership is a multilateral initiative that aims to secure
concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens,
fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. IEG found
that the governments of Indonesia and Tanzania were committed to this partnership,
and that the World Bank supported national open government initiatives in these
countries effectively. This led, for example, to greater fiscal transparency and increased
use of government administrative records.

Based on IEG’s experience with evaluating global partnerships, there are grounds to
expect that setting up new programs outside of established institutions would lead to
lengthy delays and high costs (IEG 2015a). For example, the Global Program for
Sustainable Development Data housed at the UN Foundation—established as part of
the post-2015 development agenda—has made little progress to date; according to


                                                                                          13

GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT DATA
interviews, it has produced few outputs, and the governance structure is still
provisional. Yet the World Bank supports this new partnership and has recently created
the Trust Fund for Innovations in Development Data to promote a common funding
source for scalable innovations in data production and use. Locating the funding source
(Trust Fund for Innovations in Development Data) at the World Bank and the
governance mechanism (Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data) outside
of the World Bank seems impractical and does not promote alignment with the World
Bank’s country engagements.

The new partnerships for data innovation are not framed around an articulated
architecture, unlike the previous generation of partnerships for statistical capacity
building that all united in support of national strategies for the development of statistics
(NSDS). It is unclear why so many separate global initiatives are needed or how they
relate to each other. Data innovation partnerships could be consolidated and their goals
clarified, and the World Bank could engage in them more selectively. The World Bank
Group Strategic Actions Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps (World Bank
2015a) identifies how some partnerships will contribute to the plan, but does not
address many others, nor does it identify funding sources for the anticipated increase in
support to data production.

Even though the size and effectiveness of the World Bank’s contribution to informal
partnerships and interagency working groups is hard to assess, these engagements
reflect the breadth of data-related work across the World Bank and the proclivity to
collaborate with other partners. Many good initiatives focus on producing and sharing
globally comparable sectoral data, but several databases that a global practice collected
and set up at considerable expense found little use and eventually shut down. The
World Bank Group Strategic Action Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps also
does not address the World Bank’s role and contribution to informal partnerships led
by the global practices and regions, and the overall picture that emerges is one of
initiatives that are individually relevant, but sometimes disjointed.


The World Bank’s Role in the Global Statistical Landscape
The demand for data to monitor Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators
greatly exceeds the supply. The 17 SDG goals have 169 targets and 230 indicators (of
which about half lack sound methodologies, adequate country coverage, or both).
Several of these indicators may not be relevant for national policy making and will
likely be unrealistic for countries to collect. Most of those interviewed by IEG saw SDG
monitoring as more of a risk than an opportunity for statistical systems in developing
countries. Many were concerned that the SDG agenda is setting up statistical systems

                                                                   GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT DATA
for failure—that is, countries’ NSOs could unfairly come to be seen as having failed at
rising to the herculean challenge of SDG monitoring, though some also see SDG
monitoring as an opportunity to give the NSOs more prominence.9

Asked to reflect on World Bank priorities going forward, 54 percent of staff included
“making key data sets available globally” in their top five areas of strategic thrust—a
higher proportion than for any other area. Fifty percent of country stakeholders chose
“global availability of data sets” in their five preferred areas (appendix C). In write-in
comments to the structured surveys conducted for this evaluation, staff, stakeholders,
and partners noted the many and diverse data gaps that deserve more attention, with
no clear pattern regarding sectors, data type, and balance between international
comparability and individual countries’ data needs. Likewise, staff are quick to note
major data gaps, with emphasis on those gaps that most affect their own sector or line
of work (for example, infrastructure data, household surveys, or enterprise data). The
tension between international comparability and individual countries’ data needs can
be real, and given that resources are finite, the World Bank may consider developing a
methodology to weigh the costs and benefits of country specificity versus cross-country
comparability.

The World Bank has committed itself to increasing support for poverty data and
adopted a corporate target of supporting a new household survey every three years in
78 data-deprived countries, starting in 2020. This commitment is in line with IEG’s
recommendations in the evaluation The Poverty Focus of Country Programs: Lessons from
World Bank Experience (World Bank 2015b), and will support measurement of progress
toward the twin goals and selected SDG targets. However, funding is uncertain.

Trade-offs can exist between global and national data priorities, but are not too great to
overcome. Domestic policy makers may want better economic statistics, geographically
disaggregated indicators, and surveys and censuses of economic establishments for
taxation purposes. Donors and international organizations can favor social statistics,
global monitoring data, and household surveys (which they sometimes commission in
an uncoordinated fashion). In practice, the World Bank often managed this trade-off
well. It has helped build statistical capacity (chapter 3), and the household surveys it
promotes are designed for multiple purposes, not just poverty monitoring.

The World Bank has an important role to play in coordinating and funding support for
national statistical systems. Data from PARIS21 and the literature review and
interviews conducted for this evaluation point to a fragmented, redundant, and
insufficiently funded global statistical community in which agency-specific interests
sometimes take precedence over country needs. The World Bank could coordinate and



                                                                                          15

fund general statistical support to countries and contribute to partnerships that serve
global coordination and leadership roles.


Conclusions
The World Bank has earned a solid reputation in the field of development data based on
its research and technical expertise, the ability to link global needs to national needs,
initiatives that it sustained for the long term, and its well-aligned and successful
partnerships. The World Bank has performed well on data for the global public good
because of its strong ability to engage with countries’ statistical systems through the full
range of its financial and knowledge instruments, and by working closely with global
partners. The best data initiatives and partnership engagements filled clear niches—
adequate staff and sustained funding from internal sources and trust funds maintained
them for decades. This type of long-term engagement helped build the World Bank’s
comparative advantage in household surveys. The implication going forward is that the
World Bank should consider the long-term sustainability of its data initiatives.

The World Bank and its partners will need to protect the gains made under MAPS and
the Busan Action Plan for Statistics, which provided legitimacy and funding for
statistical capacity building.10 The risk is that the existing, well-functioning partnership
architecture will stop receiving adequate funding as donors’ attention shifts to a newer
generation of less clearly articulated data partnerships with lofty ambitions,
overlapping goals, and insufficient funding. The Development Grant Facility phased
out, thus ending the World Bank’s financial support for PARIS21, with potentially
adverse consequences for the small, but well-regarded program with a solid record of
accomplishment. This could reverse past gains in statistical capacity.

The World Bank and its partners will also need to work toward maintaining coherent
global efforts. The World Bank has not spelled out priorities for its engagements with
the global statistical community, and for how its formal and informal data partnerships
will support the proposed scaling-up of World Bank investments in data.

1This report is about data as a public good, meaning data that are non-rival and non-
excludable. One person or country’s enjoyment of data does not affect its enjoyment by others
and no person or country can be excluded from sharing its benefits. Some data are clearly global
public goods (international price comparisons, for example), other data are clearly national
public goods (population numbers by district, for example), and some are both global and
national public goods. Data for the private good (proprietary firm data, for example) are not
covered in this report.
2This is not an exhaustive list. The World Bank also produces data on member countries’ debt,
the Worldwide Governance Indicators, the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment data,
enterprise surveys, Service Delivery Indicators, the Atlas of Social Protection: Indicators of
Resilience and Equity, and more.
3Another example of data partnership is a joint World Bank–IFC initiative that in 2008 launched
GEMX, a private sector–led global bond index that tracks emerging market local currency
sovereign bonds. This index is still published, but was not widely adopted (World Bank 2016).

3. Building the Data Capacity of Countries
 Highlights
 ❖ The World Bank used its own financing and financing from small trust fund grants to engage a very
   large number of countries on data activities.
 ❖ Improvements in data availability, quality, and timeliness are observable in the few countries where
   the World Bank engaged in-depth on institutional reforms and capacity strengthening.
 ❖ Progress is slow and uneven, many countries are still data deprived, and others continue to have
   weak data systems, especially regarding administrative data.
 ❖ Country clients need support that is more coordinated and long-term from the World Bank in
   strengthening their administrative data systems and supporting statistical capacity building beyond
   national statistical offices.

This chapter examines the World Bank’s role and contributions to countries’ data
production and statistical capacity building. Although each type of data (for example,
household surveys, census, and price data) undeniably requires its own set of skills,
techniques, methods, and protocols, this chapter focuses on the building blocks that are
the basis for many data-related activities. Statistical capacity as defined by Partnership
in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) “Is the sustainable ability of
countries to meet user (government, policy makers, researchers, citizens, and business)
needs for high-quality data and statistics (that is, timely, reliable, accessible, and
relevant)” (PARIS21 2015). Capacity building has four aspects: institutions (including
laws and enabling environment), human capital (knowledge, skills, and staff
incentives), organizations (budget, infrastructure, leadership, collaboration, and
coordination between statistical stakeholders), and data systems and technologies. The
chapter highlights the evolving model and expanding scope of World Bank support to
country data systems while focusing more extensively on the core approach to capacity
building of National Statistical Offices that has been prevalent until recently.

The evidence underlying this chapter is from a review of past evaluations and project
documents, surveys and interviews with a large number of partners and clients, and 11
in-depth case studies of statistical capacity–building initiatives. Only a small subset of
World Bank statistical capacity–building projects were subject to a formal evaluation.1
Therefore, this chapter focuses on the extent to which project designs are in line with
well-established good practices rather than on detailed analysis of results achieved,
except for the case study countries where in-depth analysis was possible.

CHAPTER 3
BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES

A Reliable Partner of National Statistical Systems
IEG consulted with 276 external stakeholders through interviews and 506 stakeholders
through surveys and found that overall, the World Bank is perceived as a trusted
government partner with sought-after statistical expertise, one that benefits from a far-
reaching convening power, is active in a wide range of development areas, and has a
distinct role as a funding organization. The World Bank forged this solid reputation
through a variety of technical and financial engagements to support countries’ data
production, sharing (to a lesser extent), and use (to a limited extent).

The portfolio review conducted for this evaluation found that between 2005 and 2015,
World Bank commitments for data activities averaged about $90 million per year and
increased in the latter half of the evaluation period. The World Bank is still the largest
provider of development cooperation in statistics with 37 percent of the total global
commitment and 53 percent of the country-specific commitments in 2014 (PARIS21
2016a, 23–24). This is a lower-bound estimate that does not include the many activities
in which the World Bank produces, shares, or uses data as an input to or by-product of
other work (for example, analytical work that helps countries analyze and interpret
data, or impact evaluations that collect surveys).

Relatively few countries absorbed most donor support for data—the top 25 recipients
received more than 60 percent of support. Furthermore, countries with the lowest
statistical capacity do not always receive the most assistance. The World Bank’s long-
term statistical capacity development support is also concentrated on a few countries,
leaving others with a minimal level of assistance. Twenty-six countries obtained World
Bank assistance with a loan or grant of more than $2 million dedicated entirely to data.
In other countries, the World Bank privileged direct support to targeted data collection
or sharing needs. Box 3.1, Figure 3.1, and appendix B provide more details on the World
Bank’s portfolio of activity.


 Box 3.1. The World Bank Portfolio of Projects on Data for Development
 IEG identified 225 World Bank projects that supported countries’ data production, sharing, or use
 between 2005 and 2015. IEG classified these projects into the following three categories:
 ▪   Type 1: The entire project supported data
 ▪   Type 2: At least one entire component supported data
 ▪   Type 3: The project supported relevant data activities, but the project components were not
     specifically data related.
 Statistical capacity–building initiatives are type 1 projects. The World Bank relies heavily on
 multidonor partnerships to invest global resources in national statistical systems. Among the 139 type
 1 projects, 125 were trust funded (these represented 30 percent of total data commitments).

 Note: Type 1 projects supported data activities entirely; type 2 projects had at least one component that supported data entirely
 (the commitment value for only the data component is included); and type 3 projects supported relevant data activities, but the
 project components were not specifically data related. Only the commitment value for data is included. This report understates
 the commitment value of these projects because IEG excluded development policy financing, as the amounts could not be
 reliably estimated. The IBRD IDA category combines the data for both sources of funding.


The World Bank has been most effective when partnering with other donors to support
statistical capacity building, but it too rarely does so. The portfolio review found that
only 28 of the 201 data projects reviewed involved other development partners.2 In
surveys conducted for the Statistics for Results Facility evaluation, national statistical
offices (NSOs) expressed concern that development partners continue to have weak
harmonization (Ngo and Flatt 2014). As in other sectors, the advantages to countries of
multi-partner data support include more coordinated and harmonized approaches and
pooled funding. Although the World Bank is governments’ preferred partner to work
on data issues in certain regions (especially Africa), it has less leverage to influence
reforms in others. About 44 percent of the number of data commitments and 45 percent
of the value of data commitments were to African countries.

Pooled-funding mechanisms are particularly effective to ensure donor alignment and
government ownership. However, this is the exception in World Bank lending. In
Kenya and Rwanda, the World Bank followed the United Kingdom in joining an
established basket-fund modality and had a critical role in the Joint Government-
Development Partners Steering Committee. This mechanism was a channel for
communication, setting priorities, and upholding professional standards among the

                                                                                                                               21

participating agencies. All parties interviewed during the case study depicted it as a key
factor in explaining the fast development of Rwanda’s NSO capacity. Conversely, in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, the World Bank did not join an existing pooled-funding
mechanism established by the United Nations Population Fund to support the census.

Partners and clients most appreciated the World Bank’s capacity to combine statistical
expertise—providing credibility to the statistical information generated by country
systems—and the managerial expertise to lead on large investments. These comparative
advantages emerged clearly in all case studies. The World Bank’s contribution to
reestablishing trust in the Peruvian statistical system is highly significant in this regard.
Official poverty estimates were unavailable in Peru between 2004 and 2007, which
triggered a loss of credibility of the NSO. The authorities requested World Bank
technical assistance to improve methodologies and help restore public trust. Instead of
providing only traditional technical assistance, the World Bank established an external
advisory committee made up of poverty experts from the public sector, academia, and
international organizations to agree on the best way to produce comparable poverty
estimates. The NSO was able to issue comparable poverty figures for all years from 2001
on, public trust was restored, and several data initiatives resulted from this experience.


Direct Support to Data Collection and Sharing
Direct financing of data collection activities is the most widespread form of World Bank
support to data production, and 56 percent of the projects reviewed involved support
for collecting data. Production of household survey data received the most attention in
a number of projects (20 percent). The World Bank Group Data Council identified five
priority areas that will be the focus of World Bank engagement going forward.3 About
40 percent of projects included support for collecting data in at least one of these five
priority areas. Although this form of direct support quickly triggers visible impact, it
fails to address systemic issues that hinder countries’ long-term production capacity.
Capacity-building initiatives can better address these issues. The World Bank used two
approaches depending on the configuration of countries’ needs, existing capacity, and
funding availability.

In responding to a broadening data agenda that recognizes the importance of data
sharing and use, World Bank support has widened to encompass a broader array of
activities such as improving data dissemination and open data initiatives. Of the 201
projects reviewed, 68 projects provided direct support for increasing public access to
development data—for example, through open data portals, training on publishing
microdata, and technical assistance for dissemination policy.

Building Capacity with Institutional Reforms and Technical Strengthening
Under the auspices of global partnerships, the World Bank has contributed to testing
and adopting a sectorwide statistical capacity–building approach anchored on the
design, funding, and implementation of national strategies for the development of
statistics (NSDS). Existing evaluations (Willoughby 2008; World Bank 2014; UN 2016;
UNFPA 2015) point to the approach’s high relevance to country needs and to
encouraging progress (though slow) in improving data production. Evidence is still thin
on the impact of specific statistical capacity–building components and on the most
adequate sequencing.

The larger statistical capacity–building projects the World Bank managed have typically
had the following components: institutional development and legal reform, human
resource capacity development, development of statistical systems and databases, data
collection and dissemination, and support to physical infrastructure and equipment.
Only few countries benefited from this full package. Most projects—particularly those
funded by the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB)—had the resources
to cover only one or two of those components.

In the overall portfolio, 50 percent of the projects supported the strengthening of client
institutional capacity with various degrees of success. In particular, the World Bank
supported reforms that seek to enhance NSOs’ autonomy and stature, ensuring that
they are independent of a parent agency and their management is not vested into a
governing body (typically a board of directors). Making NSOs autonomous helps shield
official statistics from political interference and improves the organization’s
effectiveness and control over staff resources (Kiregyera 2015). Autonomous NSOs are
also more respected, attract public confidence, and raise the profile of statistics in the
country, as shown in the examples in box 3.2.

BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES

 Box 3.2. The Significance of National Statistical Office Autonomy: Two Contrasting Cases
 Kenya: In August 2010, the government of Kenya acted on the recommendation of its
 autonomous national statistical office (NSO) and rejected census results submitted by eight
 northeastern districts because the population figures were inflated and unsupported by
 documented trends of births, deaths, and migration. The eight districts’ leaders promptly
 filed a lawsuit with the high court. After four years, a five-judge panel agreed with the NSO.
 The bureau was free to declare its figures official statistics eligible for use in public policy,
 including determining how to divide the national revenue among the 47 counties.
 The decision gave the NSO much-needed credibility. If the appellate judges had ruled in
 favor of the eight districts, the NSO would have faced years of uphill struggle trying to
 nurture a nascent institution while repairing the damage to its reputation.
 Ukraine: Under the 1993 law, the NSO reported directly to the Cabinet of Ministers of
 Ukraine, had its own budget, and enjoyed operational autonomy. However, the government
 reorganization of 2013 put the NSO under the supervision of the Ministry of Economic
 Development and Trade. The NSO lost the autonomy it previously enjoyed, along with much
 of its professional independence. Under this arrangement, the NSO submits its work program
 to its parent agency, which can approve or reject the line items. Resources are insufficient to
 cover physical infrastructure maintenance.
 A new draft law on statistics is now in preparation. It includes changes to give the NSO
 greater operational autonomy and professional independence by returning to the reporting
 structure that was in place before 2013 and establishing an advisory body of data producers
 and users.


To improve the quality of data produced by client countries, World Bank financing set
priorities for human capacity strengthening, especially through training for NSO staff—
the most common form of support in 88 percent of the reviewed projects in the
portfolio. Furthermore, 40 percent of the reviewed portfolio sought to improve
statistical methods, standards, and classifications. The interviewed NSO staff
particularly appreciated the World Bank’s support for the adoption of internationally
accepted standards in data collection and the transfer of best practices in projection for
economic statistics, an area somewhat neglected by other donors.

IEG reviewed the available project completion documents for 75 of 146 closed World
Bank operations to assess the results of World Bank support for data activities. IEG
rated the extent of results achieved for each dimension of statistical capacity building on
a scale of 0 to 3 (with 0 representing no documented results and 3 representing a high
degree of results achievement).4 Strengthening legal frameworks and building human
capacity are two dimensions with well-documented positive achievements, though
efficiency could improve. Issues often surfaced regarding per diem for trainees,
selection of trainees, and the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of training. The World
Bank could have used the technical expertise of specialized institutes better, such as the

East Africa Statistical Training Center based in Dar es Salaam. And higher salaries in
the private sector can make it hard for NSOs to retain trained staff, yet support to NSOs
on human resource management was rare.

Data reliability, timeliness, and quality control improved in client countries where the
World Bank intervened with a comprehensive package of activities and large funding,
as illustrated by the evolution of the Statistical Capacity Indicator (SCI) in case study
countries (figure 3.2).5 However, this progress is not attributable to World Bank
interventions alone because the SCI also increased elsewhere, but improvements in
national statistical systems’ fundamentals associated with World Bank interventions
likely translated into improved data production capacity also beyond the SCI metrics.

Development and implementation of NSDS has been the cornerstone of the World
Bank’s statistical capacity building, and most projects have used the NSDS as their
operative backbone. Until recently, the World Bank was a main funder of PARIS21,
which spearheaded the NSDS. The World Bank also implemented a large number of
TFSCB initiatives centered on developing or operationalizing NSDS.

As of January 2016, 58 of 77 IDA countries have implemented an NSDS, are now
designing an NSDS, or are awaiting the implementation of an NSDS. An additional 14
countries are in the process of planning an NSDS (PARIS21 2016b, 2). The growing
number of countries implementing NSDSs is promising because an NSDS is a powerful
framework for building capacity and mainstreaming statistics; they also promote donor
alignment (PARIS21 2015b). Unlike plans in some other sectors, NSOs have mostly

                                                                                                            25
CHAPTER 3
BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES
owned NSDS and used them to coordinate donor support. In India, state governments
are developing their own NSDS with World Bank support. The feedback from
interviews and surveys is largely positive on the usefulness of NSDS and the
effectiveness of the World Bank in supporting them. However, while providing a
common framework for cross-sectoral data collection, NSDS are not sufficient to ensure
effective coordination between the NSO and line ministries, which remains weak in
many countries. In addition, in countries that do not benefit from substantial funding
from the World Bank and its partners, NSDS implementation can stall because of low
capacity and lack of resources (PARIS21 2016c). Closing both the multicountry
Statistical Capacity Building Program (STATCAP) and the Statistics for Results Facility
Catalytic Fund, and the decision to stop funding PARIS21, threaten future progress.


Statistical Capacity Building in Fragile States
Data gaps are often dire in countries affected by fragility, conflict, and violence. The
community of experts working on fragility is divided on whether it is a good idea to set
up formal statistical systems—an inherently slow process—or whether this step should
be advanced through technology and alternative data sources. Meanwhile, the World
Bank has undertaken statistical capacity–building activities in almost all countries in a
fragile situation. These are mostly small trust-funded activities targeting specific data
collection (for example, support to the household budget survey in the Republic of
Yemen or to Kosovo’s judicial statistics), or just-in-time support to the NSO (for
example, support to Lebanon’s statistical master plan).

The World Bank also planned large projects in several fragile countries, committing $14
million to Afghanistan to strengthen the country’s statistical system, $11 million in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and $9 million in South Sudan. In Sudan, the World
Bank supported the fifth population census with a $34.4 million grant. The population
headcount was instrumental in defining power sharing between North and South and
the territorial organization of the new state of South Sudan.

Although the World Bank has had some success in the face of adverse conditions, it
designed projects that were too complicated in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sudan. In
Afghanistan, a series of events in 2013 that were outside the statistical office’s control,
coordination challenges with the twinning partner, the political situation and security
issues, and inadequate design slowed project implementation and led to the cancelation
of two-thirds of the funds. In contexts where institutions and capabilities are the
weakest, the World Bank and its partners need to adapt their standard model and
deploy specific expertise to fit these special circumstances.

                                                       BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES

Success Factors in Statistical Capacity-Building Initiatives
In the fast-moving, tech-heavy world of the data revolution, statistical capacity–
building initiatives are reputedly slow-paced, unwieldy, and somewhat archaic
endeavors that could somehow be bypassed through investments in smart devices and
big data analytics. This reasoning is misguided because technological solutions cannot
be useful without the right institution and proper skills (the core of statistical capacity
building). World Bank–supported statistical capacity initiatives have had high
transaction costs and have been slow to show results. However, this is characteristic of
this type of intervention, which seeks change at the system level. Shaping institutions
requires building trust, which takes time, perseverance, and soft skills.

The World Bank has learned through the years how to design and implement statistical
capacity initiatives that improve data production, and it should fully apply the lessons
it learned in a larger number of countries. Success factors include gaining government’s
trust and using its leverage through formal mechanisms such as the systematic country
diagnostic (SCD) and country partnership framework (CPF) and the NSDS. Other
factors include continuous policy dialogue and technical assistance at multiple levels,
engaging for the long term (eight to 10 years according to the case studies), and using
the right instrument mix.

FOSTERING TRUST AND OWNERSHIP
The World Bank’s effectiveness in statistical capacity building depends on staff’s ability
to combine technical expertise and soft skills and to stay informed of political
developments. Many World Bank staff, especially those based in country offices,
provide valuable day-to-day support and dialogue. The in-country statisticians funded
through Statistics for Results or some STATCAP projects helped ensure that countries
sustain the gains made in statistical capacity–building projects. Building relationships is
far more difficult when task team leader or in-country statistician turnover is high, or
when project supervision is entirely from headquarters.

The IEG’s evaluation of World Bank Group country engagement (World Bank 2017)
found uneven attention to data issues in SCDs and CPFs: “Many SCDs identified
knowledge gaps to improve the evidence base for future policy making; this was a
useful input for the analytical agendas in the CPFs. Data gaps also inevitably meant that
some SCDs suffered from weaknesses in their analysis of current circumstances and
future needs for achieving the twin goals. It is therefore important that SCDs identify
knowledge gaps and data limitations, and that CPFs aim to close gaps and improve
data quality.” From the perspective of this evaluation, one may add the need to ensure
links to the NSDS and policy dialogue.

CHAPTER 3
BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES
CONTINUITY OF ENGAGEMENT AND THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT MIX
Statistical capacity building takes time. The average length of larger statistical capacity
initiatives (more than $2 million) is 5.5 years and can range from three to 11 years. The
World Bank lacks a readily available instrument that allows long-term engagement of
the kind needed for statistical capacity building. Realizing that it takes more time to
achieve the intended transformation, the World Bank often resorted to various options
for prolonging engagement, including additional financing or a second intervention.
The World Bank supported three or more data-related interventions in 34 of 97
countries during the 10 years covered by the portfolio review. Considering the
numerous analytical and knowledge services not captured in the portfolio, the number
and diversity of data-related activities in any given country is even wider. Therefore,
the question of the sequencing of operations becomes important.

The World Bank wisely used smaller grants to prepare for larger and more long-term
lending, and to ensure continuity of engagement. Statistical capacity building is an area
in which trust funds have aligned remarkably well with other core World Bank
activities. In Indonesia, for example, the World Bank supported many data-related
activities financed with trust funds or nonlending technical assistance ranging from
informal advice to conducting special surveys, developing and maintaining useful
databases, sharing tools (for example, ADePT, Survey Solutions, computer-assisted
personal interviewing, and microdata library support), convening knowledge networks,
and releasing publications that help socialize Indonesian data. An evaluation of these
grants noted that they had a considerably larger effect than might be expected from
their modest amount. The grant-funded activities also created trust and paved the way
for a large lending operation to modernize the NSO.

The selected financing modality determines the length and nature of engagement. By
commitment volume, investment lending projects accounted for 82 percent of the data
for development portfolio, followed by policy lending (17 percent) and Program for
Results financing (1 percent). Modalities that allow for long-term and hands-on
engagement, by combining investment lending and technical assistance, were
preferable. The World Bank chose a stand-alone development policy financing (DPF) in
India for $107 million (the only such example in the portfolio) based on the realization
that supervising a lending operation in multiple states would have been impractical.
However, the DPF instrument did not provide the means for maintaining necessary
World Bank engagement and technical assistance with the states.

                                                       BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES

Mobilizing Domestic Resources and Strengthening Administrative Data
It is essential for countries to mobilize domestic resources for their statistical systems.
Using donor funding for a core government function such as statistics may provide the
resources needed for collecting a survey or build capacity in the short-to-medium term,
but is not sustainable in the long term. The literature and interviews with staff and
partners make it clear that many governments are not necessarily inclined to dedicate
enough domestic budget for national statistical systems. A related issue is that
governments rarely raise the status of statisticians by establishing a separate profession
in the civil service with salaries and career paths to attract and retain the right
candidates. Consequently, NSOs face difficulties in managing their own human
resources and lose qualified staff to the private sector, civil society, and international
organizations, or rely on project per diem allowances to maintain staffs.

The World Bank should use its leverage and lending instruments more effectively to
ensure that data-related activities are adequately funded, including through domestic
resources. The World Bank’s approach should demonstrate the value of using different
forms of data, promote evidence-informed decision making, and raise data issues in
country policy dialogue more systematically. Survey respondents believe that
mobilizing funding for development data should be among the World Bank’s top
priorities (51 percent of staff and 64 percent of stakeholders indicated so). The support
to the World Bank Group Strategic Actions Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps
by the IDA18 Replenishment participants also opens the door to leveraging IDA as a
funding source to supplement domestic resources and trust funds.

The World Bank has concentrated its support to NSOs so far, with 71 percent of type 1
projects (entirely dedicated to supporting data) targeting the NSO primarily or solely.6
However, an undue focus on NSOs to the neglect of the national statistical system would
be a missed opportunity; the capacity of other parts of the national statistical system
must also be improved. Government counterparts interviewed in all case studies
consistently emphasized that data used to inform policy making, service delivery, and
monitoring and evaluation, needs to be disaggregated enough to meaningfully
represent the local level, and it must be available regularly. Surveys can rarely meet
these needs. National statistical systems have struggled to keep up with the growing
demand for data from the global community, and there is concern that the numerous
Sustainable Development Goal indicators will stay unmeasured. Administrative data,
which are typically collected by line ministries and subnational governments, can
potentially bridge this gap. One of the priorities in the World Bank Group Strategic
Actions Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps is for Civil Registration and Vital
Statistics, which is based on administrative records.


                                                                                           29
CHAPTER 3
BUILDING THE DATA CAPACITY OF COUNTRIES
In many sectors, however, data quality in administrative data systems is weak and data
are little used. Service providers often collect administrative data, frequently without
any independent monitoring, which raises questions of data integrity. While NSOs are
technical organizations staffed by professional statisticians and governed by
international statistical principles and standards, there is much greater variance in
processes and systems for data collection and production across line ministries, and
capacities are often weaker at lower levels of government. Efforts to build
administrative systems should take stock of the landscape and factor in the cost and
time that will be needed. More than half of the respondents of IEG’s three surveys
indicated that they use household surveys as one of the primary data sources, yet less
than one-third of respondents in each survey indicated similar use of administrative
data (figure 3.3).

A recent report by Development Gateway provides detailed insights on constraints and
progress underpinning Tanzania’s health administrative data systems (Bhatia and
others 2016). Although a new web-based health information management system has
led to better coordination of data collection in the health sector since its rollout in 2013,
many rural clinics still cannot access the system. Facility staffs continue to collect and
manage data on paper and could spend as much as 25–30 percent of their time filling
out reporting forms, typically near reporting deadlines. Furthermore, remote facilities
often struggle with getting data to district offices. Administrative data completeness,
quality, and timeliness suffer as a result.

Development partners aligned well in building NSO capacity to produce data, but
efforts to build administrative data systems are dispersed and donor-centric. Officials
described donors’ tendency to build sector management information systems to fit their
own monitoring and evaluation needs instead of the countries’ systemic data needs,
causing a proliferation of fragmented databases across various parts of governments.
One person interviewed called this trend “the monitoring and evaluation curse.” While
World Bank support to strengthen administrative data systems takes place across global
practices, primarily as components of other sectoral interventions, this support should
be better tracked and coordinated both in the World Bank and within the Government
(across the NSO, line ministries, and sub-national levels.) Any support to administrative
data systems provided through cross-sectoral engagements should also be tracked. This
would be critical to achieving a shared digital infrastructure for data which avoids
duplication and maximizes synergies.

An exception seems to be the coordinated efforts to build management information
systems in social protection, an area in which the World Bank provides leadership. In
Rwanda, for example, DFID, the United Nations Children’s Fund, and the World Bank
(through its DPF series) have supported the ministry of local governments in its

ambitious attempt to create an integrated management and evaluation information
system linking more than eight social protection programs. This endeavor requires
hands-on support, and DFID is funding three in-country advisers embedded fully
within the government. This example illustrates the need to explore different capacity
development approaches to cost-effectively support data producers in line ministries
and local governments where capacity is often weaker and more heterogeneous.

Similarly, in Peru, the World Bank effectively supported major reforms in the social
sectors and in the country’s data systems by combining a five-year programmatic
advisory service with a subsequent DPF series. The programmatic advisory service
generated useful data and supported dialogue with the incoming authorities, and
extensive dissemination helped create consensus around social sector reforms. It paved
the way for the subsequent DPF series, which supported accountability frameworks in
health, nutrition, and education with several prior actions focused on improving data
production and dissemination. Civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems
urgently need support, as shown by their priority status on several countries’ NSDS.

The World Bank Group Strategic Action Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps
makes CRVS one of its three priorities for the near future. The program recognizes that
“Robust CRVS systems, together with national identity management systems, form the

foundation of all sectors and pillars of the economy and contribute to the World Bank
Group twin goals of poverty eradication and boosting shared prosperity” (World Bank
2015, 16). Improving CRVS also requires addressing systemic undercoverage of groups
that are particularly difficult to reach through household surveys (for example,
refugees, migrants, and people in bonded labor). The commitment to enhance support
to CRVS has been integrated in the IDA 18 replenishment, as one of three data-related
indicators in its results measurement system. In the portfolio reviewed, 18 projects
provided support to population statistics based on census or civil registration, mostly
through sectorwide statistical capacity–building initiatives. IEG identified only a few
targeted efforts, such as a multisector demographic support project in Niger or a TFSCB
grant of $250,000 in Peru, which helped design a new system for improving vital
statistics production and record keeping. The commitment to improve CRVS requires a
dramatic increase in the level of World Bank support.


Conclusion
The World Bank has worked with many country clients to improve their data quantity
and quality, increase technology use, make data and microdata freely available
publicly, and improve data analysis and use. By building on its comparative
advantages—trust of country counterparts, sought-after technical expertise, convening
power, and funding ability—the World Bank can design and deliver ambitious
capacity-building initiatives.

There is still a long way to go to build effective national statistical systems that can track
progress across a broad spectrum of development objectives (PARIS21 2016b;
Serajuddin and others 2015). To ensure that client countries escape a scenario of low
data supply and use, and continue on a trajectory of improved data production,
sharing, and use, the World Bank should consider taking the following steps:

     •   Strengthening domestic and international long-term funding for data and
         statistical capacity building
     •   Making data more central in policy dialogue, promote evidence-based decision
         making, and demonstrate the value of using data
     •   Moving toward a data capacity–building model that reaches beyond the NSO’s
         boundaries to other parts of the national statistical system
     •   Scaling up support for administrative data systems in collaboration across
         global practices and with other development partners, and aligned with country
         priorities.

1 Of 225 projects in the IEG portfolio, 146 are closed projects, and completion documents were
available for 75 of those. IEG validated an Implementation Completion and Results Report
Review (ICRR) in only 39 projects, and only a small portion of those were projects dedicated
entirely to data and statistical capacity building. Furthermore, considering the high number of
trust fund grants in the portfolio and the sparse reporting on their results, the assessment of
results achieved by closed projects was limited.
2Of the 225 data-related projects identified, only 201 projects had enough documentation for
IEG to review.

3The initial five priority areas are: household surveys, population statistics based on census and
civil registration, national accounts, price statistics, and labor and job statistics. It is expected
that more areas will be added.
4IEG reviewed three main types of completion documents: Implementation Completion and
Results Reports prepared by the implementing team at project closure, ICRRs prepared by IEG,
and Implementation Completion Memorandums for trust fund grants. Specific results are
presented in appendix B (Table B.9).
5The Statistical Capacity Indicator (SCI) is based on a diagnostic framework assessing
methodology, data sources, and periodicity and timeliness. The SCI scores countries against 25
criteria in these areas using publicly available information and calculates the overall score as the
simple average of the three area scores. Background work for this evaluation concludes that the
SCI is a recognized, well-accepted tool for assessing statistical capacity, and it has both
strengths and weaknesses. For example, it reflects statistical outputs more than statistical
capacity from an institutional or governance perspective, and it takes no account of data quality.
Because of the binary nature of many of its components, it can display large swings from year to
year for a particular country. Therefore, this evaluation makes only limited use of the SCI.
6Although the evaluation covered the World Bank’s support to national statistical offices
(NSOs) in more depth, case studies also covered data support in line ministries and the issue of
coordination within the national statistical system, though more superficially than support to
NSOs.

4. Toward a User-Centered Data Culture
 Highlights
 ❖ The World Bank has supported open data portals and practices, championed open government
    policies, and influenced several countries to share data and microdata publicly. However, the World
    Bank has not used its leverage fully in client countries that are reluctant to openly share
    development data.
 ❖ The World Bank has far paid far less attention to promoting government and citizen data use so far,
   and therefore success is limited.
 ❖ The World Bank has an opportunity to draw on insights offered by new tools, such as behavioral
   science and big data analytics, to understand the decision makers’ motivations and encourage them
   to use data. The rise in demand for data to monitor the Sustainable Development Goals, increased
   interest in performance-based budgeting among some governments, and the surge of citizen
   surveys of service quality also provide opportunities to promote a more inclusive, user-centered data
   culture.


Support for national statistical systems has enhanced data production more than it
promoted in-country data sharing and use. As recent reports show, this applies to data
development partners in general, not just the World Bank (UN 2014; PARIS21 2015).
Focusing on the World Bank’s contribution specifically, only 68 of the 201 projects
reviewed for this evaluation included support for increasing public access to
development data. IEG’s structured survey of World Bank staff and country
stakeholders and the interviews with development partners found that these groups
perceive that support to in-country data production has been more effective than
support to data sharing and use (figure 4.1).

Three types of data sharing seem to be important. First, there is data financed by the
World Bank which must be shared with the World Bank. Second, there is a set of
essential data financed from domestic or other sources which countries would do well
to share with the World Bank allowing it to report on aggregate statistics. Third, there is
country level data which if more openly shared with the country’s public could
improve transparency, accountability, and evidence-based policy making. The World
Bank made a significant contribution to data sharing in some countries by promoting an
open data agenda using a combination of legal reforms and technical updates to make
official data and microdata more accessible. It provided many countries with technical
assistance to develop access and dissemination policies that are in line with the UN
Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the African Charter on Statistics. The
World Bank also helped upgrade the websites of national statistical offices (NSOs) as

TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
well as open data portals that increase user access to data. However, the World Bank
has not used its leverage fully with governments that have been reluctant to share data.

The World Bank could do much better on data use. Statistical capacity building
objectives often included serving data users’ needs, but IEG’s review found that the
World Bank could do more to promote enhanced data use strategically, for example, by
understanding the different kinds of data users and their needs and motivations, and
including both government and nongovernment data users in the design of its projects.
Only 27 of the 201 projects reviewed for this evaluation supported activities to build
capacity for data use. Weak data literacy, limited internet and smartphone connectivity,
and in some cases resistance by interest groups impeded progress on data use. Staff also
reported in interviews that when data use is an explicit project objective, it is difficult to
prove its achievement. However, data are valuable only if they are used. Finding
evidence of data use requires carefully tracing all its influences on decision making or
resource allocation, and determining the extent to which the particular World Bank
project contributed to them. This is challenging, though not impossible, and it must be
undertaken given that the outcome of interest is data use for sound decision making
and resource allocation.

                                                       TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
The World Bank has a well-established approach to building data producers’ capacity,
but it has not yet formulated a conceptual model to consider ways of assessing user
capacity. Increasing data production, data production capacity, and data quality will
not be sustainable without consistent demand. The Data Council has yet to address the
need to fundamentally rethink how to develop a more inclusive, user-centered data
culture. The Open Data Readiness Assessment methodology, a rapid diagnostic tool to
assess the demand for open data and the capabilities of diverse user groups, should be
explored as a possible starting point. This evaluation looked for a theory of change or
other framework for understanding how data and other support might foster data use,
but it did not find either. The literature review points to a gap in theory and empirical
studies into the causal relationship between data and decisions.1

The World Bank’s approach to fostering data demand and use has, in practice, revolved
around data-driven research and analysis, global data portals, benchmarking exercises,
encouraging data sharing, and open data and government initiatives. However, these
are not sufficient to foster data use, especially beyond academia. To effectively use data,
practitioners emphasize the importance of starting with the question to be answered
instead of the data itself (World Bank and SecondMuse 2014), and of grasping the
political economy of data use and nonuse.

There are several reasons why decision makers may not demand or use data: the
available data may not be relevant to their goals; data relevant to their goals are not
available; they do not know how to analyze and use the data (low data literacy); they do
not trust the data (poor data quality); or they find the available data politically
inconvenient. On the supply side, data visualization and new technological platforms
can help to increase the accessibility and usability of data. On the demand side,
demonstration-by-example, training, and investments by the Bank in improving data
literacy – showing governments the value of specific data types to address specific goals
and building their capacity for data analytics to be able to draw actionable insights from
data – can help increase uptake. However, staff interviews indicated that the World
Bank’s country directors often do not use the World Bank’s fullest leverage to foster
countries’ interest in data, and could do more to promote greater data demand and use
if they were themselves committed.

One factor, rejection of politically inconvenient data, can be widespread and is the
hardest to address. World Bank staff needs to understand the reasons for decision
makers’ lack of interest in data and develop approaches to change their behavior by
changing their incentives. One approach is to motivate action by broader groups of
stakeholders (private sector, other parts of government, legislators, and civil society)
through data and analysis on particular issues. Better data sharing and accessibility can

                                                                                         37
CHAPTER 4
TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
lead to public scrutiny and debate of government policy and stimulate data demand
and use.

Another approach is to publicize data that compare the performance of government
programs and agencies across jurisdictions, which can often gain attention and use.
Comparison with other countries (or subnational units or agencies) seems to produce a
spirit of competition in government leaders or possibly embarrassment or envy.
Authorities in several Latin American countries were startled to see how poorly their
students scored in international comparative tests of educational learning outcomes,
and this spurred them into more vigorous reform efforts. The World Bank could
explore the use of benchmarking exercises or comparative indicators to nudge client
countries toward evidence-based policymaking.

Development data sometimes reveals politically inconvenient truths that decision
makers act upon only after broader political change occurs. Shifts in the distribution of
power could empower new decision makers with new goals or priorities, leading to a
greater appetite for data use. World Development Report 2017: Governance and the Law
stresses that even though history partly determines the distribution of power in society,
it can still change when elites reach agreements to restrict their own power, when
citizens engage (through voting, political organization, and public deliberation), and
when donors support rules that strengthen reform coalitions (World Bank 2017).

Evaluations have noted weaknesses in the promotion of data use for a long time, and
not just in the World Bank’s programs. The Partnership in Statistics for Development in
the 21st Century (PARIS21) was established partly to bring together policy makers, data
users, and statisticians. An inventory of evaluations of different statistical capacity
programs concluded that these programs had little impact on the use of statistics in
countries (Willoughby 2008). An evaluation conducted by the European Commission
(2007) covering 30 projects from 1996 to 2005 concluded that few projects tackled the
contribution of statistics to evidence-based decision making. Another study in 2009
concluded, “While support to the production of statistics has increased, the link
between production and use in-country is still far too weak” (OPM 2009, 5). Part of the
problem is that policy makers, data users, and statistical systems managers each see the
world differently and mechanisms to connect them are lacking.


Open Government Policies Support Data Sharing
The World Bank tended to be effective in promoting data sharing in countries where it
also successfully helped strengthen NSOs. Countries with sound statistical capacity are
more likely to endorse open data policies and the release of microdata and metadata

                                                                                  TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
(figure 4.2). NSOs in a number of countries increasingly provide statistical calendars
with expected release dates, and they strive to respect the deadlines.

The World Bank helped countries build national capacity in microdata preservation,
analysis, and dissemination through its support to PARIS21 and direct technical
assistance to its country clients. This involved establishing national data archives and
implementing the Accelerated Data Program (ADP). The ADP has provided training to
more than 2,000 staff from 150 national organizations in about 70 countries on
microdata anonymization, documentation, archiving, and sharing. ADP increasingly
includes outreach to microdata users and training for them. All case study countries for
this evaluation—except Ukraine—made progress on data sharing, helped by regular
diagnostic reports prepared by ADP.

IEG’s country case studies and interviews found mixed progress on data sharing and
open data policies and that the World Bank has been most effective in countries where
governments were already committed to sharing data. The World Bank has occasionally
raised data issues at high levels of policy dialogue, and has sought to influence
countries to share data and microdata publicly. However, where that did not work,
World Bank management has been unwilling to make open data access a prerequisite
                                                                                                                   39

TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
for financing of statistical capacity building—or anything else. Realistically, it is hard to
hold the World Bank’s program hostage to the performance of this one item on the
broad menu of development interventions, but the World Bank does need to ensure that
it uses its fullest leverage to help foster data sharing. And the World Bank must ensure
that it has access to data produced with its financial support.

 The World Bank engaged closely in Indonesia on opening up government records.
Indonesia is one of the eight founding members of the Open Government Partnership in
2011. The NSO’s publications are freely available online, the office posts its annual
budget online for public view, and each agency that produces statistics gives notice of
future release dates. World Bank teams have used training and technical assistance to
help several ministries use and interpret data. However, open data competes with other
priorities, the country’s Freedom of Information Law is only partially implemented, and
some ministries continue to release data in formats that are not machine-readable.
Jakarta province government leads the way on open data, while the Ministry of Finance
launched a fiscal transparency portal in 2016 to share budget data; the practice of
making data publicly available is uneven across agencies. Many local governments are
unable to produce data on a regular schedule.

After a slow start, Kenya (another case study country) is now one of the more advanced
countries in Africa in open access to official data. Statistical techniques were improved
substantially with support from the World Bank. Improvements included updating the
base years for most data sets, better data validation, and bulletins informing users about
revisions. However, the project monitoring and evaluation neglected data use even
though this was an explicit feature of the project results framework. World Bank
supervision missions emphasized the delivery of outputs more than progress toward
outcomes, data accessibility, and outreach to users. Opportunity still exists for making
data easier to select and download, clarifying the terms of use, and providing more
complete metadata.

Rwanda has made much progress toward improved data access and dissemination with
support from the World Bank and PARIS21 through the ADP. The Statistics for Results
project, launched in 2012, emphasized dissemination and services for users and
supported the NSO to update its website, provide more complete metadata, digitize
statistical information, and develop an electronic national data archive to allow users to
access microdata. The ongoing Public Sector Governance Program for Results is
supporting the government to open some administrative data collected by one of the
main data-producing line ministries. Progress has been slow to date, as this effort
requires implementing quality control protocols and sensitizing various layers of
government to the value of open data.

                                                       TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
The World Bank’s efforts to promote open data in Ukraine through seminars and
outreach events had little government support initially. Online availability, machine
readability, ease of download, ability to filter, clarity of definitions, or quality of
metadata received no priority. IEG’s case study found that an April 2015 law on public
access to information and open data is yet to be widely implemented or even
understood. The government still perceives anonymized data as confidential, does not
conduct user satisfaction surveys, and little discussion takes place on user needs or
obstacles to data access. Those interviewed reported so-called “confidential data” are
only “available on the black market for a fee.” Although the World Bank made a major
contribution to Ukraine’s data production, it has not been effective in addressing key
constraints on data access and use even though it was an explicit part of its objectives.


Websites for Data Sharing and Use
The World Bank has been particularly effective in helping NSOs develop websites and
data portals, as in Ghana and Rwanda. In Tanzania, data users took part in the design
of the website, and demand for statistics is now stronger from ministries and
development partners. However, releasing information still suffers delays, and
traditional publications take priority over digital data.

The World Bank was equally effective in Peru where it worked with the NSO to
develop a website that offers free microdata and metadata downloads from 35 sources,
including censuses and surveys. Under the auspices of the new Ministry of Social
Development and Inclusion, the World Bank established a digital data repository and
supporting web platform to collate administrative data on education, health, finance,
citizen registration, housing, and sanitation. Users can freely download data, cross-
tabulate variables, and generate basic reports. IEG’s country case study found that
uptake has been faster by the private sector than by universities.

The data format is important on official websites. In India, researchers told IEG that
officials publish survey reports in PDF format, which makes data tables inseparable
from lengthy descriptive material. Data cannot be downloaded for analysis and reuse.
Research institutions and government do not discuss improving data exchange and
usability.


Making Data Use Inclusive and Empowering
The World Bank made substantial progress in promoting open data policies and web-
based data access in some countries, and it should now redouble its efforts to increase

                                                                                          41
CHAPTER 4
TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
the number of people using data to help shape the development agenda. Enabling
officials in central government to understand, analyze, and communicate data is part of
the solution—data literacy at this level is indispensable. However, the bigger challenge
lies beyond central government: equipping local administrations, universities, the
media, and civil society to be more discerning data users so they can hold government
accountable and improve service quality. Survey respondents rated the World Bank low
on fostering in-country demand for data. Only 33 percent of World Bank staff and 45
percent of country stakeholders rated the World Bank as highly effective or effective on
this dimension. Despite this low rating of effectiveness, neither of the two groups
surveyed included “generating country-level demand for data” among their top choice
of areas needing strengthening going forward (appendix C). However, many university
teachers and researchers among the survey respondents urged the World Bank to make
outreach more effective.

Citizens are more likely to be empowered when governments establish public forums
for participation. In Peru, World Bank technical assistance to the new Ministry of
Development and Social Inclusion is helping develop channels for user feedback. It will
improve knowledge management, information, and communication through the
implementation of an integrated information platform that includes data from different
programs, thus helping to embed a culture of data use and results orientation.
Elsewhere, the World Bank had setbacks in its efforts to promote public forums to make
data production and use more inclusive. In Ghana, after a brief period of existence
between 2004 and 2006, the National Advisory Committee of Producers and Users of
Statistics was discontinued for lack of funding. Its reinstitution was inserted into a new
Statistics Bill which was supposed to be passed by the end of 2012, but remained
pending after the December 2016 session.

The World Bank encouraged the use of surveys to measure user satisfaction with
statistics. Surveys are another aspect of an inclusive, user-centered data culture and are
now standard part of World Bank technical assistance. User surveys in Rwanda and
Tajikistan, for example, point to increased satisfaction with official statistics.

Improving Subnational Data
Nurturing a data culture at the local level needs more attention. People interviewed in
many countries told IEG that they want to know how their region, city, or community is
doing relative to others in the same country. Decision makers in central and local
governments need this information to set priorities and compel action. In Rwanda, for
example, growing demand for district-level data means that samples need to be
representative below the national level, and regular surveys are essential to inform local
planning and service delivery. Surveys that are representative at the district level are

                                                       TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
valuable, but only routine administrative systems can provide the type and frequency
of data needed to meet most local needs. This data collection is done by teachers and
nurses, but they have little incentive to do so because the data are channeled to central
authorities without any attempt to use them to inform local decisions and without
providing access for local administrative staff.

Indonesia’s NSO cannot keep up with local governments’ growing demand for
technical assistance. In Tanzania, poorly trained local government staffs give low
priority to data production. The poor quality of the data produced by provincial
administrations is a source of frustration and an impediment to their use. Local
municipalities in Peru do little to track service delivery, making monitoring and
evaluation difficult. The lack of coordination between the different levels of government
means that textbooks and vaccines do not always reach the children who need them.
Interviewees in India told IEG that state and district officials need training in data
analysis and presentation. Preparation of the 2010 Statistical Strengthening Project
involved close engagement with state authorities in 16 of India’s states and included
discussion of data accessibility. Increasing user awareness at the state level is a project
objective, but there is no corresponding indicator in the results framework, and IEG
found no evidence of user-producer dialogue at the state level.


Performance Management Frameworks
The more citizens hold their governments accountable, the greater the demand and use
for data will be for measuring government performance against indicators and targets.
One way to make government agencies more accountable and more efficient is to
widely publicize data about their achievements and shortfalls, and then adjust funds
delivered in the next budget cycle to reward strong performers. Peru adopted
performance-based budgeting in 2006 with World Bank support. The number of
programs covered has steadily increased since then, and much of the budget now ties to
performance indicators. Several line ministries worked with the World Bank to develop
indicators. So far, the World Bank has been more effective at proposing metrics than
suggesting ways to integrate the various ministries’ rapidly growing data sets properly.

Since 2006, all public institutions in Rwanda have been required to sign performance
management contracts with the president of the republic. Independent evaluators
annually assess progress toward agreed targets. This is a data-intensive exercise that
collects information from the localities and the lowest levels of government. As one IEG
interviewee noted, hard evidence of results is required at annual meetings, and
anecdotal reports are no longer enough. Each district has its own scorecard and is
expected to review the targets’ relevance, the effort needed to reach them, and the
                                                                                       43
CHAPTER 4
TOWARD A USER-CENTERED DATA CULTURE
quality of information needed to report on achievements. This system of cascading
performance contracts (called Imihigo) has increased the demand for data. A high-level
statistician observed, “When they start using data, people become addicted, they want
more and more” (IPAR 2015). Going a step further, the World Bank and DFID have
recently adopted performance-based financing instruments that trigger disbursements
with evidence of data use.

Overambitious performance targets can encourage data falsification. Kenya abolished
school fees and gave local authorities resources that put more children through primary
school. The administrative data promptly showed a rapid increase in enrollment that
data from the Demographic and Health Survey did not support (Sandefur and
Glassman 2015). Performance contracts must be validated independently, and they
need to be embedded in a results-based culture that has data users who are sufficiently
literate and committed to holding government accountable.


Nurturing a User-Centered Data Culture
The World Bank has often been effective at supporting data sharing in the countries in
which it engaged NSOs. Much depends on countries’ willingness to share data, and
several countries still refuse to share data, for political reasons or because of quality
concerns or from a reluctance to lose a revenue source. The World Bank has not used its
leverage fully to influence additional countries to share data.

The next step is to foster reciprocity between the multiple agencies that produce and
share data and the equally diverse data users, creating a user-centered data culture.
This goal is broad and diffuse. Creating a user-centered data culture in the poorest
countries faces several obstacles. Internet use is limited, universities are weak, and such
countries lack a vibrant research community that demands data for its studies.
Fostering a user-centered data culture would require the World Bank to locate and
recognize the receptiveness among different groups and institutions within individual
countries (media, universities, and subnational governments). The World Bank can help
nurture an ecosystem of data use by working with local governments, civil society
institutions, the media, and academia, using approaches tailored to the needs of
different users.

5. Implications of Big Data for the World Bank
 Highlights
 ❖ A lack of an understanding of when and how big data can complement traditional data in answering
    key development questions and a lack of corporate agreements to ensure World Bank access to
    such data have hindered efforts to use big data.
 ❖ The World Bank has not systematically analyzed big data’s potential contributions and pitfalls for
   addressing its mission.
 ❖ The World Bank’s ad hoc approach to big data is unlikely to work well for scaling-up and
   institutionalizing big data, though initially it helped in facilitating small-scale exploration and
   experimentation.


Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, said in 2010, “There was five exabytes of
information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much
information is now created every two days, and the pace is increasing” (Einav and
Levin 2013, 1). Much of this information growth stems from the rise of big data
(sometimes called new data or non-traditional data). Big data refers typically to
extremely large data sets created through satellite or geospatial imagery, remote
sensing, Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking, computer search engines, social
media, crowdsourcing, online payments, call detail records, smartphones, and the
Internet of Things. Volume, velocity, and variety characterize such data (Hilbert 2013).
Extracting patterns, trends, and associations from these data sets through
computational analytics can provide a wide range of real-time information about
people, often much faster and at lower cost than was previously possible (Oroz 2016).


World Bank Support for Geospatial and Other Forms of Big Data
In the mid-1990s, the World Bank realized the potential of geospatial data and tried to
build its own capacity to analyze such data. However, these initiatives did not flourish
because staff was skeptical and the potential of such data was unproven. A 2014
campaign to champion big data innovations at the World Bank uncovered several
issues regarding lack of access to certain types of big data, data science expertise,
storage and computational capacity, guidance on handling privacy, opportunities for
peer-to-peer learning, and platforms and norms for sharing data and software (World
Bank 2016). These gaps have prevented the World Bank from combining big data with
traditional data and could represent a missed opportunity.

                                                 IMPLICATIONS OF BIG DATA FOR THE WORLD BANK
As of November 2016, the World Bank estimates the number of World Bank–supported
projects involving big data at more than 60. Of these, 14 projects had won an innovation
challenge in 2014 that had attracted 131 entries. The ongoing big data projects are in
sectors as diverse as agriculture, transport, urban development, energy, environment,
employment, economic productivity, financial inclusion, governance, property rights,
and natural disasters. Only two of these projects are lending operations; the rest are
advisory and analytic services. Most are mapped to the Development Economics Vice
Presidency and the Office of the Sustainable Development Chief Economist, followed
by the Energy and Extractives Global Practice; the Social, Urban, Rural, and Resilience
Global Practice; and the Transport and Information and Communications Technology
Global Practice. Most projects are cross-regional.

Specific innovations using big data in the World Bank include the following:

    •   Cities in the Philippines are minimizing traffic congestion by observing the
        flows of vehicles with cellphone GPS data
    •   Drones are being used in Albania and Kosovo to help map land boundaries and
        secure property rights
    •   Satellite imagery is being used to determine the maize yield in Ugandan farms.
    •   Rural poverty in Sri Lanka is being estimated using satellite imagery of building
        density and roof material
    •   Cities in Latin America are using satellite images to identify slums, roads, and
        commercial areas
    •   Citizens in the Philippines are using crowd-sourced photos, maps, and satellite
        imagery to monitor road infrastructure projects.

Several of the ongoing operations are in the piloting or incubation phase, and it is too
early to assess their effectiveness. However, the sheer numbers now of big data projects
(more than 60) show greater World Bank willingness to explore big data’s potential in
helping to solve development problems. Big data is not a complete substitute for
traditional data. Because the World Bank’s big data projects are getting started and the
new data sources are still unproven, it is essential that big data be complemented by or
validated with traditional data. For example, satellite images of building density and
roof material—proxies for poverty—need to be validated with household surveys and
census data on poverty. Furthermore, turning satellite images into accurate crop yield
estimates requires training the computer model with actual crop-cutting data from farm
visits. Box 5.1 describes ways of combining big data and traditional data to answer
development questions.

CHAPTER 5
IMPLICATIONS OF BIG DATA FOR THE WORLD BANK


     Box 5.1. Combining Big Data and Traditional Data: Two Examples
     Easing Urban Congestion with Smartphones in the Philippines. The traditional method of
     collecting traffic congestion data in the Philippines uses travel time surveys. Two local
     contractors with a clipboard and stopwatch drive in a car and manually measure the time it
     takes to drive between intersections, repeating these measurements for a month. The average of
     the results determines typical traffic speeds. This is a slow and costly process.
     The World Bank developed Open Traffic, a platform that provides an alternative to this process.
     A partnership with the taxi-hailing app Grab gives Open Traffic access to real-time, anonymized
     GPS data from hundreds of thousands of taxis. These big data have the same use as the travel
     time surveys, but there is much more data gathered in real-time at almost no cost. Open Traffic
     does not completely replace travel time surveys, however. The World Bank has been using the
     travel time surveys to validate the new approach. Furthermore, transport planning still requires
     traditional surveys to obtain data for more granular analyses of different vehicle types, such as
     studying the flows of motorcycles.
     Securing Property Rights with Drones in the Balkans. Cadastral maps in the Balkans are
     usually produced at the national level through a costly and time-consuming process. An
     orthophoto (aerial photo corrected for distortion in the same way as a map) is a key part of a
     cadastral map traditionally produced for the whole country from satellite imagery or from
     manned airplanes. The World Bank has been using drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles, since
     2013 in Albania and Kosovo to produce high-resolution orthophotos of specific towns and
     villages. Instead of waiting years for a new national orthophoto to update a particular town’s
     cadastre, drones can produce a new orthophoto in just days. Drone imagery combined with
     other new technology, such as open source software to record property rights and platforms to
     manage cadastral data, offers a cost-effective methodology to secure property rights. National
     orthophotos are still the best way to achieve large-scale cadastral mapping, but drones provide
     a fit-for-purpose mapping approach when a specific town needs updated aerial imagery and
     cadastral maps.


In IEG’s structured survey, about 50 percent of country stakeholders and World Bank
staff agreed that the World Bank has been highly effective or effective regarding global
data innovations, including big data (appendix C). Asked to choose among areas of
strategic thrust for the World Bank going forward, respondents gave a relatively low
priority to global data innovation. Only 32 percent of World Bank staff and 37 percent
of country stakeholders included this among their five preferred areas for the World
Bank’s strategic thrust, in contrast to the world’s successful global companies such as
Amazon, Google, Netflix, and LinkedIn that are using big data to deliver extraordinary
results, for example, by using such data to understand client preferences and to find the
best way to respond to those preferences (Marr 2016).

Big data initiatives at the World Bank so far have been ad hoc, driven by individual
initiative instead of a coordinated institutional approach. According to World Bank staff

interviewed by IEG, this has resulted in inadequate quality control and lack of
knowledge of who to approach for advice on using big data.

The World Bank currently spreads responsibility for geospatial and big data work
across three separate units, and the division of labor is unclear. The three units are the
front office of the Senior Vice President of Operations, the Sustainable Development
Practice Group Vice Presidency (which also houses the Geospatial Operations Support
Team), and the Analytics and Geospatial Working Group under the Data Council. And
there are two communities of practice and two working groups related to big data (for a
total of four). The rationale for this arrangement needs more thought. Overlapping
responsibilities and a lack of strong coordination can result in inefficiencies.

The World Bank’s data science staff is spread across the organization, and in units
dealing with disaster management, information technology, environment, and other
issues, and it can be hard for others to find them or know what they are doing. The
World Bank’s human resources data show that as of November 2016, 18 staff members
have the title of data scientist in various grades, half of those were direct hires into the
data scientist title, and the other half had their titles converted to data scientist. IEG
interviewed World Bank staff working on geospatial data who pointed out that along
with training staff in big data and ensuring that geographers, statisticians, economists,
and World Bank staff from other disciplines work together, the World Bank also needs
to undertake strategic hiring of data scientists, GIS experts, modeling professionals, and
other experts in big data analytics. Such experts should also help other staff grasp the
intricacies of big data.

Furthermore, the World Bank has sent mixed signals about big data’s priority. The
Strategic Actions Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps (World Bank 2015) does
not contain any proposals or actions specifically on big data (World Bank 2015).
However, a recent reform of geospatial information at the World Bank aims to make it a
sophisticated consumer of geospatial and big data analytics. The note outlines the
Geospatial Operational Support Team’s mandate as “The creation, brokering, or scaling
of institutional public goods with significant utility in development lending, specifically
around three core areas: (i) efficient spatial data management; (ii) knowledge capture
and dissemination; and (iii) procurement support.” The agenda this mandate implies
deserves wide circulation and discussion within the World Bank to ensure buy-in.

Interviews and case studies for this evaluation suggest that the World Bank’s ad hoc
approach to big data might have helped initially by facilitating small-scale exploration
and experimentation. However, it is unlikely to work well for scaling-up and
institutionalizing the World Bank’s big data work if a decision is taken to do so. Scaling-

IMPLICATIONS OF BIG DATA FOR THE WORLD BANK
up big data use at the World Bank will require clearly defining responsibility among
units, avoiding overlapping mandates, and ensuring the necessary data science
expertise on relevant forms of big data (from geospatial to social media) in answering
key development questions. The World Bank recognizes the importance of satellite
imagery and other forms of big data in situations of fragility, conflict, and violence,
especially given the lack of security in the field and low government capacity or interest
in conducting household or other surveys in remote and marginalized areas, but the use
of big data has not yet been institutionalized in those situations.


Future Big Data Use by the World Bank
A major challenge so far has been the lack of a widely-shared understanding and
appreciation among World Bank staff of when and how big data can complement
traditional data in answering key development questions. Staff interviewed for the
Strategic Needs Assessment for the World Bank Big Data Analytics Program saw an
important role for the World Bank in this area and said that the World Bank should be
“An innovative leader in the use of big data to improve the well-being of the poor”
(Vital Wave 2015).

Although big data analytics can be outsourced to specialized firms, the World Bank still
needs in-house data science expertise to examine proposals and quality control
deliverables. Many staff interviewed by IEG were opposed to wholesale outsourcing to
external firms (or even to data scientists in other parts of the World Bank) because data
science expertise needs to be complemented by subject matter and country expertise,
and the latter resides in specific World Bank operational units. A review undertaken by
the World Bank found that the majority of geospatial analytics tasks have been
outsourced on an ad hoc basis, with little to no coordination between project
expenditures, creating significant leakages of data, loss of expertise, higher average
costs, and little institutional memory.

The World Bank does not have a central repository or systematic cataloging for big data
sets obtained by different parts of the organization. Consequently, staff in different
areas can both put effort into obtaining the same data, which is inefficient.

Other organizations have recently built up their big data analytics capacity. For
example, the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy has a chief data scientist, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a Futures Unit,
and the United Kingdom has the Foresight initiative. Policy Horizons Canada is a
foresight and knowledge organization in the Canadian government, and the UN’s

Global Pulse Labs work on new approaches to using big data for development (box 5.2).
These organizations’ experiences might hold lessons for the World Bank.


 Box 5.2. The UN Global Pulse Labs
 UN Global Pulse Labs are pioneering new ways to use big data to pursue development goals,
 aiming to show how new sources of digital data and emerging technologies can help
 understand what is happening to vulnerable populations. The headquarters lab is in New
 York, and other labs are in Jakarta and Kampala. Pulse Labs design projects with UN
 agencies and public sector institutions that provide sectoral expertise, and with private sector
 or academic partners that often provide access to data or analytical and engineering tools.
 Research projects include food security, humanitarian logistics, economic well-being, gender
 discrimination, and health. Host countries must be willing to share lessons, experiences, and
 findings with labs in other countries.

Big data can be extremely beneficial in approaching problems from new angles, but
without proper management and analysis, it can also cause big errors. In developing its
capacity for big data analytics, the World Bank will need to ensure that it prepares
adequately for big data’s analytical, ethical, governance, privacy, and exclusion
challenges and pitfalls (box 5.3).

Important unresolved questions surround access to big data. The World Bank tried
unsuccessfully to acquire call data records during the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak in West
Africa. What kinds of corporate agreements or data-sharing partnerships should the
World Bank establish with big data producers (such as the U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
Uber, Verizon Communications, Facebook, and Twitter)? How will the World Bank
safeguard privacy concerns, and what protocols will it follow when sharing big data
with governments? How will the World Bank ensure the ethical use of big data by itself
and country clients?


 Box 5.3. Big Data Key Challenges and Pitfalls
 Analytical Challenges. Big data can be biased. For example, social media users are a subset
 of the population (generally young people living in cities), and information drawn from them
 is not representative of the population at large. Big data is often incomplete. A researcher
 might analyze how often topics appear in tweets, but if Twitter uses its editorial rights and
 removes all tweets that contain content it deems inappropriate, the analysis will be skewed.
 Big data is often not available in a standardized format, which makes it more difficult to
 process than traditional data. Big data can be misinterpreted. Mobile phone data might

                                                                                                51

IMPLICATIONS OF BIG DATA FOR THE WORLD BANK
 suggest that workers spend more time with their colleagues than their spouses, but this does
 not necessarily mean that colleagues are more important than spouses. O’Neil (2016) showed
 how algorithms can produce disastrously wrong results if they use imperfect proxies for
 what cannot be directly measured, and become what she calls “weapons of math
 destruction.”
 Ethical Challenges. Combining big data sets might offer new insights, but it can also violate
 privacy because some of the information is tagged with the user’s identity. It is not easy to
 ensure that users give informed consent. Private companies may thwart government efforts
 to serve the public good in this regard, and governments could use big data to suppress
 opponents or discriminate against some groups.
 Inclusiveness Challenges. Access to big data is often only available for a fee, and this might
 be beyond many organizations’ financial capacity. Big data also requires technical and
 analytical processing capacity that poorer countries lack, and their access and technical
 support is likely to be limited. This opens a new digital divide.

The World Bank needs to decide on the extent and nature of its support to country
clients in building their capacity for big data. Typical statistical capacity–building
projects have focused on building clients’ capacity to produce traditional forms of data.
Although these initiatives are still highly relevant, the World Bank should consider
when, where, and how it should also support the development of clients’ big data
capacity. Big data are often faster, less costly, more reliable, more frequent, and more
disaggregated than traditional data, and could represent the future for many types of
use, such as geographic targeting.

The World Bank now needs to examine its own experience and that of other relevant
organizations with the usefulness of big data in complementing traditional data. Based
on what it learns, the World Bank should implement coordinated actions to ensure that
sufficient, advanced big data analytics underpin its own decisions, and that it provides
effective support to country clients for big data use.

Those actions are likely to include the following:

     •    Ensuring outreach to World Bank staff and country clients to support their
          understanding and use of big data
     •    Ensuring that geographers, statisticians, economists, and World Bank staff from
          other disciplines work together, and recruiting adequate data science experts to
          strengthen both the World Bank’s own work and to improve its support to
          countries to raise their awareness of and appetite for big data use
     •    Considering when and where it makes sense to grow NSOs’ big data capacity

6. Conclusions and Recommendations
The World Bank has a strong reputation on development data. It effectively supported
many individual countries’ data needs and supported data as a global public good.
Major gaps in data quantity, quality, and availability remain, and no country is
anywhere close to collecting all 230 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) monitoring
indicators. Although the World Bank was effective in supporting data production in
many countries and encouraging some countries to share data, support for data use by
governments and citizens lagged. The World Bank has been a leader on development
data for global audiences, and it now needs to assess and adjust its approach where
needed and meet recent commitments for a stronger effort on data. The Forward Look
(World Bank 2016) expresses these commitments, and envisions an expanded role for
the World Bank in addressing global public goods as part of IDA18 and in the corporate
goal that commits the World Bank Group to ensuring a household survey in IDA and
blend countries at least every three years.1

Management of the World Bank Group’s institutions has recently signaled its intent to
step up support for data production and clarified what types of data will be given
priority. The creation of the World Bank Group Data Council and Development Data
Council (until recently Development Data Directors group) and its associated working
groups established an internal framework for governance and coordination. The Data
Council formulated goals and priorities for the World Bank’s work in data and put
forward specific, ambitious costed proposals for expansions in CRVS, price, survey, and
geospatial data collection. The World Bank also created a theme code for data that will
help track and manage the World Bank’s portfolio on data going forward. Although
these plans appear to align broadly with country needs and World Bank technical
strengths, they should not displace an emphasis on strengthening long-term statistical
capacity.

Producing data is a core government function, and governments cannot achieve good
governance with bad data. However, countries do not always understand data’s value
well, domestic funding for statistics is still low in many places, and several
governments are reluctant to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD) or International Development Association (IDA) for data.
Countries’ ownership and financing of data, while not necessarily within the World
Bank’s control, are crucial for measuring progress on the twin goals. The World Bank’s
current approach to advocating for data (often by demonstrating how specific pieces of
data analysis can generate solutions to policy problems) has merit, but is insufficient.
The Data Council has proposed principles for funding data production and vital

                                                                                  CHAPTER 6
                                                           CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
registration systems in IDA-eligible countries based on blending donor funding with an
increasing share of domestic funding over time. However, the suggested funding
principles (gradually increasing domestic financing) are not binding or enforceable. The
World Bank’s systematic country diagnostics (SCDs) identify data gaps unevenly, and
its Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs) and country policy dialogue do not
consistently include data issues.

No mechanism exists today for medium- to long-term financing of data, even though
funding needs for data are significant.2 Trust funds for statistical capacity building were
central to past successes, positioning the World Bank as a premier global funder and
coordinator of data and allowing it to engage also in countries that were reluctant to
borrow for data. However, relying on trust funds creates uncertainty and dependency
on a small number of donors, and it hinders long-term planning, which affects even
some of the most high-profile initiatives, such as the Living Standards Measurement
Study and PovCalNet. Furthermore, the Statistical Capacity Building Program
(STATCAP) is now completed. The envisioned expansion in data production, the ability
to track the twin goals and key SDGs, and the sustainability of past gains in statistical
capacity in some (mostly lower-income) countries are at stake.

The World Bank, its global partners, and client governments should join forces in
setting up and implementing a multipronged mechanism to ensure adequate long-term
funding for development data. Blending of domestic and international support could be
a guiding principle. This mechanism should result in greater funding predictability, less
ad hoc donor support tied to collection of specific surveys, and a gradual increase in
shares of domestic financing for data aligned with countries’ fiscal strength. The World
Bank should also consider doing more to incorporate development data support and
issues of data funding consistently into its engagement and dialogue in client countries.
SCDs should more consistently pinpoint data gaps.

Some countries produce data that they have little capacity to analyze and use; some
even receive World Bank support for collecting data that they do not share with the
public or even occasionally with the World Bank. This is unreasonable. For reasons that
are not entirely clear, the World Bank has not used its leverage fully to gain access to
essential data or to promote open data sharing. Support from the international
community to data production, as a rule, should be conditional on countries agreeing to
share data (suitably anonymized) openly and promptly.

The World Bank should do more to influence countries toward greater data use. IEG
identified several good practices in the World Bank, but no framework or approach for
ensuring that interventions in different sectors align to fostering a user-centered data

                                                                                         55

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
culture. The Strategic Actions Program for Addressing Development Data Gaps (World Bank
2015) has limited discussion of data sharing, and almost no discussion of data use. Staff
has mixed views on the merit of pursuing a data use objective and, in practice, often
pays limited attention to it. The World Bank and other global actors should develop a
framework for marshaling the disparate interventions to encourage developing
countries toward greater data demand and evidence-driven policy making.

Some of the factors underlying data use or non-use by government decision makers,
especially those related to government ability, can be addressed through
communication, policy dialogue, and training. The World Bank can invest in showing
governments the value of specific data types to address specific goals and build their
data analytics capacity so they can better draw actionable insights from data. Open data
initiatives can also generate pressure on government to act. The World Bank could also
use comparative data on the performance of government programs and agencies across
jurisdictions to change incentives and spur action.

The World Bank has no clear goals for its contributions to the global statistical system
and data partnerships. An overarching vision should articulate goals for engagements
in global data partnerships and how the World Bank can help maintain coherent global
data efforts with clear roles for the numerous agencies and partnerships active in data.
This coherence existed with a well-defined partnership architecture in the past, but the
present reality is a more fragmented landscape with unclear funding.

 The World Bank could do more to pursue long-term data goals and foster connections
across different data-related activities in country programs. Except for the relatively
small number of core projects dedicated to statistical capacity, much of the World
Bank’s support for data production, sharing, and use occurs as a by-product of other
work. Data efforts are often task-focused and rarely work toward a common purpose
related to data. As stated by the external panel review of the Development Economics
Vice Presidency (DEC), “Data are seen as a by-product of other activities rather than a
resource in their own right, with a lack of a coherent data infrastructure, and data that
cannot be integrated and reused” (Besley and others 2015). Country dialogue gives
uneven priority to development data, and interviews show a shared sense that the
World Bank could and should do even better in its client-facing data work.3

Could the World Bank organize its data work better? Data resides in all global practices
and is concentrated in the Poverty Global Practice (which handles most statistical
capacity–building projects) and DEC (which handles many global and corporate
responsibilities). Because of its decentralized structure and entrepreneurial staff, it is
hard to manage a cross-cutting topic like data in the World Bank. At the corporate level,
it is unknown whether the Data Council can emerge as an effective governing body or

                                                                                CHAPTER 6
                                                          CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
its different working groups can coordinate on technical issues. The Data Council has
not resolved internal budget issues. Some observers have informally suggested an
advisory data committee (a body or council) with external representation, broader
responsibility, and stronger powers. It would involve an eminent group of data users
and producers in governance and budgeting for the World Bank’s own data work. The
World Bank sometimes uses such advisory bodies with external representation, but
they rarely have real decision-making power or budgetary authority. Given that staff is
already well-connected to global data actors, the value added of a new body is
questionable.

Regarding big data, the World Bank currently spreads responsibilities across three
World Bank units, which can result in inefficiencies from overlapping responsibilities
and a lack of strong coordination. Despite many pilot initiatives, a common
understanding is lacking of big data’s potential and pitfalls in answering development
questions, and internal capacity is weak. The World Bank often pursues innovation
through bottom-up initiatives. The challenge is how to scale big data and other data
innovations and how to ensure sustainability. After establishing big data’s potential and
pitfalls for development, the World Bank will need to decide how to strengthen and
consolidate its skills and efforts in this area. Other needs include a framework for
managing privacy, ethical, and other risks.

Based on the evidence, the evaluation offers five recommendations.

Recommendation 1: Implement goals and priorities reflecting the findings of this
evaluation with regard to the World Bank’s support to global data and global
partnerships, country data capacity, and a user-centered data culture.

Steps to be considered by World Bank Management could include:

    •   articulating goals and priorities;
    •   specifying accountabilities for the implementation of new and existing goals and
        priorities; and
    •   ensuring sufficient management oversight so that the new and existing goals
        and priorities are implemented.

Recommendation 2: Mobilize and deliver additional support to countries’ statistical
systems, using a more comprehensive model of statistical capacity building that also
factors in needs and opportunities to strengthen administrative data systems.

Recommendation 3: Step up engagements with global partners and client
governments on long-term funding for development data.

                                                                                      57
CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Steps to be considered by World Bank Management could include:

     •   requiring CPFs to explicitly indicate how the SCD-identified knowledge and
         data gaps, which are most relevant to CPF objectives, will be addressed;4
     •   elevating attention to funding for data in the policy dialogue with client
         governments; and
     •   initiating high-level discussions on establishing a global umbrella mechanism
         for long-term financing of data.

Recommendation 4: Scale up promotion of data sharing and data use.

Steps to be considered by Bank Management could include:

     •   ensuring that all data financed by the World Bank are shared with the World
         Bank;
     •   developing and using a list of essential data items that countries are expected to
         share with the World Bank;
     •   incentivizing governments to more openly share data with the public, for
         example, by more prominently using a ranking of countries on open data
         performance; and
     •   scaling-up promotion of government and citizen demand for data and the voice
         of data users in the kinds of data that are produced.

Recommendation 5: Implement coordinated actions so that World Bank operations
benefit from big data’s insights and clients receive appropriate support for big data
use.

Steps to be considered by World Bank Management could include:

     •   reviewing opportunities to scale up the use of big data for development;
     •   specifying accountabilities for implementation of the coordinated actions; and
     •   ensuring sufficient management oversight so that the coordinated actions are
         implemented.

1   The commitment requires funding estimated at $148 million every three years.
2According to one estimate, for example, “The estimated cost of an expanded program of
surveys and censuses and improvements in administrative data systems for 77 IDA-eligible
countries over the SDG [Sustainable Development Goal] period is $17.0 billion to $17.7 billion.
Total expenditures by IBRD countries to produce SDG indicators are expected to be $26.5 billion
to $27.6 billion. Total aid needed to support the production of Tier I and II indicators for the
SDGs is expected to be $635 million to $685 million a year over the period of 2016 to 2030”
(GPSDD 2016).
3An evaluation of data in the IMF has a similar conclusion. “Efforts are under way in this
regard…but these efforts are, as previous attempts, piecemeal without a clear comprehensive
strategy which recognizes data as an institutional strategic asset, not just a consumption good
for economists” (IEO 2016, 1).
4This step echoes recommendation 3 in the IEG report, World Bank Group Country Engagement:
An Early-Stage Assessment of the Systematic Country Diagnostic and Country Partnership Framework
(World Bank 2017).

Appendix A. Methodological Approach
Evaluation Questions
1.      The evaluation’s objective was to assess how effectively the World Bank has
supported the production, sharing, and use of development data, and to suggest ways
to improve. This overarching objective inspired four lines of inquiry that guided the
collection and analysis of data and the framing of findings and recommendations (box
A.1).

 Box A.1. Four Lines of Inquiry that Guided the Evaluation
 ▪   Has the World Bank contributed effectively to data for the global public good and data
     partnerships?
 ▪   How effectively has the World Bank helped countries strengthen data production?
 ▪   How effectively has the World Bank promoted data sharing and use in countries?
 ▪   Is the World Bank keeping up with technological innovations, particularly those relating
     to big data?


Overarching Principles
2.      Three central principles motivated the evaluation design: multilevel analysis,
theory-based evaluation, and mixed methods. First, the evaluation adopted a multilevel
perspective because the assessments covered both the global and national dimensions
of World Bank support to data production, sharing, and use. Second, the evaluation
was grounded in a theory of change—a reconstruction of how the changes sought by
the World Bank’s support to global partnerships and national statistical systems were
expected to improve data production, sharing, and use. IEG reconstructed the theory of
change through an iterative process and validated it with key stakeholders. Third, the
evaluation followed a mixed-methods approach combining a range of methods for data
collection and analysis, and applied systematic triangulation to ensure the robustness of
the findings.

METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH

Ensuring the Validity of Findings
4.     IEG took several steps to guarantee a consistent approach across evaluation team
members—for example, using a case study template and interview protocols to ensure a
common framework and evaluative lens across studies. Similarly, IEG secured
interrater reliability across team members charged with coding interview transcripts.

5.     Furthermore, the team applied triangulation at multiple levels, first by
crosschecking evidence sources within a given methodological component. Within case
studies, for example, the team compared and contrasted evidence from interviews with
national statistical offices (NSOs), development partners, and World Bank staff on the
same topic. Second, the team applied triangulation across evaluation components—for
example, cross-validating findings from case studies with findings from surveys and
portfolio analysis.

6.     The evaluation team also applied external validation mechanisms at various
intervals during the evaluation process. For example, the team identified the portfolio
of core activities through an iterative process in dialogue with the Development Data
Group. Five peer reviewers provided feedback at the beginning, during, and end of the
evaluation process. Finally, the team organized workshops with a panel of key
stakeholders at the beginning of the evaluation process to validate the scope and the
approach, and at the end to ensure the relevance and feasibility of the evaluation
recommendations.

Limitations
7.     Notwithstanding these steps, the team documented several limitations to the
evaluation design that broadly fell into two categories. The first set of limitations is the
result of conscious choices about scope, and the second set is limitations due to other
methodological and data availability reasons. Limitations in scope include the
following:

     •   The team made a necessary trade-off between breadth and depth of analysis,
         covering some themes in detail and others more superficially, including the
         World Bank’s role in supporting data systems in fragile and conflict-affected
         states
     •   The evaluation scope was deliberately outward looking and paid limited
         attention to internal coordination issues covered in previous evaluative work
     •   The team purposefully centered the case study selection model on countries in
         which the World Bank had a significant data engagement to gauge effects at the
         system level. Cases selected included at least one core project such as a major

                                                                  METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
        statistical capacity–building initiative. This purposive sampling of countries is
        not representative of the total population of countries in which the World Bank
        is active
    •   The evaluation focused particularly on capacity-building initiatives that
        supported NSOs and went into less depth on support to line ministries, partly
        because statistical support to line ministries is difficult to identify in project
        documents. The evaluation found it impossible to develop a comprehensive
        picture of the extent of sectoral data support apart from that emerging from the
        review of type 2 and type 3 projects. The evaluation therefore somewhat
        superficially covered support to line ministries through its portfolio review,
        structured surveys that also targeted staff in line ministries, and case studies
        covering projects supporting line ministries’ data production and sharing.

Other limitations include the following:

    •   The team faced several challenges in identifying the core portfolio of data
        activities. The World Bank typically uses a sector coding system to account for
        its projects and operations, but it did not have a dedicated code to identify its
        data projects or projects with a data-related component until June 30, 2016.
        Therefore, the team estimated the total amount of World Bank commitments
        using various information sources and identification criteria (appendix B)
    •   A large range of data-related activities funded by trust funds had important
        information gaps. Similar information gaps existed for advisory services and
        analytics, where the World Bank does not document its progress as
        systematically as it does for investment projects
    •   The evaluation had to rely on proxy measures and perception data to study the
        topic of data use—a core concept of the evaluation—because it is particularly
        difficult to conceptualize, observe, and ultimately measure, and it has important
        construct validity issues. Another challenge was the relative lack of research on
        data use compared with the abundance of literature on data production and
        sharing
    •   Survey respondents did not represent the overall population for several reasons.
        The primary reason is the development methods of the survey frames that
        purposively targeted countries in which the World Bank had more than four
        data engagements and where the official or operative language was English,
        French, or Spanish. This purposive sampling and the surveys’ response rate
        have implications for the generalization of findings.

APPENDIX A
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH

Building-Block Studies
8.     Four of the 10 methodological components were building blocks for the rest of
the evaluation and informed further methodological choices, selection strategy, and the
substance of the evaluation findings. They included in-depth literature reviews, a
reconstruction of the theory of change, a systematic portfolio review, and interviews
with a large number of people both inside and outside the World Bank.

LITERATURE REVIEWS

9.     The team conducted two types of literature reviews during the evaluation
process. The first study analyzed and synthesized a diverse and extensive set of
academic, evaluation, and gray literature to understand the current state of
development data—from production to use—across the development spectrum. The
study sought to understand the key accomplishments across the entire statistical value
chain, from identifying user needs to data collection, archiving, analysis, dissemination,
and eventual use. It used the four lines of inquiry listed in box A.1 as a guide to identify
sources and synthesize existing evidence.

10.     A second, more targeted literature review sought to address a particularly
complex question: Is there a tension between global monitoring and national policy-
relevant data? IEG commissioned the review to Morten Jerven, a world-renowned
expert on the political economy of data and statistics. The review synthesized the latest
theoretical and empirical literature to establish patterns of the effect of international and
donor data priorities on national statistical capacity. It also examined the phenomenon
of the large increase in national strategies for the development of statistics and what this
means for national priorities.

THEORY OF CHANGE

11.     The evaluation drew on a theory-based evaluation approach, systematically and
iteratively reconstructing and recalibrating the theory of change underlying the World
Bank’s support to client countries’ statistical systems. Data production is understood
relatively well, so the theory of change focuses on reconstructing the causal chains and
processes underlying data dissemination and use. The idea of information polity—
defined as “stakeholders, data sources, data resources information flows, and
governance relationships involved in the provision and use of government-held and
nongovernmental data sources”—is an important construct in understanding the
factors and processes that underlie data use (Helbig and others 2012).

12.   Several recent evaluations of donors’ support to countries’ statistical system have
adopted a theory of change approach (for example, UN 2016; UNFPA 2015). This


64
                                                                                 APPENDIX A
                                                                   METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
evaluation used their frameworks, which were validated empirically, as a starting point
and modified them to reflect the specificity of World Bank support. A theory of change
underlying complex systems is necessarily a simplification. It relies on stylized
relationships and makes cognizant decisions about the systems’ boundaries and the
enabling conditions to which the evaluation paid close attention. The theory of change
also informed the design of data collection methods. IEG conducted the process of
reconstructing the theory of change by integrating insights from the literature review,
the portfolio analysis, and evidence from case studies. More specifically IEG relied on
the following elements:

    •   A review of existing empirical research and evaluations on data production,
        open data, and data use
    •   A review of the documents produced under the auspices of the Data Council
    •   A review of documents for data for development projects—for example, project
        appraisal documents, Implementation Completion and Results reports (ICRs),
        and evaluations
    •   Stakeholder consultation and validation of the model.

13.    Figure 1.1 in chapter 1 shows the World Bank’s various forms of support to
country clients’ statistical systems, on both the supply side and demand side. The
green-shaded boxes represent the World Bank’s various forms of support. Referring to
figure 1.1, the World Bank sought to bring change to its country clients’ statistical
systems in the following ways:

    •   Providing indirect support through its global-level work (top of the figure)
    •   Strengthening the capacity of national stakeholders to produce, analyze, and
        share data (left side of figure)
    •   Fostering an ecosystem for enhanced data use (right side of figure).

PORTFOLIO REVIEW

14.     The portfolio review exercise involved a systematic review of relevant project
documents for the data projects portfolio. This initial portfolio included 291 projects
approved during the FY06–15 period.1 The portfolio review’s main goal was to establish
the extent of World Bank support for data activities and the nature of activities
supported through the World Bank’s lending to client countries. Given the broad nature
of the initial portfolio, the review also sought to identify a core portfolio of projects by
eliminating projects with no relevance to data for development.

15.   The identification of a relevant portfolio focused exclusively on IBRD and IDA
lending (including development policy financing), recipient-executed trust fund grants,


                                                                                         65
APPENDIX A
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
and World Bank analytic work approved during FY06–15. The review excluded World
Bank–executed grants, terminated or dropped projects, or projects still in the pipeline.

16.     Given the lack of a harmonized system for tracking World Bank support for
development data activities, IEG constructed the portfolio by compiling an extensive
list of projects from different sources (discussed in the next sections) and excluding false
positives based on a manual review of project documents.

17.      The first step involved selecting all projects approved under the World Bank’s
different statistical capacity–building programs and trust funds. IEG retrieved a partial
list of the World Bank’s statistical capacity–building programs from the World Bank
website.2 The team identified a list of projects based on data available on the initiatives’
websites, including the Statistical Capacity Building Program (STATCAP), the Multi-
Donor Trust Fund to Support Statistical Capacity Building in Eastern Europe and CIS
Countries (known as ECASTAT), and the Statistics for Results Facility Catalytic Fund.
IEG obtained the commitments approved under the Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity
Building separately from the World Bank’s Business Intelligence database.

18.   IEG supplemented the project lists with project data compiled and provided by
the World Bank’s Development Data Group, which maintains a list of all World Bank
development data activities led by the group’s project staff.3

19.     The preliminary portfolio also included all the World Bank activities (loans,
grants, and Advisory Services and Analytics) assigned the theme code 22 (economic
statistics, modeling, and forecasting). Although the World Bank lacks a theme or sector
flag to identify data-related activities, IEG felt that this particular code is a close
approximation. The subsequent manual review of project documents eliminated several
false positives.

20.     IEG used a keyword search of project titles to identify projects whose names
indicated support for development data activities. The keywords used included
statistical capacity building, devstat, stats, survey, and census.

21.   Keyword search of relevant databases: The final step in the portfolio selection
process involved keyword searches of the prior actions database and components
database.4 The search included the following keywords, among others: data, statistical,
open government, statistics, websites, open data, civil registry, living standards
measurement, census, and survey.

22.   IEG identified relevant advisory services and analytics activities based on only
theme codes and project title searches.

                                                                    METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
23.       The World Bank Development Data Group then validated the final portfolio.

24.    Of the 291 projects in the initial portfolio, IEG excluded 66 projects from the final
portfolio because they were not relevant to data for development. The core portfolio of
225 interventions included 201 commitments to 95 countries and 24 commitments to
country groupings such as the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, Andean
countries, Western Africa, Pacific Islands, and the like.

25.    IEG developed a template for systematic data extraction in line with the
evaluation questions. The team systematically mined the information contained in the
project documents (project appraisal documents, concept notes, and ICRs and
Implementation Completion Results Reviews (ICRRs) when available) and created an
Excel database to record the extracted information and proceed with data aggregation.
The team then generated simple frequency statistics.

KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS

26.    Between June and September of 2016, the evaluation team conducted 76
semistructured interviews with World Bank staff and external experts on a range of
topics related to the World Bank’s role in promoting data for development. IEG
conducted the following interviews:

      •   21 interviews with World Bank staff early in the evaluation process to identify
          prominent World Bank initiatives related to data production, sharing, or use
      •   43 interviews with senior-level World Bank staff in the global practices, cross-
          cutting solutions areas, and World Bank regions selected to obtain cross-cutting
          perspectives
      •   seven interviews with World Bank staff involved in the day-to-day business
          operations of the World Bank’s main data partnerships or trust funds
      •   five interviews with external informants.

27.    The evaluation team took detailed, written notes for each interview and
systematically coded and analyzed those using content-analysis software (NVivo) to
derive themes and key messages from the interviews that could be triangulated with
each other and with other information sources (notably survey responses and in-depth
case studies).




                                                                                          67

METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH

Assessing the World Bank’s Contribution to Data for Development at the Global Level
SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF DATA PARTNERSHIPS AND THE WORLD BANK’S CONTRIBUTION TO GENDER DATA

28.    IEG performed a systematic analysis of formal partnerships on the main
evaluation questions about data production, sharing, and use when applicable.
Specifically, the review’s objectives were as follows:

     •    Describe the main partnerships in which the World Bank engaged for advancing
          data for development and summarize findings and recommendations from
          existing evaluations
     •    Describe the partnership’s stated and perceived purpose from a member’s
          perspective
     •    Assess the extent to which the partnership is meeting the stakeholders’ and
          beneficiaries’ needs from a member’s perspective
     •    Describe the member’s contributions to the partnership from a member’s
          perspective
     •    Describe the outcomes associated with the partnerships’ data production,
          dissemination, and use from the member’s perspective
     •    Identify key success factors for effective partnerships from the member’s
          perspective
     •    Identify perceived barriers or other factors that limited the effectiveness of the
          partnership from a member’s perspective
     •    Describe the partnership’s relevance in the context of the Sustainable
          Development Goals from a member’s perspective

29.    IEG based the assessment on three primary data sources: partnership documents
and websites, available evaluations of partnerships (five formal evaluations were
available out of the 10 partnerships reviewed), and interviews with World Bank and
partners’ staff and stakeholders involved in the partnerships. The data collection
methods consisted of a systematic review of documents, interviews, and a questionnaire
distributed to select partners. Table A.2 presents the main information sources for each
partnership.

QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTERED TO DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS

30.    The evaluation team consulted with the World Bank staff in charge of managing
data partnerships and conducted desk-based research to compile a list of development
partners involved in global data partnerships in which the World Bank is an active
member. IEG sent a questionnaire to 135 partners and reached 123 people
(SurveyMonkey reported three opt-outs and nine bounce-backs). The team
administered the questionnaire between October 4 and November 11, 2016 and sent
eight e-mail reminders (table A.3).

STRUCTURED SURVEY OF WORLD BANK STAFF

31.    To build the survey frame, the evaluation team obtained from the World Bank’s
human resource department a list of staff in all global practices, regions, cross-cutting
solutions areas, DEC, and the Office of the President’s Special Envoy whose grade level
is GF and above. The team excluded staff who were not in a direct operational or
research role, yielding a total population of 4,500 staff members. The team randomly
assigned staff members to one of two surveys that IEG conducted concurrently (one
survey for this evaluation and one survey for the evaluation of shared prosperity). The
survey’s sample size was 2,420 staff members, 52 of whom had previously opted out of
SurveyMonkey surveys, bringing the total number of respondents to 2,369. IEG
administered the anonymous, confidential survey questionnaire through
SurveyMonkey between October 4 and November 11, 2016. Nonrespondents received
11 reminders, and a random sample of nonrespondents received phone reminders
during the last two weeks of the survey.5 Furthermore, the Director of the IEG Human

                                                                                                                    69

Development and Economic Management Department sent an e-mail to a random
sample of 60 directors asking them to encourage their staff to take the survey (table

                                                    the survey (sent to 2,369 World Bank staff)

32.    The evaluation team applied descriptive statistics (a description of sample
frequencies) and goodness of fit tests to the two main surveys (the next section
describes other surveys), and used sample frequencies and crosstab analyses to assess
the results of conditional filters (for example, sorting respondents by particular
characteristics).

Assessing the World Bank’s Contribution to Data for Development at the Country
Level
CASE STUDIES

33.     The evaluation conducted 11 case studies of the World Bank’s role in supporting
national statistical systems in data production, sharing, and use. Case studies are in-
depth analyses of specific configurations intersecting a specific World Bank support
setting, country context, and modality of support. These specific configurations give
rise to a constellation of factors that influence the outcome of statistical capacity–
building initiatives. The objective for each case study was to assess the extent of success
of World Bank interventions and understand the specific constellation of factors that
account for particular outcomes. IEG conducted case studies in countries where World
Bank support was sufficiently large that effects were observable at the system level.
Taken together, the cases illustrated the range of World Bank support modalities for
data production, sharing, and use and a sufficiently diverse set of contexts.

34.   Table A.5 summarizes the case selection and the type of study. The case study
countries were selected purposefully, based on the following criteria:

     •   World Bank financial and technical support to data: the sample included
         countries receiving a medium to high level of support6

     •    Statistical Capacity Initiative: the sample had to include countries where the
          World Bank funded at least one statistical capacity–building initiative
     •    Diversity of the World Bank’s support modalities: the sample had to include
          countries that also had other data-related projects and Advisory Services and
          Analytics as identified in the preliminary portfolio
     •    Timing of World Bank support: the main statistical capacity–building initiative
          had to be active or recently closed
     •    Diversity of contexts: the sample had to include statistical systems in all World
          Bank regions and a mix of large and small countries, with deliberate
          oversampling of IDA countries.

Note: PPAR = project performance assessment report.

35.     Each case study involved an extensive desk-based review of project documents,
an analysis of pertinent indicators, and a review of existing empirical evidence on the
country’s statistical system (for example, a review of case studies conducted by other
partners, self-evaluation material, and diagnostic studies conducted by the Partnership
in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century). IEG also conducted interviews with
World Bank staff in charge of the portfolio of interventions in each country (40
interviews across case studies). A team composed of at least one IEG evaluation expert
and a statistics expert also conducted an in-depth field visit in eight of 11 cases. The
team conducted interviews and roundtable discussions with data users and producers,
including country client officials, staff in partner agencies, and researchers (160
interviews across case studies). Three of the eight field-based case studies were project
performance assessment reports.

36.   The evaluation team wrote a case narrative for each country using an established
template. Subsequently, the team systematically analyzed, compared, contrasted, and


                                                                                                      71

synthesized the evidence emerging from the 11 case narratives using a qualitative
analysis software (NVivo). The team then coded individual cases along the dimensions
of the theory of change and fed the synthetic evidence into the evaluation report.

STRUCTURED SURVEY OF COUNTRY STAKEHOLDERS

37.     The evaluation team compiled a list of 24 countries (box A.2) where the World
Bank had more than four data engagements and where the official or operative
language was English, French, or Spanish. This purposive sampling has implications for
the generalization of findings. For each country, the evaluation team asked country
offices to identify target respondents in five stakeholders group (government agencies,
civil society organizations, partners, academia, and the private sector). For government
agency stakeholders, the team targeted only director-level officials. The total target
survey population was 2,371, but 446 bounce-backs and individuals who opted out
reduced the total survey population to 1,925. The survey was anonymous and
administered in English, Spanish, and French through Snap Survey Software between
October 4 and November 11, 2016. The team sent five reminders to all targeted
participants and phone reminders to a random sample in the last two weeks of the
survey period.7

activities, IEG constructed the portfolio of 291 projects through a process of triangulating data
from different sources. The Approach Paper describes the process and criteria IEG used to select
the 291 projects.

managed by the Statistical Development and Partnership Team of the Development Data
Group. IEG excluded other existing programs in other World Bank departments. Please see the

because it did not make sense to allocate time and resources to conducting in-depth, in-country
case studies in countries where the World Bank had minimal data engagement or none at all.

Appendix B. Portfolio Review of World Bank Data
for Development Lending Commitments
1.      The portfolio review exercise involved a systematic review of relevant project
documents for the data projects portfolio IEG identified. This initial portfolio was
composed of 291 projects approved during the period FY06–15.1 The exercise intended
to establish the extent of World Bank support for data activities and the nature of
activities supported through World Bank lending to client countries. Furthermore,
given the broad nature of the initial portfolio, the review also sought to identify a core
portfolio of projects by eliminating projects with no relevance to data for development.

Identified Portfolio
2.     The document review process yielded 225 core projects across 95 countries.2
Financing by IBRD or IDA accounted for a greater share of financing by value (80
percent) though there were more trust-funded grants (table B.1). Estimating the value of
policy-based financing for data activities was difficult because the project documents do
not specify these amounts. Consequently, this report understates overall commitment
amounts because IEG excluded the DPF contributions.

Note: This report understates the commitment value because IEG excluded the amounts from development policy financing,
which could not be accurately estimated.

3.     Investment lending was the main form of support for data activities. By number,
investment lending projects accounted for 82 percent of the data for development
portfolio, followed by adjustment at 17 percent, and Program for Results projects at 1
percent (table B.2).

4.     World Bank commitments for data activities averaged about $90 million per year
and increased in the latter half of the evaluation period (FY06–15). Average annual
commitments during the 10-year period were about $90 million, with sharp increases in
FY11 and FY15.3 Declining commitments characterized the first part of the evaluation
period—commitments fell from about $64 million in FY06 to $10 million in FY09.
However, lending for data for development activities has increased steadily since 2012
from about $48 million to $209 million in 2015 (figure B.1). Consequently, the average
annual commitments have more than doubled from $55 million during the FY06–10
period to $129 million during the FY11–15 period. By number, data for development
projects did not show any sustained trend during the period, averaging about 23
projects each year.

Types of Data Coverage
6.     As part of this exercise, IEG classified the data for development projects into
three categories based on the extent of support for data activities. Type 1 projects
(stand-alone projects) used the entire loan or grant amount to support data activities
and were about 62 percent of the data for development portfolio by number and 59
percent by value (table B.4).

development and were 10 percent of the portfolio by number and 15 percent by value.
Type 3 projects supported relevant data for development activities, but the projects and


                                                                                                                             77

components were not specifically data related. These projects accounted for 28 percent
of the number and 26 percent of the portfolio value.4

8.   Of the 225 data for development projects, only 201 projects had enough
documentation for IEG to review.

World Bank Support for Identifying Data Gaps
9.      The portfolio review tried to assess the extent to which World Bank–supported
activities were informed by previously identified data gaps or were developed in
response to them. The review found only a few cases in which the project documents
explicitly referred to the existence of previously identified data gaps. Only 20 projects
explicitly discussed the existence of data gaps or activities undertaken to diagnose
existing data gaps. However, in several cases the documents referred to a previously
undertaken national strategy for the development of statistics (NSDS) or noted the
project’s support for preparing the strategy.5 Of the 201 projects reviewed, 41 projects
(20 percent) either supported preparation of an NSDS or mentioned the existence of a
previously undertaken NSDS.

World Bank Support for Strengthening Production of Specific Data Types
10.     The World Bank targeted support toward specific data types in about 56 percent
of the reviewed projects. The type of activities typically supported included improving
subject matter methodologies, capacity building aimed at enhancing skills for the
production of the specific data types, and collecting the relevant data, especially
through surveys. About 40 percent of projects included support for strengthening data
production in at least one of these five priority areas. Production of household survey
data received the most attention in number of projects.

Note: Some projects supported more than one priority area.


11.    The World Bank also supported data production strengthening for other key
types of data, including statistics in education, health, gender, tourism, and agriculture.

                                                                                  APPENDIX B
                    PORTFOLIO REVIEW OF WORLD BANK DATA FOR DEVELOPMENT LENDING COMMITMENTS
Of the 201 projects reviewed, 78 projects (39 percent) supported the strengthening of
these data types.

World Bank Support for Data Collection Activities
12.     The portfolio review found that World Bank financing was used in several cases
to support actual data collection—household surveys, business surveys, population
census, agriculture census, and surveys of private sector activity. Fifty-six percent of the
projects reviewed involved support for collecting data. World Bank–financed surveys
included, among others, pilot surveys for agriculture statistics, health facility surveys,
school censuses, and establishment surveys. For example, the FY14 Armenia agriculture
census project used grant funds to undertake the following activities related to data
collection:

    •   Training field staff (enumerators, registrars, supervisors, coordinators, and
        census area managers)
    •   Providing methodological assistance and supervising the fieldwork during the
        census
    •   Preparing census documents, including printing questionnaires, instructions,
        and publicity materials, and providing stationary necessary to conduct the pilot
        agricultural census
    •   Conducting fieldwork and interviewing respondents.

Project Execution of Data Activities
13.    National statistical offices (NSOs) were the primary implementing agencies in
World Bank–supported data activities, especially for stand-alone projects. NSOs
implemented the data activities in about 53 percent of the projects reviewed and 73
percent of the type 1 projects. For projects aimed at strengthening the production of
specific sectoral data, the statistics departments of the responsible ministry were
typically the implementing agencies. Other implementing agencies for data activities
included the ministries of finance, research institutions, and regional institutions such
as AFRISTAT (table B.6).

Beneficiaries of Data for Development Projects
14.     Project documents seldom specified the beneficiaries of World Bank support for
data activities. Reviewed documents rarely specified even the intended project
beneficiaries, and when they did, they did not specify the beneficiaries of the data
activities separately. This could be because a large number of projects are trust-funded
projects, which do not specify the intended project beneficiaries (unlike IBRD/IDA
projects). However, when specified, the main beneficiaries of data for development
projects included NSOs, government ministries, departments and agencies, policy
makers and decision makers, research institutions, international development partners,
and the public.

World Bank Support for Strengthening Client Capacity
15.    The portfolio review also assessed the World Bank’s contribution to
strengthening client capacity to produce, disseminate, and use data. The review
considered three key dimensions of client capacity: institutional capacity, legal and
regulatory capacity, and human capacity.

16.     Financing for institutional strengthening was an important form of World Bank
support. Almost half of the projects reviewed (46 percent) supported strengthening
client institutional capacity (table B.7) and delivered support to about 60 countries and
three regional subgroupings. World Bank–supported institutional strengthening
activities included organizational restructuring of NSOs, specifying formal coordination
mechanisms between and among data producers and users, and strengthening sectoral
offices. For example, the FY07 Statistical Capacity Building Program (STATCAP) project
in Kenya supported the organizational restructuring of the Central Bureau of Statistics

and its transformation from a government department in the ministry of finance to a
new, semiautonomous agency. In the Kyrgyz Republic, a 2009 Trust Fund for Statistical
Capacity Building grant provided technical assistance for defining the interaction
between the National Statistical Committee and relevant line ministries and statistical
agencies. In South Sudan, World Bank support was used to assess the NSO’s
organizational structure and implement changes to align the organization with its
corporate objectives.

17.     Support for strengthening the legal framework for data activities was less
frequent than other forms of capacity strengthening, but it was still an important form
of World Bank support. Only 20 percent of the reviewed projects involved support for
strengthening the legal framework. In countries lacking a legal framework for statistical
activities, the World Bank aimed to support the enactment of laws and regulations to
guide these activities. In countries with existing legal frameworks, World Bank support
was used to assess the adequacy of the laws and regulations and when necessary
support revision of the regulatory and procedural framework for government statistics.
The World Bank also supported the revision of existing statistics legislation to give
NSOs more professional and technical independence and to strengthen the
accountability of official statistics producers. For example, the Strengthening the
National Statistical System of Mongolia Project in FY09 financed a review of the law on
statistics to better incorporate UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the
Mongolian Code of Practice. The Strengthening the National Statistical System of
Kazakhstan Project in FY11 supported the development of regulations and bylaws to
improve interagency cooperation on statistical activities, and the revision of agreements
between statistical agencies to ensure efficient interaction and information exchange.
One of the prior actions of the FY11 Poverty Reduction Support Credit 5 DPO to
Senegal was submission to parliament of amendments to the statistics law that
mandated greater open access to primary data.

18.     Support for strengthening human capacity was the largest form of capacity-
strengthening financing. Seventy-one percent of the reviewed projects supported
activities to strengthen human capacity to produce and use data (table B.8). Activities to
strengthen human capacity included, among others, assessing competencies and
training needs, supporting key staff participation in various training programs, and
strengthening cooperation with universities to develop a training curriculum for
statistics and to educate trainers. For example, the FY14 Comoros Statistics project
supported the establishment and operation of a statistics training school at a university.

Note: Type 1: The entire project supported data; Type 2: At least one entire component supported data; Type 3: The project
supported relevant data activities, but the project components were not specifically data related.

19.     World Bank financing targeted the development of statistical methods,
standards, and classifications to improve client countries’ data quality. Eighty-one
projects (40 percent of the reviewed portfolio) included support for these quality-
enhancing activities, which included, among others, support for the adoption of
internationally accepted standards and methodologies in data collection, compilation,
and validation; improvement of questionnaire design and sampling frames; and
improvement of sampling methods, population estimates, and projections. For example,
the Additional Financing for Integrated Financial Management and Information System
Project in The Gambia in FY14 provided training on the compilation and analysis of
price and national accounts data.

20.     To provide an enabling environment for data production, World Bank support to
clients included financing for the acquisition of physical infrastructure, such as
buildings and information technology (IT) equipment. Of the 201 projects reviewed, 79
provided this form of support. For example, the Tanzania Statistical Capacity Building
Project in FY11 supported construction of new office buildings for the National Bureau
of Statistics and the Office of the Chief Government Statistician. Other projects
supported the acquisition of IT equipment, such as portable data assistants, computers,
high-performance servers, and software.

Support for Data Dissemination and Open Data
21.    In several of its projects, the World Bank supported efforts to improve data
producers’ dissemination function and make development data more widely available
to users. Of the 201 projects reviewed, 68 projects included support for increasing public
access to development data. Activities financed under World Bank projects included the
following, among others:

    •   Upgrades to NSO websites and the creation of open web portals to allow access
        to data users
    •   Publication of flagship statistical reports and documents produced by NSOs and
        other data producers
    •   Development of dissemination policies that respect the UN Fundamental
        Principles of Official Statistics and the African Charter on Statistics and technical
        assistance as needed.

22.    For example, the FY12 Ghana Statistical Development Project supported the
following activities relevant to data dissemination:

    •   Creation of a data dissemination and resource hub within the Ghana Statistical
        System
    •   Training provided to the respective line ministries on the communication and
        dissemination of statistics
    •   Improvements to the official national statistics website
    •   Development of a release calendar for national statistics
    •   Development of a policy for publications and dissemination.

Partnerships
23.    The portfolio review also sought to establish the extent and nature of partnership
arrangements in World Bank data for development projects. The review found that only
28 of the 201 projects reviewed involved other development partners, including, among
others, the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), Sida, Statistics
Norway, Statistics Korea, AusAID, Turkish International Cooperation Agency, and the
European Union. The IMF was another key World Bank partner, especially in
supporting clients to strengthen the methodology for macroeconomic statistics. The
partnership arrangements included cofinancing agreements such as with DFID under
the FY07 Kenya STATCAP project, parallel financing of data activities such as surveys,
and providing hands-on training and support. In several countries (including
Kazakhstan, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and Mongolia), World Bank
projects supported the establishment of a twinning arrangement between the client
                                                                                          83

NSO and a well-developed NSO (or a consortium of such offices). This approach was
thought to promote greater knowledge transfer, and it was expected to reduce the
transaction time and cost of implementation significantly, as well as the risk of
improperly managing project funds.

World Bank Support to Data Users
24.    The portfolio review also considered the extent to which World Bank support
enhanced clients’ capacity to use the data produced. The review found that 27 projects
(13.5 percent of reviewed projects) supported activities to build capacity for data use,
such as user education workshops, training for media on how to use statistical
information, and training and workshops to enhance data literacy among other data
users.

Results of World Bank Support for Data Activities
25.    IEG reviewed the project completion documents for closed World Bank
operations to assess the results of World Bank support for data activities.6 Of the 225
projects in the IEG portfolio, 146 are closed, and completion documents are available for
75 of those. Considering the high number of trust fund grants in the portfolio and the
sparse reporting on results for these grants, the assessment of results achieved by closed
projects was limited. For the five dimensions of support shown in table B.9, the extent of
results achieved for each dimension was rated on a scale of 0 to 3 (with 0 representing
no documented results and 3 corresponding to a high degree of results achievement).
The average project result score for strengthening data use was 1.7 compared with a
higher score of 2.0 for building human capacity and an even higher score of 2.1 for
strengthening the legal framework (table B.9).

Note: The rating scale is 0 (no results) to 3 (high degree of achievement).

26.    More than half of the data for development projects validated by IEG received a
satisfactory development outcome rating. However, the assigned outcome rating for
type 1 and type 2 projects reflects the outcome of the whole project, not just the project’s

seven of these were type 1 projects dedicated exclusively to data activities.

1 Given the lack of a harmonized system for tracking World Bank support for development data
activities, IEG constructed the portfolio of 291 projects through a process of triangulating data
from different sources. The Approach Paper describes the process and criteria used to select the
291 projects.
2Of the initial portfolio of 291 projects, IEG excluded 66 projects from the final portfolio because
they were not relevant to data for development. The core portfolio of 225 interventions included
201 commitments to 95 countries and 24 commitments to country groupings such as the
Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, Andean countries, West Africa, the Pacific Islands,
and the like.
3In both FY11 and FY15, approval of a few large value projects caused the sharp rise in data for
development commitments (projects such as the $65 million FY11 Strengthening Indonesian
Statistics project and the $80 million component of the FY15 Nigeria Saving One Million Lives
Initiative Program-for-Results Project, for example).
4This report understates the commitment value of type 3 projects because IEG excluded DPF
amounts, which could not be reliably estimated. All excluded projects were type 3 projects.
5A national strategy for the development of statistics (NSDS) is expected to provide a country
with a strategy for developing statistical capacity across the national statistical system. The
preparation process for an NSDS is assumed to involve an assessment of existing data gaps and
an implementation plan for closing these gaps.
6IEG reviewed three main types of completion documents: Implementation Completion and
Results Reports prepared by the implementing team at project closure, Implementation
Completion and Results Reviews prepared by IEG, and Implementation Completion
Memorandums for trust fund grants.



                                                                                                 85
Appendix C. Survey Data Findings
1.     The structured survey that IEG conducted for this evaluation shows that country
stakeholders (academia, civil society, donor agencies, government, and the private
sector) tend to rate the World Bank’s effectiveness in promoting development data
higher than the World Bank staff do.

2.      In each of the two groups that IEG surveyed (World Bank staff and country
stakeholders), slightly less than 70 percent rated the World Bank as highly effective or
effective in making key data sets available globally. Between one-half and two-thirds of
respondents in both groups rated the World Bank as highly effective or effective in
developing standards and protocols to ensure global data quality. Respondents gave
similarly high ratings of effectiveness to the World Bank’s performance in supporting
global data innovations (such as open data, systems for big data, or use of tablets and
phones for surveys) and bringing development partners and governments together to
discuss global data issues (table C.1).

3.     Between 62 percent and 77 percent of country stakeholder subgroups rated the
World Bank as highly effective or effective in making key data sets available globally
(table C.2).

4.    World Bank staff and country stakeholders that IEG surveyed agreed that the
World Bank has been more effective at helping countries produce data than helping
them to share or use data. On each of these dimensions, country stakeholders rated
World Bank effectiveness higher than World Bank staff did (table C.3).

5.      Only 19 percent of the staff rated the World Bank as highly effective or effective
in helping countries adopt data innovations compared with 41 percent of country
stakeholders. The staff’s rating is higher than this on support for development of
national statistical strategies—30 percent rated the World Bank as highly effective or
effective compared with 41 percent of country stakeholders (table C.5). Respondents are
more likely to agree that the World Bank puts its own data needs above those of its
country clients than to agree that it gives priority to country needs (table C.6).

6.     Asked to choose areas in which the World Bank’s work needs strengthening, a
larger proportion of respondents in each of the two survey groups (World Bank staff
and country stakeholders) chose the category of prioritizing the use of development
data in country-level policy dialogue. (table C.7).




                                                                                         86
                                                                                  APPENDIX C
                                                                         SURVEY DATA FINDINGS
7.      Asked to reflect on World Bank priorities going forward, 59 percent of country
stakeholders included “supporting countries in the production of development data” in
their top five areas of strategic thrust, a higher proportion than for any other area. Fifty-
three percent of World Bank staff chose support for country-level data production
among their five preferred areas (table C.8).

8.    Regarding support for data in client countries, country stakeholders rate the
World Bank’s effectiveness in production and sharing higher than its support for data
use—this is the opposite for World Bank staff respondents, who rated the World Bank
higher in data use than data sharing (table C.3).

9.      Only 27 percent of World Bank staff rated the World Bank as highly effective or
effective in promoting data use compared with 45 percent of country stakeholders (table
C.3). Among the country stakeholder subgroups, the proportion of respondents rating
the World Bank as highly effective or effective on data use ranges from 28 percent of the
respondents in the donor agencies category to more than 50 percent in the private sector
and government categories (table C.4).

10.    Respondents gave a low rating to the World Bank’s record in creating in-country
demand for data. Only 27 percent of World Bank staff and 40 percent of country
stakeholders rated the World Bank as highly effective or effective on this dimension
(table C.5). Despite this low effectiveness rating, none of the three groups surveyed
included “generating country-level demand for data” among their top choice of areas
where, going forward, the World Bank needed strengthening.

11.    Regarding support for global data innovations (including big data), 47 percent of
the staff rated the World Bank as highly effective or effective compared with 45 percent
of country stakeholders (table C.1). Among the country stakeholder subgroups, 53
percent of government respondents rated the World Bank as highly effective or effective
in supporting global data innovations, followed by 44 percent of donor agencies, 43
percent of civil society, 42 percent of academics, and 35 percent of the private sector
(table C.2).

12.     Asked to reflect on the World Bank’s priorities going forward, 54 percent of staff
included ‘“making key data sets available globally’” in their top five areas of strategic
thrust, a higher proportion than for any other area, while slightly less than 50 percent of
country stakeholders chose “global availability of data sets” among their five preferred
areas, giving more preference to “supporting countries in production of development
data.” Respondents gave a relatively low priority to global data innovation—only 32
percent of World Bank staff and 37 percent of country stakeholders included this among
their five preferred areas for World Bank emphasis (table C.8).


                                                                                           87
APPENDIX C
SURVEY DATA FINDINGS
13.    The surveys paint a mixed picture of the priorities for future World Bank
interventions on development data. Country stakeholders believe that the area in most
need of strengthening is the World Bank’s ability to mobilize funding for development
data. World Bank staff gave high priority to both funding and inclusion of development
data in the country-level policy dialogue, attached less importance to strengthening the
understanding of in-country political economy issues, and gave even lower priority to
generating country-level demand for development data (table C.7).
