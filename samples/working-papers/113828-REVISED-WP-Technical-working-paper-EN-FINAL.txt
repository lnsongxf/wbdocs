        This report is the product of the collaborative effort and valuable contributions of international and local partners under
        the auspices of the Food Safety Working Group in Vietnam. It was written by the World Bank team in partnership
        with development partner institutions and organizations in Vietnam. It draws on substantial research and analytical
        background information available to the authors from various sources (both through published research and ongoing
        initiatives), as well as on proposals and ideas presented at a round-table discussion organized by the World Bank and
        partners on food safety risk management held in Ha Noi in January 2016 and a consultation workshop in July 2016.
        The report benefited from two World Bank missions to Vietnam (January to July 2016) and subsequent visits to many
        food safety stakeholders.

separate from risk management and will generate risk profiles
and assessments, which, in conjunction with economic
analysis, will allow risks to be prioritized. A systematic,
comprehensive surveillance system is needed for foodborne

promise, but continued development is needed for these to
gain a significant market share and consumer trust.

 •	 At the national level, technical and human capacities are
   comparatively strong. In contrast, capacities at regional
   and provincial levels for implementing nationally
   determined policies and for securing food safety are
   uneven and exhibit major gaps. At provincial and local
   levels particularly, capacities are either weak or very
   weak and have constrained operational funding.

 •	 Although   risk-based food control management is
   being implemented in some areas, it is not being done
   uniformly across ministries, departments and provinces.
   It is recommended that a risk-based approach be followed
   across the board to ensure best utilization of resources and
   lead to an effective food control system in the country.

 •	 Currently, the focus is more on end-product inspection and
   testing for ensuring food safety rather than implementing
   preventive approaches by food business operators. It
   should be recognized that end-product testing cannot
   build safety into a product, nor is it cost-effective. It is
   important for the government to build in preventive
   approaches for food safety and use testing to validate the
   effectiveness of preventive measures put in place by the
   food businesses.

 •	 Each  ministry has its own network of laboratories
   (including research institutes and university laboratories)
   with different capacities while NIFC acts as the reference
   laboratory for food safety. National and regional
   laboratories are usually better equipped and funded than
   provincial laboratories. The concept of networking of
   laboratories at national level is needed. There is also need
   to use the private sector to strengthen the governmental
   food control activities.

 •	 There  remain significant weaknesses with regard to
   implementation of quality management, differences in
   validation procedures and parameters covered, while
   testing skills and experience among staff are insufficient.

 •	 Currently, data available from governmental and research
   institutions are not harmonized. Further, the same
   is not scientifically collected, analysed and used for
   development of standards and other risk management
   activities. It is important to organize for better collection
   of data and its use in a systematic and planned manner.
   It is also important to implement national residue and
   contaminant monitoring programs across the country.

 •	 There are a number of health sector related universities
   providing training in food hygiene and safety and seven
   main public agriculture universities providing training
   in veterinary, food and animal sciences. Although this
   significant academic asset exists, only a few universities

3.2.1. Consumption
With an average annual pork consumption of 27
kg per capita in Vietnam5 and population of 7
million in Hanoi and 8.2 million in Ho Chi Minh
City, the total demand for pork is estimated at 630
tons per day in Ha Noi and 730 tons per day in
Ho Chi Minh City. This does not include demand
from the significant number of daily visitors
to the city; hence, in reality, the actual pork
consumption may be even higher. Moreover, most          Meat inspector in performance
studies show that meat consumption is higher in
urban areas so we would expect urban Ha Noi to
have higher per capita pork consumption than the
country average. Consumption of pork outside
the home is increasing. In 2012, it was estimated
that Vietnam had 430,000 street stalls/kiosks,
7,000 fast-food restaurants, 80,000 full-service
restaurants and 22,000 cafeterias/bars. Ha Noi
also has a large number of institutional food
providers including government, educational,
medical and industry canteens.


3.2.2.	Production
As at October 2014, Ha Noi had more than 1.4
million pigs, accounting for 5.3% of the national
herd (26.5 million pigs)6. This contributes more
than 500 tons of pork per day for the capital’s
residents. Thus, deriving the 630 tons demand           A small-scale slaughterhouse in Ha Noi in operation,

food safety during transport of food between provinces.

 •	 Eighty   per cent of pork and 85% of vegetables are
     marketed mainly in retail (wet) markets and small-scale
     producers dominate the value chain. Even though the
     control of food safety has been improved as a result of
     increasing intensification of pork production and rapid
     development of the supermarket system, small-scale
     production and the flow through traditional/informal
     markets still dominates in most agricultural value chains
     and so the food safety risk remains high.

 •	 Seventy-six   per cent of pigs are processed mainly in
     small slaughtering facilities with generally poor hygiene
     conditions.

 •	 Characterized     by considerable participation of small-
     scale players along pork and vegetable value chains,
     a multi-dimensional approach that covers a wide range
     of various actions, for example, technical training of
     producers, promoting best practices and government
     control, is strongly recommended for these value chains

 •	 Given    that consumers have a strong preference for
     fresh animal-source food and fresh fruit and vegetables
     and most do not store purchased food for long periods,
     focus should be placed on (i) identifying technological
     solutions and associated management procedures to
     enable quick and efficient testing of fresh products, (ii)
     promoting business models with lean and efficient value
     chains to deliver fresh products to consumers within
     a short time and minimizing food safety risk and (iii)
     raising awareness among end consumers and producer
