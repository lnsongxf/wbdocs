Executive Summary
Background and Context
Due to the strong economic growth maintained in the last 15 years, Uzbekistan made progress in
reducing gender inequality. At the same time, a number of demographic and structural challenges
remains; and effectively engaging women in the economy is one of them. While modernizing various
sectors of the economy will foster progress and development, it may also result in setbacks for women,
as they lack the skills and education needed to successfully adjust to a changing reality. While women
constitute around 50 percent of the national population, their participation in the formal labor market is
limited. Active women’s participation offers a reserved potential for further national economic growth
and improved livelihoods for women in Uzbekistan.

The link between women’s productive participation in the country’s economy and improved eco-
nomic indicators is well documented across the world. Hence, to maintain strong economic growth,
it is in Uzbekistan’s national interest to improve women’s participation in the formal economy. Not only
can significant economic benefits be realized by mobilizing such latent productive potential, but it can
be achieved in parallel with improving women’s capacity to make decisions about their own lives and
act on them.



Study Objective and Approach
The objective of this study is to examine how gender influences opportunities and risks in accessing
livelihoods in Uzbekistan. It seeks to identify the constraints to, and opportunities for, increased socio-
economic resilience among rural women in Uzbekistan, and it has the potential to inform livelihoods
programming. The study focuses on women in rural areas, as they represent a large portion of productive
members of Uzbek society who are insufficiently integrated into the formal labor market.

The study adopts a capability approach6 to understand the distinct aspirations, opportunities,
and barriers for rural women in income-generating activities. It focuses on supply-side challenges
faced by women and enablers of women’s work (e.g., low labor demand and lack of formal employment
opportunities). The study is centered on the premise that a gender-inclusive approach should be an inte-
gral goal of livelihood support in Uzbekistan.

The study is structured around an analytical framework (adapted from the 2012 World Develop-
ment Report on Gender Equality and Development) that is composed of three pillars of outcomes:
(1) physical and human capital; (2) access to livelihoods/income-generating activities; and (3) voice—
that is, the ability to make one’s own choices within the household, community, and public sphere. This
framework promotes women’s capabilities as the central lens and employs analyses focused on the mutu-
ally reinforcing nature of those outcomes.
The study employs a mixed-method approach that generates primary qualitative data and draws
on secondary quantitative data sources. Primary qualitative data was collected from 28 focus group
discussions (FGDs) and 44 key informant interviews (KIIs) that took place in four regions. A total of

296 people participated: 203 women and 93 men. Secondary quantitative data was derived from two
sources: (1) a 2013 Central Asian Longitudinal Inclusive Society Survey (CALISS) and (2) official data
from the State Committee on Statistics, analyzed by the Scientific Research Center on Employment and
Labor Safety under the Ministry of Labor. A technical working group composed of representatives from
key national institutions was established to help analyze national policies related to women’s economic
empowerment and to access official statistical data.



Pillar 1: Women’s Access to Livelihoods
Pillar 1 provides insight into Uzbekistan’s labor market, with emphasis on access and prospects for
rural women. It features an analysis of current livelihood strategies for women, including barriers to and
aspirations for income generation.

Despite decrease in gender disparities, achieved due to significant efforts on behalf of the gov-
ernment, gender gaps still remain in Uzbekistan’s formal labor market. While gender gaps are
decreasing, several employment sectors retain strong gender dimensions and feature significant differ-
ences in average gender income levels. These disparities are also reinforced through cultural norms and
expectations.

The Government of Uzbekistan (GoU) aims to increase the labor market participation of “hard-
to-employ” groups, including women. In addition to broader policy measures to improve the business
climate for small and medium enterprises, job creation is stimulated by offering support to home-based
labor (as well as family entrepreneurship and crafts activities), implementing local socioeconomic devel-
opment and investment programs, and sponsoring public works programs.

While agriculture remains the main option for employment in rural areas, women’s participation
is mostly informal, unregulated, and part-time. Rural women are often informally engaged in tending
tomorkas and livestock for little or no remuneration. Women may not always have access to or control
over the income received from these activities. Full-time farm-based roles are limited for women, and
day labor rates are typically lower than for men. Women expressed strong interest in agricultural subsec-
tors such as horticulture, greenhouses, and food processing. Seasonal agricultural work offers employ-
ment opportunities for rural women, but current labor legislation does not clearly regulate seasonal
employment and needs to be approved.

Nonfarm opportunities for rural women are limited, but home-based enterprises and small busi-
ness activities are increasing. Beyond state-based organizations, there is limited large-scale private
enterprise in rural Uzbekistan. The most common forms of part-time, nonfarm employment for rural
women are tailoring/sewing and baking/cooking to serve local customers.

Employment provides rural women with some degree of independence and often allows them to
make valuable contributions to their households. Furthermore, women tend to allocate their income
to expenses such as their children’s education, which can create a virtuous cycle of increased opportuni-
ties for children (particularly daughters). Often, women’s nonfarm entrepreneurial activities offset the
seasonal nature of agricultural income, stabilizing a household’s annual income.

A range of barriers—from social and cultural to infrastructure and finance—limit rural women’s
opportunities for entrepreneurship and employment. These include the burden of domestic respon-
sibilities (women shoulder the bulk of household duties); an expectation to be the sole caregiver and
breadwinner for family members when men migrate for labor; limited availability and access to financial


                                                                                                      xi

and business resources, centralized utility services, and community infrastructure; limited skills; tradi-
tional household and community attitudes toward women; and restrictions on movements outside the
household.

There is evidence that attitudes and norms for women’s entrepreneurship are evolving. Concur-
rently, barriers to entrepreneurial activities are decreasing, and women’s interest in business is increas-
ing. Women’s entrepreneurship—which is often in fields of interest to other women—may have the
potential both to improve local women’s employment opportunities and to contribute to more positive
community attitudes toward women’s work ambitions. Alongside roles in public organizations, small-
scale enterprise and home production activities are most appealing to rural women.



Pillar 2: Women and Physical and Human Capital
Pillar 2 provides insight into the status of gender from a physical and human capital perspective. Key
elements of human capital are focused on access to education and skills-training opportunities for women,
while physical capital includes women’s access to finance, institutional resources, and local infrastructure.

Findings from the study support international evidence, which suggests a positive link between
female enrollment in education and greater participation in the formal labor force in later life.
However, despite gender parity in early education enrollments, female attendance in higher education
decreases, particularly in rural areas and for multiple reasons, including high costs. Employment status
in Uzbekistan is more positively correlated with education for women than it is for men.

Despite challenges to girls’ education, there is general understanding and support for girls pur-
suing higher education. This was often evident in wealthier households. However, where household
financial resources are limited, boys’ education typically gets prioritized. Evolving gender norms view
female education as beneficial for women’s combined future roles as wives, mothers, and employees/
small business owners, which signifies that a major values shift is under way in Uzbekistan.

Limited access to affordable and quality child care and preschool services in rural areas presents
a major barrier for women’s employment, particularly for young mothers. Without reliable, good
quality, trustworthy child care services, women are more confined to the household to care for children.
Where such services are available, inflexible employment conditions and sometimes inconvenient hours
of child care and preschool services limit women’s employment opportunities.

In Uzbekistan, access to financial services lags behind regional and global averages. The country
suffers from a low level of trust in financial institutions, particularly in rural areas. Financial inclusion is
lowest among youth and women. Some people reported having poor experiences interacting with banks
and not understanding or trusting formal banking processes. Additionally, many rural households have
insufficient collateral to qualify for loans. Even when people have bank accounts, very few keep their
savings in financial institutions.

However, many rural households access informal credit, including through traditional community
networks, which are more commonly used by women. Households tend to utilize family and friends
for loans or informal savings networks for storing money and for loans. Such informal networks report-
edly support female entrepreneurship and income-generating activities.

Microfinance schemes offer women access to credit and are available through commercial banks
and microcredit organizations (MCOs), but these microfinance products have not achieved

significant market penetration.7 Microcredit products offered through the banks have high collateral
requirements and complicated and time-consuming application procedures. They are offered on a non-
cash basis only, which limits their appeal to potential customers. The MCOs offer better conditions than
banks, but such organizations suffer from funding limitations.

Rural Uzbekistan suffers from infrastructure and centralized utilities deficit. This has negative
impacts on women’s roles and employment prospects. Rural areas suffer from the poorest access to
and quality of infrastructure (including roads and built infrastructure) and centralized utility services
(drinking water, electricity, gas, district heating). Access to centralized household utility services has a
significant impact on women’s time and labor burdens around the household, and hence their participa-
tion in the labor force. For example, women (and sometimes children) can be required to collect, decant,
and boil water for household use on a daily basis, as well as collect and manage fuels to use for heating.

Poor access to and availability of centralized utility services can adversely impact both farm and
nonfarm activities. Some female entrepreneurs reported that poor utility service limited their ability
to grow their agricultural production and nonagricultural business. Poor service increases expenses,
reduces productivity, and discourages overall business investment.

Improvements in rural community infrastructure—from child care and preschool facilities to
roads and market places—can go a long way toward improving women’s business opportunities.
Many women requested improvements to community infrastructure to help foster women’s business
opportunities. In particular, many suggested establishing multi-service centers that can house multiple
businesses run by women.



Pillar 3: Women’s Voice
Pillar 3 of the analytical framework outlines avenues and institutions through which women’s
voices can be heard. Pathways for conveying and amplifying women’s voices include the national legal
and policy environment; institutions with mandates to support women; technology; and women’s house-
holds and communities.

Uzbekistan is party to international conventions on women’s rights, and at the national level there
are provisions for gender equality. However, some major deficiencies exist in translating conventions
into law, and discrimination against women remains. Women are underrepresented in senior political
                                                                                         disaggregated
positions and retain only a minority voice in government positions at all levels. Gender-­
data collection continues to be insufficient.

A number of local institutions voice support on behalf of women. The strongest advocate is the Wom-
en’s Committee, a nongovernmental organization (NGO). The Women’s Committee contains affiliated
public institutions that promote women’s issues (including entrepreneurship) through various mediums.
It is regarded as a first point of contact for women when dealing with local authorities. Other local insti-
tutions for women’s employment and business support include the maslakhatchi (a consultant of local
self-governing body overseeing the issues of religious, spiritual and moral education; a respected, usu-
ally elderly woman); the local hokimiyat (a local government agency); employment centers (which pro-
vide employment advice and vocational training); the Business Women’s Association (which supports

enterprise and access to credit); and one-window centers (which provide government services to entre-
preneurs). However, rural women vary in their knowledge and utilization of such services.

Decentralized delivery of services, including local business development, has the potential to better
serve the needs of rural women, but more participatory approaches are required. Mahallas—citi-
zens’ local self-government bodies that serve as intermediaries between the needs of citizens and local
administrations—have a mandate to support local business development. The law also defines a number
of financing sources on which they can rely. However, in practice, mahallas suffer significant opera-
tional challenges, and hence their impact is limited. Better results may be achieved by adopting more
community-driven development (CDD) approaches.

Information and communication technologies are helping facilitate business opportunities and
efficiencies for some female entrepreneurs. Most rural women get information from more traditional
media outlets, such as television, radio, and newspapers, and get local information from mahalla com-
mittees. However, new technologies such as mobile phones are increasingly being used as sources of
information. While many rural women use mobile phones for social purposes, some female entrepre-
neurs use them for business activities.

Within a household (and a local community), women’s voices are amplified when they engage in
paid activities and contribute to household income. This is particularly the case in poorer households,
where a second income is relatively more valuable to a household budget. Furthermore, women’s voices
on critical development issues—such as education—are strengthened when they earn income, as it is
reportedly one of the first areas where their income is directed.

 1.1 Background8
 Despite maintaining strong economic growth in recent years, Uzbekistan faces some significant
 demographic and structural challenges; effectively engaging women in the economy is one of them.
 Uzbekistan’s strong economic growth masks significant challenges, which include a predominantly rural
 population (64 percent);9 a growing youth bulge (28.5 percent of the population was less than 15 years
 old in 2015, and an estimated 1 million young people enter the labor market annually);10 and women’s
 limited participation in the formal economy. Additionally, the two largest recipients of migrant workers
 from Uzbekistan—Russia and Kazakhstan—have seen their economies shrink; hence, many Uzbeks
 have returned home.11 The commitment to modernize the agriculture sector—­    including the cotton sector,
 which involves large numbers of women—will negatively impact rural women’s employment options.

 Slightly more than 50 percent of Uzbekistan’s continuously growing population12 are women; how-
 ever, their participation in the formal labor market is limited. According to international survey data,
 women have lower employment rates (38 percent) compared to men (69 percent),13 suggesting that there

     ers in Russia has fallen by more than 22 percent over the past two years (Migration Policy Centre 2013).

     2000 and 2015, the population increase was 1.2 percent to 1.7 percent annually (World Bank n.d.).

are fewer labor market opportunities for them, along with other structural and cultural constraints. In
rural Uzbekistan, where a larger share of the population still resides,14 women’s labor market participa-
tion is even lower.

There is a demonstrated link between gender equality and improved economic indicators. Women’s
greater access to and control over assets helps protect households from macroeconomic shocks and from
falling into poverty. It increases positive adaptation within households by enabling women to readily
respond to unforeseen and changing circumstances.15 At the national level, higher investment in women
and girls, along with increased access to assets, contributes to higher levels of economic growth.16 Wom-
en’s involvement in the labor market improves standards of living and gross domestic product (GDP) and
boosts economic growth—investments in women have high returns.

International evidence suggests that women and girls are often exposed to a range of gender
barriers—from restrictive gender norms and roles to unbalanced power relations17—all of which
­
can undermine their capacity to make decisions about their own lives and act on them. In addition
to reduced labor market opportunities, women are often held back by many societal, cultural, institu-
tional and other constraints. Hence, livelihoods programming may be an appropriate approach to exam-
ine norms that determine women’s ability to participate in and influence decision-making processes.

Women’s livelihood roles and responsibilities tend to lie in the informal employment sector, with
little or no remuneration18 or formal recognition. When working in formal roles, women are more
likely to have low-paying or part-time work. Thus, households that rely solely on women’s earnings—as
is the case in female-headed households—tend to have lower household incomes. Many women who
work on their family garden plots (tomorkas), on small farms, and in their households typically self-
identify as unemployed and are considered as such by others.

Additionally, limited access to credit may be a major constraint for women in starting or devel-
oping business opportunities, particularly in rural areas. Credit constraints often take the form of
collateral requirements and high interest rates that limit access to finance. There have been several initia-
tives introduced by the GoU to expand women’s access to credit through microfinance institutions, credit
unions, and commercial banks. However, few studies have conducted systematic field research into the
experiences and bottlenecks related to providing microfinance services to women in rural areas.

Women’s ability to work has been disproportionately affected by postindependence socioeco-
nomic and cultural changes in Uzbekistan’s transition to a market-based economy. Contributing
factors have included (1) a weakening of social protection systems, such as the decline of public child
care services, which constrains women’s ability to work outside the home; and (2) the redistribution of
state ownership, which concentrated many income-generating resources among men, thereby restrict-
ing the nature and extent of female entrepreneurship.19 Recently released Central Asia country profiles
on land rights and gender highlight that, although international gender equality agreements have been
adopted, “women . . . have been widely overlooked by . . . land reforms and redistribution programs.

This, combined with women’s limited access to paid employment, has negatively affected household
food security and also weakened their decision-making power within their families and communities.”20

Due to the significant decline in the quality of infrastructure and utility services, women in rural
Uzbekistan often have greater time and labor burdens to provide clean water, fuel, and heating
sources for their households. Additionally, formal employment opportunities for women are more
scarce in rural areas than urban ones. Studies conducted by the World Bank21 indicate that women and
girls in rural areas and small urban settings spend more time and effort on chores to sustain essential
services in households, such as securing potable water and energy, than women in larger urban centers.
Such chores limit their opportunities for education and employment in areas that already have fewer
formal employment options compared to major urban settings. Available formal and informal employ-
ment in lagging rural areas in Uzbekistan mostly involves manual work on large-scale farms; under such
circumstances, gender disparities may be high.

Importantly, the dynamics of employment in Uzbekistan’s rural areas are being transformed by
the modernization of various economic sectors. Modernization calls for the mechanization of pro-
cesses that previously required manual labor, which significantly impacts women, particularly in the cot-
ton sector.22 Mechanization eliminates the need for low-skilled manual labor, which is typically provided
by women—this is already having significant impacts on women’s employment opportunities across
large rural areas.23 Gradual relaxations of some crop quota systems may also impact what is grown and
what opportunities exist for women.

Both barriers to and opportunities for women’s employment in rural areas are changing; how-
ever, the degree to which this is occurring, the coping mechanisms employed by women, and the
impacts on them are largely unknown. Disaggregated data on gender issues in Uzbekistan is scarce,
and consumer experiences are not systematically collected or integrated into policy development. The
lack of gender-disaggregated data makes it difficult to understand the plight of women and the coping
mechanisms they use to overcome inequities. Additionally, women have limited opportunities to com-
municate their conditions to policy makers, which makes it difficult to design and implement effective
reform measures.

The limited evidence base on women’s employment indicates there are significant gender barriers
in Uzbekistan, particularly in rural areas. Further investigation into the dynamics of these barriers is
warranted to improve social and economic development.



1.2 Objective
The objective of this study is to examine how gender influences opportunities and risks in accessing
livelihoods in rural Uzbekistan. It seeks to identify the constraints to and opportunities for increased
socioeconomic resilience among rural women in Uzbekistan, with the potential to inform livelihoods

programming. Global evidence suggests that women and girls play a critical and potentially transforma-
tive role in improving household and community livelihoods.24 However, rural women in Uzbekistan
purportedly continue to face numerous obstacles that limit their time, mobility, access to and control
over resources, and decision-making power. Negative coping mechanisms hinder not only women’s and
girls’ prospects for creating sustainable livelihoods but those of their households and communities, too.

Using Sen’s capability approach,25 this study aims to understand the distinct aspirations, oppor-
tunities, and barriers for women in income-generating activities. It focuses on the supply-side chal-
lenges faced by rural women and enablers of women’s work, such as low demand for labor and a lack of
formal employment opportunities.

To achieve the objective, the study team (1) reviewed literature on the international experience of
women’s role in the labor market and economies, (2) collected evidence from the field on the barri-
ers to and enablers for improving livelihood opportunities and the empowerment of socially excluded
women in rural Uzbekistan, and (3) assessed statistical data on women’s participation in various sectors
in Uzbekistan. The study offers an opportunity to strengthen stakeholders’ discussion of the current con-
straints faced by low-income rural women in improving their livelihoods and to generate consensus on
how to improve their situation.

The study assesses constraints and opportunities for low-income rural women in Uzbekistan to (1)
improve their capacity to engage in productive employment, including self-employment activities; (2)
access important inputs for becoming more productive, such as education, credit, land, and labor market
information and networks; and (3) strengthen their ability to participate in local-level decision making.
An analytical framework was devised to structure the study (outlined in the subsequent section).

                                           and Methodology




 2.1  Analytical Framework
 This study is based on the premise that a gender-inclusive approach should be an integral goal
 of livelihood support in Uzbekistan. The capability approach provides the conceptual framework for
 analysis.26 First, it embeds women’s work within their context—their household, the community, and
 the macroeconomic environment, shifting the evaluative space to that of women’s capabilities. Second,
 it explicitly acknowledges human diversity—such as race, age, ethnicity, sexuality, and geographical
 location—rather than assuming that all women have the same utility function or are influenced in the
 ­
 same way by similar personal, social, and environment characteristics. Third, and most importantly, it
 considers women’s economic empowerment (and gender equality more generally) both as an end in itself
 and as a means to an end.

 A capability approach suggests that gender equality in work does not imply that women and men
 should make the same choices; rather, they should have an equal range of choices and equal capa-
 bilities to act on those choices. Ultimately then, closing the gender gap in labor outcomes and entrepre-
 neurship will rest on enhancing women’s capabilities and closing the gap between their aspirations and
 capabilities.

 This study employs an analytical framework focused on three pillars of outcomes. It uses women’s
 capabilities as the central lens and employs analyses focused on the mutually reinforcing nature
 of those outcomes. The framework is adapted from the 2012 World Development Report on Gender
 Equality and Development,27 which was focused on three pillars: (1) physical and human capital, which
 includes access to quality health, education, land, technology, infrastructure, and finance; (2) access to

livelihoods/income-generating activities; and (3) voice,28 which includes the ability to make one’s own
choices within the household, community, and public sphere (see Figure 1).29

The framework pillars support increasing agency among women to achieve their full productive
potential. Agency refers to “the capacity to make decisions about one’s own life, and act on them to
achieve a desired outcome, free of violence, retribution, or fear.”30 Strengthening women’s intrahouse-
hold bargaining power, their control over decision making, and their autonomy in terms of how they
use their time and income increases their agency.31 Improving women’s agency and voice are mutually
reinforcing.

Elements of each pillar can be enhanced independently, but their interlinkages mean that some
elements may build on others. For example, elements of the physical and human capital pillar—such
                                                                      opportunities—play an important
as access to education and information about markets, jobs, and other ­
role in facilitating and expanding women’s learning and economic opportunities and increasing their
agency and voice. Improving women’s access to information can improve their livelihood opportuni-
ties. Research on past livelihood interventions has shown that one way to promote this is to reestablish

2.2 Methodology
This study’s methodological approach is based on the analytical framework outlined above and
employs a mixed-methods approach (qualitative and quantitative methodologies), drawing on pri-
mary and secondary data sources. The methodology was designed to understand the distinct aspi-
rations, opportunities, and barriers for women in rural Uzbekistan who engage in income-­     generating
activities. Investigations were structured around the three pillars of the analytical framework (see Fig-
ure 1); namely, physical and human capital, access to livelihoods/income-generating activities, and
voice. The study draws on primary qualitative data and secondary quantitative data and includes a desk-
top review of donor and government experiences on women’s economic empowerment.34

Secondary quantitative data were derived from two sources: (1) a 2013 CALISS study and (2) offi-
cial data from the State Committee on Statistics, analyzed by the Scientific Research Center on
Employment and Labor Safety under the Ministry of Labor (referred to hereafter as the Center). The
2013 CALISS35 study (a World Bank–GIZ collaboration) focused on jobs, skills, and migration in
Uzbekistan;36 it identified gender-specific differences in labor market access and outcomes.37 CALISS
data analysis on women’s labor force participation and access to financial services was undertaken by
the World Bank study team.

A technical working group composed of representatives from key national institutions was estab-
lished to help analyze national policies related to women’s economic empowerment and to access offi-
cial statistical data. It included representatives from the Ministry of Labor, the Women’s Committee, the
Federation of Trade Unions, and the Center. Representatives provided comments throughout the study
process, from concept note development to data analysis. The Center was commissioned to prepare a
background report—based on an analysis of national data and policy documents—on the labor market,
national employment legislation, business development, and employment stimulation programs. The
Center conducted expert interviews when needed to get clarity or explanations of the collected informa-
tion. The World Bank task team conducted trainings and consultations38 on qualitative research methods
for representatives from key national think tanks.

Primary qualitative data was collected from 28 FGDs and 44 KIIs that took place in four regions.
A total of 296 people participated: 203 women and 93 men. Sampling was undertaken in Jizzakh,

Kashkadarya, Namangan, and Karakalpakstan (see Figure 2), based on characteristics such as economic
development, female labor force participation, and agricultural land types. Two factors used in village
selection were its distance from a raion (district) center and the availability of water resources (hypoth-
esized as contributing factors to economic activity, nonfarm labor opportunities, and agricultural produc-
tion). FGDs and KIIs were conducted by a local consulting firm in conjunction with a World Bank study
team and focused on women’s perspectives. Annex 1 outlines the methods used in the primary qualitative
data sampling and collection.

The findings of this study are limited in the context within which they can be interpreted and
applied. The availability of and access to information is limited in Uzbekistan, and data that is available
is often not gender disaggregated. Study resources limited sampling to four regions; hence, findings are
illustrative rather than representative on a national scale. There was also limited analysis of the supply
and value chain for employment, so study findings are embedded in the local context.

Findings were strengthened by collaboration with national counterparts. This collaboration provided
deeper insight into national perspectives and offered varying views on data analysis and interpretation.
While coordinating a large team required additional efforts and caused delays, such an approach helped
build partnership and support for the study among local policy makers. Consequently, recommendations
will hopefully resonate more loudly with national counterparts and strengthen policy dialogue.

Study findings are presented in a synthesized format. They draw on all data sources to create a flow-
ing narrative for the reader. The study’s main contribution comes from its collection and analysis of
primary qualitative data, which is presented independently or as a supplement to secondary quantitative
data. Secondary data sources are explicitly referenced, while primary qualitative data are not.

 Pillar 1 of the analytical framework provides insight into Uzbekistan’s labor market, with an
 emphasis on access and prospects for rural women. It includes an analysis of current livelihood strat-
 egies for women, including barriers to and aspirations for income generation.



 3.1  Uzbekistan’s Formal Labor Market: Gender Disparities39
 In recent years Uzbekistan made progress in decreasing gender disparities in its labor market.
 However, there is further potential to increase women’s economic activity. According to the State
 Committee on Statistics, from 1991 to 2015 the gender gap in Uzbekistan’s labor market decreased. The
 share of economically active men and women40 (employed and unemployed) decreased from 1991 to
 2015; however, over that same period the gender gap (the difference in men’s and women’s participation
 in the labor market) in the level of economic activity decreased from 16.4 percent to 7.5 percent (see
 Figure 3). In 2015 women accounted for 48.2 percent of the total working population and 45.7 percent of
 the employed population, suggesting that access to the labor market is becoming more equal.

International survey data show lower employment rates for women than the official statistics.41
According to the CALISS data (see Figure 4), women have lower employment rates (38 percent) com-
pared to men (69 percent),42 with a large share of women not even looking for employment (this includes
both homemakers and discouraged workers). At the same time, the bottom wealth quintiles for both
men and women (see Figure 4) show a larger share of those not employed (including unemployed and
inactive), highlighting the importance of employment opportunities for household welfare. A larger
share of employment of the upper quintiles is in the public sector (comprising the state administration
and state-owned enterprises), whereas working individuals from the bottom quintiles are more likely
to be in the noncorporate sector, which include small-scale service sectors, individual farmers, and the
self-employed.43

Several employment sectors exhibit a strong gender dimension. According to the State Committee
on Statistics, women constitute the majority of workers in the health care, physical culture, sports, and
social security sectors and the education, culture, arts, science, and science services sectors, representing
82 percent and 72 percent in each of those sectors, respectively (see Figure 5).44 On the other hand, men


41	   There are some discrepancies between nationally derived and internationally derived employment statistics,
      partly related to nomenclature definitions and methodological approaches. For example, some differences can
      be attributed to contrasting age classifications. Working ages in international assessments are 16–64, while in
      Uzbekistan they are 16–55 (for women) and 16–60 (for men). On employment criteria, the World Bank and the
      ILO consider employment as work performed for a minimum of 1 hour during an assessment period. Mean-
      while, Uzbekistan’s State Committee on Statistics considers only those who work at least 10 hours per week
      to be employed, and the Ministry of Labor uses 2 hours per week for the definition. While nationally derived
      statistics report that the national women’s employment rate in 2015 was close to 62 percent, internationally coor-
      dinated assessments suggest lower women’s employment rates and greater gender gaps in employment rates.

are most strongly represented in the construction and transport and communications sectors, where they
make up 92 percent and 89 percent of workers, respectively (see Figure 6).45 Recent employment trends
suggest that women are becoming more active in certain sectors such as agriculture and forestry, trade,
and public catering (see Figure 5).

There remain significant differences between genders in average income levels that are often
associated with the sectors in which they work (see Figure 7). According to the State Committee on
Statistics, the sectors in which men are most frequently employed (construction, transport, and commu-
nications) have respective average incomes between 32 percent and 42 percent higher than the national
average. In contrast, the sectors with the highest female labor participation (health care, physical culture,
sports, social security, education, culture, arts, science, and science services) have respective average
incomes that are 71 percent and 80 percent of the national average.46 Other labor-intensive sectors (such
as textiles, clothing, knitwear, and the food industry) in which women are more commonly employed
also pay lower wages. In sum, women tend to be employed in labor-intensive sectors that typically offer
lower wages, while men dominate sectors with high capital investment and, as a result, higher incomes.

The differences in the choice of employment sector tend to be driven by wage differences between
sectors and are reinforced through cultural norms and expectations regarding what are appropri-
ate professions for men and women. Qualitative fieldwork suggested that women are tracked into or
expected to take up professions/jobs that will also benefit their families or communities. For example, a
woman with a medical or teaching degree can also use her skills to raise her children, tend to the sick and
elderly in her home, or earn informal income by providing services to her neighbors. The sectors that are
considered female domains remain as such for both financial and cultural reasons, which creates a cycle
of structural discrimination. However, as evidenced from the qualitative fieldwork and consultations

but rather as a norm and cultural practice.



3.2 Government Policies for Labor Market Activation
     (with focus on women)47
The nonstate, noncorporate sector is where most new jobs in Uzbekistan are created. Due to the
high population growth rate in the past 10 years, the State Committee on Statistics reports that the share
of working-age people in the overall population increased from 49.1 percent in 2005 to 61.4 percent in
2015.48 The nonstate sector employs the majority of workers, and its share has been steadily increasing
over the past decade—from 77.2 percent of all workers in 2005 to 82.1 percent in 2015. In the nonstate
sector the majority of new jobs were in the noncorporate sector—that is, in enterprises and activities that
do not require the creation of a legal entity. These include individual self-employment (trade, transporta-
tion, seasonal work), work on commercial and dekhan farms, and home-based work. According to the
State Committee on Statistics, the percentage of those employed in the noncorporate sector, out of the
total number of employed in the nonstate sector, has increased in the past decade from 78.9 percent in
2005 to 87.4 percent in 2015. In the noncorporate sector the majority of workers are self-employed—65.4
percent in 2015.49

State programs for employment activation emphasize policies and measures to stimulate indi-
vidual entrepreneurship. Government policies to stimulate individual entrepreneurship include the
following:

1.	 Stimulation of home-based labor. According to legislation,50 home-based labor programs tar-
    get rural areas, and particularly women, as well as other social groups that require assistance for
    employment. Work is carried out at home and on a flexible basis, but the employees hold official
    employment contracts, with contributions paid toward pension and other social insurance pay-
    ments. The enterprises that employ home-based workers do not pay taxes on the costs of equipment
    used; they currently do not have to pay social fund contributions. Home-based work is prevalent in
    the garment industry, silk production and processing, electronics, telecommunications, and some
    other service-based industries. Over the past five years, 513,000 new jobs for home-based workers
    were created.51
2.	 Support to family enterprises and crafts.52 Local authorities are required to stimulate creation of
    family enterprises and crafts through the following measures: providing premises for workshops and
    shops, for selling products; levying taxes on the sales of crafts (as approved by the Cabinet of Min-
    isters); providing assistance in sourcing materials, providing equipment, organizing fairs, reducing
    the number of inspections; and facilitating connections to utilities, applying private dwelling tariffs
    for utilities for the premises used by the family enterprises, and levying the requirement to register
    them as commercial property. In the past five years, over 124,500 new jobs were created in the fam-
    ily enterprises and over 186,700 in crafts.53
3.	 State public works programs.54 These include temporary jobs—which do not require professional
    qualifications—for citizens who are officially registered as unemployed. The decision to conduct
    public works is made by regional and district administrations, with financing provided by the
    employers, as well as local budgets and the State Fund for Employment Facilitation. According to
    the Ministry of Labor, in 2015 only 8,000 jobs were created through public works.55
4.	 Local socioeconomic development programs. Investment programs aimed at creating, expand-
    ing, and modernizing industrial production, services, and processing capacities in the regions of
    Uzbekistan contribute to job creation and are therefore accounted for in the State Program on Job
    Creation.

Legislation governing labor relations in Uzbekistan includes a range of protective measures and
guaranties; while these help protect women’s labor rights, they also reinforce gender stereotypes that
suggest it is more cost-effective for employers to hire men. Protective measures include prohibiting

women from being employed in jobs with unfavorable labor conditions;56 putting limitations on shift,
overtime work, and work-related travel; protecting the rights of pregnant women and mothers with chil-
dren under three years old;57 and instituting regulations related to maternity leave, among others. Addi-
tionally, quotas for employment of social vulnerable groups exist for all organizations with more than
20 employees. Employment of single mothers and women with more than two children is prioritized.
While such protection measures contribute to protecting women’s right to employment, they also create
a perception among employers that the hidden costs of employing women could be too high, which could
contribute to a preference for employing men over women.

Seasonal agricultural work offers employment opportunities for rural women, but regulation
needs to be approved.58 According to the Ministry of Labor, in 2015 more than 837,000 people
(6.1 percent of the economically active population) took part in seasonal agricultural work. Addition-
ally, 1,869,000 people employed in agriculture through dekhan farms are also likely to be affected by
seasonal fluctuations in demand for their labor. The most significant seasonal spike in labor demand
occurs for cotton picking, which largely features manual labor. Earlier research59 indicates that for
rural women, cotton picking constitutes 12.4 percent of annual income on average, and for low-income
families this figure can be as high as 30 percent. At the same time, seasonal employment is not sepa-
rately defined in national labor legislation, so labor relations between the employers and employees
are not regulated; the conditions of employment and dismissal, overtime payments, medical insurance,
and pension contributions are not defined; and there are no contributions to social protection schemes.
Information about seasonal employment opportunities is not always readily available, and intermedi-
ary services between employers requiring seasonal labor and potential employees are ad hoc and not
institutionalized.



3.3  Livelihood Strategies for Rural Women: Agricultural Activities
In rural Uzbekistan women are often engaged in the agricultural sector, but for little or no remu-
neration. Qualitative study results confirm that full-time income-generating opportunities in the agri-
cultural sector are limited for women compared to men. FGD and KII respondents stated that most
opportunities in the agricultural sector for women were performing daily-wage labor on farms, working
on a household plot (tomorka), and/or growing secondary crops on land rented from a farmer.

In all rural areas sampled in the qualitative study, women typically reported earning lower wages
as day laborers, compared to men. However, women could earn more than men as day laborers pick-
ing cotton.60 Unskilled rural women’s daily wages for harvesting and weeding crops in the sample areas


56	   The list of sectors and occupations where employment of women is prohibited due to unfavorable labor condi-
      tions was approved by the Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Health in 1999. It requires revision in light of the
      latest developments in the sectors, including measures on improving health and safety.
57	   Such additional protection measures for pregnant women and women with children under the age of three
      include prohibition to refuse employment and introduce a probation period, prosecution of employers in cases of
      unfair dismissal, alteration of duties to omit negative influence of the working environment on women’s health,
      registration with unemployment services, and priority right to request and extend the period of leave of absence,
      including maternity leave.

ranged from 10,000 to 20,000 UZS, compared to 15,000 to 30,000 UZS for rural men. Women reported
that men earn higher day rates because they undertake tasks that are considered more difficult, such as
carrying heavy items and doing work that requires some qualifications (such as operating machinery
and watering crops). Additionally, women reported that more full-time and part-time labor opportuni-
ties were available for men, and hence fewer men were available for day labor. However, women did
report higher daily earnings than men for cotton picking, as incomes were based solely on kilograms
of cotton picked, and women were more motivated to work harder because they have fewer income-
generating opportunities in other areas. Additionally, cotton picking is traditionally viewed as women’s
work. It is estimated that around 80 percent (and in some regions, up to 90 percent) of cotton pickers
are women.61

Evidence from the qualitative study suggests that the most common farm-based work activities
for rural women—that are both socially and personally well regarded—are tending tomorkas and
engaging in small farm production activities, such as poultry and dairy. Tomorkas are often wom-
en’s responsibility and can play an important role in providing fresh food and an additional source of
income (see Photo 1). Many rural households have 0.06 to 0.15 hectares (ha) close to the house where
residents can grow fruits, vegetables, flowers, and seedlings. Some households install greenhouses in
these plots. While many products are for the household’s consumption, surplus products can be sold
locally. Women are often responsible for tending the tomorkas and selling surplus products. According
to female respondents, a woman can earn around 3 million to 5 million UZS per season with 0.10 ha
of land.

Two factors emerged from the qualitative study that seem to determine whether women earn
income from tomorkas: (1) availability of irrigation water and (2) distance to market. For example,

women in more arid areas with difficult access to irrigation water reported that they were not able to
grow sufficient products for surplus sale, while women with more access to irrigation reported greater
surpluses. Also, women from remote villages reported difficulties in selling products, due to the low
availability of public transportation to get to markets and the expenses associated with travel.

In addition to tending tomorkas, rural women may be involved in home-based agricultural busi-
ness activities, such as keeping livestock and poultry and growing secondary crops on rented lands.
However, such tasks are often considered to be part of their domestic duties rather than an income con-
tribution to the household, despite the importance of such activities and their contribution to household
member welfare (see Photo 2).

While there do not appear to be formal or legal barriers for women to become farmers in Uzbeki-
stan, the qualitative study shows that the clear majority of farm owners are male, as are most
full-time farm employees. Men are typically hired for full-time farming roles, such as mechanics, driv-
ers, accountants and mirobs (irrigation canal superintendents). At the same time, women are hired as
unskilled daily-wage laborers when needed. The reasons farmers give for why men are hired full-time
include the need to be in a field most of the day and that men have the skills required to operate or repair
machinery.

Both male and female FGD respondents expressed reluctance and concern about women engag-
ing in some farming roles. These were chiefly related to issues such as safety and the possibility that
women would interact with males outside the household. However, women expressed strong interest in
working full-time in some agricultural subsectors, such as horticulture, greenhouses, livestock, and food
processing. Most male FGD respondents expressed concern about female household members working
full-time on farms because they would be outside of the house for much of the day, work with other
males, and need to attend meetings at night. Many female FGD respondents expressed a low desire to
become farmers, due to the need to participate in male-dominated meetings, work late in the fields, and

learn to drive a car, and because there are few examples of women successfully fulfilling such roles.
However, women were interested in working in some agricultural subsectors full-time, such as horti-
culture, greenhouses, livestock, and processing agricultural products. Participants in a female FGD in
Karakalpakstan were interested in the prospect of women owning farms and thus being in the position to
hire other women as full-time workers.

While female-owned farms are not the norm, cases of successful female farmers who earned more
profits than their male counterparts were reported in every sampled raion. Successful female farm-
ers were purportedly an inspiration to other women, and the recent development of horticulture has
seemingly increased women’s interest in farming. Successful female farmers who were interviewed did
not report formal or informal gender discrimination.

A significant barrier to rural women engaging in and/or expanding farm-based income-­          generating
activities is limited access to physical resources (chiefly land and water). Qualitative findings sug-
gested that for agricultural activities of greatest interest to women, access to land is a major barrier to
livestock and poultry raising and horticulture, while access to water for irrigation is a major barrier for
horticulture and greenhouses. Other issues included low access to and the high cost of livestock feed and
low access to and low quality of electricity and gas to pump water and for greenhouses.



3.4 Livelihood Strategies for Rural Women:
     Nonagricultural Activities
Nonfarm opportunities for women are limited in rural areas, but home-based enterprises are
increasing. The qualitative study confirms that women in rural areas have limited opportunities for full-
time nonfarm employment. Options for formal full-time employment are mostly limited to state-based
organizations; there are few opportunities to work full-time in the private sector. In the rural areas sam-
pled, women represented 40 percent to 70 percent of employees of state organizations, such as schools,
clinics, colleges, and mahalla offices. Rural women reported that employment with state organizations
was highly sought after because of the relatively high incomes one can earn (300,000 to 1 million UZS,
monthly) and the fact that the public holds these jobs in high regard. However, there are generally only
a limited number of positions available (how many depends on the number of state organizations in the
area), and preference is typically given to more highly educated applicants. More remote and smaller
villages that have no private sector may have particularly few full-time nonagricultural roles, especially
for women.

Beyond state-based employment options, FGDs reported that women engage in small-scale entre-
preneurial activities. Nonfarm income-generating activities for rural women include baking, cooking,
sewing, tailoring, beauty salon work, hairdressing, work in retail stores, dairy production, fruit and veg-
etable processing, carpet making, copying and printing documents, craft activities, and shoe production
(see Photo 3). Given household duties and the responsibility to care for children and elderly house-
hold members, it is purportedly more common for women over age 35–40 to seek out entrepreneurial
activities.

The most common part-time, nonfarm employment for rural women is reported to be tailoring/
sewing and baking/cooking. Rural women reported that the form of home-based, nonfarm income-
generating activity in which they most frequently engage is tailoring/sewing (see Photo 4). It typically
requires up-front capital expenditure (for a sewing machine, material, and other accessories) and some
training (via college or learning from experienced women, either free or for a fee). Women may access

capital via personal savings, household savings, informal loans, and more rarely, formal loans. Products
can be sold directly to community members or via markets. Some women produce bakery goods, prepare
salads, and make traditional dishes in their homes and sell them directly to neighbors, at local markets,
or for special events (such as weddings).

The qualitative study revealed that part-time, home-based employment provides rural women
some degree of independence and flexibility, somewhat reliable incomes, and products that their
household can use. Women engaged in part-time sewing activities reported incomes of between 8,000
and 30,000 UZS per day, which is roughly equivalent to daily labor rates for women in the agricultural
sector. During wedding season, daily incomes for sewing may reach 50,000 UZS. Male respondents
were generally supportive of part-time, home-based income-generating activities because their female
household members can do housework at the same time. In some wealthier rural areas, beyond sewing/
tailoring and baking/cooking, there was a reported increase in demand for salon-based beauty services
such as hairdressing and makeup.

Women who participated in FGDs in remote villages expressed less interest in engaging in nonag-
ricultural sector activities than women in villages closer to raion centers. This was due to several
factors that influence small business opportunities. Women in remote villages identified barriers to par-
ticipating in small business activities, including fewer customers in their villages who demand products;
greater distances and more difficulty reaching markets to sell their products; and poorer infrastructure
services (e.g., electricity, water) with which to produce quality products. Additionally, small businesses
that operate in remote areas often rely on middle persons to supply materials and connect to markets,
which adds production costs and deters some women. Conversely, women in villages that are closer to
raion centers preferred nonfarm income options because products can easily be sold in local markets,
and the fact that there are local employers in the area means that local women have more money to spend
on services. There are also female-run businesses that can provide advice and/or inspiration to others.

Many rural women expressed interest in participating in nonfarm income-generating activities.
Furthermore, many communicated a preference to combine farm-related income-generating activities
with domestic responsibilities and/or other nonfarm income-generating activities. Most FGD partici-
pants across all sampled regions (and ranging in age from young to elderly) communicated interest in
engaging in nonfarm activities that have potential to earn income and that can be conducted from home
or in small workshops with other neighborhood women. At the same time, many rural women seek to
remain engaged in farm activities such as raising livestock and poultry, growing fruits and vegetables in
tomorkas and greenhouses, and undertaking horticulture. Many respondents are interested in combining
both, in varying capacities.

Incomes and expenditures tend to be highly seasonal in rural areas. Women reported that their
incomes take on greatest significance at the end of summer and during the winter months. In late sum-
mer, households spend money on food and fuel supplies for the winter months and purchase school
supplies for their children. During winter and early spring, employment opportunities (and incomes,
particularly for farming roles) are more scarce, while household expenditures on heating, food, and
seeds (for spring planting) are high. Any income generated by women during these periods constitutes an
important contribution to a household’s budget. Figure 8 illustrates household demand for loans (during
periods of low income and high expense) and reliance on market produce.

3.5  Barriers to Women’s Livelihood Opportunities
Barriers to rural women’s entrepreneurship and employment are evident and range from house-
hold responsibilities to capacity and access limitations. Barriers reported in qualitative fieldwork
included, but were not limited to, (1) expectations to shoulder the burden of household responsibilities;
(2) the need to manage household affairs while men migrate for labor; (3) capacity and skill deficiencies
(particularly where educational opportunities are not promoted for women); and (4) lack of access to
financial resources.

Women’s domestic responsibilities are a major constraint to employment opportunities. Women
perform most of the domestic duties in Uzbek rural households. Many female FGD respondents reported
spending three to six hours per day collecting water, preparing and cooking food, baking bread, clean-
ing, managing indoor heating, working in tomorkas, and caring for children and the elderly. Duties vary
seasonally, with more time and effort spent in tomorkas and collecting water during the summer, and
more spent on indoor heating and cooking in winter. With regard to age and position within a household,
younger women (kelin) tend to bear the greatest burden of domestic chores, while some other women
may have more opportunities to engage in income-generating activities.

Interviews with female entrepreneurs revealed that women must balance their domestic respon-
sibilities with potential income-generating activities. In such cases they often rely on support for
domestic tasks, which comes from other household members or paid assistance.

    “My day starts at 5 a.m. to milk our cow, boil milk, and cook breakfast for my children. After send-
    ing my oldest son to school, I sweep the yard and help my mother-in-law cook lunch. I then go to
    work from 8:30 a.m., until 4 or 5 p.m., during which time I sew clothes and supervise my employ-
    ees. When I return home, I cook dinner for our family and my in-laws. After dinner, I bake goods
    for breakfast the following day.”

Chapter 3  Pillar 1: Women’s Access to Livelihoods in Uzbekistan



Men’s labor migration can also adversely impact women’s opportunities. FGDs and KIIs suggest
that the vast majority of international labor migrants are temporary, are male, and travel to Russia and
Kazakhstan.62 The qualitative findings reported that most migrant workers are men, typically between
the ages of 20 and 40. Women reportedly represent less than 10 percent of migrant workers in sampled
areas. In cases where both parents work internationally, children tend to be cared for by their grand-
parents. Respondents noted the generally negative effect that such a disjointed family dynamic tends
to have (such as lower school performance and behavioral challenges). While women who return from
international work reportedly tend to receive less respect from their home village, households that have
one or two members who work internationally typically save enough to buy a house or establish a small
business in their home village.

FGDs revealed that in cases where the husband works internationally and the wife remains in the
home village, the burden on the woman can be high. FGD respondents reported that many male labor
migrants remain away from their home village for 8 to 10 months out of the year. During this time, the
woman typically assumes responsibility for all domestic duties, including those that a husband is usually
responsible for, including farming duties. Furthermore, in cases where remittances are not received for
several months or not at all, women must seek income locally.

       “One woman from our village had to bake pies at home and sell them in the local market while her
       husband worked abroad and could not send her any money.”
                                                             —Female FGD participant, Jizzakh Oblast

Some FGD respondents reported that migrant labor activities can cause household tension and
that such challenges, coupled with macroeconomic trends, have resulted in a recent shift toward
men seeking job opportunities more locally. The challenges of a household member living away for
extended periods each year can cause marital and other social challenges. This, coupled with drops in
currency values in Russia and Kazakhstan, reduces demand for labor. In addition, stricter migratory
working legislation has prompted some workers to return to their local areas to seek employment in sec-
tors such as construction, service, retail, and livestock, or to invest in their own small business.

FGD participants reported capacity challenges for many rural women, particularly in low- and
middle-income households. These include a lack of technical skills, low financial capacity, and low
business (and finance) literacy. In terms of financing, many women highlighted a lack of capital with
which to purchase equipment and materials for income-generating activities and a limited knowledge of
available forms of credit and application procedures. Some respondents also communicated a low confi-
dence in their ability to repay loans.

Other barriers to rural women engaging in and/or expanding nonfarm income-generating activi-
ties are reportedly a lack of access to financial and business resources and reliable energy sup-
plies. Qualitative findings suggested that for most nonfarm activities, access to financial and business
literacy, training, equipment, and credit were the major barriers. Respondents highlighted the importance
of accessing information about new technologies. Poor-quality energy supplies (gas and electricity) were
also cited as limiting many nonfarm entrepreneurial activities. More activity-specific issues included
training (for baking and sewing), access to land (to process fruits and vegetables and produce dairy prod-
ucts), and access to commercial premises (for beauty salon and retail store work).



62	   Cases of husband and wife migrant workers were reported, with mixed results in terms of community status and
      disposable income.

Similarly, some women reported restrictions on their mobility outside of the household and village,
which limits some working opportunities. Women engaged in income-generating activities may need
to travel within and outside of their village to meet with clients, deliver orders, purchase materials, and
sell items in markets. In FGDs women aged 35 or older reported no restrictions on movement inside
and outside of their village. Restrictions on movements are reportedly stricter for younger women (e.g.,
recent college graduates and young wives), who may not be permitted by parents or parents-in-law to
travel far outside the house or village, which negatively impacts their income-­ generating capacities.



3.6  Norms and Attitudes Regarding Female Entrepreneurship
Attitudes and norms toward female entrepreneurship and employment are evolving. Evidence from
FGDs and KIIs suggests that (1) formal barriers to (female) entrepreneurial activities are waning; and
(2) female interest in pursuing entrepreneurial activities is increasing. Both women and key informants
reported a reduction in formal barriers to entrepreneurial activities in rural areas.

A number of factors can be drawn from the qualitative study that seem to contribute to the variety
of income-generating activities available to women. These include women’s personal preferences
and skill level, as well as attitudes toward female employment among both household members and
the broader community. For example, a job with a government organization is one of women’s most
highly desired positions and is also highly respected in the community. In terms of inspiration, many
women expressed interest in learning from other women who had managed to successfully establish a
business—women want other female entrepreneurial role models. Availability of different types of jobs
contributes to shaping views of their value and worth (see Table 1).

Qualitative findings suggest that female entrepreneurship is a driver of female employment oppor-
tunities and a contributing factor to changing attitudes about female employment—which could

potentially represent a virtuous cycle. Female entrepreneurs tend to establish businesses in sectors
such as cooking/baking, sewing/tailoring, beauty salons, food processing, carpet making, and other areas
in which female workers are needed (and often attracted to). Female entrepreneurs reportedly help other
women learn new skills, often in exchange for a small fee or to support women from lower-income
households. Female entrepreneurs also often serve as an inspiration to other women by demonstrating
that women can be paid for their work. Finally, working women may spend less time on domestic duties
and pay other women to do sewing, baking, cooking, and other such tasks for them, which creates addi-
tional demand for female-based services.

Evidence from the study suggests that the most desirable forms of employment for rural
women—and which other household members and the broader community deem acceptable—
are state government roles and small-scale entrepreneurial and home production activities. It
was confirmed that rural women have a strong interest in working for state organizations and private
small-scale enterprise activities (e.g., production, service, retail). However, while generally desirable,
full-time work in the farming sector has limited availability (see Table 2). In addition, the private sector,
home-based businesses, and small family businesses contributed more jobs to the economy between
2009 and 2015.63 64

Many FGD respondents perceived a stable and growing demand for certain local products. In
terms of demand for rural products, fruits are the most in-demand farm product and textiles the most
in-demand nonfarm product (see Box 1 and Table 3). At the local village level, there is typically the
greatest demand for nonfarm-sector products, such as baked goods and textiles. At the local level, the
demand for farm-based products is typically low, as rural households tend to produce their own. How-
ever, at the raion level and regional/national level, demand is generally highest for farm-sector products,

               Box 1 Market and Income-Generating Opportunities for Textile
                      Production in Rural Areas

   There is generally a high demand for textiles produced in rural areas in local, regional, national, and inter-
   national markets. Common textile products include adult and children’s clothing, blankets, bed linens, and
   curtains. Unlike products such as baked goods, textiles are durable. At the local level, women often produce
   sewn goods in their home for sale within their own village (demand is high and competition is low). At the
   regional and national level, demand from urban areas is also high, and production becomes more formal, via
   small workshops and larger factories. Uzbekistan is well placed to serve international textile markets due to
   its comparative advantages of skilled labor, relatively low labor costs, strong interest in textile production in
   many rural areas (particularly from women), and the high availability of cotton. In terms of income generation,
   women reported receiving higher prices for their textile goods sold at raion-level markets than in their local
   village. Furthermore, payments at the village level can be delayed or in-kind, which purportedly causes some
   difficulties in obtaining cash, paying off loans for capital purchases, and expanding business activities.

such as dairy, vegetables, and fruits. Sometimes, traders will purchase farm products from rural markets
to sell to urban customers. Demand for textiles and carpets can be quite high for urban markets. At the
international level, demand for Uzbek textiles and carpets can be high, as is demand for fruits from the
farm sector.

In addition to the limited farm- and nonfarm-sector work options in rural areas, some women
reported facing social restrictions from within their own household/extended family, which limits
their ability to engage in such work. Some women—particularly young women and those who live with
extended family members—may not receive support to engage in income-generating activities/employ-
ment. Reported reasons include their responsibility to care for children and elders, the high expectation
to manage domestic duties, a public perception that men should provide for the household, and some
male partners’ jealousy that their female partner may be earning income. Even to tend a tomorka, women
often require permission from their household/extended family.

    “I think that men have more freedom than women. Since many women are dependent on their hus-
    bands, many husbands do not let women go outside of the village. There are women who do work

Many FGD respondents acknowledged a change in traditional gender norms in rural areas and
the rising acceptance and importance of female income generation within households and society
more broadly. The most acceptable and desirable work options have expanded from traditional roles in
state organizations and on tomorkas to include small-scale entrepreneurial activities, such as operating
a retail shop, selling products at market, working in a private workshop, and providing a service such as
hairdressing. Within the farm sector, an increasing number of women have become engaged in horticul-
ture. These increasingly acceptable and desired roles for women have increased their earning capacity
and role within the household. Women of varying ages seek out such positions, from college graduates
to older women.

      “In my home village, women never previously worked in retail. Today, many women in our village
      work in retail, having set up shops, where they sell cloth, vegetables, fruits and foods. Even women
      with only a couple of cows, now make cheese and cream and sell it to others. Such women can
      make a good income and contribute to their household’s budget.”

      “My husband allowed me to set up my business and helps me a lot. He understands that my busi-
      ness makes me happy. I have never heard any words of disapproval from anyone. People have
      become more progressive in their thinking. Men bring their daughters and wives to my salon. Even
      older women come to my salon with their husbands.”
                                                            —KII: Female entrepreneur, Karakalpakstan

The types of income-generating activities that rural women regard most highly varied by region
sampled and are often influenced by local conditions and resources. For example, the greatest inter-
est in horticultural and dekhan farming was found in areas with good irrigation, high crop diversifica-
tion, and high population density (and associated high demand for products). Interest in retail stores was
highest in locations with high population densities (and hence potential customers). While interest in
livestock raising was generally high across all regions sampled, it was highest in locations with a lot of
available land. Interest in industries such as shoemaking (leather from livestock production) and sewing/
tailoring (cotton production) were evident where primary industries were present. Furthermore, field
data suggested that in areas where less land is allocated to traditional crops (wheat and cotton), women’s
interest in horticulture and livestock raising is highest.

Across all sampled regions, female respondents expressed a strong interest in training on a range
of topics related to income-generating opportunities. Women expressed interest in being trained on
specific activities such as sewing/tailoring and baking/cooking, as well as more general financial literacy
(e.g., estimating costs and profits, account management) and general entrepreneurship processes (e.g.,
how to register a business, taxation information). Women suggested training sessions through mahalla
offices (where specialized trainers could visit and conduct sessions) and/or sending local women to train-
ing sessions held in raion or oblast centers. Such training could be shared among villagers.

Women’s contributions to household incomes were considered most critical in households that are
female headed; have families with several young children; and/or have families in which one or
more children attend higher education. Female-headed households—where the female is widowed
or divorced, or the husband has migrated and ceased sending remittances—may rely solely on women’s
income. Families with several young children may have higher everyday expenses (e.g., food, schooling,
clothing, medical, and so on) and may also be trying to save money so as to be able to move outside the
extended family house. In households with children in higher education, one parent’s income may cover
tuition fees while the other parent’s income finances household expenditures.

   “My husband and I moved out of our in-law’s house ten years ago. We built our own house. We decided that
   my husband’s income would be spent on construction of the house and my income [would] cover all other
   household expenses. It is really difficult to cope if both husband and wife do not have an income.”
                                                                    —KII: Female entrepreneur, Namangan Oblast

When females are obligated to head their households, they may seek to engage in enterprises or
farming activities. FGD participants recalled cases of women who were forced to enter the workforce
following divorce, being widowed, or when their husbands became ill and were unable to earn income.
The increased importance of women’s income in these households means that they tend to explore both
enterprise and farming employment.

   “I did not want to become a farmer; however, I did not have any other choice as life circum-
   stances brought me into this way of life. I became a widow when I was 42 years old and with nine
   daughters to support. While my husband was alive our household income was sufficient. When my
   husband was alive we were well off. I have learned a lot about farming since I started and I’ve had
   to become independent to provide for my daughters.”

   “I am responsible for domestic duties and for looking after my mother-in-law and husband, both of
   whom have health issues. Hence, I am not able to work outside our house but needed to generate
   income. So, I started sewing at home. Initially I sewed only clothing but now I sew curtains as well.
   Sewing is the only skill I had and it helps me generate income.”

In many instances physical and human capital go together: the paucity of infrastructure and ser-
vices negatively impacts individuals’ ability to develop and benefit from human capital. ­    Pillar 2 of
the analytical framework provides insight into the status of gender from a physical and human capital
perspective. Key elements of human capital are focused on access to education and skills training oppor-
tunities for women, while physical capital includes women’s access to finance, institutional resources,
and local infrastructure.



4.1  Gender Dimensions of Education

4.1.1  Characteristics of Female Educational Attainment
International evidence suggests a positive link between an increase in female secondary/­  vocational
and tertiary school enrollment and greater participation in the labor force. As the 2012 World
Development Report notes, “Investments in education determine women’s ability to earn higher wages
and to own and operate productive farms and firms.”65 Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that
“when returns to women’s education increased, so did parental investments in the schooling of girls.”66
This suggests there is opportunity for a virtuous cycle of improvement between education, investment,
and employment opportunities.

Secondary education is compulsory in Uzbekistan, and urban and rural areas have a network of
professional colleges. The State Committee on Statistics reports that the number of professional colleges
and specialities they offer has increased over the past decade. In 2015 there were 1,556 institutions (i.e.,
colleges and lyceums) that offered secondary education.67 The share of female students at the second-

ary education level is generally in line with the population’s gender structure (for example, from 2013
to 2016, close to 49 percent of 16- to 19-year-olds were female, and females represented 48 percent of
specialized secondary vocational education, or SSVE).68

Gender parity in enrollment is offset by disparities in disciplines pursued by each sex. This, along
with stream divergence,69 poor quality of education, and social norms related to starting a family, family
models, and childbearing are some of the main obstacles to raising female education levels. For example,
while the State Committee on Statistics reports that female enrollment in SSVE is high, there is gender
variation across disciplines—for example, females constitute most students in pedagogical and medical
training, and male students dominate in industrial, construction, transport, communications, and agri-
culture fields. Overall, women tend to go to school for vocations that have lower demand in the labor
market, particularly in rural areas. Girls’ families often promote specializations that will complement the
domestic duties they will take on later in life, and potentially generate additional income from home.
Subsequently, this translates into jobs that are considered appropriate for women or men.

At the same time, there is some evidence of slight trends of growing numbers of women in tradi-
tionally male disciplines such as agriculture. The State Committee on Statistics reports that, while
disciplines with a high proportion of female students remain (e.g., in health care, physical culture and
sports, education, arts, and cinematography), the proportion of females is increasing in less traditional
fields, such as agriculture and industry, construction, transport, and communications, albeit gradually
(see Figure 9).

For students, the choice of discipline and academic institution in which to enroll tends to be closely
linked to the institutions available in their local area, particularly for females. Qualitative findings
suggest that children tend to attend schools within their raion and often choose specializations that are
locally available and will help them get hired locally. Families of female students are more reluctant to
send their daughters away from home at a young age to pursue education, due to concerns that they will
make poor choices, get a bad reputation, or not return to their communities. When asked, female students
indicated they prefer to stay and go to school in their communities, which limits their options of what to
study.

Educational attainment is highest for men in urban areas and lowest for women in rural areas.
CALLIS data (2013) reports that more than 60 percent of women in rural areas have only general second-
ary education (grades 9 to 11) or below, and only around 8 percent have obtained higher education (see
Figure 10). The group with the highest level of education is men from urban areas (55 percent obtained
education above a general secondary level).

Beyond secondary/vocational education, tertiary educational opportunities for women are lim-
ited. Female enrollment in higher education is low. While eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average percentages of
female students enrolled at a university are almost 55 percent, in Uzbekistan this figure is just above




68	   Statistical Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan 2015.
69	   This relates to differences between men and women in their choice of field to study, which affects wages. World
      Bank (2012b) notes that patterns of stream divergence suggest “that increases in enrollments and learning are
      necessary, but not sufficient, to even the playing field in later life” (107).

37 percent.70 Furthermore, female enrollment in higher education in Uzbekistan has declined.71 Low
enrollment figures can be attributed to various cultural, traditional, and economic/labor barriers, such
as relatively early marriage ages, families that prioritize boys’ education, and the fact that most higher
education institutions are located in Tashkent.72 Such challenges are generally greatest for households
in rural areas.

Qualitative fieldwork findings suggest that costs associated with higher education can be restric-
tive for rural households. In 2012 only 4.6 percent of graduates of professional colleges and lyceums
continued to higher education.73 Most higher education institutions are only available in oblast centers
or Tashkent, meaning that rural households must incur additional expenses (transportation, accommoda-
tion, food) to send their children for multiple yearlong courses. Full scholarships (that cover tuition fees)
to support students are limited. Furthermore, students who live away from their home village are unable
to provide labor and other inputs to family farms and businesses.

       “[It] is difficult for households to pay for higher education. For example, in a case of a household
       of government workers, the average annual salary is 10 million UZS. And to pay 6 million UZS per
       year as a fee for one child is difficult. And if the student does not pay on time, the student can be
       expelled.”

       “I have heard from parents whose children are studying in universities that it was difficult for them
       to pay the annual fee of 6–7 million UZS. Also, if a child lives in a city during the study, the parents
       have to rent an apartment and pay the rent, around 100,000 UZS per month. If they cannot afford
       the apartment, the child will live in a dormitory and they need to pay 30,000 UZS per year. In addi-
       tion, they have to spend money on food for the child.”

4.1.2  The Value of Education
FGD respondents indicated that despite the potential deterrent of higher education costs, both
parents and students value higher education. The main reasons cited related to high social status in
the community and a high demand for graduates in rural villages and raion centers. Many respondents
also felt that graduates may also be more successful as farmers and/or entrepreneurs.

       “Both boys and girls if there are available opportunities desire to obtain higher education. Every-
       body should get higher education. For example, I managed to provide two of my eight children
       with higher education, others received the secondary vocational education. I wish now to provide

       children grew up and will apply for higher education soon . . . I want them to get higher education
       so they have better future. If they get educated they will find a place in life, they will not be in need.
       If girls are educated they will not be dependent on their husbands; while if boys get education, they
       will be able to be good providers for their families.”
                                                                  —KII: Female farmer, Kashkadarya Oblast

       “One of the main barriers for women in rural areas to be engaged in income-generating a     ­ ctivities
       is a lack of higher education. They lack the educational qualification and skills to get prestigious
       and well-paid jobs.”
                          —KII: Female head of the raion-level Women’s Committee, Kashkadarya Oblast

Field data suggests that in cases where students receive a merit-based scholarship to attend higher
education, households typically support the child, irrespective of gender. However, where scholar-
ships are not received and household resources are limited, male children typically receive educational
support over female children. The main reason is that, as per local norms, men tend to live with their
parents after marriage, and hence it is considered a long-term investment in the household’s financial
sustainability. Therefore, parents may take out a loan or sell assets to provide their male children with
higher education opportunities. If financial resources are limited, girls do not often receive such invest-
ment. Additionally, men who served in the army receive additional points toward scholarships,74 making
them more likely to receive one compared to young women. Respondents felt that scholarships specifi-
cally targeted at girls could help create more equal opportunities.

The qualitative data also suggests that where household capacities are higher, wealthier house-
holds seek to actively provide higher education opportunities for their female children. In rural
households that can afford higher education, there are evolving social norms and recognition of increas-
ing demand for women with higher education in the labor markets.

       “Nowadays, parents want their daughters to be educated. Otherwise, it is very difficult for a
       woman without an education and a specialization to feed her family. In the past, a husband’s
       income was enough for the whole family. However, today for a family to have good food and edu-
       cated children (at school and university), it is helpful for a household to have both husband and
       wife earning an income. Today families even search for educated brides, girls with specialization,
       as wives for their sons.”
                                                                       —KII: Male farmer, Namangan Oblast

       “I look at girls with higher education. There are very active and manage to handle duties both at
       home and at work. Also, they are financially independent, dress well, take care of themselves, eat
       well. Because of that, I believe that it is very good if girls get the higher education. Boys also have
       to get higher education since they will become household head and will need to be providers for
       their families.”

income while caring well for their children (in terms of knowing about nutrition, health, hygiene, educa-
tion, and so on).

Despite some gender norms that remain (e.g., prioritizing boys’ education where costs are restric-
tive), field results suggest that today, females with higher education are perceived favorably as
potential wives—a major shift from traditional gender expectations. Traditionally, wives may be
expected to spend most of their time at home, caring for children and the elderly and doing domestic
chores. Women could be prohibited (by husband and in-laws) from completing their education. However,
evolving gender norms now hold women’s schooling in greater esteem, to the extent that some focus
groups reported cases of in-laws encouraging and funding their daughter-in-law’s continuing higher
education.

       “It was very difficult for me to pay tuition fees for my daughter’s education. I paid 5 million UZS
       per year for the first two years. Then she got married and her in-laws paid the fees for the rest of
       her study.”

       degree. An educated girl will take care of her children better. She managed to get education herself and
       so she will convince her children to study harder.”
                                                                       —KII: Male entrepreneur, Jizzakh Oblast

Field data also suggests that households with income-generating female members may be more
motivated to provide their daughters with access to higher education. Some FGD respondents felt
that women who earn money may better understand local market demands and the value of higher edu-
cation, both of which they can pass on to their daughters. Additionally, households that have multiple
income sources may also be more likely to have the financial resources to pay for fee-based higher edu-
cation for their daughters.

4.1.3  From Education to Employment
Survey data75 in Uzbekistan shows that while gender profiles for secondary school attendance
are similar among the sexes, employment rates after secondary school are much higher for men
compared to women. Compulsory secondary schooling means that both males and females have high
attendance rates up to ages 17 to 18. The percentage of female students in academic lyceums and colleges
is 43.7 percent and 49.1 percent respectively (see Figure 11).76 Following this period, both genders tran-
sition from school to employment, with males reaching (informal and formal) employment rates of 80
percent by age 24, while females reach just 40 percent.77 Additionally, males are more likely to continue
with tertiary education, whereas many females do not work or attend further school.

Employment status in Uzbekistan is more positively correlated with education for women than it
is for men. CALISS data (2013) shows that male employment levels are similar for individuals with less
than secondary education compared to tertiary education. In contrast, female employment levels increase

with increasing education, such as 21 percent for less than secondary-level education to 67 percent for
tertiary education (see Figure 12).78

Furthermore, women’s employment type varies greatly with education level. CALISS data (2013)
shows that women with vocational and tertiary education are chiefly employed in the public sector (with
a formal wage), while those with secondary education or lower are predominantly working informally or
in the household and are unpaid (see Figure 13).

Qualitative study findings indicate that graduates with higher education degrees more easily find
employment when returning to rural areas, while those without such degrees generally face greater
barriers. Graduates with higher education degrees tend to have more transferable skills and a variety of
employment options or have better general knowledge with which to start their own businesses.

income-generating activities, or establishing small businesses.

The number of preschools in Uzbekistan was cut nearly in half from 1991 to 2013, and the quality
of services provided is poor. Qualitative findings confirmed that preschool availability in many
sampled rural areas was low. The Ministry of Public Education reported that from 1991 to 2013, the
number of preschools in Uzbekistan dropped from 9,834 to 4,962.79 The majority of those closed were
in rural areas (where numbers dropped from 6,474 to 2,073). Preschool coverage declined from 35 per-
cent in 1991 to 14 percent in 2013 (33 percent in urban areas and 8 percent in rural areas). Furthermore,
of those preschools that remain, occupancy rates average 85 percent (91 percent in urban areas and 73
percent in rural areas).80 As reported in qualitative investigations, the main reasons parents may not send
their children to preschool include the high cost of such schools relative to household incomes and poor
facilities, lack of access to utility services (e.g., water, gas, electricity, heating), and the need for renova-
tion and educational materials.

       “There are very few kindergartens in our area. Most of them are located in the center of villages
       or raion centers. There are many women who want to work, but they cannot leave their children
       anywhere.”

The lack of good quality early childhood education and care facilities prompted some women in
FGDs to propose private child care facilities as possible solutions. Private child care facilities for
rural areas could help improve early childhood development, free women up for more employment
options, and create local enterprise opportunities for women.

Women reported that inflexible employment conditions, coupled with the sometimes inconvenient
hours of early childhood education services, created barriers to engaging in full-time employ-
ment. FGD respondents reported that many employers do not provide flexibility for dropping off and
picking up children from day care. This is usually the responsibility of women, and therefore it limits
their opportunities for full-time employment. Additionally, early childhood education services often
keep limited hours. For example, primary school classes generally run only in the morning, and after-
school care is not usually available. Even in cases where after-school care options exist, their hours are
also limited.

Poor access to early childhood education services limits women to part-time, irregular, or informal
work, without the benefits offered by full-time roles. This was reported in FGDs to lead to low and
irregular wages, lack of access to social security systems, and poor career development options. Even in
employment fields where women are well represented, their relative absence in senior positions is notice-
able. For example, the Ministry of Education reports that while women occupy more than 70 percent of
educational teaching positions, they represent just over one-third of school principals.81

In December 2016 the GoU adopted a 2017–2021 program to overcome the low coverage and quality
of preschool education.82 Proposed program activities include (1) expanding the network of preschools
by constructing 50 new institutions, reconstructing 1,167 institutions, and overhauling 983 institutions;
(2) creating 6,100 short-term groups of alternative forms of education to prepare children ages five to
six for school; (3) providing the parents of children aged three to six who are not covered by preschools
with study guide textbooks; (4) reducing parents’ financial contributions to preschools in rural areas
to 30 percent; and (5) training and retraining preschool teachers with curricula and programs that take
into account modern pedagogical technologies and techniques. The GoU expects these measures will
increase preschool education coverage by 150 percent.



4.2  Financial Services

4.2.1  Low Financial Inclusion and Trust in Financial Institutions
Financial inclusion—in terms of adults who have access to formal bank accounts—has improved
significantly in Uzbekistan in recent years but remains behind regional and global averages.
According to the Global Findex Database, between 2011 and 2014, the share of adults (over age 15)
with an account at a formal financial institution83 almost doubled, from 22.5 percent to 40.7 percent.84
While this improvement is impressive, Uzbekistan still lags behind the ECA average (51.4 percent),
lower-­middle-income average (42.7 percent), and upper-middle-income average (70.5 percent; see Fig-
ure 14). Less than one-quarter of youth (age 15 to 24) have their own financial accounts. Women’s finan-
cial access (39.3 percent) is higher than the lower-middle-income country averages (36.3 percent) but
lower than the adult average in Uzbekistan (40.7 percent) (see Figure 15). Importantly, the gender gap

in Uzbekistan has decreased in recent years, with women’s access to accounts at financial institutions
increasing from 21.3 percent in 2011 to 39.3 percent in 2014.

Access to accounts in financial institutions is growing, but their use is limited in a predominantly
cash economy. Despite a relatively high proportion of adults with bank accounts in financial accounts,
usage of these accounts is limited. Access to cash in Uzbekistan remains severely restrained.85 Accord-
ing to the Global Findex Database, 17.8 percent of the adult population uses accounts to receive wage
payments, 5.1 percent to receive government transfers, and 30 percent to pay utility bills (see Figure 16).
From 2011 to 2014, the share of adults with debit cards increased from 20.4 percent to 24.6 percent.
During the same period, the number of people using automatic teller machines (ATMs) to withdraw cash
decreased from 14.9 percent to 4.6 percent, indicating problems accessing cash.86 In terms of electronic
payment tools, debit cards are used by almost a quarter of adults, while credit cards and Internet pay-
ments are rare (less than 1 percent).87 Despite the fact that 43.5 percent of adults in Uzbekistan report
savings, only 1.8 percent (in 2014) reported keeping those savings in a financial institution, a rate lower
than for ECA (8.4 percent) and lower-middle-income countries more broadly (14.8 percent).88 These
data suggest that most adults use their formal accounts only to receive wages, which is related to the
limitations of the peculiar financial system in Uzbekistan, where cash payments and bank transfers have
different currency weight.

During qualitative fieldwork, FGD respondents confirmed a low level of trust in and availability
of formal banking services in rural areas. Rural women with incomes reported greater familiarity
with formal financial institutions compared to women without incomes. Formal financial institutions
are typically only available in raion or other urban centers. Women in villages closer to urban centers
generally reported greater familiarity with applying for and receiving loans from formal financial institu-
tions. Women with incomes—particularly business owners—were more likely to apply for credit from a
financial institution to, for example, expand their business operations.

During FGDs and KIIs, some female respondents reported having poor experiences at banks. Spe-
cifically, they said that credit services and procedures were inadequately explained to them. This caused
them to abandon their pursuit of formal credit options. Some FGD respondents reported receiving poor
information from bank staff about loan options, types of credit, and procedures. Hence, after a prelimi-
nary visit, many abandoned their pursuit of a formal loan and instead borrowed money from relatives or
sold livestock.

The study findings suggest that there is opportunity for community groups to act as a third party
to help women gain access to loans. Stakeholders such as mahalla committees, women’s committees,
and hokimiyats could play important roles helping facilitate loans at the request of rural households.
Such stakeholders could help prepare formal applications, collect required documentation, and even act
as an informal guarantor for women.

Financial services to small businesses and enterprises in Uzbekistan come from large providers
(commercial banks) and MCOs. However, there is an absence of midsize providers. Commercial
banks provide microcredit at concessional rates but require high rates of collateral and provide only non-
cash credit. At the other extreme, MCOs offer simplified credit in cash and without collateral; however,
they have low financial capacity and small loans. There is a gap between these two providers, and hence
the financial needs of businesses (small and medium sized) and entrepreneurs are not currently being
met.

4.2.2  Traditional Financing Practices
Low levels of trust in financial institutions, coupled with an insufficient understanding of banking
systems and an absence of collateral, often leads people (particularly rural residents and women)
to continue to access finance via informal networks. In Uzbekistan qualitative findings suggest that
it is rare for rural households to obtain credit from formal financial institutions. Instead, alternative
sources—such as family and friends—are strongly preferred. The Global Findex Database reports that in
2014, only 1.3 percent of adults obtained loans from financial institutions, compared to an ECA average
of 12.4 percent.89 However, 11.1 percent of adults borrowed money from family and friends, and another
1.5 percent borrowed from private informal lenders. Despite informal financing sources, the rate of bor-
rowing in Uzbekistan (16.6 percent of adults) is lower than the average in both ECA (39.5 percent) and
lower-middle-income countries (47.4. percent).90 When accessed, credit is typically used for education,
mortgage repayments, and business development (see Figure 17). Money transfer systems utilize remit-
tances, with 5 percent of adults having sent money and 8 percent having received money through such
systems.

Qualitative findings suggest that men and women typically access informal credit for different
purposes. Women tend to borrow small amounts of cash, as well as food and other goods, from relatives

to buy items for dowries, the household, children’s educational needs, and small businesses (such as sew-
ing machines, poultry, or livestock). Men tend to be responsible for borrowing larger amounts of money
for more significant expenses, such as for buying a vehicle, renovating the home, and paying for events
such as weddings and funerals. Rural households can sell livestock or borrow money from relatives
(either in the village or abroad) to start a business or expand farming activities.

As an alternative to using formal institutions for savings, many rural households reported storing
money at home and participating in informal savings networks, such as gaps or chernaya kassas.
Qualitative findings confirmed low levels of trust in financial institutions and the existence of informal
networks, leading to a situation in which many rural households store money at home. For example,
a savings network called gap is an informal regular meeting at a house or café where each attendee
contributes a fixed amount of cash and the total is provided to one member. The recipient of the cash
changes each meeting, and members agree on who it will be. Gap can be considered a noninterest loan
and a mechanism for recipients to access money for significant purchases. It also means that each house-
hold does not keep large amounts of cash at home. There are separate male and female gaps, and boys
typically participate in gaps earlier than girls. In addition to serving as a means of informal credit, gaps
also serve as networks through which people can receive news and information regarding employment
and business ideas. Chernaya kassas are other informal savings networks, like gaps, but without the
meetings.

    “I have been meeting up with my childhood friends via a gap for a long time now. We have 8 mem-
    bers in our group and we meet monthly in someone’s house and collect 100,000 UZS from every-

    buy, for example, an important item for your house.”

Gaps and chernaya kassas appear to be mechanisms that help enable female entrepreneurship and
income generation, both as a source of finance and networking. In addition to the credit, women can
receive advice from other network members on starting a business and investing. These benefits mean
that such informal networks are often preferred to formal financial institutions.

       “I get together with my old school classmates once a month, where each of us gives 100,000 UZS
       and one member receives 1 million UZS that month. That amount of money is significant enough
       to buy something big. In addition, we talk to each other at the meetings, discuss and try to solve
       problems for each other.”

4.2.3  Microfinance and MCOs
Globally, women’s access to microfinance has been shown to have a range of economic and social
benefits.91 Both the body of literature and empirical experiences suggest that microfinance can increase
economic empowerment and household well-being,92 as well as create an increased sense of agency at
household and community levels. Access to microfinance services increases women’s income, which
they can use to invest in various income-generating activities. With greater income comes greater bar-
gaining power, which women may use to play a bigger role in managing their households, take care of
health care needs, access better nutrition, and improve their (and their children’s) access to education.
In the social and political spheres, increased access to income is often accompanied by higher confi-
dence and self-esteem. This enhances decision-making power not only at the household level but at
the community level as well.93 Table 4 presents conditions that contribute to women and young college

             Box 2 Microfinance Barriers, Trepidations, and Remedies

  Several barriers can limit access to microfinance among women: (1) restrictive social and gender norms
  that limit women’s roles to housework and child rearing;94 (2) market restrictions that limit women to subsis-
  tence farming and producing low-profit goods;95 (3) restrictive legal norms that limit women’s property rights,
  constrain various economic opportunities, and limit their access to land and other assets, which result in lower
  average incomes;96 and (4) socioeconomic conditions (such as class, race, ethnicity, religion, level of educa-
  tion) that affect women’s access to credit.

  However, microfinance may not always be conducive to women’s empowerment. A number of studies
  highlight issues related to microfinance, which include all of the following: (1) external pressures imposed on
  women to take out loans;97 (2) the appropriation of their incomes by other household members;98 (3) increased
  family tensions as a result of women’s income-generation capacity;99 (4) delays in transfer of funds, which can
  increase women’s debts; (5) microcredit activities that can increase women’s workload and stress and dimin-
  ish health;100 (6) microcredit activities that can reduce women’s involvement in social and political activities;
  and (7) repayment problems that can threaten women’s networks.101

  eral conditions drawn from the literature are deemed necessary: (1) consider local context and type of
  borrowing for women;102 (2) better understand the impacts of different types of products and services on
  women;103 (3) account for the high degree of variation in financial services and institutions and their contribu-
  tion to women’s empowerment;104 and (4) understand different users’ real needs.105

graduates to successfully benefit from microcredit programs. At the same time, microfinance does have
some barriers and nuances, some of which are outlined in Box 2.

In Uzbekistan the microfinance sector has developed to serve the needs of the growing micro and
small enterprise sector. The microfinance sector is made up of MCOs, pawn shops, and concessional
loans offered by the banks and was estimated by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan to be worth 3 trillion
UZS, or 7 percent of the total loan value in the banking sector in 2015. This reflects a limited presence in
the market. Banks provide microcredit on concessional terms (discounted interest rates of 1.5 percent to
4.5 percent per annum, compared to standard interest rates on ordinary commercial loans issued by the
banks, which are set at 16 percent to 18 percent per annum) through small business credit programs (see
Figures 18a and 18b). Microcredit constitutes a small proportion of total credit to small businesses and
private entrepreneurs. However, more than half (56 percent) of private entrepreneurs and small businesses
do not apply to banks for loans,106 due to high collateral requirements, high interest rates, the noncash
nature of the credit, and complicated and time-consuming procedures (see Figure 19).

KIIs reported that credit facilities for new entrepreneurs are the most popular type of credit acces-
sible to rural women. Limited credit is provided for 1.5 years at an annual interest rate ranging from
3 percent to 9 percent. Banks typically require borrowers to submit as collateral a vehicle or a com-
mercial estate. Following loan repayment, the borrower can apply for a business development loan, also
provided on concessional terms.

To increase uptake of microcredit by female entrepreneurs and college graduates, the GoU is imple-
menting targeted awareness raising programs. According to official data from the Central Bank, in
2015 female entrepreneurs constituted only 16 percent of total microcredit, even though women headed
40.4 percent of small enterprises and 13.7 percent of microenterprises (see Figure 20). To improve equal
access to credit, the State Women’s Committee, in collaboration with the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry and local administrations, conducts competitions and training programs to encourage women
and youth to apply for targeted credit.107

MCOs can offer borrowers better conditions than banks; however, they are not expanding their
market share in Uzbekistan due to funding limitations and slow sector growth. Compared to banks,
MCOs enjoy simplified procedures,108 do not require collateral,109 and are able to provide credit as cash.
This makes MCOs attractive to customers without collateral or full-time employment and to rural popu-
lations. However, MCOs are not allowed to accept funding from citizens. Hence, their financing base is
limited to grants from international donors. Consequently, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan reports that
MCOs occupy just a small place in the Uzbek market,110 particularly when compared to MCOs in other
ECA countries (for example, Azerbaijan; see Figure 21).


107	For more information, see the case study on the role of the Women’s Committee in Chapter 5 on Pillar 3: Voice.
108	According   to the Microcredit Organisations Law, MCOs can offer micro loans (up to 100 minimum wages),
    microcredits (up to 1,000 minimum wages, for 6, 9, or 12 months, and 3 years) and micro leases (up to 2,000
    minimum wages, for up to 3 years).
109	For loans less than 3 million UZS. Above that amount, collateral—often in the form of real estate—is required.

4.3.1  Severe Infrastructure Deficit
An infrastructure and utilities infrastructure deficit has been worsening over the past 10 to 15 years
in Uzbekistan, especially in many rural areas. Furthermore, investments in utilities are declining. A
combination of decaying infrastructure (much of which was installed during the Soviet era and is deterio-
rating) and increasing demand for utility services (caused by population growth, economic development,
and increased urbanization) has created a supply deficit (see Figure 22). For example, in the water sec-
tor alone, Uzbekistan’s Center for Economic Research (CER) estimates that investments of 3 trillion to
4 trillion UZS—or 4 percent of national GDP111—are required to return degraded water supply networks
to service. Instead, investments in utilities sectors have been declining over the past 10 years.

The degradation of utility infrastructure means that many households and businesses now receive
poor or no utility service. The scale of the challenge is highlighted by the fact that the State Committee
for Privatisation, Demonopolisation and Competition Development reports that more than 60 percent of
complaints registered with state authorities pertained to the low quality of utility services.112 Further-
more, a survey of entrepreneurs carried out by the CER revealed that poor utility service can substan-
tially reduce business incomes (see Figure 23).

Rural areas tend to suffer from both the poorest access to and quality of infrastructure and utility
services. Previous studies reported that only 26 percent of rural households have access to a centralized
water connection,113 while only 3 percent of connected rural households experience 24-hour access.114
There is no access to centralized sewage networks in rural areas, which means that most wastewater is
disposed directly into the environment without being treated.115 Despite universal coverage of central-
ized electricity,116 it is common for populations in rural regions to experience regular and long electricity
outages, surges, and interruptions.117 Another feature of public infrastructure is the poor connectivity
of tertiary road networks to secondary networks, which affects sectors such as agriculture.118 Recent
research by the CER119 suggests that the centralized housing and public utilities models are outdated
and there is a need to create a new housing and public utilities architecture that can promote diversified
financial sources and expand local authority capacities.

The GoU has announced a range of infrastructure programs planned for 2017 to 2020. This com-
plements broader GoU plans to improve living conditions in remote and hard-to-access areas. National
infrastructure efforts are focused on multistory buildings; water networks, wells, and water structures;

roads; and paving city streets.120 As part of the Access to Infrastructure Programs announced during
2016: Year of Healthy Mothers and Children,121 improving living conditions in remote and hard-to-
access areas will focus on consumer services centers; free electrical appliances to women in low-
income families; housing construction in rural areas; and extending electricity, gas, and water supply
networks.122

4.3.2  Infrastructure and Gender
The state of local infrastructure plays a critical role in determining women’s availability and par-
ticipation in the labor force. Previous World Bank studies have confirmed that household tasks and
chores pose a significant demand on women’s time, which reduces the time they have for market work
or leisure.123 Providing local infrastructure, such as electricity, water, roads, and transportation, can have
transformative impacts on women’s household burdens, welfare, and economic opportunities.

The accessibility and quality of utility services impacts gender roles in Uzbekistan’s labor m
                                                                                             ­ arket.
Being responsible for household chores means that women are most impacted by poor service. Women
are the main users of utilities, and regional studies by the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe (UNECE) indicate that they can spend approximately five times more time on household chores
than men.124 Where utility service is poor, women spend more time on household duties, which limits
their employment options. While good-quality utility service may facilitate more employment opportu-
nities, poor or absent service limits women’s opportunities for informal or part-time work.

Qualitative study findings suggest that the accessibility and quality of utility and community ser-
vices is a major determinant of the time and effort women must spend on domestic chores. In areas
that have no or poor access to water, electricity, and gas, women must allocate more resources (time and
effort) to seeking out alternatives and substitutes. For example, where centralized water is unavailable in
a household, a household member (or multiple members) may have to collect and treat water daily. Addi-
tionally, where community services (such as kindergartens) are unavailable, women must spend more
time caring for young children. Hence, the absence of functioning utility and community services limits
women’s potential income-generation opportunities. As a coping strategy, women reported helping one
another with domestic chores to save time for other activities.

Access and quality challenges were reported across all sampled areas for all the centralized utility
services. These have consequences for women’s household tasks and income-generation opportunities.
Many rural communities reported frequent electricity outages, particularly in autumn and winter when
service may be provided for just a few hours per day. Without electricity, women cannot use sewing
machines or electric ovens; many other tasks cannot be done without lighting, and food spoils more
quickly without refrigeration. At the national level, of 8,900 rural settlements, 5,054 are reported to
have functioning water supply networks, which leaves almost 3,900 that have abandoned or barely

functioning systems.125 Where centralized gas supplies are poor or unavailable, some households use
gas tanks. However, tanks can only be used for cooking, not heating, which forces households to find
alternative sources (e.g., cotton stalks, wood, coal). Where household heating options are limited, mem-
bers often congregate in one room, which makes it difficult for women to conduct home-based business
activities.

4.3.3  Infrastructure and Business Opportunities
Qualitative findings suggest that unreliable energy services can have adverse impacts on both farm
and nonfarm activities. For example, some FGD respondents reported no centralized gas supply and
insufficient bottled gas for cooking and processing foods to sell. Furthermore, electric outages, which
may be frequent and prolonged, limit the time that women have to undertake many income-­     generating
activities (outages are more frequent during the heating season).

Some female entrepreneurs in FGDs identified poor utility service as a major impediment to busi-
ness growth. Poor utility service can prevent businesses from providing decent working conditions for
their employees and force them to adopt inefficient practices. For example, cold working areas discour-
age workers, and manual sewing machines are not as efficient as electric ones. Poor utility service creates
both inconvenience and additional expense (should generators, fuels, and heaters need to be purchased),
which limits efficiency and the potential for growth.

      “As you probably know, there are frequent outages with the electricity supply in our rural area.
      Only three months a year we receive electricity without outages . . . When there is no electricity
      we have to use gas tanks to heat irons for ironing of dresses . . . We have to use manual sewing
      machines due to the issue . . . We also have to use solar panels for lighting. In addition, we have
      installed a generator. But anyway, we face an issue with heating during the winter months. It gets
      very cold in our workshop during the winter months. Because of that, we heat our space with

Qualitative findings suggest that poorer infrastructure services are a major factor in increasing
expenses, reducing productivity, and discouraging women’s entrepreneurial activities in rural
areas compared to urban ones. Higher growth rates and greater numbers of women’s entrepreneur-
ial activities in urban areas were primarily attributed to better-quality infrastructure services, improved
access to (larger) markets (for buying and selling), and application of standard tax rates (irrespective of

urban or rural setting). Poorer infrastructure service in rural areas was considered to increase expenses,
reduce productivity, and make it difficult to access markets.

Some FGD respondents reported that seasonal variations in the quality of centralized utility ser-
vice can directly impact women’s income-generating activities. In addition, the way loan repayments
are structured are out of sync with rural income cycles. Centralized electricity and gas services are report-
edly worse in winter, and this generally corresponds to less business activity/efficiency and less income
generation. While the demand for some services also wanes during winter (there are fewer social events
and hence less demand for tailoring, baking, and so on), some respondents stated that if utility services
were better during the winter, many women could continue to produce surplus goods for sale during
high-demand months and/or be able to take more of their goods to larger markets. Seasonal production
losses due to poor utility service may also make business owners more reluctant to take out loans, which
often require consistent repayment. The general structure of regular loan repayments can also dissuade
some business owners from expanding.

    “I have been sewing for the past ten years, originally from home, before setting up my workshop
    two years ago. The hokimiyat offered support to me to apply for a bank loan to buy additional
    sewing machines. The offer was made in autumn and I knew that I would need to make repayments
    during winter. Given the frequent electricity outages in winter, and fewer orders from customers, I
    decided not to apply for the loan.”

Qualitative findings reported that an undersupply of commercial real estate for rent is a common
challenge for women’s enterprise activities in rural areas. Consequently, many female entrepreneurs
work from home and cannot expand their business operations. In the absence of rental space, some
entrepreneurs may construct space, but this is often prohibitively expensive for small businesses (FGD
respondents estimate 1 million to 300 million UZS).

4.3.4  Community Infrastructure Availability
FGD participants strongly communicated the link between the availability of community infra-
structure/utility services and the ability of women to engage in income-generating activities. FGDs
of women, men, recent graduates, and mahalla committee members highlighted the importance of com-
munity infrastructure (such as kindergartens, public transportation, and playgrounds) and utility services
(such as drinking water, irrigation water, electricity, and gas supply) on women’s ability to engage in
work. Young women with children were regarded as most affected by the state of such infrastructure.
Table 5 summarizes the adverse impacts that poor community infrastructure and utility service can have
on women’s income potential.

Global evidence suggests that the availability of community infrastructure, such as early child-
hood care facilities and kindergartens, influences women’s education, livelihood, and employment
opportunities. Despite recent improvements in the availability of such services, Uzbekistan lags on a
global scale. Where women bear full responsibility for child care, they forgo opportunities for capacity-
building activities such as education and professional training.126 The absence of child care facilities127
and/or kindergartens limits women’s opportunities to be outside the house for long periods of time. The
2012 World Development Report noted that “better access to formal child care affords women greater

dren aged two to six in early development programs (child care/kindergarten) in Uzbekistan (approxi-
mately 27 percent) remains far below the levels (80 percent to 100 percent) being achieved in developed

women. In Jizzakh Oblast some FGD respondents suggested building small sports facilities/­    playgrounds

time for domestic duties and/or income-generating activities.

FGD participants communicated that one type of community infrastructure development con-
sidered particularly conducive to female employment in rural areas is multiservice centers.
FGDs in Namangan and Karakalpakstan proposed the idea of one multiservice center per village.
It would be located in a single building that could house multiple small business services, such as a
beauty salon, a hairdresser, a tailor, a shoe repair shop, a laundromat, and so on. The center could act

as a community service hub that could benefit all businesses within it. Such centers could be housed
in renovated existing buildings and funded by either entrepreneurs or governments (which would then
rent space to entrepreneurs). Implementing a recently passed presidential decree may go some way
toward satisfying such requests, as the decree plans to transform public buildings to house local busi-
nesses and services.129

Qualitative findings suggested that for women who produce and sell farm and tomorka prod-
ucts, community infrastructure—in the forms of roads and market spaces—plays a critical role.
Access to markets is a barrier for farm and tomorka income-generating activities, particularly in remote
villages. This challenge is exacerbated where road networks and public transport services are poor
and where market spaces lack facilities (e.g., roofing, heating, access to electricity for refrigeration).
Many FGD participants hoped that their village/local markets would be repaired, upgraded, and/or
constructed.

Voice is defined as the capacity to speak up, engage in, and influence discussions, discourse, and
decision-making processes.130 Pillar 3 of the analytical framework outlines avenues and institutions
through which women’s voices are heard. Pathways for conveying and amplifying women’s voices
include the national legal and policy environment, institutions with mandates to support women’s voices,
technology as a medium for women’s voices, and women’s voices within their households and local
communities.



5.1  National Legal and Policy Environment
Gender equality is addressed in Uzbekistan’s national legal and policy environment. However,
gaps are evident in women’s participation. Equal rights and responsibilities for men and women are
addressed in Uzbekistan’s laws and policies, as well as in the Constitution and the Family Code. While
the legal framework includes other critical provisions that are sensitive to gender, enforcement mecha-
nisms need improvement. Uzbekistan ratified the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimi-
nation against Women (CEDAW) in 1996. Based on recent UN CEDAW Committee recommendations,
the GoU, with the participation of civil society institutions, has enacted two national action plans to
implement the CEDAW Committee recommendations (one in 2006 and one in 2010). One of the remain-
ing challenges in evaluating the progress to CEDAW implementation is linked to the absence of gender-
disaggregated data. However, the recent launch of the gender statistics web page131 is a step in the right
direction.

              Box 3 Uzbek institutions Involved in the Protection
                     of Women’s Rights

   Institutions involved in the protection of women’s rights include (1) the State Committee for Women’s Affairs,
   which has a mandate to coordinate and promote women’s activities; among other achievements, the com-
   mittee was influential in declaring 2016 as the Year of the Mother and Child, which was accompanied by a
   comprehensive state action program; (2) the Ombudsman (Authorized Person of the Oliy Majlis—­    Parliament);
   (3) the Oliy Majlis Committee on Labor and Social Protection; (4) the Committee on Democratic Institutions;
   and (5) various nongovernment organizations and self-governing bodies.



Women are underrepresented in top political positions in Uzbekistan. In 2004 Uzbekistan’s politi-
cal parties agreed on a 30 percent minimum quota for female candidates in the election process.132 The
number of female deputies in the national legislature increased from 9 percent in 2004 to 16 percent
in 2014.133 Since the introduction of the quota, the number of female members of political parties has
increased to between 35 percent and 50 percent for the five major parties.134 However, these actions have
not yet translated into a significant increase in the number of female members in parliament.

Women retain a minority voice across all levels of the Uzbek government. They occupy just 7 per-
cent of high-level government positions (such as ministers, deputy ministers, and so on); 31 percent of
midlevel government positions (such as heads of department, heads of divisions, and so on); and at the
local level, there are no female hokims (local governors). Women more often occupy positions as heads
or deputies of specialized roles with a gender mandate.

Improving the regulatory environment for nongovernmental organizations could strengthen
their ability to promote gender rights. In recent years a number of changes aimed at improving the
dialogue between citizens and the state were introduced into the legal framework. In 2014 the Regu-
lation on the Procedure on State Registration of Non-Governmental and Non-Commercial Organiza-
tions (CSO Regulation) established a simplified registration procedure and reduced the frequency and
complexity of civil society organization (CSO) reporting to the Ministry of Justice. The Law on Open-
ness of Activities of Governmental Bodies introduced a new requirement to enhance the transparency
and accessibility of information around government actions, and the Law on Social Partnership lays
the framework for cooperation between government bodies and CSOs by allowing for the establish-
ment of public funds and public commissions at the local level. In 2016 the newly elected president of
Uzbekistan, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, announced that 2017 will be a “Year of Dialogue with the Citizen”
and signed a decree ordering the development of a state program accordingly. Priority tasks for the
program include adopting measures on development mechanisms to facilitate parliamentary and pub-
lic monitoring of how laws, decrees, and other legislative documents are executed, and to make sure
state authorities operate efficiently. The program will also introduce mechanisms for an open dialogue
between public officials and citizens and include measures that enable citizens to hold public officials
accountable for their activities. All of these steps have the potential to widen the space in which women
could articulate their voices.

5.2  Institutions That Voice Support for Women
Women face multiple hurdles in raising their voice, particularly in local politics. Such challenges
include (1) cultural and social norms, which hinder women’s participation in local politics, particularly
where it is perceived to encroach on traditional male domains;135 (2) economic disparities, which impact
women’s participation; it is more difficult for women from low-income households to participate politi-
cally, as they cannot afford to delegate household and income-generating activities;136 (3) education
levels, which affect political participation, as illiterate women are less aware of governance procedures
and political processes;137 (4) ethnicity, race, and religion, which can deter minority groups because of
cultural, administrative, and language barriers;138 (5) the threat of retribution toward women, which
can include harassment, intimidation, and physical abuse;139 and (6) informal community structures and
institutions, which are typically dominated by men.140

The international literature outlines several potential solutions to these obstacles, including (1) form-
ing associations of elected female local representatives (aided by women’s national power structures);141
(2) introducing quota systems for more female representation at local governance levels; (3) instituting
government-sponsored campaigns to raise the status of women, which can impact women’s participation
in local governance;142 and (4) mobilizing women for community campaigns—for, say, improved service
delivery.143 All of these have the potential to increase women’s voice. Alternative approaches include
women being active in nonconfrontational and nonpolitical institutions such as women’s associations,
self-help or microcredit groups, and civic and religious groups,144 as well as participation via proxies
(men related to women who can speak or act on their behalf).145

5.2.1  The Women’s Committee
Qualitative findings suggest that the Women’s Committee of Uzbekistan is one of the strongest
advocates for women’s issues nationally. It is a nongovernmental nonprofit organization that is
also integrated into the executive power structure. The chairperson is the ex-officio deputy prime
minister and at the oblast and raion levels also serves as deputy hokim on women’s affairs.146 At the
mahalla level, a representative of the Women’s Committee serves as an advisor on religious education
and spiritual and moral upbringing (maslakhatchi). The Women’s Committee’s NGO status is maintained
through a wide network of “primary cells” established at enterprises, local self-governing bodies, uni-
versities, vocational colleges, academic lyceums and schools, and preschools, as well as through active

Figure 25 outlines the structure of the Women’s Committee across multiple levels of governance.

The Women’s Committee contains affiliated public institutions that promote women’s issues
through various mediums. For example, the Republican Scientific Center “Oila” (Family) is a public
institution affiliated with the committee that studies family and societal values and traditions, develops
methodological recommendations on family-related issues, collects gender-related statistics, organizes
training courses, and conducts awareness-raising campaigns for young people. The committee also
runs a national magazine called Saodat (Happiness), two national newspapers—Gulchehralar (Beau-
tiful Faces) and Oila va Jamiyat (Family and Society), and its regional branches also publish local
newspapers.

The Women’s Committee plays an important role in promoting and supporting women’s entrepre-
neurship. The committee collaborates with the Central Bank to provide concessional loans for enter-
prises led by women or that employ mostly women and to provide microcredit to family businesses. The
committee coordinates training programs for female entrepreneurs and jobless women in conjunction

with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with an annual target of reaching a minimum of 1,000
jobless women.

Despite a general lack of disaggregated gender data, the Women’s Committee generates estimates
on some employment statistics for women. For example, in 2014 the committee estimated that 468,000
jobs were created for women nationally, of which almost half (220,000) were in small business and pri-
vate entrepreneurship, 118,000 in home-based work, and 44,000 in farm-development work. While these
numbers cannot be independently verified, they may indicate how women’s employment is nationally
distributed.

The Women’s Committee plays an important role in disseminating information, raising awareness,
and promoting opportunities through competitions. Through kindergartens, schools, and colleges,
and in collaboration with the Mahalla Foundation and Kamolot Youth Movement, the committee sup-
ports educational programs on topics such as girls’ hygiene, reproductive health, family law, household
budgeting, and professional skills. The committee also collaborates with groups such as the Business
Women’s Association (BWA), the Trade Union Federation, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and
the Central Bank on competitions that support women’s business ideas. For example, an annual contest
for female entrepreneurs received 1,500 applications in 2016, and 28 winners received commercial bank
loans of more than 4 billion UZS.148

FGD respondents communicated sound knowledge of the Women’s Committee and its activities
and regard representatives at the district level as an initial contact point for women when dealing
with local authorities. Women’s Committee representatives can provide basic information, help guide
women through the process of contacting state agencies, and monitor how the agency responds. Repre-
sentatives work in close collaboration with mahalla committees to help women with income-generating
opportunities such as establishing small businesses and finding employment in farm- or home-based
labor.

5.2.2  Role of Local Institutions
Several other government and nongovernment institutions aid women in employment and busi-
ness establishment. Beyond the Women’s Committee, such groups include the Business Women’s Asso-
ciation (BWA), employment centers, one-window services,149 and hokimiyat and mahalla committees.
While mahalla offices are based at the village level, most other organizations are based in raion or oblast
centers, and representatives sometimes make village visits.

The maslakhatchi was reported to be a common first point of contact for rural women to address
a multitude of issues. Maslakhatchi are members of the Women’s Committee and advisers to mahalla
committees. They include respected women in the local community, are typically married, and have a
higher education. Maslakhatchi tend to focus on health care (including family planning), crime pre-
vention, education, social welfare, and women’s employment. Maslakhatchi women often have more
freedom to visit households150 than mahalla committee members. FGDs reported that women will dis-
cuss issues with them such as how to apply for loans, find employment, or start businesses. However,
maslakhatchi are limited in the skills and capacity they can provide.

The local hokimiyat is the government agency where women can submit formal business applica-
tions and within which other government and nongovernment organizations that promote wom-
en’s rights often locate their offices. Hokimiyats are key public and administrative authorities at the
raion and oblast levels. In addition to helping submit social assistance applications and registering com-
plaints about utility services, hokimiyats aid entrepreneurs and businesses in their daily operations, such
as giving legal consultations and providing support for loan applications and land or commercial real
estate rentals. Raion hokimiyats house offices of other government and nongovernment organizations
that are engaged in women’s issues, employment, and entrepreneurship (such as women’s committees,
employment centers, one-window services, and others).

Employment centers at the raion level monitor unemployment levels, provide benefits, and retrain
and help reemploy people. Most FGD respondents were aware of employment centers, which work
with mahalla committees to identify unemployed persons, invite them to employment fairs, and help
them apply for unemployment benefits. However, men are reportedly more likely to seek assistance
from employment centers than women. This is because such centers typically offer jobs outside villages,
which many women are not interested in (chiefly because of their domestic responsibilities).

    “Our village is remote and one lady . . . applied to the employment center but has not found a suit-
    able job yet. She wants to work in the village and jobs offered by the employment center require
    travel outside of the village. The salary is low and employees must pay for their own transporta-
    tion and lunch. This kind of job does not suit many women and in this case, this lady awaits better
    opportunities.”

Employment centers tend to connect potential employees to nonfarm vacancies rather than place
workers in farm-based roles or help with business start-up activities. Interviews with employ-
ment center representatives show that the centers tend to receive vacancy notifications from urban-area
employers such as state organizations, production plants, and private businesses. Farmers and business
owners from rural areas tend to hire people directly from the community or come to the mahalla for
advice or help when they need to mobilize labor (for example, picking cotton).

Employment centers can provide vocational training assistance and unemployment benefits, but
awareness of these services is low among the rural population (particularly women); hence, such
services are not often utilized. Where employment centers make requests for specialized roles but do
not receive appropriate candidates, the centers can provide state-funded training at a local college. In
some cases centers can also provide unemployment benefits to candidates for up to a six-month period
when employment cannot be sourced. Candidates must attend job interviews organized by the center, and
the unemployment benefit ceases when employment is found. However, FGD respondents suggested the
rural population and especially rural women have low awareness about such opportunities.

The BWA supports women’s enterprise and access to credit. However, awareness of the service is
low in rural areas. The BWA is nongovernmental and nonprofit and aims to provide women with edu-
cation, consultancy, and help accessing credit, as well as advocating and lobbying on behalf of female
entrepreneurs. However, despite the fact that the BWA has operated since 1991, rural women in FGDs
and rural female entrepreneurs in KIIs communicated very low awareness of the BWA and its activities.
Those who were aware stated that it was focused on activities in urban areas (oblast centers and some
raion centers) and had a limited presence in rural areas. Many women interested in entrepreneurship and
building their business skills suggested extending the BWA’s activities into rural areas.

One-window centers, which are now overseen by the Department of Justice,151 provide govern-
ment services to entrepreneurs. However, rural women reported low awareness of these centers.
One-window centers were established in 2015 as one-stop shops that house 16 government services rel-
evant to entrepreneurs, including licensing and registration, banking services, utility service connections,
taxation, and consultation services. KIIs with entrepreneurs suggested that the centers had simplified
and accelerated business establishment and operational procedures. However, awareness of these new
centers was low among rural women interested in enterprise activities.

5.2.3  Decentralized and Community-Based Solutions for Women’s Empowerment
Women’s specific needs are best addressed at the community level, and participatory CDD
approaches could be a powerful mechanism for supporting women’s social and economic empow-
erment. Global best practice demonstrates that CDD allows for the different livelihood needs of men
and women due to gender roles and responsibilities and gender disparities in access to resources at both
the household and community levels.152 Participatory approaches in CDD programs provide an avenue
for the inclusive engagement of women in determining community priorities and in planning for and
implementing development initiatives. CDD programs provide an opportunity to take a closer look at
gender norms, roles, and power relations that determine the distribution of assets and risks among men
and women. It is important to ensure that CDD interventions work toward the inclusion of women as
active decision makers and beneficiaries, particularly where informal power structures and elite capture
risks exist.153 Box 4 provides an outline of CDD approaches.

In the context of Uzbekistan, citizens’ self-governing bodies (CSBs) are responsible for protecting
the interests of the population, including support for business development. CSBs include assem-
blies of citizens from settlements, villages, auls, and mahallas (either at the town or village level); the
1999 law titled Citizens’ Self-Governing Bodies regulates their activities.154 Amendments introduced in
2003 and 2008 pertain to the implementation of employment and public amenities programs, assistance
to utilities companies in recovering debts, organization of hashars, changes to local political powers,
and increases in mahalla powers to determine financial assistance to low-income families. For example,
Article 17 of the law specifically mandates that mahallas “promote development in the respective areas
of business, including family businesses and the craft activity.”

While the law defines a wider range of powers and diversified financing sources, in practice CSDs
powers and authorities are very limited. According to the law, financing may be derived from bud-
getary funds allocated by the district or city (usually to pay staff salaries); social benefits and financial
aid sources (where the CSB is the intermediary); donations from legal entities and individuals; and their
own funds. But in practice CBSs almost exclusively relay on hokimiyats for funding. The absence of
regulatory division powers between executive authorities and CSBs; and the requirement that hokimiyats
approve the appointment of a chairperson (aksakal) further weaken the position of CSBs. As a result,
CSB activities lack transparency and accountability and do not have mechanisms to monitor and evaluate
financial management and election processes.

                 Box 4  CDD as a Decentralization Option

      CDD is a development approach that emphasizes community control over planning decisions and
      investment resources.155 It enables local communities and institutions to take the lead in identifying and man-
      aging community-level investments. It is built on the theory that community participation in local development
      planning can lead to better use of resources in meeting local development needs. CDD has become an impor-
      tant operational strategy. It has demonstrated success in empowering local decision making, getting resources
      to communities efficiently, and delivering services and infrastructure to targeted populations.

      CDD programs generally aim to decrease poverty and improve the well-being of poor communities
      through participatory means, working closely with project facilitators or local government officials.
      Programs typically train and provide technical assistance to communities to plan, implement, and manage
      development activities that increase access to and use of infrastructure and services. Emerging research
      shows that the most successful programs are based on two key principles: (1) programming that responds
      to a community’s self-identified needs and (2) programming that strengthens a community’s ability to design
      and implement programs that engage diverse groups and stakeholders.156

      The socioeconomic benefits of CDD programs are evident across various impact evaluations. One
      economic benefit is greater labor force participation, which results from the diversification of income sources
      and improved production practices.157

      With regard to infrastructure projects, community-driven approaches can demonstrate multiple
      benefits to traditional government service delivery, including (1) lower costs for some investments;158
      (2) attractive average rates of return;159 (3) efficiency gains through more accurate targeting of limited
      resources to community needs; and (4) supporting local problem-solving innovations and fostering increased
155
      connections   and trust.

5.3  Conditions That Influence Women’s Voices
Representatives of organizations that support women’s employment emphasized the importance of
women having the capacity to generate income so as to amplify their voice within their household
and in their community. KIIs with representatives from Women’s Committees, employment centers,
and employers highlighted the importance of income-generating capacities for women. Representatives
communicated that employed women set a good example for children, pass on skills to children, can con-
tribute to reduced arguments between spouses and in-laws, and, by bringing income into the household,
acquire more voice.

Women’s voices may be strongest when their contribution to household income is proportionally
greater. Women’s contribution to household income was most appreciated by both sexes where
households are poorer and located in more remote areas, and was considered least important for
household welfare in areas closer to urban centers and with higher levels of agricultural produc-
tion. In poor households the proportion of women’s income contribution can be greater and hence their
voice in household matters is generally strengthened. In cases where men earn sufficient income from
their farms, they thought it was less important for women to generate additional income; in those cases,
women may focus more on growing fruits and vegetables in the tomorka for household consumption.

Chapter 5  Pillar 3: Voice



Women’s voice on education is strengthened where they earn income, as it is reported to be one
of the first areas where their income is directed. FGDs reported that while men’s income often goes
to pay for everyday household expenses, women most commonly put their income toward children’s
education. This means that women’s income can be significant to families’ future welfare and even more
broadly on a village/community scale.

      “Fifteen years ago, one lady in our village was widowed, with children to support. To generate
      income, she set up a shoemaking workshop in her house and started selling shoes. Thanks to the
      income she generated, her children were supported through education. Today, one of her sons is a
      head doctor in our clinic, another works in Tashkent, and the third son is in the livestock business.
      All is well with the family, they are prosperous and have no difficulties with money.”

5.4 Technology Helps Strengthen Women’s Voices
According to qualitative fieldwork, people in rural areas mainly get their daily information from
media outlets such as television, radio, and newspaper, as well as mahalla committees. Mahalla
committees are also sources of information for female entrepreneurs. Community and raion-level
news is shared with communities via the mahalla committee, members of which often travel to the raion
center to attend meetings and training activities. Through the mahalla committee and other local groups,
women learn about opportunities for daily-wage labor, vacant positions in government institutions and
organizations, and potential customers for their business activities (e.g., requests for sewing, baking, and
so on). Mahalla committees also provide advice for women who want to start businesses.

FGDs revealed that rural women increasingly get their information via new technologies such
as mobile phones. Approximately 70 percent to 90 percent of women in FGDs owned mobile phones
(elderly and younger women often did not own phones). Women tend to use mobile phones to commu-
nicate with friends and relatives and for work. Additionally, mahalla committees and farmers use mobile
phones to inform women about daily-wage opportunities (e.g., weeding and picking cotton). However,
respondents stated that men were more likely to have smartphones (with mobile Internet and other appli-
cations), while women’s phones usually only have calling and texting capacities.

However, women reported that they do not generally utilize new technologies to search for jobs or
information related to income-generating activities. Women who have access to the Internet (typi-
cally full-time employees) reported using it to check weather conditions. Very few female respondents
used the Internet to look for jobs or income-generating activities. In general, men tend to have greater
access to information than women, either through smartphones or computer-connected Internet (men
typically have more freedom to travel outside the home to access information).

The exceptions were women with businesses in rural areas who communicated that they actively use
new technologies for work-related activities. Women also conduct work-related Internet searches—for
new recipes, fashion designs, and haircuts—to discuss potential services with clients. Business women
tend to use their mobile phones as a camera, calculator, calendar, and work planner, and for communicat-
ing with customers.

      “My mobile phone helps me run my business. I contact my clients via the phone and if a client
      wants to alter their order, they contact me over the phone. I also use my phone to take photos of
      dresses that I see in shops and keep them for future reference.”

The main barriers to technology use in rural areas relate to supply-side availability, affordability,
and reliability, and demand-side capacity challenges. While most FGDs said that mobile Internet was
available in the areas sampled, the connection quality can be poor and the price high. Frequent electricity
outages, particularly in winter, compromise use of smartphones (in that it is difficult to charge them) for
both work and leisure. In terms of capacities, many older community members are unable to use new
technology devices.

Although some employment groups post job vacancies and business services online, many rural
villagers seem uninformed about those practices and unable to easily access them. For example,
key informants from employment centers stated that they publish job vacancies on their website, and
representatives from one-window services suggested that entrepreneurs register their businesses online.
However, FGDs revealed that most rural men and women were unaware of these services and, further-
more, may not consistently have access to the Internet to make them useful.

                                       Conclusions




Analyzing Uzbekistan’s rural labor market through the lens of the analytical framework (see Fig-
ure 1, confirms that gender strongly influences opportunities and barriers in accessing livelihoods
in Uzbekistan. Rural women face many inequalities and constraints in increasing their socioeconomic
resilience. Analyzing secondary quantitative data and primary qualitative data provided evidence of
numerous obstacles that limit women’s time, mobility, access to and control over resources, and deci-
sion-making power across physical and human capital, livelihoods and income generation, and voice
pillars of the framework. There remains a need to overcome some persisting social, economic, political,
and cultural gender biases and stereotypes. These factors hinder not only women’s prospects for sustain-
able livelihoods, but also those of their families and communities.

In particular, the capability approach revealed that rural women, and factors enabling their work,
face significant supply-side challenges. Rural women’s livelihood options are limited by numerous
factors, including (1) a general lack of formal employment opportunities in rural areas; (2) barriers to
accessing those opportunities; (3) changing labor demands, particularly in sectors in which women are
active (such as reduced opportunities because of cotton mechanization); and (4) limited formal support
structures for female entrepreneurs/business activities (in the form of access to finance, business support,
training, and so on).

The study permitted a detailed look at critical aspects of women’s status in Uzbekistan and
revealed insights into how to achieve greater empowerment and involvement in the labor market.
This provided selected evidence of strengthened elements within each of the three pillars, which has led
to some increased opportunities for women. However, progress is gradual and uneven, and more sup-
port is needed. In some areas of analysis, gender disparities are waning and cultural norms and practices
are evolving toward greater equity. Improvements in certain elements of each framework pillar provide
encouraging progress that can be built upon. For example, it is evident that there have been some cultural
shifts away from strict traditional gender roles, and women now have greater freedoms. The study also
emphasized the increasing role that small businesses and female entrepreneurs play in rural area farm
and nonfarm sectors, in terms of offering women employment options. Such activities will need to be

                                                                                                Conclusions



nurtured and scaled up, particularly in the context of recently reduced migrant work opportunities, and
given the significant numbers of young people (including women) entering the workforce annually.

The study confirmed that in Uzbekistan, there is strong interdependency between the pillars of
the analytical framework; the pillars have both simultaneous and sequential components that are
necessary to increase women’s agency and support their aspirations. In terms of capacity building,
components of human capital—such as education and health—must be in place to help shape women’s
pathways to employment opportunities and voice. Therefore, the former need to be supported before the
latter can be facilitated. Similarly, critical physical and institutional infrastructure needs to be in place
first to allow women to benefit from enhanced human capital.

On the one hand, deficiencies in any pillar create greater barriers to women’s overall aspirations;
on the other hand, improvements in one pillar reinforce components of the others. This study
has helped recognize how to facilitate the latter. The interdependence of the pillars means that both
positive and negative changes influence women’s opportunities. It may be possible to create virtuous
cycles. For example, providing support to women to start enterprises, as well as supporting those who
have already established them, can raise and amplify women’s voices. This in turn gives women greater
agency and control over household and community decisions and sets positive examples for future gen-
erations of women.

Recognizing and understanding the interdependence and simultaneous and sequential linkages of
the three pillars provides a solid foundation around which policies and operational recommenda-
tions can be developed. The framework can be used as a basis to help prioritize policies that promote
greater agency for women and support their aspirations to achieve gender equality in a growing and
progressive Uzbekistan.

Despite some limitations, the study approach proved effective in capturing rural women’s perspec-
tives. It presents an important contribution to the national dialogue around gender and women’s
issues, particularly regarding employment prospects. The study can help generate consensus on
what should be done to improve their situation. Based on a small but illustrative sample size, the study
provides evidence-based policy and operational recommendations for the GoU. The collaboration with
government counterparts and national researchers proved successful and has added valuable national
perspective to the study.

The study achieved its objectives and provides policy and operational recommendations for the
GoU and the World Bank to now consider and translate into action. These recommendations are
contained overleaf.

                                        Recommendations




The audience for this study is the GoU and the World Bank. Based on the study’s findings,
the following policy and operational proposals are recommended for further investigation and
consideration.



7.1  Women’s Access to Livelihoods

7.1.1  Livelihoods: Policy Recommendations
■■    Empower local authorities at regional and local levels to draw on existing administrative resources to
      (1) support existing female entrepreneurs in rural areas to expand their businesses and employ more
      women and (2) link rural businesses to urban markets. These two initiatives can be achieved through
      measures such as repurposing unused or underutilized public buildings for women’s businesses and
      facilitating information events and trade fairs, or introducing tax and utility costs breaks.
■■    Introduce incentives to support female employment and entrepreneurship in the growing agricultural
      subsectors in which women expressed interest in working, such as horticulture, greenhouses, live-
      stock, and food processing.
■■    Collect gender-disaggregated data on key parameters of the labor market.
■■    Monitor the gendered impact of labor activation programs by aligning the indicators and definitions
      of employment and labor market participation to international standards.
■■    Encourage the employment of women in sectors traditionally dominated by men.
■■    Introduce quotas for female employment in the public sectors (including state-owned companies)
      and short-term wage subsidies for private companies to employ young, female graduates in technical
      fields. These measures could also be completed by employability skills training courses for young
      graduates.

                                                         7.2  Women’s Access to Physical and Human Capital



7.1.2  Operational Recommendations
■■   Conduct public awareness and promotional campaigns that highlight the experience of successful
     female entrepreneurs to help encourage girls and women to pursue business activities and to educate
     men about the benefits of women’s increased freedom and employment.
■■   Conduct gender focused market research and value chain analysis to identify areas where demand
     for services and goods produced by rural women is high and/or predicted to grow.
■■   Conduct targeted information campaigns and training activities for women farmers.
■■   Make regular agricultural extension services more accessible to women and focused on their needs.



7.2  Women’s Access to Physical and Human Capital

7.2.1  Education: Policy Recommendations
■■   Improve the quality and coverage of early childhood education and child care services both by state
     and private providers, including a range of alternative forms, such as family-run kindergartens, early
     development centers, Sunday schools, short-term courses for children, and so on.
■■   Increase funding to child care and preschool education to improve their quality and create legal and
     policy conditions that are conducive to private investment. This could promote a flexible, multi-
     variate system of education that caters to the needs of different rural population groups. A first step
     would be to review sound international practices on stimulating the development of private and
     public-private partnerships for child care and preschool institutions.
■■   Formalize and provide interim financial and resourcing support to family kindergartens in rural
     areas.
■■   Synchronize vocational educational opportunities with growth sectors (such as engineering, natural
     sciences, education, and technology), so women can transition into those sectors.
■■   Revise the structure of vocational colleges to provide vocational training scholarships to girls and
     create aspirational quotas for female attendance.
■■   Strengthen the links between vocational education programs and companies that would be able to
     employ college graduates.

7.2.2  Education: Operational Recommendations
■■   Make short-term vocational courses available to rural women to improve their business and associ-
     ated support skills (e.g., accounting, legal). Such courses could also target girls finishing secondary
     school, as a support for transitioning to higher education or employment.
■■   Provide support via incentives to address the female drop-off rate from secondary school to higher
     education, particularly in fields where demand is predicted to grow (such as engineering, natural sci-
     ences, education, and technology).
■■   Build on the results of value chain analysis to develop and deliver new short-term courses for upskill-
     ing women in disciplines that are anticipated to increase in demand. The Women’s Committee can
     serve as the main partner for this initiative.
■■   Introduce distant learning modules so young women from rural areas can access higher education
     without needing to relocate to urban centers.


                                                                                                        67
Chapter 7  Policy and Operational Recommendations



7.2.3  Financial Services: Policy Recommendations
■■    Improve women’s access to loan services via property registration revisions, where they are regis-
      tered as co-owners of properties.
■■    Make loans available that are flexible as per the cycles of seasonal rural production.
■■    Encourage formal financial institutions to consider alternative forms of collateral for rural house-
      holds. Current forms of collateral are biased against rural households, which often do not have
      incomes from full-time employment or assets such as modern vehicles. Hence, forms of collateral
      more common to rural households could be considered, such as livestock.

7.2.4  Local Infrastructure: Operational Recommendations
■■    Improve the rural population’s financial education to help keep financial institutions accountable and
      customer driven. This could be done in conjunction with established local intermediary organiza-
      tions, such as mahalla committees, employment centers, and women’s committees.
■■    Develop financial products that are demand based and flexible enough to recognize regional differ-
      ences in local economic drivers (e.g., horticultural focus, dairy production, cotton, textiles, and so on).
■■    Establish a network of nonbank lending services, which may increase competition and enhance
      options for consumers. This could help improve the regulatory environment of the nonbank micro-
      credit sector. This could be done in collaboration with the National Association of Microfinance
      Institutions and in accordance with international best practices.
■■    Investigate measures through microfinance schemes and combine and modernize informal savings
      and lending networks.
■■    Drawing on the vast network of specialized secondary education facilities across the country, sup-
      plement formal vocation education curriculum with a range of short, targeted courses that feature
      applied skills on how to run a business in areas of most interest to women—horticulture, greenhouse
      management, food processing, bakery, and so on.

7.2.5  Local Infrastructure: Policy Recommendations
■■    Institute public-private partnerships and tariff reforms to make existing infrastructure utilize resources
      more efficiently. Loss reductions may be incentivized via billing based on consumption volumes and
      by identifying network losses.
■■    Strengthen the role of local authorities in managing selected local communal services and
      infrastructure.

7.2.6  Local Infrastructure: Operational Recommendations
■■    Pilot small-scale models for decentralized utilities infrastructure in rural areas.
■■    Implement gender mainstreaming across all stages of planning, construction, and financing of infra-
      structure to ensure equitable access. Mechanisms to facilitate this could include expanding legal
      outreach services for women, introducing quotas for women’s participation in community groups,
      and collecting gender-disaggregated data.
■■    Improve citizen feedback mechanisms for infrastructure and utility providers to promote transpar-
      ency and accountability for services provided.

7.3  Amplifying Women’s Voices

7.3.1  Women’s Voices: Policy Recommendations
■■   Promote greater gender equity in senior political and government positions by adopting aspirational
     quotas. This could help empower women at the local level.

7.3.2  Women’s Voices: Operational Recommendations
■■   Identify and promote successful female entrepreneurs as advocates and role models to increase
     women’s voices.
■■   Conduct public awareness campaigns about institutions that support rural women’s issues in general
     and women’s employment more specifically. Currently, many rural women are unaware of the local
     services available to them.
■■   Incorporate CDD principles into local interventions, such as by holding separate women’s-only
     meetings where appropriate; holding meetings at appropriate times of day (and where women are
     encouraged to bring children); featuring female staff as facilitators; undertaking gender analysis
     activities for men and women; and adopting gender indicators and gender-equality strategies.
■■   Draw on information and communication technologies to connect women from rural areas to profes-
     sional and trade networks in urban centers.
■■   Support the development of local-level cooperative models for the co-production of goods and ser-
     vices to improve women’s bargaining power with the buyers of their products and services.
■■   Develop a strategic framework for synergetic collaboration to stimulate female employment and
     entrepreneurship between key organizations focused on these issues—the Women’s Committee, the
     Chamber of Commerce, and local administrations.

Annex 1: Qualitative Methodology
and Sampling
All qualitative study tools were designed to understand the distinct aspirations, opportunities, and
barriers for rural women engaging in income-generating activities. FGDs and KIIs were structured
around the three “families of outcomes” outlined in the study’s analytical framework: (1) physical and
human capital; (2) access to livelihoods/income-generating activities; and (3) voice. Table A.1 outlines
the research themes and guiding questions.

Qualitative research comprised 28 FGDs and 44 KIIs conducted across four geographically con-
trasting regions of Uzbekistan (Jizzakh, Kashkadarya, and Namangan Oblasts, and the Republic of Kara-
kalpakstan) between June 1 and August 31, 2015 (see Figure A.1). The four regions were selected to be
illustrative (not representative) of the range of conditions present in Uzbekistan and also included criteria
of poverty levels and rates of women’s labor force participation. Karakalpakstan and Namangan were
selected as extreme cases, with Karakalpakstan located in the west and characterized by high poverty

rates and high women’s labor force participation, and Namangan located in the east and characterized by
low poverty rates and low women’s labor force participation. In contrast, Kashkadarya, in the southwest,
and Jizzakh, in the center, both contain moderate poverty rates and low-to-moderate labor force partici-
pation. Table A.2 summarizes the selection criteria for each region.

Within each region, sample villages were selected based on two primary characteristics: (1) dis-
tance from raion center; and (2) general availability of water resources.160 Two villages were
selected in each sample region, one of which was close to a raion center and without water availability
challenges, and the other more remotely located from a raion center with some water availability chal-
lenges. Table A.3 outlines the characteristics of selected sample villages.

A total of 285 people participated in FGDs across five demographics. FGDs were segregated into
(1) women with income (who had been earning for at least two or three years); (2) women without
income (and interested in starting a business); (3) men (aged 22–60, including husbands of working
women and fathers of female children pursuing high school or higher education); (4) mahalla commit-
tee members; and (5) recent college graduates (each group contained an equal number of males and
females aged 18 to 21). A matrix of all 28 FGDs is provided in Table A.4. The two women’s FGDs were
further categorized by age (22–40 and 41–60). A total of 143 women, 34 men, 40 college graduates, and
34 mahalla committee members participated, with each FGD ranging in size from 6 to 10 participants.
FGD participants estimated their income levels using self-assessment templates.161

Eleven KIIs were conducted across each of the four regions, three at the district level and eight at
the village level (totaling 44 KIIs for the study). Subgroups of KIIs at the district level included repre-
sentatives from the Women’s Committee, employment centers, and one-window centers. At the village
level KIIs included female entrepreneurs at an early stage of business development, female entrepreneurs
with established businesses, employers in the farm sector, and employers in the nonfarm sector.



160	Itwas hypothesized that distance from raion center can influence level of economic activity, and water avail-
    ability can influence agricultural productivity. Both were also considered to influence the level of nonfarm
    income-generating opportunities.
161	Potential participants self-assessed their income groups based on “we don’t have enough money for food”; “we

    have enough money for food, but buying clothes is difficult”; “we have enough money for food and clothes and
    can save some money, but not enough to buy expensive goods (such as a TV or refrigerator)”; “we can afford to
    buy certain expensive goods (such as a TV or refrigerator)”; and “we can afford to buy whatever we want.”

The World Bank study team designed and coordinated the qualitative research in conjunction with
a local research firm. The World Bank team designed the qualitative research instruments and worked
collaboratively with local consulting firm Al Mar Consulting. FGD facilitator and KII interviewer train-
ing in Tashkent was followed by pilot testing in the field (in the Syrdarya region). The World Bank team
worked with Al Mar Consulting during full-scale fieldwork and analysis.
