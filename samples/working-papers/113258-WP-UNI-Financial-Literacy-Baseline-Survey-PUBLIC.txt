Nigeria is an entrepreneurial economy with an estimated
37 million micro-, small-, and medium-sized companies in the
country, and their contribution to economic growth and job
creation is significant. There are also a large number of self-
employed entrepreneurs who support themselves and their
families by supplying goods and services to the economy.
Many of these businesses have the potential to become
bigger and more prosperous, but their growth is restricted for
a variety of reasons. Access to finance has been singled out as
a crucial prerequisite to the growth of these businesses.

This report is based on research commissioned by the
Central Bank of Nigeria and IFC to understand the awareness,
perceptions, and behavior of micro-, small-, and medium-
sized enterprises with regard to access to finance and
financial services. The objective was to gain an understanding
of the current knowledge and use of credit, credit
information, credit bureau services, and collateral in Nigeria.




The research was conducted in Lagos, Rivers,    The study found that access to credit among      applicant (information asymmetry) and

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FOR MSMEs

This section investigates and highlights the respondents’
perception of the state of the business environment for MSMEs
in the next five years. It also looks at what factors are considered
likely to be critical to the business environment during this time.
Overall, there is optimism about the economy in the next few
years, although the qualitative interviews showed that there is
considerable concern regarding the exchange rate and the effect
of the depreciation of the Naira on the overall economy.

 KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF COLLATERAL

 Although collateral requirements are the biggest challenge
 when it comes to formal access to finance for MSMEs and
 entrepreneurs in Nigeria, the possibility of using different
 types of collateral – including moveable assets like vehicles
 or machinery – could make it much easier for the small-scale
 business sector to obtain loans from financial institutions.

KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF CREDIT INFORMATION
AND CREDIT BUREAU SERVICES

Even though credit bureaus have been established in Nigeria
since 2009, there is still a relatively low level of awareness on the
benefits of the services that the credit reporting system can offer
to the financial sector and the economy. A vast majority of MSMEs
(85 percent) and employees (89 percent) surveyed for this report
stated that they are not aware of the credit reporting system.
However, 100 percent of respondents from financial institutions
were aware of the credit reporting system already in place.
