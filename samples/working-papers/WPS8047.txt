  Abstract
 This study investigates the impact of World Bank develop-                          specifications and sample restrictions, and controlling for
 ment policy loans on the ease of doing business. It finds                          possible endogeneity. When the cumulative number of
 that the cumulative number of development policy loans                             loans and their cumulative value are included in the regres-
 enhances business climate, especially for less developed coun-                     sion, the value is no longer significant. This finding suggests
 tries and when combined with an International Monetary                             that overall engagement with the World Bank is more rel-
 Fund assistance program. The results are robust to several                         evant than the amount of resources invested in the project.

1        Introduction

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals call for a new approach to development ﬁnance.

The primary ambition of the goals is to mobilize resources commensurate with the scale of the

challenge. The new consensus recognizes that the most eﬀective solutions to development problems

involve the interplay of private investment and public policy.1 In developing countries, the private

sector can invest in and implement solutions that spur productivity, create jobs, and foster income

growth. However, in order to thrive, a vibrant private sector requires access to market opportunities.

It also requires an environment that will eﬃciently allocate resources. This process is fostered by

good regulation, trade openness, dynamic entrepreneurship and innovation, and sector-speciﬁc

approaches to tackling market failures.

        The World Bank has great expertise in helping countries enhance competitiveness by improving

business regulations, facilitating access to ﬁnance, and protecting property rights. Among the

Bank’s lending instruments, Development Policy Loans (DPLs) most speciﬁcally target public

policy and therefore have the highest chance of promoting a healthy business environment. The

World Bank introduced its ﬁrst general budget support instrument in 1980, with the aim of helping

client countries achieve sustainable growth and poverty reduction through policy and institutional

activities. In 2004 the approach to this policy-based ﬁnancing was substantially modiﬁed. Since

then, the World Bank has committed to about $130 billion in DPLs, representing about 30 percent

of total World Bank lending.2 The sizable amount allocated to these operations and the scarcity of

available resources for development call for a better understanding of how DPLs can achieve more

eﬀective results. This should be a matter of concern, especially if one strives for the most eﬃcient

allocation of these resources.

        External research and various internal evaluations have assessed the impact of World Bank

Development Policy Lending. The results obtained by these studies are mixed, partially due to
    1

for Development: Multilateral Development Finance”, prepared jointly by the African Development Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the
Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank Group for the April 18,
2015 Development Committee meeting.

diﬀerences in the dependent variable, time frame, and strategies adopted to address the important

selection bias problems inherent in these analyses.

    As for the dependent variable, many studies, especially those focusing on previous generations of

policy-based support, have considered the impact of the World Bank DPLs on broad macroeconomic

and public ﬁnance indicators.3 In a recent paper, Smets and Knack (2014) discuss the impact of

DPLs on the quality of economic management, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy

and Institutional Assessment. Like them, we focus on the most recent generation of policy-based

support (i.e., all operations approved after the 2004 reform) and refrain from assessing DPLs’ eﬀect

on variables representing ﬁnal outcomes, such as economic growth, macroeconomic stability or

poverty reduction. Instead, we look at the impact of DPLs on the business environment.

    The Doing Business survey, carried out by the World Bank’s Research Department, provides

one of most widely used measures of the ease of doing business. It produces objective indicators

of business regulations and the protection of property rights that can either enhance or constrain

business activity for ﬁrms in about 190 economies going back to 2004. The measures are obtained by

surveying experts in each country about the legally required time and costs of regulatory compliance

for various aspects of private enterprise, such as starting a business, dealing with construction

permits, getting credit, and enforcing contracts. According to these data, OECD high-income

economies have on average the most business-friendly regulatory systems, followed by Europe and

Central Asia. The Sub-Saharan Africa region continues to be home to the economies with the least

business-friendly regulations on average, despite the relatively large improvement recorded for these

economies in recent years.

    The comparability of quantitative indicators across a large number of economies and over time

makes the Doing Business survey a potentially ideal source of data for empirical work aiming

to investigate the impact of business regulation both within and across countries. However, the

ability of these indicators to capture the real investment climate that most ﬁrms actually experience

has been questioned on several grounds. For example, Hallward-Driemeier and Pritchett (2015)
   3
     Previous generations of policy-based support addressed areas of macroeconomic stabilization, trade integration,
privatization and tariﬀ reforms, among others. Over the past decade DPF in a number of countries has evolved to
sector-speciﬁc operations focusing on critical areas such as energy, governance or social protection.

argue that in developing countries, even if the legal environment creates complex and burdensome

regulatory procedures, the state’s weak capability and desire to implement regulations may allow

ﬁrms to circumvent those regulations, through bribery for example. They ﬁnd that the numerical

estimates provided by the Doing Business survey of legally required time and costs to complete

certain regulatory processes do not accurately square with the experience of ﬁrms as measured by

the World Bank Enterprise Survey, which asks ﬁrms about how business is actually done. We

recognize that the Doing Business indicators may be an imperfect measure of how conducive a

country’s regulation is for business. Indeed, the indicators do not cover important elements of

the business climate, like security, corruption, market size, ﬁnancial stability, or infrastructure.

Furthermore, they do not consider important labor market features, such as workers’ skills and

the ﬂexibility of working hours. Nonetheless, the indicators provide a timely, broad picture of

institutional features that aﬀect the business environment for all countries. Of course, countries

can have good rules and bad practices: the diﬀerence between ”the rule” and ”the practice” is

important, but this does not make the quality of the rules less relevant.

   As mentioned above, analyzing the eﬃcacy of World Bank ﬁnanced policy interventions involves

important methodological problems. This is because of the selection bias problems inherent in this

kind of operation. The bias can go in two directions. On the one hand, countries receiving support

are likely to be those that are most in need. Thus, a negative association between DPLs and

outcomes does not necessarily imply that DPLs are counterproductive. On the other hand, the

World Bank can choose to engage with countries more likely to achieve positive results, because, for

example, they are more reform-prone. If this is the case, a positive association between the Doing

Business score and the World Bank’s operations may capture this reverse causality rather than the

eﬀectiveness of policy loans. These problems clearly call for robust identiﬁcation strategies.

   To address the ﬁrst type of selection bias, following Easterly (2005) and Smets and Knack

(2014), we focus on the cumulative number of policy loans, or alternatively their cumulative value,

instead of considering policy loans as independent events. As Easterly (2005) points out, using

cumulative policy loans changes the nature of the selection bias: if the ”treatment” is repeated,

this suggests that either it has not been eﬀective or, more favorably, that the adjustment is a


                                                 3
multistage process and its completion requires multiple loans. In this latter case, we should observe

an improvement in performance, either gradual or all at once after a certain number of loans.

We also consider changes in the Doing Business score, instead of its level, in a cross-sectional

estimation. To investigate whether our estimates are biased upward because loans tend to go to

motivated governments, we try using instrumental variable regressions.

   Finally, unlike other investment projects, DPLs ﬁnance reforms whose costs cannot be easily

assessed. Therefore, the value of resources allocated to these projects is absolutely arbitrary. Unlike

previous studies on this topic, our analysis considers both the number and the size of DPLs, and

tries to answer the following empirical questions: is there an appropriate size for DPLs? Are large

DPLs useful, or could the same results be achieved with a lower consumption of resources? We

believe that in a resource-constrained environment, where opportunity costs are relevant, these are

important issues to examine.

   Our main result is that the World Bank’s DPLs enhance business climate, especially for less

developed countries and when combined with an IMF assistance program. Quantitatively, the size

of the impact is inversely related to the level of the Doing Business indicator and to the number

of DPLs the country has received. For example, in a country like Mali, which received 10 DPLs

and is below the sample mean in terms of Doing Business, an additional DPL yields an increase

in the Doing Business indicator of about 0.47 percent. Alternatively, in a country like Colombia,

which received 20 DPLs and is above the mean of Doing Business, an additional DPL yields an

increase in the Doing Business indicator of about 0.16 percent. The positive association between

DPLs and Doing Business is robust to a number of diﬀerent speciﬁcations and sample restrictions,

and controlling for possible endogeneity. Importantly, when both the cumulative number of loans

and their cumulative value are included in the regression, the value is no longer signiﬁcant. This

suggests that the overall engagement with the World Bank is more relevant than the amount of

resources invested in the project.

   The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data and some descriptive statistics

of our sample; Section 3 describes the econometric speciﬁcation and presents the empirical results

from our benchmark model, as well as some robustness checks and corrections for endogeneity;

Section 4 concludes.



2        Data

Our dependent variable is the distance to frontier indicator taken from the World Bank Doing

Business report series. Ease of doing business is measured in 10 areas of a ﬁrm’s operations: start-

ing a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting

credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and

resolving insolvency. The distance to the frontier score shows the distance of each economy from

the ”frontier”, which is the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies

in the Doing Business sample. An economy’s distance to frontier is reﬂected on a scale of 0 to 100,

where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. As not all areas are

measured as far back as 2004, we compute four scores, each obtained as the average, by country and

year, of diﬀerent subsets of indicators depending on their availability in various years. The longest

time series contains averages of the distance to frontier scores in starting a business, enforcing con-

tracts, and resolving insolvency, which are available from 2004 onwards. Another series is available

from 2005 onwards and is obtained from the average score recorded from the three areas mentioned

above and the two available from 2005 (registering property and getting credit). Data from 2006

dealing with construction permits, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and trading across

borders became available and are included in a third series of the average score. Data for getting

electricity is available from 2010 onward and is included in the overall measure of distance to the

frontier. Our results are robust to changes in the deﬁnition of our dependent variable.

        All the information regarding the lending projects is taken from the Work Bank Projects and

Operations database.4 Our analysis focuses on Development Policy Loans (DPLs). This lending

instrument was launched by the World Bank in 1980 to provide conditional ﬁnancing in support of

speciﬁc policy changes in recipient countries. It was then reformed in 2004 to address some limita-

tions and a mixed track record for the original policy-based support. Because of the availability of

the Doing Business indicators and changes in the World Bank’s approach toward policy-based lend-

ing, our data set includes all DPLs approved by the Board from 2004 to the ﬁrst months of 2016,

representing 690 operations and approximately $130 billion worth of commitments. We consider

all DPLs, irrespective of the sectors they speciﬁcally claim to target. As a matter of fact, basically

all DPLs include elements that either directly or indirectly can improve the business environment,

and choosing between them is not straightforward. However, as we believe that a well-functioning

public sector administration is an essential prerequisite to foster business, we also present results

only for those DPLs targeting reforms in the public administration area.5 Unlike the more tradi-

tional investment project ﬁnancing, DPLs are approved under the condition that the government

in the recipient country implement a set of policy reforms, called ”prior actions”. We can thus

reasonably expect that the eﬀect of a DPL on the Doing Business score, if any, occurs concurrently

with its Board approval. Furthermore, following Easterly (2005) and Smets and Knack (2014), we

focus on the cumulative number of policy loans, to assess the impact of repeated lending to the

same country. We are also interested in investigating whether the size of these loans matters. We

therefore compute the cumulative value (in current dollars) committed to each country.

       As control variables, we include GDP per capita and total oﬃcial aid received by each country

in each year from all donors. These variables, as well as the population, which we use to normalize

some explanatory variables and in our instrumental variables estimation, are taken from the World

Development Indicators database. We also create a dummy variable capturing whether the country

is under an IMF assistance program for the year that the ease of doing business is assessed. This

information is taken from the IMF website.

       In Table 1 we report some descriptive statistics of the main variables contained in our data

set for the top 20 DPL recipients (countries that received 10 or more loans). All measures of

performance, including the average Doing Business score, its change, and the growth rate of per

capita GDP are computed over the period starting in the year the country received its ﬁrst DPL
   5
     Linkages with the Doing Business score could be thought of as even tighter for those DPLs explicitly targeting
private sector development. However, while about 420 DPLs, of the 690 operations in our data set, have their
major sector classiﬁed as ”General Public Administration”, ”Central Government Administration”, and ”Sub-national
Government Administration”, the theme ”Infrastructure services for private sector development” appears for only 68
operations. Of these, 30 are in Africa, 15 in East Asia and Paciﬁc, 8 in Europe and Central Asia, 6 in South Asia, 5
in Latin America and Carribean and 4 in Middle-East and North Africa. In all regions the size of these DPLs varies
signiﬁcantly, from a few million to hundreds of millions.



                                                         6
until 2014. Per capita GDP refers to the year the country received its ﬁrst DPL. The same summary

statistics are also presented by region.

    The statistics reported in Table 1 show mixed results. Indeed, intensive recipients of DPL tend

to perform better than the sample average, but with several exceptions. Only 12 among the top

20 DPL recipient countries recorded a larger than average increase in the Doing Business score,

and 13 performed better in terms of per capita GDP growth. In Africa, the region with the largest

number of DPLs, smallest average loan size and weakest Doing Business performance, 6 of the 9 top

recipients managed to achieve larger improvements in their business environment than the region’s

average. In contrast, only half of the intensive recipients in Latin America, Europe and Central

Asia, and East Asia and Paciﬁc exhibited better results than their respective regional averages.

    Of course, this evidence does not say much about whether development policy lending has been

eﬀective in promoting better environments for business activity or good growth outcomes. We

cannot observe counterfactual performances. Moreover, we do not control for additional factors

that may well have aﬀected the outcomes, nor for self-selection biases. This is what we try to do

in the next section.



3     Estimation

We estimate the following equation at the country level using data from 2004:



                                DBi,t = β0 + β1 DP Lsi,t + β2 Zi,t + ηi +        i,t                            (1)

where DBi,t is the average distance to frontier of Doing Business indicators in country i and year

t.6 DP Lsi,t represents the cumulative number (or cumulative value) of development policy loans

for country i in year t. Zi,t is a vector of control variables, which includes the logarithm of GDP

per capita to correct for the possibility that policy quality is inferred in part from performance.

As a robustness exercise, we also control for total oﬃcial aid received by the country in a given
    6
      In our baseline speciﬁcation we use the longest time series of the Doing Business indicator, which includes
averages of three indicators available since 2004. As a robustness check, we also consider averages of wider subsets
of indicators, which however became available only after 2004. See Section 2 for further details.



                                                         7
year over GDP, which may as well induce policy reforms. We also add a time trend to control

for any tendency of the Doing Business ratings to increase over time. ηi is a set of country ﬁxed

eﬀects, and   i,t   the error term. A dummy variable, which takes the value one when there is an IMF

program in place, is also included in the regression, either separately (in our baseline speciﬁcation)

or interacted with the DPL variable.7

    We estimate the coeﬃcients of this model by employing OLS on a comprehensive country-year

panel of aid recipient countries that runs from 2004 to 2014. Standard errors are adjusted for

country clustering of observations.


3.1    Eﬀect of the cumulative number of DPLs

We ﬁrst estimate a linear speciﬁcation. To assess if there are diminishing returns to additional

loans we add a quadratic term, and also estimate a logarithmic model.8 In Table 2 we present

the results obtained for all three functional forms (linear, quadratic and logarithmic). We ﬁnd

strong evidence that Development Policy Financing enhances the business environment. In fact,

the coeﬃcient on the cumulative number of DPLs is positive and highly signiﬁcant. The quadratic

and the logarithmic speciﬁcations suggest that there are decreasing returns to additional loans.

Therefore, in the remainder of our analysis we will focus on the logarithmic speciﬁcation. Not

surprisingly, the Doing Business score is positively correlated with the log GDP per capita, and

is improving over time. It appears lower in the presence of an IMF assistance program (which

may be explained by the fact that critical macroeconomic conditions may weigh on the business

environment), even though the relationship is not statistically signiﬁcant.

    How large is the impact of DPLs on Doing Business? It is instructive to compute the elasticity
   7
      The IMF assessment in program reviews provides a key input into the World Bank team’s assessment, but the
Bank team should make its own assessment (OP 8.60, footnote 4). In cases where there are disagreements over
technical or policy issues, Bank and IMF teams are expected to discuss and reach agreement over any diﬀerences of
opinion and coordinate their policy dialogue. This is facilitated by regular consultations between the Bank and IMF
teams and an explicit understanding on the thematic division of labor on macroeconomic and structural issues in
each country. However, when there is no IMF program in place, the Bank team’s independent assessment is central.
In such cases, the IMF may be asked for a letter of comfort providing its own view of the macroeconomic policies,
but such letters are typically much shorter and less detailed than IMF program reviews (IMF 2003). Hence the Bank
team’s assessment remains critical.
   8
     To retain the zero observations when making the log transformation, we add 1 to the number of cumulative
DPLs.



                                                        8
of Doing Business to the cumulative number of DPLs. Using the logarithmic speciﬁcation, such

elasticity is β1 /DBi,t , that is, it is inversely related to the level of Doing Business. Yet, it also

depends on how many DPLs the country has received. This elasticity measures the percentage

change in Doing Business with respect to the percentage change in the cumulative number of

DPLs. Take, for instance, a country like Mali, which received 10 DPLs and is below the sample

mean in terms of Doing Business, having an average score of 42. An additional DPL in this

country implies a 10 percent increase in the cumulative value of DPLs, which yields an increase of

the Doing Business indicator of about 0.47 percent. Alternatively, take a country like Colombia,

which received 20 DPLs and is above the mean of Doing Business, with an average score of 60. An

additional DPL in this country implies a 5 percent increase in the cumulative number of DPLs,

which yields an increase of Doing Business of about 0.16 percent.

   In order to understand whether the positive impact of DPLs on the business environment is

driven by any of the regions in which the World Bank operates, we run a series of estimations,

excluding one region at a time from the sample. In Figure 1 we plot the point estimates of all the

various estimates of β1 . The point estimate obtained with the whole sample is depicted as a solid

line and its two standard-error bands as dashed lines. The impact of the cumulative number of

DPLs on the Doing Business indicator remains positive and strong. However, when the African

region is excluded from the regression this impact somewhat weakens, suggesting that this is the

region where DPLs are most eﬀective.

   In Table 3 we report the results of three robustness exercises. We ﬁrst control for diﬀerent

deﬁnitions of our dependent variable. In particular, in the ﬁrst column of Table 3 we present

the estimates obtained using the overall distance to frontier: that is, the average of all 10 Doing

Business indicators available since 2010. The impact of the cumulative number of DPLs remains

strong when using this alternative deﬁnition. We also obtain qualitatively similar results (available

upon request) when we use averages of diﬀerent subsets of the Doing Business indicators (as

described in Section 2).

   In the second column we present the results obtained when restricting our variable of interest

to a subset of DPLs, whose impact on the business environment could be reasonably assumed to


                                                  9
be more direct. More precisely, in this exercise the cumulative number of DPLs includes only those

DPLs that have supported policy reforms in the public administration area, namely those classiﬁed

in the ”General Public Administration”, ”Central Government Administration”, and ”Sub-national

Government Administration” sectors. The relationship between this subset of policy reform loans

and our doing business indicator is still statistically signiﬁcant and, perhaps unsurprisingly, quan-

titatively larger.

   Our results are also robust to the inclusion of another control variable, as shown in the third

column of Table 3. When we we include among the regressors the ratio of total oﬃcial aid over

GDP received by the country in a given year, the results do not change much. We can thus rule out

the possibility that we are capturing the impact of a joint development eﬀort by all donors rather

than the eﬀect of World Bank DPLs.

   Finally, in Table 4 we present separate estimates for the impact of the cumulative number of

DPLs implemented with or without an IMF assistance program, as well as for relatively poor and

rich countries (deﬁned as the countries at the bottom 75th and top 25th percentile of the within-

sample per capita income distribution). The impact of DPLs consistently turns out positive and

highly signiﬁcant, regardless of whether they are accompanied by an IMF arrangement. The pres-

ence of the IMF seems indeed to enhance this eﬀect. However, a formal test rejects the hypothesis

that the impact is statistically diﬀerent when associated with an IMF program. If we allow the

impact of DPLs to be diﬀerent in relatively richer and poorer countries, the estimated coeﬃcient

for countries in the bottom 75 percent of the distribution of borrowers according to per capita GDP

is larger and more precisely estimated with respect to those in the upper 25th percentile. However,

in this case, a formal test cannot support the hypothesis that the two coeﬃcients are statistically

diﬀerent.


3.2    Does the size of DPLs matter?

In this section we investigate whether the value of resources loaned to a country for policy reform

matters for the results. Unlike standard investment projects, DPLs do not ﬁnance operations with

an associated estimated cost. Thus, deciding the amount of dollars to commit for a DPL entails a


                                                 10
substantial degree of arbitrariness.

   To this end, we estimate equation 1 with either the cumulative value of DPLs alone or both

the cumulative number and the cumulative value of DPLs as our variables of interest. The results

are reported in Table 5. As shown in Column 1, the total cumulative value of DPLs has a strong

positive eﬀect on the business environment. However, when both the number and the value are

included in the regression, the value looses its explicative power, which is otherwise retained by the

cumulative number (Column 2). As a robustness check, we also consider the total value of DPLs

as a ratio to GDP or in per capita terms to take into account the size of the country. The results

are reported in Columns 3-4 and 5-6, respectively. The results from an alternative speciﬁcation,

including the average size of DPLs (alone or in addition to the cumulative number of DPLs) are

presented in the last two columns.

   All these results point to the conclusion that DPLs are strongly eﬀective, although their eﬀec-

tiveness does not seem to increase with size. The last column is particularly telling since if the

coeﬃcient of the cumulative number of DPLs and that of the average size were the same it would

imply that only the cumulative value of DPLs matters.

   Thus, our next step is to understand what drives the result that the impact of the number of

DPLs dominates that of their size. To this end we investigate whether the previous ﬁndings hold for

subsets of countries in our sample. In Table 6 we present the results obtained by splitting the sample

into high and low income countries (deﬁned as those at the top 25th and bottom 75th percentile of

the within-sample per capita income distribution), and excluding one region at a time. We focus

on the more compact speciﬁcation, which includes both the cumulative number and average size

of DPLs. The other speciﬁcations deliver the same qualitative results. The number eﬀect clearly

dominates that of the average value of DPLs in all regressions concerning less developed countries

and all sub-groups of countries including Africa. On the contrary, for the countries at the top

quartile and for the sub-group of countries excluding Africa, the eﬀect of the cumulative number

of DPLs is no longer prevailing.

   The evidence suggests that what really aﬀects the results in low income countries is the overall

engagement with the World Bank, regardless of the amount of resources invested in each project.


                                                 11
By contrast, for countries in the upper quartile of the income distribution the size of the project

may also matter. This argument is consistent with the ﬁnding that the impact of DPLs is largest for

less developed countries, especially in Africa, where the average size of DPLs is smallest. Moreover,

it is also broadly in line with the current practice adopted by the World Bank, which tends to

award middle-income countries fewer but relatively sizable loans.


3.3   Controlling for endogeneity of policy lending

As we argue in the Introduction, endogeneity of policy lending can run in two directions. By using

the cumulative number of policy loans (or the cumulative value committed), instead of considering

them as independent events, we have already partially addressed one source of selection bias; that

is, the one generated from the fact that countries receiving support are typically those with larger

policy deﬁciencies. Here, we address the same concern by estimating the following cross-sectional

equation:



                        ∆DBi,T = γ0 + γ1 DBi,0 + γ2 DP Lsi,T + γ3 Zi,t +    i                     (2)

where ∆DBi,T is the change in the average Doing Business indicator over the period 2004-2014,

and DBi,0 is its level in 2004. DP Lsi,T represents the cumulative number of development policy

loans for country i from 2004 to 2014. As a control variable, we also include the logarithm of initial

GDP per capita. We estimate equation 2 using 109 observations, or the number of countries for

which the relevant information is available.

   The results seem robust to this endogeneity check as well (Table 7). There is a positive and

strongly signiﬁcant correlation between the cumulative number of DPLs granted over the years 2004-

2014 and the change in their Doing Business score over the same period. Such an improvement

appears larger for more developed economies (i.e. with higher GDP per capita) and those with

larger initial distances to the Doing Business frontier.

   One could object that the World Bank has chosen to engage only with motivated countries,

and that the reforms we observe would have taken place even in the absence of the Bank’s support.



                                                 12
If such a case, the positive relationship between the Doing Business score and the value of DPLs

that we estimate would be upward biased or even non-existent. To address this concern we rely

on instrumental variables estimations. We ﬁrst estimate equation 1 using our panel data set with

GMM following Arellano and Bover, 1995, Blundell and Bond, 1998, and Windmeijer, 2005.9 This

implies diﬀerentiating the equation and using lagged levels as instruments for the DPLs variable.

The results, reported in Table 8, still show a signiﬁcant positive impact of the cumulative number of

DPLs on the Doing Business score. The eﬀect is larger in size, although statistically less signiﬁcant.

A Sargan test does not reject the null hypothesis that the overidentifying restrictions are valid.

      Finally, as a second correction for possible selection bias we employ 2SLS, again using the

cross-sectional version of our data set, equation 2. We do not perform this analysis using the panel

data set as we could not ﬁnd good instruments for DPLs with suﬃcient time series variation. In

the ﬁrst stage we instrument the number of DPLs with the logarithm of population in 2004 and

the average number of years the country spent under an IMF program. We expect that DPLs,

being relatively sophisticated lending instruments, are more likely to be awarded to large countries.

Furthermore, given their budget support nature, they tend to be associated with IMF assistance

programs. In fact, as shown in the ﬁrst column of Table 9, both these variables are positively and

signiﬁcantly correlated with the number of loans. At the same time, there is no evident reason

why more populous countries or countries frequently assisted by an IMF program should exhibit

better performances in terms of ease of doing business. The results of the second stage, presented in

the second column of Table 9, again point to a positive and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of policy

loans on the business environment. A test of overidentifying restrictions also supports the choice

of instruments. We ﬁnd a strong negative relationship between the change in the Doing Business

score and its initial level, implying a reversion toward the mean eﬀect. Interestingly, once the initial

quality of Doing Business is controlled for, countries with higher initial per capita income appear

to be those with greater chances to take advantage of policy loans.
  9
   The standard GMM robust two-step estimator of the variance-covariance matrix is known to be seriously biased.
Windmeijer (2005) derived a bias-corrected robust estimator for two-step VCEs from GMM estimators, known as the
WC-robust estimator.

4    Concluding remarks

In this paper we have investigated the impact of World Bank Development Policy Financing on the

quality of the business environment, as measured by Doing Business, for a panel of more than 140

borrowing countries from 2004 to 2014. Our choice of the dependent variable recognizes the key

role that private investments play for development.

    Our results point to a strong positive relationship between policy loans and the performance of

a country in Doing Business, even after controlling for endogeneity bias and other factors that could

aﬀect the health of the business environment. The eﬀect is stronger for less developed countries,

and remains statistically signiﬁcant after splitting the sample of countries by region or income level.

    When the cumulative number of loans and their cumulative value are both included in the

regression, the latter loses its explicative power, especially if we restrict the sample to lower income

countries. This suggests that, particularly in less developed countries, what matters more is the

overall engagement with the World Bank rather than the amount of resources invested. For the

countries in the upper quartile the size of the project also matters for results. This last ﬁnding

supports the current practice by the World Bank of awarding middle-income countries with fewer

but relatively sizable loans.

    These results come with a caveat. The bias arising from the fact that the selection of loan

recipient countries may be on the basis of unobservable characteristics (such as the willingness or

ability of the country to introduce business-friendly reforms) represents the major methodological

problem in our analysis. We tried to address this problem by running instrumental variable regres-

sion. However, we still believe that disentangling the truly exogenous component of policy lending

and establishing a causal link between World Bank intervention and ease of doing business should

be studied more. We expect the main qualitative results to hold even after fully addressing this

potential bias. Even allowing for a potential upward bias in our estimates, there is no reason why

it should be systematically higher for lower income countries. Further, there is no reason why the

bias should be diﬀerent when the number or the size of the loans is the covariate of interest. We

leave these questions to future research.
