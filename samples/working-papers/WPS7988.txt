1. Introduction

In April 2014, the Government of Chile proposed a large-scale tax reform, the most significant in 30 years.
Among the main changes were tax increases on tobacco, alcohol, and sugared beverages. Because low-income
families usually allocate a larger proportion of their budgets to tobacco, as well as alcohol and sugary beverages,
at first sight the tax increase would seem to be a regressive policy. However, a closer look shows that the tax
increase and resulting reduction in consumption would lower the adverse effects of tobacco consumption,
including higher medical expenses, the negative effect on life expectancy at birth, added years of disability
among smokers, reductions in the quality of life, and a list of negative externalities among first- and secondhand
smokers. The increase in tobacco tax and the subsequent reduction of tobacco consumption could therefore
result in potential measurable benefits for tobacco consumers. This paper describes and quantifies the effects
of the tobacco tax on incomes through three factors: (1) the tobacco price increase, (2) the reduction in medical
expenses, and (3) the rise in revenues because of the gain in years of employment. To estimate the impact of
these effects, the paper makes various assumptions about the price-elasticity of tobacco and calculates the
income gains among various population income groups.

During the last 15 years, the prevalence of tobacco consumption has been falling around the world, and Chile
is no exception (WHO 2015a).2 According to the Drug Consumption Survey in Chile, monthly tobacco
consumption has decreased from 43.6 percent of the adult population in 1992 to 34.7 percent today.3 These
consumption reductions could relate to policy measures implemented in Chile during the last decade such as
education, taxes, warning labels, and advertising bans. Public anti-tobacco policies in Chile are in line with the
global trend: at least 40 percent of countries have implemented mechanisms to reduce tobacco consumption
during the last two years (WHO 2015a).

There is ample and robust evidence linking tobacco consumption with health-related problems (Doll and Hill
1956; Wynder and Graham 1950). Diseases associated with tobacco use range from lung cancer to stroke and
even to congenital malformations in children (HHS 2014.) In 2010, 5 million early deaths were attributed to
tobacco consumption globally, and, in Chile, the Ministry of Health estimates that 18.5 percent of annual deaths
may be attributable to tobacco use (Jha and Peto 2014; Pichón-Riviere et al. 2014). Scientific evidence linking
tobacco and health problems triggered important policy shifts among international organizations and policy
makers alike, leading to more rigorous normative frameworks on the sale and use of tobacco.

Today, more than 80 percent of the world’s smokers live in low and middle income countries; harming health,
incomes, earning potential, labor productivity, and undermining human capital accumulation – a critical factor
for sustainable economic growth and social development (WHO 2015). The United Nations (UN) has set the
health and wellbeing as one of their priority goals. Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set the
reduction of tobacco consumption as one of its primary goals. It has thus promoted tobacco monitoring,
smoke-free policies, smoking-cessation support programs, relevant health advice, advisory deterrents, and
taxation policies (WHO 2015a). Among strategies, the tobacco tax seems to be one of the most efficient

2 Between 1970 and 2000, tobacco production and consumption showed steady growth around the world. This trend started to change
with the reduction of consumption in the developed countries and increases in the developing world, particularly China (WHO 2015b).
Tobacco prevalence has decreased, but because of population growth, total consumption has increased (Ng et al. 2014).

measures to reduce tobacco consumption and increase government revenue (World Bank 1999). The inelastic
demand of some tobacco consumers is useful for increasing tax revenues; and the higher price elasticity of
younger smokers makes the tax an effective consumption deterrent (Chaloupka et al. 2002; Debrott Sánchez
2006).

A recurrent concern about tobacco tax policies relates to potential negative income inequality effects, as there
is a common believe that these tend to affect the poor more disproportionately. Because low-income
households allocate larger shares of their incomes to consumption and, among expenditures, to purchase
tobacco, indirect taxes tend to affect their monthly budgets disproportionately more than the budgets of more
well off households. Therefore, tobacco taxes directly affect low-income individuals more, compared with other
income groups and other taxes. Nonetheless, if indirect effects are considered, the concern about tobacco tax
policies no longer holds. Indeed, it has been shown that the future benefits of nonsmoking outweigh the losses
attributed to tobacco taxes among the population in general and, specifically, low-income groups (Denisova
and Kuznetsova 2014; Verguet et al. 2015). Still, there is no evidence that these trends are occurring in Chile.

During the past two decades, several anti-tobacco measures have been implemented in Chile, including tax
increases, advertisement regulations, and smoke-free public spaces. Although the policy effort has been
substantial, Chile still has one of the highest tobacco consumption rates in Latin America (WHO 2015a). In
2006, Chile enacted the Anti-Tobacco Law, which includes restrictions on tobacco advertising, a prohibition
on selling cigarettes to students or close to schools, advertising the risks of tobacco consumption and of
exposure to tobacco smoke, and designated smoking areas in restaurants, casinos, or nightclubs (IDB 2011).
Some of these policies have been strengthened further in subsequent normative updates.

The Government of Chile raised the ad valorem tobacco tax to 62.3 percent and the fixed tax to US$0.16 per
package of 20 cigarettes to finance the reconstruction of the areas affected by the earthquake in February 2010
(IDB 2011).4 The change meant that Chile had one of the highest tributary loads for tobacco in the Americas
(Pichón-Riviere et al. 2014). The 2014 Tax Reform reduced the ad valorem tax to 30 percent and substantially
increased the fixed tax to Ch$681 (US$1.28) per 20-cigarette pack.

Beyond short-term changes in tobacco expenditures, the possible benefits of these policies included lower
medical expenditures and more years of healthy life, both of which could translate into private monetary
benefits that more than offset the losses generated by tax increases. To test these hypotheses, we use a social
welfare framework to calculate the effects on various income groups and assume different price-elasticities for
tobacco consumption. To establish a contextual background, section 2 briefly reviews the literature on the
health effects of tobacco, tobacco policies, and tobacco price elasticities. Section 3 describes the methodology,
parameters, and data used to forecast the impact of the tobacco tax. Section 4 presents the estimation results,
and Section 5 concludes with a discussion on implications and policy implications.

2. Literature

There is extensive literature analyzing the health effects of tobacco, public policies, and price elasticities on the
international level, but there is surprisingly little evidence on Chile.

a. Tobacco and health
In the 20th century, about 100 million deaths were potentially related to tobacco use (Peto and Lopez 2004). If
current trends were to remain constant, about 1 billion people could die from tobacco-related diseases during
this century (Jha and Peto 2014). In Chile, over 92,000 children and more than 4 million adults consume tobacco
every day (Tobacco Atlas 2010). Moreover, according to the Chilean Ministry of Health tobacco caused more
than 16,000 deaths in 2013 (nearly 1 in 5 annual deaths). The same year, almost 8,000 Chileans were diagnosed
with cancers related to tobacco consumption.

The relation between tobacco consumption and health problems has been extensively researched since the
1950s (Doll and Hill 1956; Wynder and Graham 1950). According to the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, the conclusion that tobacco consumption is responsible has been reached in many studies of
cancer, including lung cancer, oral cancer, laryngeal cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, cervical cancer,
and acute myeloid leukemia (HHS 2004).

Active smoking is associated with respiratory problems such as tuberculosis, chronic respiratory symptoms,
influenza, pneumonia, infections, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. It is also associated with
cardiovascular diseases, such as aneurysms, strokes, and coronary heart disease, as well as adverse reproductive
and developmental effects, such as congenital malformations in babies, male sexual dysfunction, low birth
weights and complications in pregnancy (HHS 2004, 2014). The exposure to secondhand smoke has a causal
relationship with many respiratory diseases in children. There are more than 4,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke
(of which at least 250 are harmful and more than 50 cause cancer). Although the evidence to infer a relation
between secondhand smoke and cancer or its impact on reproduction is not clear, some research points in this
direction (HHS 2004, 2014). Moreover, according to the World Health Organization, secondhand smoke is
responsible for over 600,000 premature deaths.

b. Tobacco policies
Globally, anti-tobacco policies range from separating smokers in particular locations from completely smoke-
free environments to advertising to deter tobacco use, prohibitions on tobacco sales close to schools, and
taxation and smoking cessation programs. Although various approaches have been assessed, they show diverse
effects in tobacco use and exposure among the population.

WHO (2015a) argues that entirely smoke-free environments, rather than separate smoking rooms or good
ventilation systems, are the only way to prevent the harmful consequences of secondhand tobacco smoke.
Smoke-free laws are popular because there is evidence showing they not only improve health outcomes, but do
not affect business. In 2014, these laws benefited 18 percent of the world's population, and Chile was one of
five countries that had implemented a smoke-free law covering all public places and all workplaces (WHO
2015a).5 The benefits depended on the breadth of the legislation. For example, prohibiting smoking in all indoor
workplaces reduced the exposure to secondhand smoke by 80–90 percent and decreased the incidence of acute
respiratory illness (IARC 2009). However, the impact of smoke-free policies on consumption is small compared
with taxation. Levy et al. (2012) estimate that the vast reduction in tobacco use in Brazil was mostly caused by
higher tobacco prices (46 percent of the impact) and smoke-free policies (14 percent).



5. In 2014, 1.3 billion people (18 percent of the world's population in 49 countries) were covered at the most comprehensive level of

smoke-free policies, an increase of about 200 million people since 2012 (WHO 2015a).


                                                                                                                                   4
In 2014, about 15 percent of the world's population had access to smoking cessation support programs, 2
percent more than in 2012.6 These programs represent the fifth most widespread policy in the world (WHO
2015a). They significantly raise quit rates among smokers who want to quit (Fiore and the Guideline Panel
2008). They are more cost-effective relative to other health care programs (Cromwell et al. 1997). Even though
they are an effective way to quit, they consider only the group of addicted individuals who want to be treated.
Their provision is also associated with country income, and they are widely concentrated in high-income
countries.

Another way to discourage tobacco consumption is through health warning labeling on tobacco packages. This
is the third most common policy against cigarettes in the world. In 2014, almost 20 percent of the world’s
population was being exposed to such labeling. Warning labels are widely supported by the public and must be
redesigned regularly to maintain their impact. They may not represent a cost to governments (WHO 2015a).
The use of warnings may influence people against tobacco consumption; however, their use would account for
only a marginal decrease (Borland 1997; Fathelrahman et al. 2009; Levy et al. 2012).

Mass media campaigns that reach large populations represent the most massive way to combat tobacco use. In
2014, such campaigns covered 55 percent of the world's population. People in low-income countries are less
likely to be exposed to campaigns, and there is also limited information about the cost-effectiveness of this
approach (WHO 2015a). Durkin, Brennan, and Wakefield (2011) conclude that mass media prevention
programs could promote quitting. The impact depends on the duration of the campaigns, especially among
low-income smokers. It also depends on the message; information about the adverse health risks of smoking
are the most efficient means to reach users.

c. Tobacco taxes
Although media campaigns are cost-effective, tobacco taxation is considered one of the most efficient measures
for reducing tobacco consumption; as a second-level benefit, they also increase government revenue (World
Bank 1999).7 Because both effects are desirable from a policy standpoint, the use of taxes is economically
justified on the externalities caused by tobacco. The higher price elasticity of young people makes taxes a good
way to fight tobacco. Chile is one of the countries covered by higher tobacco taxes (WHO 2015a).

Institutions such as IDB (2010), WHO (2008), The International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC, 2011),
and the World Bank (1999) and authors such as Levy et al. (2014) have associated price increases with significant
declines in tobacco consumption. They estimate that higher taxes are responsible for almost 50 percent of the
decline in smoking. The effects of these policies mainly depend on the type of taxes. Ad valorem taxes consider
a portion of the price; so tobacco companies have the opportunity to avoid higher taxes by setting lower prices.
For this reason, the levels of consumption and the amount of government tax revenue depend on the industry
pricing strategy. Alternatively, specific excise taxes establish a fixed tax amount, although they must be adjusted
periodically for inflation to accomplish their mission, and they are associated with the risk of encouraging
contraband sales (WHO 2015a). The taxation system in Chile considers both types of tobacco taxes: the recent
tax increase on tobacco included a reduction in the ad valorem tax and a significant increase in the specific
excise tax. These measures are aligned with WHO (2010) best practice recommendations, making almost every
cigarette brand in Chile equally costly.

6 Smoking cessation support programs are implemented in 24 countries and cover 1.1 billion people (WHO 2015a).
7 Tobacco tax increases have also been associated with the increase of contraband and illegal tobacco sales, reducing the expected
increase in government revenue. (Jha, P., & Chaloupka, F. J. (2000))


                                                                                                                                     5
d. The price elasticity of tobacco consumption
The measurement of price elasticity is crucial in defining and calibrating taxation systems because it determines
the sensitivity of demand to a change in tobacco prices. In general, tax increases generate more impact on
tobacco consumption in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries (WHO 2015a).

There is an extensive literature defining the relationship between tobacco prices and consumption. Guindon
(2013) provides a broad review of 26 international studies. Chaloupka and Grossman (1996) and Lewit and
Coate (1981) estimate the elasticity among under-18-year-olds in the United States at values of −1.44 and −1.31,
respectively. Among adults ages 18 years and older, Chaloupka (1991) and Lewit and Coate (1981) estimate the
elasticity in the United States at between −0.27 and −0.42. For Latin America, Guindon, Paraje, and Chaloupka
(2015) analyze 32 studies and conclude that the price elasticity is likely to be below −0.5. Carvalho and Lobão
(1998) and Iglesias and Nicolau (2006) calculate the short-run price elasticity in Brazil, and Ramos and Curti
(2006) do same in Uruguay. The results in both countries range between −0.2 and −0.6. In Argentina and
Mexico, the estimations are slightly lower. Gonzáles Rozada and Rodríguez-Iglesias (2013) and Olivera-Chávez
et al. (2010) calculate a short-term price elasticity at between −0.10 and −0.30. Debrott Sánchez (2006) estimates
a general price elasticity in Chile of −0.21 and calculates that the price elasticity in the short and long term is
−0.22 and −0.45, respectively.

Thus, some studies find lower-bound elasticities between −0.1 and −0.3, while other researchers find medium-
bound elasticities between −0.3 and −0.6. A third set of studies finds higher-bound elasticities, from −0.6 to
−1.5, in particular among younger population groups and low-income countries. A similar classification can be
found in China (Hu et al. 2010).

There are two important relationships between tobacco price elasticities, income and age. People from low
income groups have shown to have more elastic demands than medium and higher income groups of the
population (Jha & Chaloupka 1999). At the same time, young groups of the population are also more responsive
to tax increases because they tend to be less affected by addiction, more affected by peer effects and at the same
time have less disposable income (Jha & Chaloupka 1999). Studies in United States have consistently shown
that younger groups of the population have higher elasticities than older groups (for example, U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention,1998). Chaloupka and Grossman (1996) and Lewit and Coate (1981).

e. Further costs of tobacco: Life, work, and medical expenses
The major costs of tobacco consumption beyond the direct price effects are associated with public and private
health costs. Tobacco-related health costs are usually considered to be either direct or indirect. Direct costs
include the monetary value of the consumption of goods and services motivated and, in many cases, compelled
because of tobacco use. These are divided into health care costs (hospitalization, medication, medical supplies,
equipment, and so on) and non–health care costs (job replacements for sick smokers, insurance, cleaning up
the cigarette ash, stubs, packaging, and smoke residue of smokers, and so on). The indirect costs include the
loss of productivity because of lost working days related to smoking illnesses and the value of the lives
prematurely lost. Both effects are incorporated in the disability-adjusted life years indicator (WHO 2011).

Focusing on the costs of health systems, Lightwood et al. (2000) estimate the cost of tobacco use. They suggest
that the gross health cost in high-income countries fluctuates between 0.1 and 1.0 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP). Limited data inhibit accurate estimates on low- and middle-countries, but the authors argue
that the price elasticity could be as high as the elasticities in high-income countries. Meanwhile, Verguet et al.



                                                                                                                 6
(2015) analyze the health effects of a price increase in China. Their research concludes that a 50 percent rise in
prices would result in 231 million years of life gained over 50 years, with a significant impact in the lowest
income quintile. Pichón-Riviere et al. (2014) estimate that tobacco use in Chile would reduce life expectancy by
nearly 4.0 years among women and 4.3 years among men. There would also be about 379,000 life days lost,
which is over a thousand years.8 They estimate the annual direct cost of tobacco-related disease in the Chilean
health system is about 0.6 percent of GDP.

3. Model
We estimate the impact of the tobacco tax in Chile using a social welfare framework. This is common in the
literature (Pichón-Riviere et al. 2014, Verguet et al. 2015). We estimate the way in which tobacco taxes would
change household income, analyzing three factors: (1) the rise in tobacco expenditure because of the tax
increase, (2) the reduction in medical expenses because of less tobacco consumption, and (3) the change in
incomes because of the additional years of labor recovered through the reduction in mortality.9 The aggregated
effect of the tax policy is estimated as follows:

    Income effect = change in tobacco expenditure (A) + lower medical expenses (B) + rise in income (C) (1)

Our baseline scenario is derived from the Chilean Household Expenditure and Consumption Survey (Encuesta
de Presupuestos Familiares). The latest available survey is from 2011–12, and we use it to measure general
consumption and tobacco consumption, as well as medical expenditures.10 Data limitations do not allow us to
simulate the exact tobacco price increases by brand, but we can accomplish this through a relatively good proxy
based on aggregate sales volumes and prices faced by all households.

A partial equilibrium model allows the distributional effects of the tobacco tax to be assessed, resulting in an
estimation of the first-order effects of these policies. We proceed using a partial equilibrium approach and
evaluating the change in prices, which relies mainly on household expenditure patterns. This decision implies
that we are assessing only the first-order effects, but does not include further behavioral changes of economic
agents. In consequence, we are observing the upper-bound effects of the short-term response. These
assumptions imply that the model uses the share of tobacco consumption in household budgets according to
price increases. The loss of real income arising from price increases in products i = 1, …, n is obtained by

                                                                   ∆
                                          ∑            ∆       ∗           ,                     (2)
                                                                       ,

where      is the share of product i in total household expenditure, and ∆ is the percent price increase.11
Therefore, if 10 percent of the total budget is destined for cigarettes, for example, and the price of cigarettes
increases by 10 percent, the real loss of income amounts to 1 percent; ∆ 	is the change in consumption of the
taxed good, and it will depend on the price elasticity of the product.


8 Days lost refer to years of life lost (YLL) because of premature mortality. Another indicator is years lost because of disability (YLD)
among people living with poor health and its consequences. Usually, disability-adjusted life years = YLL + YLD.
9 Other studies have also evaluated productivity loss, disability costs, externalities, and so on. Because of the availability of relevant data,

we focus solely on medical expenses and income changes associated with shifts in mortality.
10. The survey was collected every 10 years between 1956–57 and 2006–07; the latest round is the first one following the decision to

undertake the survey every five years. The survey is representative nationally, as well as in the metropolitan areas of Santiago and other
capitals of administrative divisions. The final sample of the 2011–12 survey includes 13,056 households.

Tobacco expenditure: We estimate the variation in tobacco consumption after the tax increase, considering the
change in prices (∆ ), the tobacco price elasticity	 , and the tobacco expenditure of decile i in period 0
                  0

We divide the change in tobacco expenditure by the total expenditure for each decile group i, thereby obtaining
a comparable per household measure of the change in tobacco expenditure relative to the total expenditure of
each decile group.

                                                                             ∆               ∗∆       ∗

Medical expenses: We estimate the change in medical expenses of tobacco-related diseases in equation (5), where
the cost of the treatment of tobacco-related diseases for income decile i is obtained from Pichón-Riviere et al.
(2014) and adjusted according to the expenditure survey.

Equation 5 shows the income gains related to the reduction of medical expenses because of the reduction of
tobacco consumption in the long term. Although the calculation is not realistic in the short-term, we assume
that the effects of tobacco-related diseases will immediately diminish with the reduction in tobacco
consumption.13

Increase in working life: We estimate the impact on incomes arising from the increase in labor years. In our base
line, we estimate the income lost because of lost working years associated with tobacco consumption (equation
6).14 The years lost are distributed across each decile proportionately to the number of households that consume
tobacco, and the income lost is estimated as the average income per household. We then estimate the effect of
the tax increase in relation to the income gains because of increases in working years. We expect that incomes
will increase as the number of years lost because of premature deaths from tobacco consumption decrease.

                                                            ∗∆       ∗           	       	    	       ∗

Lastly, we estimate the total income gains for each income group by adding the results of the reduction of
medical treatments, the gains in working years, and the increase in tobacco expenditures (see equation 1).

a. Elasticity parameters
After defining the model to calculate the income impact of tobacco taxes, we examine the estimates in the
literature on elasticities, disease prevalence, the cost of medical treatments, and mortality patterns. Several
studies have estimated tobacco price elasticity in Chile and Latin America. Within this research, the work of

12 Another expression might be ∆	Expenditure ∆C∆P ∆CP                  ∆PC .
13 Other studies have forecast the pass-through between the decline in tobacco consumption and the effect on medical expenditures.
These estimates may also differentiate the effect associated with people who stop consuming tobacco versus people who do not start
because of the tax policies. Because of data restrictions, we cannot use these assumptions in this paper.
14 We assume that income is equal to the average consumption of each household per decile.




                                                                                                                                8
Debrott Sánchez (2006) stands out for the use of prices and quantities among tobacco firms in Chile. The
parameters estimated by Debrott Sánchez are −0.21 for the price elasticity and −0.23 for the income elasticity.
Using a myopic consumption model, the author estimates a short-term elasticity of −0.22 and a long-term
elasticity of −0.45. For China. Verguet et al. (2015) consider an average price elasticity of −0.38, which varies
from −0.64 in the poorest quintile to −0.12 in the richest quintile.

As our initial elasticity assumption, we use a lower-bound price elasticity of −0.21, estimated by Debrott
Sánchez (2006). For a second level, we use a medium-bound elasticity of −0.38, considering variations for
different income groups and extrapolating the price elasticities used by Verguet et al. (2015) into 10 income
deciles. We found that the average elasticity of Verguet et al. (2015) is similar to other estimates for Chile and
Latin American countries, but the innovation is use a different elasticity profile for different income deciles.15
We also consider an upper-bound elasticity of −0.75. This upper-bound elasticity tends to reflect a longer-term
scenario, echoing the effect the tobacco tax would have on the young population. After a few decades only
these groups of the population would still be alive, therefore the total average effect of the price increase would
be better approximated by the upper-bound price elasticity. Table 1 describes the assumed elasticities.

After obtaining the changes in tobacco consumption because of the price increase, we estimate the incidence
of tobacco consumption in medical treatments, lost years of work, and the cost of these factors. The incidence
of tobacco in medical spending was estimated by the Ministry of Health of Chile and the Instituto de
Efectividad Clínica y Sanitaria in Argentina, as reported in Pichón-Riviere et al. (2014). Disease prevalence per
age-group and the monetary cost of treatment have also been estimated. This information allows us to calculate
the average cost of medical treatment for each disease. The cost of lost working years can be estimated using
the Household Consumption Survey described in the next section.

b. Tobacco mortality and morbidity
To estimate the medical costs of tobacco consumption, we examine tobacco-related medical treatments and
deaths. The Department of Health Statistics and Information of the ministry provides information about
mortality related to tobacco consumption in Chile during 2009. As a second source of information, the total
number of tobacco-related events are obtained from Pichón-Riviere et al. (2014) (table 2).16
                                      Table 2 – Tobacco mortality and morbidity
                                                                      Deaths                            Events
                                                             Total     Tobacco related        Total       Tobacco related

         Esophagus cancer                                    686             527              1,089            793

15 To our knowledge there are no papers that estimate different elasticity profiles per income deciles in Chile or other Latin American
countries.
16 Although it is not possible to know the exact cause of death for a particular disease, the medical community has converged upon the

probabilities of disease occurrence by age, gender, and tobacco consumption. The resulting tables of probabilities, along with tobacco
incidence, are used to estimate the deaths related to tobacco. For more information, see Pichón-Riviere (2011).

c. Cost of treatment
After producing estimates of the deaths and other events related to tobacco, we look for the medical cost of
treatments of tobacco-related diseases. These costs are contained in Pichón-Riviere et al. (2014). Table 3 shows
estimates of the average cost of medical treatment for tobacco-related diseases in the public and private sectors
in Chile. These expenses refer to the total cost of treatment, but the out-of-pocket expenses that families face
could be reduced by the health insurance scheme currently existing in Chile.

We need to adjust national data from the Ministry of Health to the Household Consumption Survey. The survey
is representative of 60 percent of the Chilean population, particularly urban households in the regional capitals
of Chile. Therefore, it represents 10,516,229 individuals of the total population of 17.6 million in 2013. Thus,
the equivalent cost would be 60 percent of the estimated US$496 million (table 5). The costs of tobacco-related
medical expenses are distributed across the income deciles of the consumption survey according to the
proportion of households that consume tobacco in each income decile.

d. Age pattern of mortality
To obtain the working years lost, we need to look at early mortality related to tobacco events. The medical
events associated with tobacco have a strong correlation with age and years of smoking. Table 6 shows age
patterns in tobacco-related deaths. These years lost will be distributed among the population in the analysis,
and the income (or wages) of this population segment is going to be used to estimate the working years lost.

e. Summary of descriptive statistics
Table 7 summarizes the most important indicators, which shows total monthly expenditure from the
Household Consumption Survey, as well as the proportion of cigarette expenditure. We estimate the cost of
medical treatment of tobacco-related diseases as a proportion of monthly income for each income decile. We
then estimate the share of income lost because of the working years lost because of tobacco-related mortality.

4. Results
After obtaining the baseline results, described in table 7, we estimate the effect of the tax increase on prices,
medical expenditures, and income, and aggregate these three effects into a single measure. We use the three
scenarios in the tobacco price elasticity: lower-bound, medium-bound, and higher-bound, presented in table 1.
These three scenarios allow us to have a notion of how results change under different assumptions.

a. Tobacco price increase
As a first step, we estimate the income changes for each income decile arising from the increase in tobacco
prices based on low-, medium-, and upper-bound elasticity. Using equation (4) and tables 1 and 7, we can
calculate the effects of the tobacco price increase. For example, the lower-bound elasticity (−0.21) in table 1,
the proportion of tobacco expenditure among the first decile (1.42 percent) in table 7, and a price increase of
25 percent would give an increase in expenditure of 0.26 percent (equation 7). This represents a loss in welfare
among consumers. The results for all income deciles and elasticity scenarios are shown table 8.

Source: Based on data of the 2011 Household Consumption Survey.
Note: The table shows the share of total consumption of each decile. Complete pass-through refers to elasticity equal to zero,
consumers pay all the increase in prices.


Across the three elasticities, the direct effect of the tobacco tax is a welfare loss, but, in the lower-bound
elasticity, the effect is clearly regressive because the lower-income groups lose proportionally more of their
incomes (figure 1). In the medium-bound elasticity, the effect of elasticities varies across different income


                                                                                                                                                                 12
groups, making the tax effect more flat. To show the effect of the elasticities on prices, table 8 includes the
estimates on a complete pass-through scenario, whereby the increase in prices is passed on completely to
consumers without a reduction in consumption.

b. Medical expenses
We estimate the cost of yearly medical expenses associated with tobacco consumption, assuming a direct
medical impact on health. Although this assumption is unrealistic in the short run, the long-run reduction of
tobacco consumption would tend to behave according to this pattern, whereby a reduction in tobacco
consumption would be strongly related to a reduction in tobacco-related diseases. Health expenditures are
estimated using equation (5) and tables 1 and 7. For example, using the medium-bound elasticity assumption,
the result for the first decile would be as follows:
                        ∆	         	           1   0.64 ∗ 25%          1 ∗ 2.94%=0.469                      (8)

Note: The table shows the share of total consumption of each decile.


Table 9 reports the income gains derived from the reduction in medical expenses for each income decile. The
reduction in tobacco consumption would have a positive effect on income through the reduction in medical
treatments. The income gains would vary between 0.15 and 0.01 percentage points in the case of the lower-
bound elasticity assumption, between 0.47 and 0.01 percentage points in the case of the medium-bound
elasticity, and between 0.55 and 0.03 percentage points in the case of the upper-bound elasticity (figure 2).
These results show the importance of the elasticity assumptions; they also stress the relevance to the possible
elasticity variations across income groups.

c. Income gains arising because of longer years of working life
We estimate the cost of working life lost because of tobacco consumption, assuming that there is a direct impact
of lower tobacco use on health and work-generated income. We calculate the impact for each income decile,
using the age pattern of mortality and estimating the years of life lost. We then estimate the welfare effect using
the lower-bound price elasticity, medium-bound price elasticity, and upper-bound elasticity with decile
variations.

The 15,031 deaths attributed to tobacco consumption are distributed using the occurrence of mortality profile.
For each death, the number of working days left are calculated, and the working years lost are divided across
the deciles according to decile tobacco consumption. Using equation (6) and tables 1 and 7, we can calculate
the results of the tax increase. For example, for the first decile assuming the higher-bound elasticity, the income
increase arising because of gains in working life would be as follows:
                        Δ                 1    0.75 ∗ .25       1 ∗ 0.60%         0.11%                    (9)

The results show that the reduction in tobacco consumption and the expected reduction in work years lost
have positive impacts on welfare. In the first scenario, the gains are evenly distributed across income groups.
However, elasticities vary across deciles, generating an important impact on lower-income groups (figure 3).

d. Out-of-Pocket Medical expenses
For a country like Chile, where 90% of the population is covered by either public or private health insurance
systems, the total medical cost of tobacco related diseases reflects the total average societal cost of the tobacco
burden.17 On the other hand, from a household perspective, the out-of-pocket expenditure could be the most
relevant one. According to the OECD Health Data, out-of-pocket expenditures represent 33% of total medical
costs. For tobacco-related diseases, cross-subsidies on health treatment, selectivity of public versus private
hospitals or governmental subsidies of health care could provide relevant changes in out-of-pocket
expenditures.

Using the household consumption survey, we try to identify out-of-pocket medical expenses associated with
tobacco consumption. The household survey has a few limitations regarding the identification of tobacco out
of pocket related medical expenses. First, descriptive results at the households level show a positive relation
between health expenses and income level. Nonetheless, households that consume tobacco spend less money
on health than those where nobody smokes. These unexpected results could be due to several factors. First,
the use of a household consumption survey and not an individual survey, leads us to inexact statistics. It may
be necessary to control for number of household members, their age, and tobacco consumption. In particular
kids and old adults that do not smoke could be increasing medical expenses. Second, people that smoke may
be less inclined to look for medical attention and preventive care.

    The private insurance companies in Chile (ISAPRES) can differentiate via income, age, gender and pre-existing conditions. From
an aggregate point of view, the amount paid by individuals would tend to reflect the average cost of their of health expenditures. On
the other hand, the public health insurance system does not provide these types of differentiations, but only due to income.
ISAPRES insure 16.5% of the country population, while the public insurance (FONASA) insures 74.1%. The private insurance covers
a national average of 60% of medical costs (Superintendencia de Salud, 2010). From a national level perspective, out-of-pocket
medical expenditures represent 33% of medical expenditures in the country, representing 4.6% of the households’ incomes, one of
the highest in the OECD. (Health Data, OECD 2012)


                                                                                                                                  15
               Figure 4 – Out of Pocket Medical Expenses and Tobacco Consumption




To approximate the first problem, we analyze only single-member households, with members over 40 years
old. For these households, we can see a pattern between medical expenses and tobacco consumption. In
particular, individuals with tobacco monthly consumption of over US$ 100 show high medical expenses. In
the appendix, we add estimations for single households with members over 20, 30, 40 and 50 years old.
These results provide us with hints regarding the limitation of a household survey, and the importance of
medical expenses for heavy smokers.
                              Figure 5 – Out of Pocket Medical Expenses




Nevertheless, we can forecast results for this group using a linear estimation of medical expenses. For this
group of the population we can obtain an elasticity of out-of-pocket medical expenses and tobacco
consumption. A 1 percent increase in tobacco consumption is associated with a 0.12% increase in medical
expenditures. As out-of-pocket health expenditures account for 5.16% of all expenditures, and households that


                                                                                                            16
have smokers account for 30.5% of the sample, we could obtain a rough estimation for the reductions on
tobacco consumption. Table 11 shows the estimations for reduction in out of pocket medical expenses.
                                                                       ∗∆         ∗ .   ∗

As an example, for the lower-bound elasticity, the change in out-of-pocket expenditure would be:
((1-0.21*0.25)-1)*0.0516*0.305*0.12=-0.01%.

These results give us a dimension of the magnitude of out-of-pocket expenses and the reduction of tobacco
consumption, for a very limited group of the population, and without estimating the effect of secondhand
smoking.

e. Net effects: Total distributional impacts
After separately calculating the effects of tobacco tax policy on prices, medical expenditures, and working years’
gains, in this subsection we add the results. Using a lower-bound elasticity, the results show the net negative
effect of tobacco tax policy; it is regressive, affecting the lower-income groups of the population more severely
(table 12; figure 5). Obviously, a population that is not sensitive to tobacco price changes will not reduce
consumption sufficiently to allow health and work benefits to offset cost increases. For medium-bound
elasticity, the effects are not so clear. Among lower-income groups of the population, the effects of the tobacco
tax would be positive, while, among higher-income groups, the tax would have a negative effect. Under these
circumstances, the tax would have a progressive distributional effect, benefiting lower-income groups in larger
proportion. Although this effect is driven mostly by the elasticity variance among income deciles, the elasticity
level is also relevant. For upper-bound elasticity, the tax would have a positive effect on all income groups and
also show a progressive pattern, that is, greater benefits among lower-income groups.

In conclusion, the tobacco tax increase has a small but negative effect in the presence of a low tobacco price
elasticity. This assumption does not consider other policies, such as smoking cessation and advertising programs
that may be implemented in parallel. On the assumption of medium-bound elasticity, with variations across
income deciles, we find that the tobacco tax generates welfare gains among lower-income groups. In a scenario
of upper-bound elasticity, there would be income gains across all groups of the population. Moreover, the
impact would be particularly important in the case of lower-income deciles. These results are in line with the
literature, showing the important benefits of the reduction in tobacco consumption that may occur through
diverse policy mechanisms.


5. Discussion
The tobacco literature has shown the negative effects of tobacco consumption on health and well-being, as well
as the benefits of various public policy mechanisms aimed at reducing tobacco use. One of the most efficient
ways to deter tobacco use is the application of taxes, both ad valorem or excise taxes. Yet, questions remain
regarding the net positive effect of these policies and the progressivity or regressivity that they entail, particularly
because the welfare effects derived from the increase in the taxes on tobacco heavily depend on the price
elasticity of this item across different sectors of the population. The price elasticity will determine the magnitude
of the income shock, as well as the increase in the benefits, because of the reduction in tobacco consumption.

The net welfare gain may be supported through the reduction in medical costs and the expansion in working
years, which are an effect of the lower levels of tobacco consumption promoted by the tax increase. Thus, it is
critical to justify the maintenance or intensification of the use of these kinds of policies by means of a
demonstration of the aggregated monetary gains or losses generated. At the same time, a responsible and
comprehensive policy analysis should address the differentiated effects among particular socioeconomic groups
of the population, which is one of the main motivations of this research.

Results show that, considered by itself, a price increase for tobacco through higher taxes generates negative
income variations across all groups in a population, because the overall prices go up. These negative effects are
particularly acute in the scenario of lower-bound elasticity, and they are more moderate as elasticity expands in


                                                                                                                     18
absolute terms. Based on an assumption of a more comprehensive approach, including benefits through lower
medical expenses and an increase in working years, the scenario reverses the negative effects, and the overall
monetary effect of the taxation policy becomes positive in all cases, with the exception of lower-bound elasticity.
The reduction in medical expenses is the main driver of the increase in net incomes because of the reduction
in tobacco-related problems that require expensive treatments. In the three variations based on elasticity, the
benefits of medical expenses are greater than the benefit of the increase in working years, particularly among
lower-income groups. This is because of the reduced salaries among the lower-income groups; while medical
expenses remain constant across all segments of the population, the income increases are lower among the
lower-income groups.

The different elasticity assumptions generated three particular results. The lower-bound elasticity assumption
generated an income loss across all decile groups in the population. The medium-bound elasticity, with decile
variations, generated income gains among lower-income groups and small losses among the upper-income
groups. The upper-bound elasticity generated income gains across all groups of the population, but particularly
the lower-income groups. This means that the effect of taxes on the different income groups is exacerbated if
the variation of price-elasticities among income deciles is higher.

The three price elasticity scenarios mimic the short- versus the long-term effects of the tobacco tax. There is
evidence that adult smokers will only present small changes in their behavior if price increases, the lower-bound
elasticity would tend to represent this behavior more closely. In contrast, younger groups of the population
would show more elastic demand, similar to the upper-bound elasticity. After a few decades, we expect the
impact of the tax policy to resemble the upper-bound elasticity scenario.

The results provide evidence to support the maintenance or increase in tobacco taxes. The analysis also shows
the importance of the price elasticity of tobacco, which indicates the relevance of the interaction of taxation
and other policies. In particular, this research suggests that taxation should always be supported by actions that
could change or alter the behavior of consumers, increasing elasticity levels. Because the reaction to a price
change is different in each income group, specific programs should be implemented to target consumption
among lower-income groups by supporting smoking cessation and through advertising adapted to the particular
sociocultural context. There is thus a need for an integrative approach to anti-tobacco policies that favor
coordination between taxation and behavioral change policies to generate higher social returns. Further research
could investigate which combination of programs is more efficient in deterring smoking among each
socioeconomic group.
