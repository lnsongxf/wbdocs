IFC’s Gender Secretariat aims to strengthen private sector development by focusing on the role of women as
business leaders, entrepreneurs, employees, consumers, and economic stakeholders.

This approach is good for our clients and good for business overall. It is also fundamental if economic development
activities are to yield sustainable, widespread benefits in emerging markets.

In this regard, IFC works with corporations, financial institutions, government departments, and regulators, as well
as other industry players. We also collaborate with business associations, commercial mediation bodies, research
groups, and other partners in development.

Improving Access to Finance for
Women-owned Businesses in India
Lending to women-owned micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as a distinct segment is still unexplored when
compared to lending to MSMEs in India. Due to a lack of segmental focus and, perhaps, due to a higher perception of risk,
formal financial institutions have made little effort to better understand this segment. There is a lack of awareness among
bankers of the potential business opportunity presented by this segment. One reason for this is the lack of data that would
help present a business case to target this emerging sector. In cases where formal institutions have created women-MSME
targeted credit schemes, lack of awareness and limited outreach (especially in rural areas) has meant that the impact is limited.

IFC’s work in this area aims to (a) build awareness about opportunities in access to finance for women-owned businesses;
(b) demonstrate commercial viability of offering financial services to this sub-segment; and (c) strengthen capacity of the
financial sector to offer targeted financial services to women entrepreneurs.

As part of its intervention in this sector, IFC organized a roundtable with representatives from banks, non-banking financial
institutions, and industry associations to understand perspectives and discuss financial access for women-owned businesses.
The discussion began to build awareness of the opportunities in the women entrepreneurs’ segment for financial institutions,
and best practices involved.

This report aims to assess the gap in demand and supply of finance, highlight the opportunity in serving women
entrepreneurs, and catalogue initiatives taken by financial institutions in access to finance for women-owned businesses in
India. The report presents the findings of a scoping study based on secondary research and primary interviews, together with
key themes of the roundtable discussion, and recommends potential interventions by financial institutions to address the lack
of access to formal finance for women-owned businesses in India.

     overall SME strategies have seen an increase in the number of women clients, both as entrepreneurs and as consumers.
     Overall, it was noticed that women borrowers have stronger repayment track records. Gender disaggregated data from banks
     indicates that non-performing loans are 30 to 50 percent lower in women-owned businesses. Also, women-owned MSMEs
     present greater potential for cross sales. Research[2] indicates that they are likely to access two to three times more products
     when compared with male entrepreneurs. This roughly makes them twice as profitable for banks as a consumer segment.

     Financial institutions can tap this profitable segment with products and services tailored to the needs of women-owned
     MSMEs. However, financial institutions will need to adapt due to a number of reasons. First, women entrepreneurs are
     predominantly in the services sector, while the majority of credit extended by banks has historically been to manufacturing-
     based enterprises. Second, banks rely heavily on collateral to give credit, which is a constraint for women-owned services
     enterprises. Third, there is also a need to address some of the more obvious barriers that prevent women entrepreneurs from
     approaching financial institutions, such as a lack of women relationship managers and the need for support from a male
     family member to access credit. Finally, financial institutions should consider options such as advisory desks at selected bank
     branches to offer information on products and services tailored to women-owned enterprises. Providing non-financial services
     (NFS) and training, along with access to financial products, will offer holistic growth opportunities to women entrepreneurs.

     This report takes a look at the state of access to finance for small women entrepreneurs and how the issue could be addressed.

     Chapter 1 highlights the key characteristics of women-owned businesses and discusses the major issues confronting women-
     owned MSME entrepreneurs. It focuses on lack of financing as a barrier to growth and success. The subsequent two chapters
     focus on assessing market opportunities by estimating demand-supply gap in access to finance for women entrepreneurs
     (chapter 2) and details global best practices in financing women-owned enterprises (chapter 3). The report concludes by
     presenting the business case for financing women-owned MSME finance and outlines recommendations for financial
     institutions to address the lack of access to formal finance for women-owned businesses in India (chapter 4).

     1.	Women-owned Businesses in India: An Overview
     1.1  Micro, small and medium enterprises
     India’s growth story in the past decade has seen rapid industrial progress as well as exponential growth of the services
     sector. The micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sector played a significant role in this through innovation,
     diversification, and employment generation. An estimated 29.8 million MSMEs in India[3] contribute 11.5 percent of gross
     domestic product (GDP), 45 percent of industrial output, 40 percent of exports, and employ nearly 69 million people.

     MSMEs in India are broadly divided into two classes according to the provisions of the MSME Development (MSMED)
     Act, 2006. These are:

     ■■   Manufacturing enterprises engaged in the manufacturing or production of goods pertaining to any industry specified in
          the first schedule of the Industries Development and Regulation Act, 1951, defined in terms of investment in plant and
          machinery.

     ■■   Service enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services defined in terms of investment in equipment.

     The segmentation into micro, small, and medium is based on investment in plant and machinery (in case of manufacturing)
     or in equipment (in case of services). This is detailed in table 1.


                       Table 1 Definition of micro, small, and medium enterprises based on investment

Ninety-four percent[4] of micro, small, and medium enterprises operate without formal licences or registration. Approximately
29 percent[5] belong to the manufacturing sector. MSMEs in the services sector, comprising of the remaining 71 percent,
mostly operate in conventional transaction-based industries.

Access to finance is a key constraint to growth of the MSME sector in India. A significant proportion of financing is sourced
from informal sources such as moneylenders. The funding sources used by various MSMEs are given in table 2.

1.2  Women-owned micro, small, and medium enterprises[7]
Around 3.01 million women-owned enterprises represent about 10 percent of all MSMEs in the country. Collectively,
they contribute 3.09 percent of industrial output and employ over 8 million people. Approximately 78 percent of women
enterprises belong to the services sector. Women entrepreneurship is largely skewed towards smaller sized firms, as almost 98
percent of women-owned businesses are micro-enterprises. Approximately 90 percent of women-owned enterprises are in
the informal sector. The classification of women-owned businesses is shown in table 3, while table 4 shows the geographical
location of women-owned MSMEs across India.

     As with the rest of the sector, access to finance is the biggest barrier[8] to growth and development for women-owned
     MSMEs. As a result, there continues to be a heavy reliance on informal sources of finance for seed capital and working capital
     requirements. The funding sources for women-owned MSMEs are listed in Table 5.

     Although the financing needs for women-owned enterprises are not radically different from the needs of male-owned enterprises,
     the level of financial exclusion is higher due to a combination of factors. Also, the social status of women and prevalent social
     norms in India influence perceptions of financial institutions and the ability of women entrepreneurs to access finance. The key
     demand and supply side constraints specific to women entrepreneurs’ ability to access finance are outlined in table 7.

    Analysis of Access to Finance Gap
    for Women-owned Enterprises
     2.	Analysis of Access to Finance Gap for
        Women-owned Enterprises
     2.1  Estimating demand for financing for women-owned businesses
     Based on the 4th MSME Survey Census of Registered and Unregistered MSMEs, 2006 and the 2011-12 report of the Ministry
     of MSME, there are 321,000 registered and 2.69 million unregistered women-owned MSMEs in India. These 3.01 million
     enterprises were segmented into micro, small, and medium enterprises. The financing demand for each of these comprises
     of working capital needs, financing of long-term assets, and investment demand. The total combined demand for finance by
     women-owned MSMEs, using 2012 data as a base, is approximately Indian rupees 8.68 trillion ($158 billion), which includes
     both debt and equity. A detailed explanation of the methodology used to arrive at these estimates is included in Annexure 1.

     The small enterprises segment leads the demand for financing, followed by micro and medium enterprises. The total debt
     required by women-owned MSMEs is estimated at Indian rupees 6.10 trillion ($111 billion) and equity at Indian rupees 2.58
     trillion ($47 billion). Financing requirements by segment and the split between debt and equity by segment, is provided in
     table 8.

2.2  Supply of finance to women-owned businesses
Total formal finance extended to women-owned MSMEs in 2012[10] was around Indian rupees 2.31 trillion ($42 billion).
This credit supply originated from various types of financial institutions such as public sector banks, non-banking financial
corporations, and self-help group-bank linkage programs. A breakdown of types of institutions financing women-owned
MSMEs is given in table 9.

2.3  Financing programs for women entrepreneurs
The government of India encourages greater financial sector participation for women-owned MSMEs to address the significant
finance gap in this sub-sector.


2.3.1  Government schemes
The government has an ambitious 14-point action plan for public sector banks to increase women’s access to bank finance,
including MSME finance. It set a target of 5 percent aggregate public sector bank lending to women and instructed the central
bank to track performances. Following this, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2000 asked public sector banks to report credit
extended to women. This resulted in an increase of loans to women from 2.36 percent in 2001 to 5 percent of total lending in
2007. Aggregate net bank credit to women increased to 6.3 percent in 2009, with 25 banks reaching targets.

Apart from MSME-specific initiatives, India’s 11th five-year plan encourages ownership rights for women by offering incentives
for registration of property. Women homebuyers benefit from tax exemptions, lower stamp duties, and easier availability of
home loans. This could help women who own MSMEs to get greater access to collateral and, in turn, access business finance.

The MSME ministry has flagged the promotion of women-led enterprises as a key priority area. In 2008, the ministry launched
the government of India’s only financing scheme for women entrepreneurs. However, lack of awareness among target clients
led to low uptake of this scheme. In 2012[11], loans of Indian rupees 7.7 million ($140,000) were disbursed against a target of
Indian rupees 38 million ($700,000).Table 10 outlines the key details of the scheme.

     The government plans to set up India’s first all-women’s public sector bank -- the Bharatiya Mahila Bank -- by the end of
     2013. The bank targets to have 25 branches by March, 2014. This bank will focus on the banking needs of women and
     promote their economic empowerment. The government has approved Indian rupees 10 billion ($181 million) as seed capital
     for this bank. It gave an in-principal approval for the bank in June 2013.

 Segments


2.3.3  Microfinance
In 2012, the number of microfinance clients in India was 90 million. Of these, nearly 95 percent were women who primarily
accessed loans for income-generating activities. Microfinance loans for seed capital allow women borrowers build credit
habits and become more bankable. Thus, microfinance plays a key role in expanding access to finance for low-income women
aspiring to become entrepreneurs.

However, microfinance is effective in serving the needs of tiny enterprises which do not have as much potential to contribute
to GDP and employment generation when compared with micro, small, and medium enterprises. MSMEs in India are
constrained by microfinance’s mono-product environment, singular delivery model, lack of flexibility, and shorter-tenure
loans with limited amount of credit. In this environment, microfinance is limited to providing working capital to tiny home-
based income generating activities.

Microfinance innovatively addresses the constraints of access to collateral through joint liability mechanisms and a
sophisticated understanding of individual clients’ personal circumstances in the case of individual lending. Another model
of access to finance for women is the self-help group-bank linkage model. Largely promoted by NABARD, the SHG-bank
linkage program was, in 2012, able to link over 9.9 million women with banks and enable access to credit. However, as this is
targeted at low-income women and not at women-owned MSMEs, it caters to the needs of micro entrepreneurs, at best.




                                                                                               Analysis of Access to Finance Gap for
                                                           25                                            Women-owned Enterprises
     Microfinance is widely seen as a valuable tool to expand access to finance and empower women to set up and grow businesses
     and become earning members of households. Microfinance has great potential to expand from its current tiny/home
     enterprise model to MSMEs run by women. Microfinance institutions have a strong women borrower base and are in a
     position to address specific needs of this segment. The unique characteristics of existing microfinance models can be leveraged
     to bring more women entrepreneurs into the formal financial sector by building on microfinance credit histories.

     A way forward for Indian banks can be based on the example of Exim Bank. With IFC’s help, Exim Bank partnered with
     Sero Lease and Finance, a micro-leasing company in Tanzania, to successfully help women graduate from microfinance to the
     formal banking sector by facilitating transfer of borrowers’ good credit histories from microfinance institutions to commercial
     banks. The program has committed $1 million to target 30,000 women. The program includes training on business
     planning, management, and banking services such as the loan application process.


     2.4  Current demand-supply gap in access to finance to women-owned MSMEs
     The finance gap for women-owned MSMEs is Indian rupees 6.37 trillion ($116 billion), or 73 percent of total demand.
     Details of the calculation methodology are included in annexure 1. The finance gap by segment is broken down in greater
     detail in table 12.

        Financing[12]
     3.1  Commercial banks providing tailored financial solutions to women-owned MSMEs

     3.1.1  Best practices of commercial banks from developed economies
     There are several examples of banks in developed economies that have successfully designed and implemented access to
     finance programs for women customers. But, three examples stand out - Wells Fargo Bank and American Express from the
     United States of America, and Westpac Banking Corporation from Australia.


     Wells Fargo
     Wells Fargo is a diversified American financial services company that leads in financing women-owned businesses. Wells
     Fargo recognized and seized the opportunity to tap women-owned businesses in their growth through:

           ■■    Products

                 ●●    Tailor-made and customized products: Wells Fargo’s customized products and solutions (such as offering
                       unsecured credit lines) for women entrepreneurs enabled access to high-quality and affordable finance to
                       women-owned businesses in the United States. Its Women Business Services Program provides outreach and
                       education to help women business owners increase access to capital and other financial services.

           ■■    Non-financial services

                 ●●    Training and networking opportunities: Wells Fargo collaborates with women’s organisations, such as
                       the National Association of Women Business Owners, to reach women businesses and provide clients with
                       research, financial solutions, and business advice resources. The program includes providing financial tools,
                       research, financial guides, workshops, and seminars.

                 ●●    Recognising achievements of women entrepreneurs: Building partnerships with national and regional
                       organisations and an annual “trailblazer” award to recognize the business achievements and leadership of
                       women entrepreneurs are also part of the program.

           ■■    Results

                 ●●    Since the program was launched in 1995, Wells Fargo has extended credit of more than $38 billion[13] to over
                       750,000 women entrepreneurs. The bank serves women-owned business with financial services, loans, and
                       lines of credit including unsecured credit lines of up to $100,000.

Westpac Banking Corporation
Westpac Banking Corporation sought to become the “Bank of Choice for Women” by realizing the potential of Australia’s
businesswomen. Since 2002, Westpac has been the only Australian bank to have a dedicated women’s market team.
Westpac is a founding member of the Global Banking Alliance for Women, an organisation of institutions committed to
women in business and women’s wealth creation worldwide. Importantly, Westpac’s is a retail model – not just for women
entrepreneurs, but all women customers. Its value proposition and brand has been built on a liability-based strategy which is
a good model for banks to consider.

              opportunity to network among themselves to potentially partner and grow their businesses.

         ●●   Education offered to businesswomen through educational seminars, cash flow workshops, and superannuation
              information sessions.

    ■■   Results

         ●●   Westpac disaggregated by gender the portfolios of every section of the bank and conducted research that

         ●●   Westpac’s Women in Business program contributed over $2.5 billion to Westpac’s bottom line in 2009. The
              bank received national and global sustainability awards, including recognition as one of the world’s most
              ethical companies in 2008, 2009, and 2010 by Ethisphere. It is the only Australian bank listed on the 2011
              list of Global 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and is recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index as a
              leader in the global banking sector.

     American Express
     American Express, the leading payment card issuer for small businesses in the United States, successfully targets and
     promotes women entrepreneurs.

         ■■   Products

              ●●   The American Express OPEN Program enables women-owned enterprises to access a variety of cards
                   specifically designed to help them manage their day-to-day business activities. This includes business charge
                   and credit cards that deliver purchasing power, flexibility, rewards, and savings on business services from an
                   expanded line-up of partners, online tools, and services designed to improve profitability.

              ●●   American Express has also been active in promoting women entrepreneurs’ access to government contracts,
                   which is traditionally a male dominated area. American Express lobbied for the passing of the Women-
                   Owned Small Business (WOSB) Federal Contract program, which dedicates a percentage of government
                   contracts in 83 different industries to women. The program creates more federal contracting opportunities
                   for women-owned small businesses.

         ■■   Non-financial services

              ●●   Women can access information, advice, and guidance from other women entrepreneurs through the OPEN
                   forum, an online platform that provides cutting-edge tools and insights to help women-owned enterprises
                   easily monitor everyday operations, from advertising new products to paying vendors.

              ●●   American Express has also partnered with “Count Me In, Make Mine a Million” program to work with its
                   women clients and help them achieve the million-dollar sales threshold.

              ●●   American Express collaborated with Women Impacting Public Policy (WIPP), to create the “Give Me
                   5 Program” to advocate for more federal contracting opportunities for women-owned small businesses.
                   The program is designed to educate women business owners on how to apply for and secure federal
                   procurement tenders.

     Although these three models have different approaches to financing women entrepreneurs, a common aspect is providing
     targeted training and mentoring/networking opportunities to women entrepreneurs as part of the core offering.


     3.1.2 Best practices of commercial banks from emerging economies
     Banks in some emerging economies have had success with similar women-centric programs. In contrast to programs in
     developed economy, however, the focus is on creating products and services to help women-owned MSMEs overcome
     the challenges of lack of collateral and start-up capital, and to support them in meeting non-credit needs such as cash
     management and insurance, and non-financial services such as training, mentoring, and networking.

DFCU Bank
DFCU Bank in Uganda, as part of its SME business strategy, created the Women in Business (WIB) Program in 2007 to
assist Ugandan women entrepreneurs grow through access to finance.

    ■■   Products and services

         ●●   Customized financial products such as loans and savings for women entrepreneurs: Since collateral
              requirements are a major obstacle for Ugandan women as they have difficulty accessing property, DFCU
              created a “land loan” specifically for women. With this, women can take a loan to purchase property that
              they can later use as collateral for business loans.

         ●●   Promotes partnerships among clients: To facilitate this, the bank created an investment club, a savings
              scheme where women entrepreneurs raise funds together to make future business investments. Investment
              club members can also use the amount saved as collateral.

    ■■   Non-financial services

         ●●   Business management and financial awareness training to women entrepreneurs in addition to traditional
              credit product offerings.

    ■■   Results

         ●●   The program has financed over $20 million to women entrepreneurs in Uganda.


SME Bank
The SME Bank in Malaysia enhances the capacity of women entrepreneurs to run stronger businesses.

    ■■   Products

         ●●   Financial products adapted to match needs of women entrepreneurs who, in Malaysia, are heavily
              concentrated in manufacturing and tourism. SME Bank Malaysia has several packages for the women
              entrepreneurs, depending on size and development stage.

    ■■   Non-financial services

         ●●   Incubation system through which the bank provides financing, entrepreneurial guidance, and training. SME
              Bank has used its incubation center to encourage women to enhance business skills and grow businesses.

         ●●   Assists clients in marketing and promoting products.

     Rawbank
     In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rawbank partnered with IFC to design and launch its “Women in Business”
     program. The program, “Lady’s First” aimed at capturing dynamic and growing women-owned SMEs. IFC provided initial
     financing of $1.87 million to support women entrepreneurs. The program included:

         ■■   Products

              ●●   Lending strategy that eases collateral requirements for women entrepreneurs.

Exim Bank
In Tanzania, Exim Bank became the first financial institution to provide lines of credit to women entrepreneurs running
midsize enterprises when it launched its Women Entrepreneurs Finance Program in 2007. IFC provided a $5 million credit
line to finance the program, and the Canadian International Development Agency helped fund the business advisory services.
Exim Bank takes an innovative approach to address the unique challenges faced by women entrepreneurs running midsize
firms. The bank allows women to use contracts with reputable companies as collateral for their loans, which have an average
size of $160,000.

Other banks in developing markets such as Access Bank in Nigeria, Sacom Bank in Vietnam, and Bank International in
Indonesia, have also realized the potential of women entrepreneurs and have initiated or are examining specific approaches to
enhance growth opportunities for women-owned businesses.


3.2  Finance for women-owned businesses: A key focus of development finance institutions
IFC assists BLC, Lebanon to increase its reach to SME clients through disbursement of new SME loans, of which 20 percent
will be women entrepreneurs.

BLC recognizes women including women-owned SMEs as a sub-segment across all banking products, including retail
banking products. IFC supports ABANK Turkey to grow its women-owned SME portfolio to 150 clients and $100 million
in outstanding loans by the end of 2016. This will be achieved with a $25 million credit line and an additional $15 million
from FMO, the Dutch Development Bank, of which 50 percent is slated for women entrepreneurs. Garanti Romania plans
to expand its SME portfolio to $1.4 billion in outstanding loans, to at least 300 women-owned businesses by the end of
2015. IFC supports this effort with a €22.5 million ($30.4 million) credit line, with 50 percent of the facility aimed at
women entrepreneurs.


African Development Bank
African Development Bank’s Growth Oriented Women Entrepreneurs (GOWE) program is a partial guarantee aimed
at women entrepreneurs. The program was launched in Kenya and Cameroon in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The Kenya
GOWE program is fully financed by the African Development Bank with up to $3 million for capacity building and
management, and another $10 million for the partial guarantee facility. In Cameroon, African Development Bank, Canada
Trust Fund ($450,000), and Irish Trust Fund ($100,000) jointly financed the GOWE program for capacity building and
management. African Development Bank has in place $13 million for the partial guarantee with International Labour
Organisation (ILO) as technical advisory partner. Similar partial guarantee programs in Tanzania and Zambia have recently
been launched.

     USAID’s Development Credit Authority
     USAID’s Development Credit Authority program partners with Kenyan financial institutions to encourage lending in
     areas that are underserved due to the perception of high risks. Under this partnership, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB)
     has introduced the Grace Loan, which is tailor-made for individual women entrepreneurs and women business groups to
     meet working capital or business expansion needs. Women can apply for funds of up to $62,000, repayable in up to 36
     months. The loan also has an important training component. To access value added services, women entrepreneurs get the
     opportunity to join KCB’s Biashara Club (a club for business women, biashara in Swahili means business). Since its launch,
     the bank has lent over $1.6 million to 350 women entrepreneurs.


     3.3  Equity financing
     As with the rest of the MSME sector, equity finance, particularly in the early stages, is critical for the growth of women-
     owned enterprises. As with other businesses, women-owned enterprises need to be capitalized if they are to achieve
     sustainable growth. Although commercial banks and microfinance institutions have been engaged in providing credit,
     other sources such as equity funds or angel/investment funds are required for equity support. World-wide, women-owned
     businesses attract less than 5 percent of venture capital funds. Investment funds such as equity and angel funds provide access
     to seed capital, as well as technical assistance support which may increase sustainability of these enterprises. There are several
     international funds that have successful models that target women-owned SMEs.


     Trapezia Fund
     The UK-based Trapezia Fund is the first equity fund dedicated to venture capital requirements of women-centred business
     in the United Kingdom and Europe. Trapezia offers investors the opportunity to invest in women-focused businesses for
     three to five years. The fund, which uses tax rebates to incentivise investors, started with $7 million in November 2006. It has
     invested amounts of $380,000 to $880,000 in a diversified portfolio of ten companies led by women. A Trapezia II fund is
     currently in negotiations to meet the demand in the United Kingdom.


     Women Enterprise Development Initiative
     Similarly, in South Africa the Women Enterprise Development Initiative (WEDI) is a seven-year, $250 million closed-
     end, women-owned SME equity fund. WEDI achieves high social impact and above average returns on investments by
     using up to 1 percent of funds for assessment and support required by women entrepreneurs to be successful. WEDI
     incorporates a multi-disciplinary and holistic approach to enterprise development, while providing capacity building services
     to women-owned SMEs to achieve long-term growth. Operating out of South Africa, the fund covers the Southern African
     Development Community (SADC) region.

    The Way Forward
     4.	The Way Forward
     The number of women entrepreneurs in India is increasing; so is the demand-supply gap for financing of women-owned
     enterprises. There is a growing opportunity for financial institutions to address the needs of this segment. While tapping
     this market requires financial institutions to make some contextual adaptations, there is a strong case that serving women
     entrepreneurs makes significant business sense.


     4.1  Finance for women-owned MSMEs – The business case for financial institutions
     The business case for financial institutions to expand financial products and services to women-owned enterprises is based on
     a combination of volume and value factors.

     Volume

           ■■    Significant market opportunity: Women entrepreneurs present a strong “volume” business case as there are over
                 three million women-owned businesses in India and only about 3 percent of these businesses access finance from
                 formal financial institutions. The financing gap for women-owned businesses is 73 percent of total requirements or
                 approximately Indian rupees 6.37 trillion ($115 billion).

     Value

     There is significant empirical evidence that women tend to be better borrowers and customers, thus providing “value” to their
     partner financial institutions.

           ■■    Better quality credit: Women-owned MSMEs have a better repayment track record[14] according to the experience
                 of banks in developed economies. Gender disaggregated data from banks indicates that non-performing loans are 30
                 to 50 percent[15] lower in women-owned businesses when compared with those owned by men.

           ■■    Comprehensive banking relationships: Women tend to be more loyal in the long term[16] to a chosen financial
                 institution and they are better depositors into bank savings accounts as well.

           ■■    Enhanced profitability: Some reports[17] suggest that women are roughly twice as profitable as men, because
                 they access more products from the bank or financial institution with which they have dealings. Women-owned
                 MSMEs could have more potential for cross sales[18] when compared with men-owned businesses. While male
                 entrepreneurs focus on just one product dealing with a bank and usually will look at multiple options before buying
                 other products, female entrepreneurs are more likely to access a range of services such as credit, savings, insurance,
                 and remittances. Banks’ cross sales to women entrepreneurs are two to three times higher[19] than to men-owned
                 businesses.

     In India, given a lack of any market leader in this space, there is enormous potential for formal financial institutions to
     develop a brand as a financial partner for women-owned businesses. An institution entering this sub-segment will have a first
     mover advantage.

4.2  Key recommendations
Given the limited financing to women-owned enterprises, several levels of interventions are required to build this market.

Role of formal financial institutions
    ■■   Customized offerings for women entrepreneurs require deep understanding of the market

         The financial needs and support services required by women entrepreneurs will have to be researched and
         documented. Due to limited knowledge and experience in this area, financial institutions may have to begin the
         product development process with market research followed by pilots in select geographies.

    ■■   Build a “brand” and develop tailored products and services to meet financial needs of women entrepreneurs

         Next, with an understanding of the needs of women entrepreneurs, financial institutions can focus on building a
         “brand” as a financial partner for women-owned businesses, catering to the full spectrum of their financial needs.
         A suite of financial products and services specifically tailored to the financial needs of these entrepreneurs can be
         offered, along with associated sourcing and marketing strategies.

    ■■   Customize policies, processes and systems to align to women entrepreneurs’ needs

         In addition to developing tailored products and services and a “women-friendly brand”, financial institutions can
         align policies, procedures, and systems to become more accessible to women entrepreneurs. Financial institutions
         can build “brands” as banks that serve women entrepreneurs through targeted sourcing/marketing strategies,
         generate awareness about products and services, and provide tailored tools to women such as doorstep services,
         online, and phone support. For instance:

              ●●   Simplify the approval process to reduce the number of visits to branches

              ●●   Explore potential for “doorstep financial delivery model” branchless banking and other innovative
                   delivery systems

              ●●   Consider tie-ups with non-governmental organizations, microfinance institutions, and self-help groups
                   that often have a better understanding of their geographies and insights into clients’ cash flow cycles and
                   repayment capacities. These tie ups could reduce transaction costs and manage risk

              ●●   Remove dependence on male members of family as a pre-requisite to access finance. Some/many public
                   sector banks demand the husband’s or father’s (in case of unmarried women) signature to approve
                   loan applications

              ●●   Explore options on psychological or alternative collaterals such as post-dated cheques, movable assets, and
                   business assets

              ●●   Incorporate delivery channels such as online banking, mobile banking, and phone-a-financial
                   product facilities.




                                                                                                                     The Way Forward
                                                              37
         ■■   Promote a friendlier environment for women customers

              When financial institutions deal with a relatively new customer segment with customized products, changes in
              human resource management systems may be needed. Banks can train sales staff, including relationship managers,
              on how to engage with women entrepreneurs. Financial institutions may consider hiring and training more female
              relationship managers to target women-owned MSMEs, as this could increase accessibility to new customers and
              provide greater comfort to them. Branches should be seen as more friendly and approachable for women customers.

         ■■   Deliver non-financial services

              Non-financial services can be a strong complement to the core business of credit delivery. Potential services could
              include:

                   ●●   Programs to make women aware about banking products and processes. Since a key demand-side
                        constraint is the lack of awareness of products and services, financial institutions should proactively build
                        awareness about tailored products and services available. Banks could organise workshops, seminars, town
                        council meets, and group discussions. Such events offer opportunities to women entrepreneurs to have
                        one-on-one interactions with bankers and get to know about financial products and schemes for women.
                        They also offer opportunities for women entrepreneurs to build networks.

                   ●●   Training programs on human resources, financial management, business management, marketing, and
                        financing the venture. These skills can be extremely beneficial in supporting women entrepreneurs sustain
                        and grow their enterprises, making them long- term and better customers.

                   ●●   MSME toolkit to help women businesses at different stages of the business cycle -inception, start-up and
                        growth - in areas such as business planning, financial projections, input management, marketing, market
                        linkage, and branding. Women-owned businesses that are unable to engage expensive advisory services can
                        benefit from this type of intervention.

     Enabling environment
         ■■   Co-create a risk capital fund

              Governments and, in some cases, multilateral agencies have come up with risk share facilities to encourage banks
              to lend to women-owned enterprises. A risk-share facility with support from the government of India can provide
              impetus to credit delivery to women enterprises and will encourage banks and financial institutions to focus on this
              segment.

         ■■   Equal rights to property

              Governments should promote and incentivise joint property registration. Such a move will enable women to be
              included in asset registration, give them equal rights to property, enabling them to use it as collateral and enhance
              access to finance. Similarly, governments should focus on amending regulations to address issues around inheritance
              of property and land ownership of women.

                                                                     38
■■   Simplify collateral requirement

     More than 90 percent of women-owned enterprises in India are self-financed. Stringent collateral and
     documentation requirements act as barriers. A simplified collateral regime will greatly encourage women
     entrepreneurs and enable access. Governments may focus on developing an effective secured transactions
     regime for women enterprises characterized by a wide range of allowable collaterals (immovable and movable),
     the establishment of clear priority rankings of claims over collateral, efficient collateral registries, and effective
     enforcement of collateral in case of default. Governments may focus on developing a credit guarantee scheme to
     enable women entrepreneurs borrow from formal financial institutions in the absence of collateral.

■■   Formulate women-focused policies to promote women-owned enterprises

     The government of Andhra Pradesh has set an example by creating a dedicated women-enterprise focused industrial
     area. This initiative is an important landmark in terms of ‘policy segmentation’ to promote women enterprises and
     can be replicated in other geographies.

■■   Co-create an online customer care support

     A call center for women entrepreneurs to guide them on business planning, financial management, working capital
     management, input/raw material purchase, legal counselling, and market linkages will help them get help and
     information on critical issues that they face at different stages of the business cycle.

■■   Role of development finance institutions (DFIs)

     DFIs can offer credit lines and equity schemes to commercial banks in developing countries to increase their
     capabilities to address the needs of women entrepreneurs. This will enhance the efforts from the government and
     the private sector to address the needs of women entrepreneurs. In addition, DFIs can support financial institutions
     through guarantee facilities to mitigate risks perceived by financial institutions looking to lend to women
     entrepreneurs. Also, DFI interventions can be combined with technical assistance to assist financial institutions
     enhance the skills of women entrepreneurs.

     Detailed estimation process
     Data on total number of women-owned MSMEs, both registered and unregistered, was extracted from the MSME Ministry’s
     Annual Report 2011-12 and 4th MSME Survey Census of Registered and Unregistered MSMEs 2006. The women-owned
     MSMEs were then segregated into micro, small, and medium enterprises as per the definition of the ministry. The working
     capital needs based on average operating margin and average gross output per enterprise was estimated for each segment.
     Long-term assets financing and investment demand was estimated based on asset turnover ratio and average plant and
     machinery (for manufacturing sector) or total assets (for services sector) per enterprise. Table 13 shows the estimated average
     working capital and assets financing demand.

The estimated demand for financing of women-owned MSMEs in India for working capital and fixed assets financing was
calculated based on the estimated financing needs for each segment (tables 14 and 15). The total financing need for women-
owned MSMEs is estimated at $158 billion (table 16).

     reports, and websites of top NBFCs of India. The total supply of financing to the women-owned MSME sector for 2012 was
     calculated at $42 billion. The financing gap for women-owned MSME sector was estimated at $116 billion.

Annexure 2:

Increasing access to finance for women
entrepreneurs in Lebanon
IFC works with BLC Bank to improve access to finance and support growth of women-owned businesses in Lebanon. BLC
Bank, supported by IFC, launched the Women’s Empowerment Initiative, which offers a range of services tailored to women-
owned businesses. This initiative makes it easier for these businesses to access the capital they need to expand, creating jobs and
spurring economic development in Lebanon.
The opportunity

The main barrier to increasing participation of women in business in Lebanon remains access to finance. While this constraint
is universal for all small and medium enterprises, regardless of gender, it tends to disproportionately affect women-owned
businesses. Women own more than 30 percent of all smaller businesses in the developing world, but in Lebanon only
3 percent of bank loans go to female entrepreneurs.

This under-tapped market presents an enormous opportunity for financial institutions and other business providers that
support women-owned businesses. Research indicates that women tend to be loyal customers and cautious investors, in
addition to having better loan-payback rates. Serving this market not only makes business sense, it also has a positive impact
on society as a whole by expanding economic growth and job creation. A recent World Bank study in Lebanon has shown that
women-owned enterprises hire more women and provide greater social benefits to employees than enterprises owned by men.

The approach

IFC’s Advisory Services team worked with BLC Bank to design financial services and banking products for smaller enterprises.
As a sub-set of its overall strategy for small and medium enterprises, IFC helped BLC recognize the business case for actively
reaching out to the market of smaller enterprises owned by women.

IFC’s support included market research to understand the needs of women-owned businesses and testing of new product
concepts. Adopting IFC’s recommendations, BLC launched the Women’s Empowerment Initiative, the first program dedicated
to the economic empowerment of women in the Middle East and North Africa region. BLC Bank targets women employees and
entrepreneurs, providing them with innovative products and services to support their advancement.

In addition to new financial services, the Women’s Empowerment Initiative provides non-financial services critical to supporting
the growth of women-owned businesses. In this context, BLC launched a website dedicated to female entrepreneurs that allows
them to exchange ideas and combine forces to tackle professional challenges. BLC Bank also created a Woman Entrepreneur of
the Year Award to honor successful businesswomen.

Results and impact

     ●●   Increased number of loans to women-owned small and medium enterprises by 55 percent.
     ●●   Increased number of women-owned deposit accounts by 17 percent.
     ●●   Became the first bank in the Middle East and North Africa to commit to the UN Global Compact/UN Women’s
          Empowerment Principles and to join the Global Banking Alliance for Women.
 “Initiatives like these are key to changing attitudes about the role of women in society. At the same time, we are also demonstrating
that there is a considerable commercial advantage in providing women with concrete means to access financing for their businesses.”

              on the private sector in developing countries. Established in 1956, IFC is owned by 184 member countries,
              a group that collectively determines our policies. Working with private enterprises in more than 100
