I. Introduction2

Investment plays a critical role for growth and social development. Investment in human capital
and high-quality, sustainable infrastructure lays the foundation for output and productivity growth,
provides basic services to households and market access for firms; enables sustainable urban
development; and opens corridors of trade to link into the global economy (Global Infrastructure
Facility 2015). Competitiveness rests on strong human capital and quality infrastructure (World
Economic Forum 2016). Infrastructure mitigates the challenges to economic activity imposed by
distance, helps integrate domestic markets, and established critical connections to international
markets. Strong human capital increases productivity and earnings.
Investment growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) has slowed sharply
since 2010. However, investment growth performance has varied significantly across different
regions (Figure 1). The objective of this paper is to examine the regional dimensions of recent
weakness in investment.3 Specifically, the paper addresses the following three questions. First,
how has investment growth in the six EMDE regions evolved? Second, what are the remaining
investment needs across these regions? Third, which policies can help address investment needs?
Investment growth in EMDEs slowed from 10.2 percent in 2010 to 3.4 percent in 2015 and, based
on partial data, likely slowed further in 2016. This slowdown exceeded 5 percentage points in
almost half of EMDEs. In 2015, investment growth was below its long-term average in more than
60 percent of EMDEs and negative in about 30 percent of EMDEs.
Developments have varied widely across regions, however, reflecting the presence of commodity
importers or exporters, the degree of political stability, and spillovers from key trading partners
and investors. In the EMDE regions with a substantial number of commodity-importing
economies—East Asia and Pacific (EAP), which accounted for one-quarter of global investment
during 2010-15 and South Asia (SAR), which accounted for 4 percent—investment growth has
been stronger than the average across EMDEs, but also declined steadily in 2010-14. Investment
growth has since stabilized in EAP and SAR, in part reflecting reduced policy pressures for
rebalancing, lower political tensions and sharply lower oil prices.

  The six regions include East Asia and Pacific (EAP), Europe and Central Asia (ECA), Latin America and
the Caribbean (LAC), Middle East and North Africa (MNA), and South Asia (SAR) and Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA).

In contrast, since 2010, investment growth has declined sharply and registered several years of
anemic growth or even contraction in EMDE regions with a large number of commodity exporters.
In addition to a severe terms of trade deterioration since the peak of commodity prices in the first
quarter of 2011, investment growth was set back by procyclical policy tightening (Nigeria, Russian
Federation, South Africa, some Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries), balance of payment
pressures (Angola, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Nigeria), political instability or policy uncertainty
(Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine), spillovers from conflicts in fragile neighboring countries
(Middle East and North Africa) and spillovers from recessions in neighboring countries (Central
Asia, South Caucasus, South America). Many large economies in Europe and Central Asia (ECA)
struggled with falling commodity prices, sharp adjustment of exchange rates, recessions in the
Russia and Ukraine, and on-going geopolitical tensions. In Latin America and the Caribbean
(LAC), investment growth fell from 12.5 percent in 2010 to -4.8 percent in 2015; in Europe and
Central Asia (ECA), it declined from 9.2 percent in 2010 to -1.6 percent in 2015; in the Middle
East and North Africa (MNA), it slowed from 4.2 percent in 2010 to 0.5 percent in 2015; and in
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it fell from more than 14 percent in 2010 to 0.3 percent in 2015.
Post-crisis investment weakness affected both public investment, which accounted for 31 percent
of investment in 2010-15, and private investment. In all regions except SSA, public investment
growth has slowed steadily from elevated levels during the global financial crisis to below long-
term averages. This slowdown partly reflected increasing financing constraints as fiscal space
eroded with crisis-related fiscal stimulus and slowing post-crisis growth. Following a post-crisis
rebound in 2010, private investment growth also slowed sharply and remained below the long-
term average in more than half of all EMDEs. Private investment growth was weakest in ECA,
partly as a result of spillovers from the Euro Area crisis, and MENA, where political uncertainty
in the wake of the Arab Spring weighed on sentiment.
In some EMDEs, especially in China and commodity exporters, slowing investment growth in
recent years is partly a correction from high pre-crisis investment growth. In China, this process
has involved economic rebalancing towards domestic consumption and the services sectors. In
commodity-exporting EMDEs, especially oil-exporting ones, a sharp terms-of-trade deterioration
undermined long-term growth prospects and set back investment. A moderation of investment
growth in commodity-importing economies reflected weak trading partner growth and slowing
foreign direct investment (FDI). Political risk and weak growth prospects in major trading partners
have been important obstacles for investment growth in all EMDEs.
Sizeable investment needs remain in EMDEs, driven by three forces: the need to alleviate severe
poverty, income and demographic shifts, and rapid urbanization. Investment needs include the
provision of basic public services, fostering efficiency, promoting innovation and ensuring
sustainable growth. A sizeable portion of these investment needs is in infrastructure and human
capital. Public investment in these areas can crowd in private investment, especially in the presence
of economic slack, accommodative financial conditions, well-developed institutions, and a
sufficiently skilled labor force (World Bank 2017a).

Figure 2. Regional variation in health outcomes and service provision
Despite some remarkable successes, provision of basic public services to reduce mortality and morbidity and
enable basic economic activity, remains a challenge in many EMDEs, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also
in parts of other EMDE regions.

Basic public services. Despite some remarkable successes, the provision of basic public services,
which help to reduce mortality and morbidity and enable basic economic activity, remains a
challenge in many EMDEs, especially in Africa, but also in parts of other EMDE regions. The
challenge of providing basic services—water and waste water management, access to markets, and
access to basic health care and education—is especially large in Sub-Saharan Africa but continues
in parts of other EMDE regions (Figure 2). About 770 million people worldwide lack access to
clean water; 2.5 billion people do not have adequate sanitation; 2.8 billion people still cook their
food with solid fuels (such as wood); and 1 billion people live more than a mile (2 kilometers)
from an all-weather road (Global Infrastructure Facility 2015). There are over 59 million primary-
school-age children without access to education, of whom more than half live in Sub-Saharan
Africa.
Accommodating growth and urbanization. Investment in quality infrastructure and human capital
is critical to expanding economic activity, enhancing productivity, and facilitating urbanization.
EMDEs have the potential for decades of rapid urban development (World Bank 2015a). For
example, relative to their per capita incomes, the share of the population living in urban
agglomerations is below-average in India and Russia. Despite internal migration, the share of
people living in urban centers in the EAP region remains at 54 percent in 2015, well below the
advanced economy average (80 percent). Slums are still prevalent in about half of SSA economies,
but also in Brazil and several other LAC economies (Figure 3).
Urbanization and accommodating growth puts a premium on quality transport network; reliable
provision of electricity; and availability of quality education. The OECD (2012) estimates that
worldwide air passenger traffic could double in 15 years; air freight could triple in 20 years; and
port handing of maritime containers worldwide could quadruple in 15-20 years (OECD 2012).
Yet, most of the current gateway and corridor infrastructure could not accommodate a 50 percent
increase, let alone a doubling of passengers in 15 years or a tripling of freight in 20 years (OECD
2012). Transport infrastructure is of below-average quality in Brazil and several economies in the
ECA region, especially in Central Asia, and the quality of ports is below the average in Brazil and
Russia (Figure 3). Similarly, almost 20 percent of the world’s population still has no access to
electricity. Just to keep pace with growing global electricity demand, annual investment in energy
supply of almost 2 percent of GDP ($1.6 trillion) may be needed until 2035 (International Energy
Agency 2014). Annual spending needs on energy efficiency, measured against a 2012 baseline,
are expected to rise almost five-fold by 2035 (Ruiz-Nuñez and Wei 2015).
Sustainable growth. Even in EMDEs with above-average infrastructure and adequate provision of
basic education and health care, investment is needed to ensure environmentally sustainable
growth and preserve competitiveness. Environmental challenges include water management,
deforestation and land degradation, air pollution and natural disaster management (Lee and Pang
2015). For example, relative to their per capita incomes, air pollution is high in China, India, and
several GCC countries. To maintain competitiveness in the global economy, both innovation and
absorption of productivity-enhancing technologies is critical, supported by higher education and
training. Innovation can be fostered by investment in research and development; the presence of
high-quality scientific research institutions that can generate the basic knowledge needed to


                                                 7
develop new technologies; collaboration between different sectors in research and technological
developments; and the protection of intellectual property. These activities can be buttressed by
well-educated workers who are able to perform complex tasks and adapt rapidly to their changing
environment and the evolving needs of the production system (WEF 2016). The quality of
education is particularly weak in South Africa and in Brazil and other parts of LAC (Figure 4).
How large could total investment needs be over the next decade? For infrastructure, specifically,
a number of studies have estimated sizeable investment needs. At the global level, the OECD
(2006) estimated that key infrastructure sectors (land transport, telecomunications, electricity and
water) require additional annual investment of 2.5 percent of global GDP ($53 trillion) until 2030
to keep pace with rising global demand. Electricity generation and other energy-related
infrastructure in oil, gas and coal require an additional investment of 1.5 percent of global GDP
($3 trillion per year; OECD 2011; McKinsey 2013; and WEF 2013a). Global environment-related
infrastructure needs represent another 1.7-2.5 percent of global GDP ($3.5-5 trillion per year; WEF
2013a).
Since EMDEs tend grow faster on average than advanced economies, investment needs for
maintenance and increased capacity of infrastructure are estimated to be highest in EMDEs (6-8
percent of GDP on average; Fay et al., 2011). However, there are significant differences in the size
and the composition of investment needs across regions and countries depending on development
and income levels, demographic and urbanization trends. Estimated infrastructure investment
needs are largest in U.S. dollar amounts in fast-growing, populous Asia ($9.5-16 trillion by 2030).
However, relative to GDP, infrastructure needs are largest in Africa and South Asia where, by
some estimates, they reach double-digits (Foster and Briceno-Garmendia 2010; Inderst 2016). On
average across EMDEs, investment requirements are largest in electricity generation, followed by
construction and upgrading of transportation networks, real estate development, water and
telecommunications (RBS 2011). In Asia, about half of investment needs are for energy, about one
third for transport and the rest for telecommunications and water.
A sizable portion of these infrastructure investment needs remain unmet, although estimates vary
widely and are subject to large uncertainty (e.g., Gramlich 1994 and Dethier and Moore 2012). For
example, the difference between expected investment needs and current actual investment in
EMDEs is estimated at $1-2 trillion per year (1.25 to 2.5 percent of EMDE GDP; WEF 2013a;
Bhattacharya et al. 2012, McKinsey 2013, 2016).
Public investment in infrastructure can catalyze private investment (World Bank 2017a). However,
public investment is more likely to crowd in private investment in the presence of economic slack,
accommodative financial conditions, sizable investment needs, well-developed institutions, and a
sufficiently skilled labor force. Improved project selection and monitoring, as well as better
governance, may enhance the benefits from public investment.

The following six sections discuss investment developments and remaining investment needs in
each of the World Bank’s six EMDE regions. The final section concludes with a summary of
policy implications.

II. East Asia and Pacific

During 2010-15, East Asia and Pacific accounted for almost one-half of the growth in global
investment, and one-quarter of global investment. Investment growth has steadily declined from
12.1 percent in 2010 to 6.5 percent on average in 2015-16—well below the double-digit rates of
2003-08. The slowdown has been broad based and reflected decelerating public as well as private
investment.
The slowdown in investment growth in the EAP region was concentrated in China and commodity
exporters. To some extent, the deceleration represents a necessary adjustment from high pre-crisis
growth rates and the post-crisis policy stimulus. The process has involved economic rebalancing,
from manufacturing industry to services, and from investment (in excess of 40 percent of GDP)
and exports to domestic consumption. In other economies, the cycle in commodity markets, from
a decade of high prices to recent weakness, has encouraged adjustment. Despite several decades
of rapid investment growth prior to the recent slowdown, requirements in the areas of transport,
health and education, and environmental protection, remain sizable across the region.

   II.1. How has investment growth in the EAP region evolved?

Investment growth in East Asia and Pacific has steadily declined—from 12.1 percent in 2010 to
6.5 percent on average in 2015-16. This is well below the region’s double-digit growth rates of
2001-08, but higher than in other EMDE regions. The slowdown was particularly pronounced in
China (Figure 5). It reflected decelerating public as well as the private investment growth, as the
coordinated fiscal stimulus following the global financial crisis was unwound (especially in
China).

Figure 5. EAP: Investment growth
Investment growth in the EAP region stabilized at moderate levels in 2015-16 following a gradual decline in
2010-13. This decline reflected a steady slowdown in China and a sharp deceleration of investment growth in
commodity exporters through end-2013. Since early-2014, investment growth has begun to recover in major
commodity exporters as their terms-of-trade bottomed out and major central banks embarked on easing cycles.
FDI to the EAP region remained buoyant and supported investment growth.

In China, investment growth slowed sharply from a 22.8 percent peak in 2009 to 6.5 percent on
average, in 2015-16. The deceleration reflected a rebalancing towards more sustainable growth.
The rebalancing of the economy has involved a shift from capital accumulation (in excess of 40
percent of GDP) and exports to domestic consumption, and from manufacturing industry to
services. By 2015-16, the drivers of investment growth had changed. Large debt stocks resulting
from record-high credit growth in 2010-13 continue to weigh on investment growth. Nevertheless,
China’s investment rate remains elevated at 43 percent of GDP in 2016.
Until 2015, commodity importers other than China faced investment headwinds from tight
monetary, fiscal, and prudential policies that were designed to contain rapid credit growth. Also,
the uncertainty due to political problems in Thailand and delays in investment project approvals
in the Philippines held back investment in these countries.
In commodity exporters in the region, investment growth slowed sharply during 2012-14. In large
commodity-exporting economies (Indonesia and Malaysia), this slowdown mainly reflected policy
tightening in response to financial market stress during the 2013 Taper Tantrum, and to weaker
terms-of-trade as a result of declines in commodity prices (especially raw materials, fertilizers,
metals and minerals) from their early-2011 peaks. In smaller, more heavily commodity-dependent
economies, investment contracted as FDI for mining sector projects declined, and as domestic
policies tightened sharply in response to balance of payments stress (World Bank 2015b).
Since 2015, investment growth has begun to recover in the EAP region, with the exception of
China, where it stabilized at around 6.5 percent (Figure 6). This has reflected a number of
developments: stabilizing commodity prices; more accommodative policies amid low inflation and
benign global financial conditions; and buoyant FDI. Various factors contributed to the increased
FDI: a reduction of political turbulence in Thailand; improved prospects for electronics
manufacturing under WTO membership for Vietnam; and the opening up in Myanmar that began
in 2011. In China, the composition of FDI has shifted from manufacturing—held back by rising
wages and production costs, especially in coastal regions—towards services, and from lower
value-added products towards higher value-added products such as cars (UNCTAD 2016).

    II.2. What are the remaining investment needs in the EAP region?

Infrastructure needs and priorities. Income and demographic shifts, and rapid urbanization are the
three main forces driving investment needs in the region (World Bank 2015c, 2016b). Rapid
urbanization, large-scale migration, and population aging place heavy strains on urban
infrastructure for housing, transportation, healthcare, and education. Meeting the growing
demands of these forces requires choosing a balance between economic growth and environmental
protection (ESCAP 2015).4 Estimates of costs vary widely (Inderst 2016; Bhattacharyay 2012;
McKinsey 2014). The largest costs involve road construction and upgrading, energy infrastructure,
and real estate development (McKinsey 2014). The region shows a significant disparity in density
and quality of transport networks, electricity provision and housing, with greater gaps in China,

  For example, in addition to 170 cities in China with populations exceeding 1 million, China is expected
to gain 292 million city dwellers by 2050 (World Economic Forum 2015).

Indonesia, and lower-income ASEAN economies (primarily because of large landmass and
population size). There is substantial demand for upgrading and maintenance of infrastructure in
other regional economies, including Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
Infrastructure upgrades and challenges. Despite some remarkable successes, providing adequate
transport networks, power, water, and other facilities remains a challenge across much of the
region (Figure 7).
Infrastructure projects underway. Extensive construction activities are underway in the region
(BMI 2016). Transport, especially rail, accounts for the largest share. The aim is to integrate the
region's transport networks, and to accommodate rapid urbanization.5 These projects are supported
by government initiatives such as the China’s One Belt One Road.
       China’s highway network more than doubled in size between 2004 and 2014, and the share
        of high-speed railways was boosted from 33 percent to 50 percent of total railway
        kilometers. Yet, transport density still falls far short of that in advanced economies.
        Infrastructure needs vary considerably across Chinese regions, and range from high-profile
        projects (such as high-speed railways) to installing basic municipal infrastructure and
        pollution-reducing or -reversing technologies (World Bank 2013a, World Bank and DRC
        2014).
       Lack of adequate infrastructure are the main cause of Indonesia’s high logistics costs
        (around 17 percent of companies’ total expenditure). Transport costs are high. About one-
        quarter of the population of Indonesia remains without electricity.
       In Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Vietnam, investment in basic road infrastructure is a priority
        (World Bank and Vietnam Ministry of Planning 2016).
       In Malaysia, high-profile projects like the expansion of the public transport system in
        Kuala Lumpur, and airport and port upgrades, are anticipated to proceed through 2020.
        Middle-income ASEAN countries in general, such as Malaysia and Thailand, are still
        investing heavily in the rail and public transport systems.
       The Philippines is particularly weak with regard to transport and trade-related
        infrastructure. It continues to rank above 100 globally in the overall state of its
        infrastructure (World Economic Forum 2015), with particularly low rankings for the
        quality of its seaports and airports. About one-quarter of the population remains without
        electricity.
       In many East Asian countries, about one-third of the population lives in substandard
        housing.

Figure 6. EAP: Investment growth slowdown and investment needs
In 2014, virtually all EAP economies recorded investment growth below their long-term
average, mainly reflecting weak private investment. A rebound of investment in 2015 helped,
but investment growth remains below its long-term average in more than half of EAP economies.
Long-term forecasts suggest continued weakness in investment growth, while sizable investment
needs remain in infrastructure.

A. Ranking of 140 countries according to the quality of their infrastructure. 1= best, 140 = worst.
B. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is constructed through the calculation and aggregation of 20 indicators reflecting
national-level environmental data, including child mortality, wastewater treatment, access to drinking water, access to sanitation,
and air pollution average exposure to PM2.5. These indicators use a “proximity-to-target” methodology, which assesses how close
a particular country is to an identified policy target. Scores are then converted to a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being the farthest from
the target (worst observed value) and 100 being closest to the target (best observed value).
C. Latest data are for 2014.
D. 1= extremely underdeveloped; 7= well developed and efficient by international standards.
E.F. This measures the average level of exposure of a nation's population to concentrations of suspended particles measuring less
than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter, which are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and causing severe
health damage. Exposure is calculated by weighting mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 by population in both urban and rural
areas. Latest data are as of 2013.

and North Africa; SAS is South Asia; SSA is Sub-Saharan Africa.

Health care, education and environment. The region has made great progress in human
development outcomes, including child survival, nutrition, and education. Despite this progress,
the region still faces serious education and human-resource shortfalls (Figure 8).
      Health care. EMDEs in the EAP region have reduced child mortality rates by an average
       of two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. However, child mortality rates in Lao PDR,
       Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste are still well above global averages.
       In addition, the region has historically faced a high burden of disease from infectious
       diseases, some of which have potential global reach (e.g., SARS and pandemic influenza).
       Within a generation, rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are expected to rise, and
       infectious diseases are expected to remain a risk associated with high population mobility
       and environmental degradation (Anbumozhi and Ponciano 2015). Adjusting to these long-
       run trends will require public investment in basic infrastructure, education, health and
       environmental protection.

      Education. Although enrollment in primary education in the region is almost universal,
       there are deficiencies in student retention (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar), quality of
       education (Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao PDR), and knowledge gained as
       measured by literacy rates (Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, Lao PDR, Cambodia).


      Environmental challenges. Many countries in the region face environmental problems that
       threaten to undermine future growth and stability. The main challenges include water
       management, deforestation and land degradation, air pollution, and climate change (Lee
       and Pang 2015). In several major cities in China, air and water pollution presents a growing
       health risk. Pollution levels have also risen in Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia
       since 2010.

East Asia and the Pacific made great progress towards education and human development
outcomes, including child survival, nutrition and education outcomes. Despite clear progress in
the region, some countries still face significant challenges and serious education and human-
resource shortfalls.

participation can help improve efficiency, and at the same time provide funding. Several reforms
can help realize the potential benefits of public-private-partnerships. Governments can centralize
agencies that coordinate national infrastructure, in cooperation with the private sector and
multilateral agencies. Multilateral development banks can work with the private sector to provide
quality and governance assurances. Standardization and a global “code of conduct” can enhance
confidence in the private sector as a good partner. This could include a regulatory framework,
transparency principles, and a system for dispute resolution (McKinsey 2013).
Confidence in the business environment is central to encouraging private investment. Measures to
improve the environment include cutting red tape, clarifying laws and regulations, allowing greater
market access to foreign companies, opening more investment areas to private enterprise
(especially in services sectors), and cutting financing costs. Reforms to deepen capital markets and
to strengthen banking systems (e.g., through faster and more effective insolvency procedures) can
encourage private financing.
In education, policy priorities include a focus on developing skills that are a high priority in labor
markets, keeping in mind that requirements differ across country and sector. Primary and
secondary education must focus on quality and on learning outcomes, and on building effective
educational systems based on autonomy and accountability. The relevance of higher education,
vocational education, and training can be improved by giving institutions the capacity and
incentives to meet labor market demand, and by providing information to improve the matching
between job openings and the skills of prospective workers (World Bank 2014a). In health,
ensuring access to good quality services, without imposing financial hardship, will entail reforms
to the insurance regime, and a shift of focus from hospitals toward high-quality primary care.
The complexity of environmental challenges in the region underlines that there are no easy or
universal solutions to these problems. However, a number of initiatives would be appropriate.
These include a focus on common benefits; emphasis on stakeholder participation; commitment
to scientific and technological research; emphasis on long-term planning; reforms to align resource
and utilities pricing with cost, including externalities; improvements in governance and general
institutional capacity; and a strengthening of regionally coordinated approaches and international
support (Anbumozhi and Ponciano 2015).
Investment growth in EAP is unlikely to revert to the high rates of the previous decade. Demands
for capital formation in the region will nevertheless remain relatively high, and governments and
multilateral agencies will remain important providers of funding. The establishment of the Asia
Infrastructure Investment Bank provides a new source of funding. In March 2016, the Japan
International Cooperation Agency signed an agreement with the Asian Development Bank to
establish a new $1.5 billion fund to support private infrastructure investments across the Asia-
Pacific region. In order to have the desired impact, it is important that investments go to
economically viable projects. Close coordination of regional and global initiatives will help reduce
duplication and inconsistencies in public investment projects (BMI 2016).

III. Europe and Central Asia

Europe and Central Asia (ECA) accounted for 5 percent of global investment during 2010-15.
Investment growth in the region decreased sharply, from a 10.2 percent in 2010 to 0.4 percent in
2015. Partial data for 2016 suggest that investment is bottoming out in 2016, led by easing
investment contractions in Russia and Ukraine. However, regional investment growth remains well
below its long-term (1995-2008) average of 6.5 percent a year.
The slowdown in investment growth in the ECA region was initially concentrated in the Central
Europe in the aftermath of the Euro Area’s debt crisis of 2011-12 and associated recession. The
post-crisis recovery in Central Europe was weak, reflecting impaired banking systems and
corporate sectors in the aftermath of the Euro Area crisis. Lingering concerns about armed conflict
and related geopolitical tensions (Russia, Ukraine), policy uncertainty in several major regional
economies, and adjustment to the terms-of-trade shock in energy exporters (Russia, Azerbaijan,
Kazakhstan) have weighed on regional investment growth.
Meanwhile, current and prospective investment needs are sizable. Investment and major reforms
are needed to increase productivity and set the stage for a sustained growth recovery. However,
efforts to address under-investment are likely to be constrained by the need for sustainable
financing.

   III.1. How has investment growth in the ECA region evolved?

The recent investment growth slowdown was sharp and broad-based. In 2015, investment growth
remained below its long-term averages in three-quarters of the countries in the region, and was
negative in one-quarter of them, including Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine (Figure 9). Between 2010
and 2015, investment growth trends differed markedly between commodity importers, which are
located in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe, and commodity exporters, mainly Russia
and the economies of Central Asia.
The overall slowdown was partly a correction from historically high investment growth prior to
the global financial crisis. Pre-crisis, large capital inflows and credit booms fueled investment
growth in the western part of the region as financial systems became more integrated with those
in the Euro Area. Proximity to, and rapid convergence with, the Euro Area appeared to promise
bright growth prospects as regional labor and product markets became increasingly intertwined
(World Bank 2010). In the eastern part of the region, pre-crisis investment growth was buoyed
by resource development encouraged by high global commodity prices.

Figure 9. Investment growth slowdown in Europe and Central Asia, 2010-15
Regional investment growth declined from 10.2 percent in 2011 to 0.4 percent in 2015. Initially, the decline was
concentrated in the western part of the region and reflected spillovers from the Euro Area crisis. The recovery of
investment growth in the western part of the region in 2014-15 was outweighed by a contraction in oil-exporting
economies in the eastern part of the region, which suffered a major terms-of-trade shock after the oil price drop.
Recession in Russia was exacerbated by international sanctions.

In general, in commodity-importing EMDEs in the region, investment financing became difficult
to obtain from domestic banking sectors that were still healing from the crisis and pre-crisis credit
booms (Hungary, Moldova, Serbia). The 2012-13 debt crisis and subsequent weak growth
prospects in the Euro Area weighed on investor sentiment. Weak trade growth and lower capital
inflows reduced prospects for strong investment returns and increased financing costs. Net capital
inflows exceeded 10 percent of GDP before the crisis but have been negative since 2013 in the
Central and Southeastern Europe. Large foreign currency-denominated debt amplified the damage
to the banking sector (EBRD 2015a). In some countries, this was compounded by policy
uncertainty and lack of public investment (Figure 10). The recovery in investment in commodity-
importing economies has been gradual since 2013, despite support from accommodative monetary
and fiscal policies in some countries, and sharply lower oil prices that lifted business confidence
and real incomes.
In commodity-exporting EMDEs, the global financial crisis-related fiscal stimulus supported
double-digit investment growth in 2010. Investment growth remained robust until 2013, but
slowed sharply once oil prices started sliding in 2014. Since mid-2014, investment has contracted
year-on-year in every quarter, weighed down by the following factors: the unfolding conflict in
Ukraine, intermittent border tensions in the Caucasus, international sanctions that heavily
restricted access to finance in Russia, a severe terms-of-trade shock that hit energy exporters
(Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia), and contracting public sector investment. Neighboring
countries suffered from spillover effects, including weaker trade, remittances, and FDI (World
Bank 2016c).

    III.2. What are current and prospective investment needs in the ECA region?

Infrastructure needs are sizable across the ECA region. The additional investment needed to reach
the investment levels of economies at similar stages of development has been estimated at 1.3
percent of GDP per year, on average (EBRD 2015a; Figure 11).6 Investment priorities vary widely
across the region (Figure 12).
       Russia has implemented important upgrades in certain types of infrastructure, especially
        railways, mobile-cellular telephone networks, and airlines. However, the overall quality of
        infrastructure lags many EMDEs at similar levels of development. Roads, port and air
        transport infrastructure, and electricity supply all need considerable upgrading. The energy
        extraction sector requires an estimated $1.9-3.3 trillion in investment between 2014 and
        2035, while the power generation sector requires $600 billion (International Energy
        Agency 2014; Russian Investment Agency 2015).
       Infrastructure in Turkey exceeds average EMDE quality, but it has come under pressure as
        strife in neighboring countries has brought waves of immigrants: Turkey currently
        accommodates about 56 percent of all registered Syrian refugees. Annual energy
        investments of $12 billion are required to meet the country’s development goals, to
        diversify the sector, and to help narrow Turkey’s current account deficit by reducing energy
        imports (Winrow 2015; Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
        2014). Turkey plans to increase renewable sources of energy, including nuclear, and
        improve energy efficiency (EBRD 2015b). From 2014 to 2018, total infrastructure
        investment needs are estimated at $350 billion (EBRD 2015b).
       For landlocked Central Asia, developing and upgrading infrastructure are critical for
        connectivity and reducing dependence on extractive industries. Investment in the energy
        sector will help to improve electricity access, a major concern for business (ADB 2016).
        Waste water systems in rural areas are also underfunded.
       In other countries in the ECA region, port, road, and railway infrastructure needs
        improvement, and logistics infrastructure needs to be upgraded to foster trade and
        investment (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria). Border bottlenecks should be addressed
        and customs infrastructure improved. Upgrading water supply and irrigation systems will
        enhance productivity in agriculture and reduce environmental degradation (Azerbaijan,
        Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Uzbekistan).

  In addition to 24 countries in ECA region, the estimate includes the Arab Republic of Egypt, Estonia,
Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Mongolia, Morocco, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and Tunisia.

 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia Mongolia, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia in
 addition to 24 countries in ECA. Financing gap for Central Asia and the Caucasus includes all infrastructure
 financing requirements that are not covered by national governments. For Central Asia, the range is GDP

Initiatives are already underway to improve infrastructure in the region:
             In Russia, several hundred infrastructure projects were announced in the past five years,
              with more than half scheduled for completion by 2020. These projects are mostly in more
              densely populated western Russia. The largest allocations are for transport infrastructure
              (especially high-speed rail, and road and bridge construction). But there are also a large
              number of projects underway to improve the supply of utilities (electric power, gas, and
              water).
             Turkey has initiated several public-private partnership projects, including the Caspian and
              Middle Eastern oil and gas pipeline and the $10.2 billion Istanbul Grand Airport. Countries
              in Central Asia—aspiring to become an overland transit and energy hub linking Chinese
              and European markets—has initiated investment projects in energy and transport sectors.
              In the energy sector, major projects include a pipeline from Turkmenistan to India, gas
              sector development in Uzbekistan, and hydroelectric power in Tajikistan. In the transport
              sector, key projects include highways in Kazakhstan, railroads linking Tajikistan and
              Kyrgyz Republic to China and the Islamic Republic of Iran, ports in Turkmenistan and
              Kazakhstan, and an airport in Kyrgyz Republic.
             In Central and South Eastern Europe, the investment pipeline largely reflects EU funding
              to further integrate the EU member states of the region with Western European countries.

The quality of infrastructure in the most of the region is substantially below OECD average. Port container
traffic is limited, highlighting the region’s reliance on road, air, and rail transport. The quality of air and road
transport infrastructure remains well below the OECD average in most of the region. The region is energy
intensive and heavily reliant on non-renewable energy.

Climate adaptation and energy efficiency. ECA is an energy-intensive region that relies heavily
on non-renewable energy. Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Turkey are implementing policy
reforms (such as cost-based energy pricing) and investments in both public infrastructure and
private industry, including renewable energy and energy efficiency, in partnership with the World
Bank. Efforts to adapt to climate change include improved water resource management (flood
protection, water loss reduction, irrigation efficiency) in Kazakhstan; climate-smart agriculture
(switching to more resilient crops) in Tajikistan; and better weather forecasting and climate change
monitoring in Russia.
Education and health. The region has made significant advances in the area of human
development, including reductions in child mortality rates. Many countries in the region have
achieved universal primary enrollment and gender parity in both primary and secondary education,
and literacy rates are high (Figure 13). On average, the ECA region scores above average among
EMDE regions in several education and health indicators. Nevertheless, shortcomings remain.
Levels of learning achievement are low in several countries, and socio-economic and ethnic
disparities in education persist. Among the basic education indicators, regional gaps are most
apparent for math and science education. The region scores well below the EMDE average on
attracting and retaining talent. Building a highly skilled workforce will require improving the
quality of education, investing in on-the-job training, and using talent more effectively.

   III.3. Which policies can help address investment needs in the ECA region?

Unmet investment needs, along with governance, financial, and labor market obstacles, limit
output growth in the region (World Bank 2015d-g; World Bank and Vietnam 2016; World Bank
2016c; EBDR 2015a). While policy priorities depend on country circumstances, appropriate
cyclical and structural policies are needed in all cases to raise investment growth. Fiscal policy
could help most directly by expanding public investment while monetary policy could boost
activity by lowering financing costs. Structural reforms could address factors holding back private
investment, including by boosting productivity and aggregate growth prospects and improving the
business climate.
This constrains their ability to finance public investment and places a premium on reforms that
encourage private investment. Only a few regional economies can tap debt markets to finance
infrastructure, while weak domestic banking systems and underdeveloped capital markets restrict
the ability of governments to borrow domestically.
With weak growth, limited fiscal resources, and net capital outflows, the gap between
infrastructure needs and the ability of governments to meet those needs may widen. This places a
premium on measures to improve investment efficiency and to obtain funding from multilateral
sources or the private sector.

Figure 13. Human development indicators
Health and educational expenditure is highest among EMDE region and close to the OECD
average. The region made significant advances in the area of human development. Nevertheless,
important shortcomings remain. Among the basic education indicators, the region scores below
the OECD average in math and science outcomes. The region also lags behind both the OECD
and the EMDE average in attracting and retaining talent.

Many EMDEs in the ECA region remain under pressure to consolidate their fiscal positions to
reduce high debt-to-GDP ratios and ensure long-term fiscal sustainability (Georgia, Hungary).
Investment efficiency. Effective public investments can meet needs with less cost (Dabla-Norris
et al. 2012), but regional institutional capacities fall behind the standards in advanced economies
in this area (Figure 14). The eastern part of the ECA region ranks particularly low in relevant
measures, including social stability, government effectiveness, and corruption. The efficiency of
investments can be enhanced through a strategic, rigorous and transparent project selection
mechanism and through strong institutions able to fund, manage, execute and monitor project
implementation.
Private funding. Policy efforts can be geared toward developing private funding sources for
investment. Many countries still lack adequate frameworks for effective public-private
partnerships, which can improve the effectiveness of public investment (Engel, Fischer, and
Galetovic 2014). Capital market reforms can help channel domestic savings towards private
investment (EBRD 2015a).
Multilateral funding sources. The region, especially the South Caucasus and Central Asia, will
continue to depend on financial support from multilateral development institutions such as the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Asian Development Bank, and the
World Bank. Countries in Central Asia will likely be the largest beneficiaries of China’s “One
Belt, One Road” (OBOR) initiative, due to their locations and natural resource abundance. EU
structural funds will continue to play an important role in closing investment gaps in Central and
South Eastern Europe.

IV. Latin America and the Caribbean

Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) accounted for 7 percent of global investment in 2010-
15.7 During this period, investment growth slowed sharply in the region, from about 12.5 percent
in 2010 to -4.8 percent in 2015, well below its long-term (1990-2008) average of 4.6 percent.
Regional investment is projected to decline further, by more than 1 percent, in 2016.
The decline in investment growth in the LAC region in 2010-15 was concentrated in commodity
exporters. It reflected domestic macroeconomic challenges, a sharp terms-of-trade deterioration
resulting from declines in global commodity prices, and slowdowns in economic growth, with
outright recessions in some cases. Current and prospective investment needs are sizable, especially
in education and infrastructure.

  Throughout this section, unless otherwise specified, investment refers to real gross fixed capital formation
(public and private combined). For the sake of brevity, “investment” is understood to indicate investment
levels. Investment growth is measured as the annual percent change in real investment.

     IV.1. How has investment growth evolved in the LAC region?

The LAC region accounted for 7 percent of global investment during 2010-15, less than LAC’s 8
percent share of global output. This investment underperformance reflects low investment-to-GDP
ratios in LAC, averaging around 22 percent during 2010-15, significantly below the EMDE
average of 32 percent. Current private investment-to-GDP ratios have fallen below levels prior to
the global financial crisis (IMF 2015b).
Regional investment has contracted since 2014 amid deep recessions in several of the region’s
largest economies (Argentina, Brazil, República Bolivariana de Venezuela) and growth
slowdowns in the rest of the region (Figure 15). In 2015, investment growth was below its long-
term average in two-thirds of LAC economies and negative in one-third of them (Brazil, Chile,
Ecuador, Jamaica, and Peru). Preliminary data point to a further investment decline in the first half
of 2016.

Figure 15. LAC: Investment growth slowdown
Partly due to weak overall economic growth, investment growth slowed sharply during 2010-
15. The investment slowdown was broad-based across various sectors and across both private
and public investment. Investment growth is expected to remain low and may decline further in
the short to medium term.

The declines mark a sharp reversal of the region’s robust investment growth before 2010, when
LAC countries were buoyed by robust overall growth prospects, still-elevated commodity prices,
and relative political stability in the region. During 2010-15, investment growth averaged 3.9
percent, significantly below the 7.8 percent average during 2003-08. The recent weakening of
investment growth has returned investment-to-GDP ratios near their levels in the early 2000s. The
slowdown in investment growth has been broad-based across various sectors, and across public
and private investment. In light of the weakened economic growth prospects for the region,
investment growth is expected to remain low in the short to medium term.
South America, with a large share of commodity exporters, experienced the sharpest downturn in
investment growth in the LAC region as these economies’ terms of trade deteriorated sharply
(World Bank 2016d). Investment in Mexico and many other countries in Central America has been
more robust as reform agendas, especially in Mexico, have bolstered confidence. Investment
growth has also picked up in the Caribbean, partly due to strong construction growth supporting
the tourism sector.
The post-crisis slump in commodity prices and associated deterioration in the terms of trade
triggered sharp investment drops in commodity-producing sectors, in particular mining, across the
region (World Bank 2016e; Figure 16). Investment also declined in non-commodity-producing
sectors. Public investment was curtailed as fiscal revenues shrank and fiscal deficits widened as a
result of lower commodity prices and slowing growth. Private investment declined as investor
confidence in growth prospects waned, especially among major commodity exporters (IADB
2016, IMF 2015a). Political and policy uncertainty has also dampened investor confidence and
discouraged investment expenditures in several countries in recent years (Argentina, Brazil, Haiti,
República Bolivariana de Venezuela) (IMF 2016a).
Tightening financing conditions in the region further weighed on investment. As the U.S. Federal
Reserve began to reduce monetary accommodation in 2014-15, currencies of major commodity
exporters in the region depreciated against the dollar, some by around 30 percent in 2015 (Brazil,
Colombia). Coupled with severe weather conditions that affected domestic food supplies, upward
pressures on inflation led some central banks in the region, especially in South America, to raise
interest rates in 2015-16 to contain price rises despite weak output growth (Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia), further dampening investment growth.

   IV.2. What are current and prospective investment needs in the LAC region?

Investment needs in the region remain significant. The low quality of infrastructure and poor skills
of the labor force are bottlenecks to the achievement of faster productivity growth, for example in
Brazil (World Bank 2016d), and to poverty reduction. Infrastructure has not kept pace with
urbanization in the region (IADB 2010), while the majority of the poor in LAC are in urban areas.
Immediate needs for investment in infrastructure and education have also been identified in
country studies of Belize, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti,
Honduras, Panama, and Uruguay (World Bank 2015h-p, and 2016e).

 Figure 16. LAC: Correlates of investment growth slowdown
 The investment slowdown has coincided with severe terms-of-trade deteriorations, sharp output
 growth slowdowns, slowing FDI inflows, political tensions, and domestic policy tightening.

Infrastructure investment. On average across the 16 EMDEs in LAC over 2008-13, infrastructure
investment amounted to just 3.7 percent of GDP, well below the 5-6 percent of GDP required just
to sustain current economic growth rates (Bhattacharya, Romani, and Stern 2012; Kohli and Basil
2010; Fay and Yepes 2003; Calderón and Servén 2003; and Perrotti and Sánchez 2011). Apart
from low investment levels, the quality of infrastructure in the LAC region is poor relative to that
of advanced economies and Asian emerging markets. The average LAC economy ranked 82nd
out of 138 economies (around the 40th percentile) on quality of infrastructure (World Economic
Forum 2016; Figure 17). Priority infrastructure needs in the region include improving road
conditions through maintenance and rehabilitation (Uruguay), upgrading infrastructure relating to


                                                                                             31
energy (Panama), increasing access to electricity in rural areas (Bolivia), enhancing the quality of
roads and ports (Costa Rica), and reducing the prices of electricity (Costa Rica).
Education. While public education expenditure in the region is on par with the EMDE average,
various metrics of the quality of education systems, such as the average student-teacher ratio, fall
short of EMDE comparators. Urgent education needs include improved pre-school education and
access to early childhood education; better teacher training and quality; and a reorientation of
education programs towards employer needs, such as information technology and English
language skills (Belize, Bolivia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama).
Public health. The region’s public health expenditures are slightly above that of EMDE
comparators. Health infrastructure, such as access to improved sanitation and improved water
sources, exceeds that of EMDE peers. However, urgent health care investment needs remain
(World Bank 2015i, m). These include tackling malnutrition (Guatemala), increasing access to
improved sanitation in rural and urban areas, and access to specialized health care services for
women and children (Bolivia).

   IV.3. Which policies can help address investment needs in the LAC region?

While policy priorities differ across countries, most economies in the region have limited funds to
expand public investment spending. The lack of resources places a premium on the efficiency of
public investment, which may be enhanced by leveraging public funds with public-private
partnerships and implementing reforms to stimulate private investment.
      Strengthening the efficiency of public investment includes streamlining the process for the
       development, approval, and selection of projects (IADB 2016). Transparency in the project
       selection process and its monitoring and coordination between multiple stakeholders can
       help remove inefficiencies.
      Several countries have begun to develop public-private partnership frameworks (Chile,
       Colombia, Peru). If designed well, these can improve the efficiency of public investment
       spending (Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic 2014).
      LAC economies rank low on ease of business startup and tax compliance (South America
       and Central America), as well as trading across borders and registering property (Caribbean
       and South America) (World Bank 2017b). Reforms to ease these constraints can also
       encourage investment.

V. Middle East and North Africa

The Middle East and North Africa (MNA) accounted for 4 percent of global investment, on
average, during 2010–15.8 Investment growth in the region slowed from 4.4 percent in 2010 to 2.6
percent in 2015, far below the long-term (1990–2008) average of 7.2 percent, with considerable
divergence among oil exporters and importers (Figure 18).
This section documents the recent slowdown in investment growth in the Middle East and North
Africa due to the severe terms-of-trade deteriorations in oil-exporting economies and uncertainty
associated with deep political changes in several oil-importing economies. Remaining investment
needs are sizable, especially in the transport and energy sectors.

    V.1. How has investment growth in the MNA region evolved?

In 2015, investment growth remained below its long-term average in 70 percent of EMDEs in the
region, and investment contracted 30 percent of the EMDEs in the region. However, investment
developments have diverged between oil exporters and oil importers since the broad-based
slowdown in investment growth during 2010–13.
Investment growth in oil-exporting economies has evolved in line with oil prices, which rose
rapidly in 2010 and 2011. When the steep oil price decline began in mid-2014, governments
initially responded with additional fiscal stimulus, often in the form of public investment. As a
result, investment growth in oil-exporting economies rose more than 3 percentage points in 2014,
to 7.3 percent. Yet, sharp oil revenue losses and fiscal constraints brought project delays and
cancellations in 2015. Investment growth fell to an average of 2.4 percent in 2015, the slowest
pace since 1994, and investment contracted in three of the four largest oil-exporting economies in
the region (Algeria, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Saudi Arabia). Preliminary data suggest further
contraction in investment in 2016 in oil-exporting economies. For example, Saudi Arabia, the
largest economy in the region, experienced a 16 percent year-on-year contraction in the first half
of the year.
Among oil-importing countries, investment growth decelerated sharply in 2011, to 0.2 percent,
when mounting political tensions during the Arab Spring were rapidly followed by an intensifying
Euro Area sovereign debt crisis. The sharp recovery of investment growth in 2015, to 4.0 percent,
reflected efforts to address infrastructure needs in Egypt and Morocco, the two largest oil-
importing economies in the region, while investment contracted in several smaller oil importers
(Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia). The private sector contributed more strongly than the public sector to
investment growth in Egypt, a typical pattern among oil importers. Even with the recovery in 2015,
investment growth in oil-importing countries was still below the long-term average of 5.1 percent.
Heightened balance of payments and fiscal pressures in Egypt were likely accompanied by weaker

  Throughout this section, unless otherwise specified, investment refers to real gross fixed capital formation
(public and private combined). For the sake of brevity, “investment” is understood to indicate investment
levels. Investment growth is measured as the annual percent change in real investment.

Figure 18. MNA: Investment growth slowdown
Investment growth slowed from 4.2 percent in 2010 to 0.5 percent in 2015. The slowdown reflects a severe
terms-of-trade deterioration in oil exporters, spillovers from armed conflict, and political uncertainty in
oil importers.

investment growth in 2016. Recently-implemented structural reforms and expansionary policy
among oil-importing countries may lift investment in the medium term, however (IMF 2016b).
A severe terms-of-trade deterioration in oil exporters, far-reaching political changes, and spillovers
from armed conflict in several countries in the region weighed heavily on activity and sentiment.
As growth prospects dimmed, especially among oil-exporting countries, investment growth
slowed sharply across the region.
Oil-exporting countries—where oil and gas accounts for, on average, 40 percent of GDP, 70
percent of fiscal revenues, and 80 percent of goods exports—have been hard-hit by the sharp oil
price decline since mid-2014. The terms of trade of oil exporters in the region deteriorated sharply
between 2011 and 2015. Panel regression estimates suggest that the terms-of-trade shock
accounted for nearly all of the slowdown in investment growth. A two-year growth contraction in
the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2013 and 2014 also contributed to the slowdown.
In oil importers, deepening political uncertainty associated with profound institutional changes in
2011 weighed heavily on investment. Political risk deteriorated particularly sharply in Egypt and
Tunisia, where civil uprisings led to regime change, and has not yet recovered to 2010 levels.
Developments in the larger economies in the region had spillovers to confidence in the smaller
ones (World Bank 2015q). On average, such political uncertainty may have been associated with
slower investment growth of approximately 1.5 percentage points during 2011–15.

   V.2. What are the remaining investment needs in the MNA region?

A ramping up of infrastructure investment is needed across MNA (Figure 19). In oil-importing
and non-GCC oil-exporting countries, where the quality of infrastructure is on par with that in all
EMDEs, there is significant underinvestment in the transport (in particular, roads) and electricity
sectors. In Lebanon, frequent blackouts make electricity a binding constraint to competitiveness
and doing business, and in recent years this was also the case in Egypt (World Bank 2015q; Le
Borgne and Jacobs 2016). Large numbers of Syrian refugees in Jordan and Lebanon have
compounded existing strains on infrastructure in those countries. In Syria, the cost of rebuilding
infrastructure damaged or destroyed by war is estimated to be on the order of $100–200 billion
(Gobat and Kostial 2016). Iraq, as well, faces large infrastructure investment needs, which have
risen as a result of conflict.
GCC countries also have outstanding infrastructure investment needs, predominantly in electricity
generation. With higher income levels, however, these countries also have greater capacity to
fulfill such needs (IMF 2014b). GCC countries’ planned medium-term public spending on
infrastructure generally tracks their infrastructure investment needs, while planned spending in oil-
importing and non-GCC oil-exporting countries lags far behind needs (Ianchovichina et al. 2013).
Besides contributing to growth, higher investment in infrastructure could also help improve labor
market conditions in MNA. One study estimated that each $1 billion of infrastructure investment
has the potential to generate 110,000 infrastructure-related jobs, on average, in oil-importing MNA
countries (Estache et al. 2013). It is key that countries prioritize investment projects to suit country
conditions, however.

Infrastructure investment needs are high, especially in electricity and transport. While the Middle
East and North Africa performs well relative to other EMDEs on basic health measures, it is at

MNA scores well relative to other emerging and developing regions on basic health measures.
However, the region is at or below the EMDE average in terms of education indicators, despite
considerable long-term gains (World Bank 2011). MNA does not necessarily need to increase the
level of investment in education, which has risen substantially over several decades, but rather to
invest with the goal of increasing the quality of education, thereby supporting growth and lowering
poverty (World Bank 2008).

   V.3. Which policies can help address investment needs in the MNA region?

Several policy measures could support investment in MNA. Across the region, the scaling back of
subsidies since 2014 has created space for increased public spending on investment in
infrastructure, health, and education (IMF 2016b). High public sector wage expenditures could be
reduced, with funds reallocated to investment. Improvements in governance and investor
protection could also support private sector investment, as could incentives to undertake public-
private partnerships (e.g., in Morocco; EBRD 2015a). In some oil importers, the electricity sector
would benefit from additional privatization (Lebanon) or efforts to incentivize the private sector’s
contribution to electricity generation (Egypt). Finally, improved security conditions in the region
are a prerequisite for a sustained pickup in investment.

VI. South Asia

South Asia (SAR) accounted for 4 percent of global investment, on average, over 2010-15. Despite
an uptick in public investment spending, a deceleration in the private sector resulted in a substantial
decline in overall investment growth, from 11 percent in 2011 to 3 percent in 2014. A rebound, to
6 percent in 2015, still left the growth rate below the long-term (1990-2008) average of 8 percent.
Recent investment weakness in South Asia reflects the legacy of weak output growth during 2010-
13, excess manufacturing capacity in the face of sluggish external demand, and some uncertainty
about government policy. These factors have compounded the long-term problems of structural
bottlenecks, weak banking systems, and bouts of political tension. Needs for capital formation
remain sizable, especially in the energy and transport sectors; the region also lags in the provision
of health and education services. Governments can help directly, and by encouraging private sector
participation. More broadly, improvements to the general business environment (e.g., through
more streamlined regulations and reduced corruption) would enhance incentives for productive
investment.

   VI.1. How has investment growth in the SAR region evolved?

Weak investment has been a drag on South Asia’s recent, consumption-driven expansion (World
Bank 2016i). Investment growth slowed sharply from 11 percent in 2011 to 3 percent in 2014,
with only a modest rebound to 6 percent in 2015—barely half of its 2011 pace and well below the
long-term (1990-2008) average of 8 percent (Figure 20). The downward trend reflects a slackening
in India, (which accounts for more than three-quarters of the region’s total investment), which
offset a pickup in Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan. Preliminary data suggests continued investment
weakness in 2016.

Figure 20. Investment growth slowdown in South Asia
Investment growth has been below the long-term average in more than half of SAR economies since
2012. Its composition has shifted away from private sector-driven investment growth during 2013-14
towards public sector-driven investment growth in 2015. While lower oil prices and easing political
tensions supported investment, weak activity during 2010-12 and long-standing structural bottlenecks
constrained investment.

In India, gross fixed capital formation has been on a downward trend since 2011, with a shift in
the composition from private to public. While public investment rose by 21 percent in FY2016,
private investment (which accounts for two-thirds of the total) contracted by 1.4 percent, reducing
overall investment growth to 4 percent. Infrastructure demand is expected to go up to $1 trillion
under the 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-17). Going forward, public and private investment should be
supported by higher allocations in the FY2017 federal government budget to build and upgrade
infrastructure, and the setup of a $3 billion National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
In Pakistan, investment surged in 2015, mainly reflecting the China-Pakistan Economic
Partnership (CPEC) infrastructure project (worth $45 billion). This has more than compensated
for sluggishness in private investment. The project is part of China’s “One Belt, One Road”
initiative, and consists of a network of highways, railways, and pipelines to connect Western China
to the Arabian Sea through the Gwadar Port in Pakistan. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed
interest in early 2016 to join the CPEC project. Combined with the ongoing gas pipeline project
from the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan should be able to maintain robust public investment
growth in the near-term, while private investment is expected to pickup in the medium-term.
In Bangladesh, capital formation is estimated to remain weak in 2016, partly as a result of
heightened political tensions and security concerns. Sri Lanka’s investment contracted by 2 percent
in 2016, following the suspension of the $1.4 billion Colombo Port City real estate project for
more than one year in 2015. In the near-term, investment growth in Sri Lanka is expected to
continue on a downward trend, following the tightening of monetary policy in mid-2016 that raised
financing costs. Fiscal consolidation, aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP
by 2020 under the IMF’s $1.5 billion Extended Fund Facility program, will weigh on infrastructure
spending (IMF 2016c).
During 2010-13, weak economic activity weighed on investment and business confidence. Since
2014, however, investor sentiment in the region has benefited from sharply lower oil prices, easing
political tensions, and revived reform agendas in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, as well as easing
vulnerabilities in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. This uptick has yet to translate into a robust
rebound in private investment. Structural bottlenecks (e.g., power shortages, poor road and rail
networks) and administrative requirements constitute barriers to investment, and weak banking
sectors constrain investment finance.
India’s steep private investment slowdown has been attributed to several factors (World Bank
2016i; Tokuoka 2012). First, the need to unwind excess capacity built during the pre-financial
crisis growth boom amid weak external demand (e.g., in the manufacturing sector) has discouraged
new projects and caused investors to shelve existing projects. Second, policy uncertainty has been
a factor. For example, the stalled Land Acquisition Bill has extended project development
timelines. Lack of federal and state government coordination, on compensation for land acquisition
and environmental clearances, has contributed to cost and time overruns. Third, lenders have been
less willing to finance overleveraged corporates, especially in infrastructure-related sectors (e.g.,
power and other utilities, steel, and cement firms). In particular, the Reserve Bank of India’s 2015
corporate governance reforms in state-owned banks (which represent two-thirds of the total
banking sector lending) has adversely affected lending to leveraged corporates and conglomerates.

   VI.2. What are the remaining investment needs in the SAR region?

South Asia is the second most densely populated region in the world, behind East Asia and Pacific,
with large and pressing investment needs for infrastructure improvement (Bloom and Rosenberg
2011; Figure 21). Metrics of human capital provision (e.g., expenditure on education and
healthcare, teacher-pupil ratios, doctor-patient ratios, availability of improved water and sanitation
in rural areas), are below the EMDEs average (World Bank 2016j). This suggests that sizable
additional outlays on human capital could effectively alleviate poverty (Romer 2016; Estache and
Garsous 2012). Rapid urbanization and the maintenance of growth momentum, call for
improvement of energy and transport infrastructure (Ellis and Roberts 2016; Inderst 2016;
Battacharya 2012; ADB 2009, 2012; Andres, Biller, and Dappe 2014).
South Asia is one of the least economically integrated regions in the world (World Bank 2016a).
This has been attributed to inadequacies in transport and power infrastructure (ADB 2009).
Coverage differs within countries and across the region, with India and Pakistan somewhat better
positioned than other countries.
Energy shortages (electricity, diesel) remain a critical constraint to activity in the region.
Underdeveloped within-country and cross-border electricity grid network connectivity and, in
some cases, geopolitical tensions have contributed to significant energy shortfalls, compounding
regular electricity outages. In India, dependence on imported fuels for power generation, and low
electricity tariffs have hampered power generation capacity, which now requires significant
expansion to meet energy shortfalls (McKinsey 2011).
Bangladesh’s infrastructure quality lags behind other countries in the region: power shortages and
poor transport infrastructure have affected investment and productivity (World Bank 2015r). The
7th Five Year Plan estimates that about $410 billion in financing—twice the size of 2015 GDP—
is needed for developing Bangladesh’s infrastructure. Investment is also needed in public health
care, where expenditure has declined from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2010 to 0.7 percent of GDP in
2014 (World Bank 2015e, 2016h).
In Sri Lanka, fiscal consolidation, coupled with priority spending to rebuild infrastructure after a
25-year civil war, has crowded out expenditure for human capital-building purposes. Government
spending on education fell from 2.7 to 1.8 percent of GDP during 2006-13, while spending on
health declined from 2.0 to 1.4 percent of GDP over the same period (World Bank 2016k).

     VI.3. Which policies can help address infrastructure needs in the SAR region?

The alleviation of some longstanding obstacles to growth would help increase the level and
productivity of investment of all forms. A more targeted, multi-pronged, policy strategy could also
encourage investment by increasing returns to investment, and by expanding the financing
envelope (Henckel and Mckibbin, 2010; Nataraj 2007).

Private investment. Under the right conditions, public investment can crowd-in private
investment (World Bank 2016i).9 For example, private firms may be able to reap the benefits of
scale, if public infrastructure facilitates market access (Calderón,Moral-Benitob, and Servéna
2010). However, in South Asia, only India appears to have experienced a positive crowding-in
effect (Jesintha and Sathanapriya 2011; World Bank 2006).
Financing. Financing for public and private investment can be expanded in a number of ways to
narrow the investment financing gap (Andres, Biller, and Dappe 2014; McKinsey 2013; ADB
2012, 2009). First, public-private partnership may offer efficiency gains and cost-effectiveness
(e.g., infrastructure funds), and at the same time alleviate fiscal pressures (Anadon and Surana
2015; Nataraj 2007). This can help reallocate government spending to socially desirable projects
that cannot, in practice, be undertaken by the private sector, for instance, because of an unduly low
private rate of return (e.g., water supply and sanitation projects). Second, domestic savings can be
mobilized by improving access to the financial system (e.g., encouraging pension funds) and by
broadening and raising government revenue collection. Third, banks’ lending capacities can be
increased by strengthening their balance sheets, and the efficiency of capital allocation may be
improved by increasing the commercial orientation of banks, including through privatization and
governance reforms. Fourth, greater commercial orientation (through privatizations or
concessions to private investors) of state-owned enterprises could raise efficiency and increase
investment. Fifth, reducing asset-liability mismatches through greater use of funding through
capital markets (e.g., infrastructure bonds), can be an alternative to heavy reliance on bank lending
for infrastructure-related projects. Finally, FDI in infrastructure can be encouraged by removing
regulatory obstacles to doing business in restricted sectors (Kirkpatrick, Parker, and Zhang 2006;
World Bank 2000).
Reforms to foster an enabling environment. South Asia is just ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa, but
behind the other regions in terms of a conducive business climate (World Bank 2016f; Lopez‐
Acevedo, Medvedev, and Palmade 2016). Entry and administrative barriers in many sectors
(construction, finance, retail and wholesale, telecommunication, and health care) in Bangladesh,
India, and Pakistan have hampered investment in these sectors. The burden of regulatory
compliance, delays in utility connections, difficulties in obtaining permits to start and operate
business, high taxes, and rigid labor markets raise the cost of doing business and discourage
investment (Pachouri and Sharma 2016; Shirke and Srija 2014). Compared to an average of 103
days in EMDE, obtaining services from utilities (e.g., electricity) can take four time as long in
Bangladesh and almost twice as long in Pakistan (World Bank 2016f). In India, investors point to
restrictive labor laws as contributing to lower productivity in the manufacturing sector, restricting
employment opportunities for women, and discouraging the adoption of new technologies.
Reforms that promote competitiveness and reduce barriers to trade can encourage investment in
the tradable export-oriented sectors (e.g., services and manufacturing). This can also level the
playing field and increase profitability of exporting, or of competing with imports in hitherto
protected industries (Alfaro and Chari 2014). More generally, reforms to reduce regulatory

 Public investment could also lead to crowding-out of private investment, e.g. Pakistan (World Bank
2016g).

                                                 43
burdens (e.g., land acquisition, environmental impact assessment) and to strengthen public-private
partnerships legislation (e.g., consistent regulations, transparent bidding procedures) can foster
investment. Strengthening public investment management processes, integrating infrastructure
projects in budget cycles, and curbing corruption in infrastructure projects will not only improve
quality of the infrastructure, but also improve the efficiency of government spending (KPMG
2011; Ali 2009).
Stability. Policy and political uncertainty represents a deterrent to investment in parts of the
region. Security challenges (Afghanistan, Pakistan) and geopolitical tensions (India, Pakistan)
remain a formidable obstacle to creating a more conducive investment climate (Dash, Nafaraj, and
Sahoo 2014) especially for cross-border projects that could increase regional economic integration.
Stalled reforms on land (acquisition, compensation, and environmental clearances) remain a
drawback on infrastructure-related private investment. Reforms to enhance efficiency of labor
market—encouraging greater female labor market participation, facilitating hiring and redundancy
procedures, and reducing taxes on low-paid workers—would increase the mobility and flexibility
of the work force (Shirke and Srija 2014). In turn, the resulting increase in profitability, as well as
the improvement in household incomes, would provide incentives for the expansion of businesses,
including small and medium-size enterprises.

VII. Sub-Saharan Africa

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounted for a modest 2 percent of global investment, on average,
during 2010-15. However, it suffered the sharpest investment growth slowdown among EMDE
regions despite large-scale public investment efforts until recently. Investment growth slowed
from nearly 8 percent in 2010 to 0.3 percent in 2015, on average—well below the long-term (1990-
2008) average of about 6 percent.
The investment growth slowdown in Sub-Saharan Africa is concentrated in South Africa and oil
exporters. It reflected domestic political tensions, a sharp terms of trade deterioration and, in some
economies, domestic policy tightening. Investment needs remain sizable in agriculture,
infrastructure, and health and education.


   VII.1. How has investment in the SSA region evolved?

For Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, investment growth averaged about 5 percent in 2010-15, less
than half the average annual growth of 12 percent recorded prior the global financial crisis, despite
rapid public investment growth until 2014. In more than two-thirds of SSA countries, investment
growth was below its long-term average in 2015 and, in more than one-third, it was negative
(Figure 22).
Investment growth was particularly weak in South Africa and a number of oil exporters, but was
robust among metals exporters. Investment growth averaged just 2.5 percent per year in South
Africa in 2010-15, compared with over 9 percent in 2000-08, reflecting deep structural constraints,
including inefficiencies in state-owned enterprises.


                                                  44
Among oil exporters, investment growth slowed significantly in Angola, Chad, and Nigeria; and
was negative in Equatorial Guinea. The sharp decline in oil prices was compounded by the
introduction of foreign exchange controls or weak business environments that weighed on
investors’ sentiment. However, in Cameroon and Gabon, large infrastructure programs continued
to raise investment growth, despite a decline in investment in the oil industry.
Investment growth in metals-exporting countries averaged 11.3 percent per year over the period
2010-15 (compared with 8.5 percent in 2000-08), with double-digit growth rates in Ghana,
Mozambique, and Namibia. Investment growth in Ghana benefited from a more stable economic
environment, while Mozambique’s and Namibia’s extractive industries continued to attract foreign
investment. Some metals exporters were subject to domestic shocks that held back investment,
including power shortages (Botswana, Zambia), deteriorating security conditions (Niger), the
Ebola virus (Liberia, Sierra Leone), and political uncertainty (the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Zambia).
Investment growth has been solid in agricultural exporters, such as Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and
Senegal, supported by the implementation of infrastructure development projects. However,
investment growth stagnated in commodity importers such as Cabo Verde and Mauritius,
reflecting a slowdown in their main trading partners. It was highly volatile in a number of fragile
or conflict affected countries.
External shocks, including the end of the commodity super cycle, a marked slowdown in major
trading partners, and rising domestic vulnerabilities contributed to the investment growth
slowdown in the region. Prior to the global financial crisis, higher commodity prices, low global
risk aversion and favorable domestic growth prospects prompted significant capital inflows in the
region. Average net FDI inflows grew from 0.5 percent of GDP in 1974-94 to 2.2 percent of GDP
in 1995-2008 (Calderon and Boreux 2016). By contrast, over the period 2010-15, during which
commodity prices declined sharply, net FDI flows averaged 1.9 percent of GDP.
This period of investment growth slowdown in the region coincided with a weak growth recovery
in the European Union, the slowdown of economic activity in China as it embarked on the
rebalancing of its economy toward more domestic consumption, and the appreciation of the U.S.
dollar. The European Union, the United States, and China are the region’s main sources of foreign
investment. This triple blow of weak growth in major export markets, lower commodity prices and
a higher U.S. dollar hit the region’s oil exporters particularly hard. During 2010-15, net FDI flows
averaged just 0.4 percent of GDP in oil exporters, down from 2.5 percent of GDP in 2004-08. Net
FDI flows were negative in Angola and Equatorial Guinea. In contrast, in oil importers, net FDI
flows rose, averaging over 3 percent of GDP, as investors responded to growth opportunities in
construction, light manufacturing and renewable energy.

Investment growth has slowed sharply from about 8 percent in 2010 to near-zero in 2015,
despite significant public investment until 2014. The slowdown has reflected a severe terms-of-

political tensions.

In addition to the unfavorable external environment, the slowdown in investment growth reflected
weak macroeconomic fundamentals and policies, and an uncertain institutional and legal
framework in some countries. Fiscal and current account balances have deteriorated across the
region since 2010 (World Bank 2015s). In 2014, 33 countries registered fiscal deficits greater than
5 percent of GDP (up from 25 in 2007), while 15 countries had a current account deficit exceeding
5 percent of GDP (up from only five in 2007) (Calderon and Boreux 2016). This meant that, in
some countries, policy makers lacked the ability to conduct countercyclical policies to support
economic activity, while rising vulnerabilities weighed on capital inflows. Large current account
deficits and falling capital inflows put pressures on real exchange rates. Rising inflation, reflecting
deep currency depreciations, prompted central banks in a number of commodity exporters to
tighten policy, making it costly for firms to invest.
In many countries, basic reforms to improve the business environment—including the rule of
law—have been negligible, especially among resource–rich countries. Uncertainty about the
enforcement of contracts, property rights and the direction of policy was compounded by weak
investment planning and execution capacity. These factors played a significant role in slowing
investment growth across the region.

   VII.2. What are Sub-Saharan Africa’s remaining investment needs?

Sub-Saharan Africa’s strategic priorities to reinvigorate growth and reduce poverty call for
investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and health and education (World Bank 2016l).
In agriculture, which provides the livelihood for almost two-thirds of Sub-Saharan Africa’s
population, investments are needed to raise farm productivity. Increasing investments in
agricultural R&D is not only essential for boosting growth in the region but also for accelerating
its transformation. Infrastructure investments are needed to support agricultural productivity
growth and potential export diversification. These include investments to build or improve
irrigation, road, and storage infrastructure, and to develop higher value chains and markets.
Although some countries in the region have made progress in improving their infrastructure,
results vary. Improved infrastructure was partly responsible for the region’s recent strong growth
performance (Calderon and Serven 2008). That contribution reflected mostly advances in
information communication technology (ICT). The region has experienced an unprecedented
increase in mobile phone subscriptions. By contrast, progress in the power sector has been far more
limited. Only a third of households have access to electricity (World Bank 2016l).
      The deterioration in the quantity and quality of power infrastructure has increased the need
       for investment in renewable energies. These have the potential to improve access to
       electricity while addressing climate change challenges.
      Transport infrastructure development has also been limited. In many countries, only a
       small proportion of the road network is paved. Railways development is inadequate.
      Across the region, investments are needed to improve the quality of education and skills,
       the health status of the populations, and the coverage of infrastructure services, notably

       access to improved sanitation. Despite recent progress, Sub-Saharan Africa lags other
       regions (Figure 23).
The region’s infrastructure investment needs are large, estimated at 15 percent of GDP, reflecting
insufficient and inefficient spending on capital, operation, and maintenance expenditures (Foster
and Briceno-Garmendia 2010). Financing to address these investment needs has increased. The
external sources of financing for infrastructure have expanded. Official development finance—led
by the World Bank and the African Development Bank—has increased appreciably and is
supporting transport and water and sanitation investments in a number of countries. China emerged
as a major bilateral source of infrastructure finance. Chinese investments have increasingly
targeted the energy sector and hydropower in particular. Direct private sector participation in
infrastructure investment has surged. Private participation in infrastructure now accounts for more
than half of total external finance, with a large share of the investments going to the telecom,
energy and transport sectors (Gutman, Sy, and Chattopadhyay 2015).

VII.3. Which policies can help address the SSA region’s remaining infrastructure investment
needs?

Financing for infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa from multilateral development banks, China,
and the private sector tripled between 2004 and 2012 (Gutman, Sy, and Chattopadhyay 2015).
External financing for infrastructure grew fastest in the energy sector, with Ethiopia, Ghana,
Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa among the largest recipients. Untapped opportunities remain,
including in renewable energy (EBRD 2016) as well as in other investments that can support
private sector development. Innovative financing solutions for infrastructure investment that
mitigate risk factors for investors have been developed. Tools such as blended finance, co-
financing between private investors and development finance institutions, public-private
partnerships and climate finance instruments are being deployed in countries across the region
(IFC 2016). Nevertheless, financing investment projects remain challenging. Although private
investment has become significant and covers a broad range of countries, it has focused more on
ICT than other sectors.
Despite the rising importance of external finance, public sector budgets remain the primary source
of funding for infrastructure investments in the region. Countries across the region finance about
65 percent of their infrastructure expenditures with domestic resources (IMF 2014c). In some
countries, the fiscal space created by debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries facilitated
these expenditures. Others took advantage of low interest rates to issue eurobonds to finance
infrastructure investments. Governments spend most of their resources on transport and energy.
Nonetheless, the level of public finance remains insufficient to cover their infrastructure needs.
Sub-Saharan African countries need to mobilize more domestic resources to finance infrastructure
investment. Tax-to-GDP ratios are far below the EMDE average in a number of countries,
reflecting a failure to reform weak tax systems, especially in oil exporters.

The capacity of countries in the region to effectively use resources for infrastructure investment
remains a critical issue. The efficiency of public investment in Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind
other EMDEs, reflecting poor project selection, weak enforcement of procurement procedures, and
failure to complete projects (Dabla-Norris et al. 2012). These weaknesses point to a need to
increase absorptive capacity in public infrastructure in the region.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure development faces major geographic and physical challenges,
reflecting its low population density, low urbanization, and large number of landlocked countries.
A sizable number of small countries makes it difficult for firms to exploit economies of scale. As
a result, Sub-Saharan Africa’s infrastructure services are more expensive than in other regions,
suggesting that greater gains could be achieved through deeper forms of regional integration.
Four key areas of policy priorities to address investment needs and ensure sustainable financing
are the following:
      Sustaining public investments. Domestic resources— tax and nontax revenue—are likely
       to remain the dominant source of financing for infrastructure. Increasing domestic revenue
       may provide the most sustainable way of financing infrastructure investment. This will
       require improving tax collection as well as cost recovery. In many countries, debt levels
       are still manageable, and borrowing to increase spending on infrastructure remains a viable
       option. However, debt sustainability should not be compromised.
      Encouraging greater private sector participation in infrastructure. Countries need to
       strengthen the pipeline of bankable projects that can meet the financial objectives of private
       investors. Innovative fund and deal structures, such as guarantees and risk sharing, should
       be developed. Blended finance instruments that can leverage private sector development
       financing should be promoted. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are a tested strategy that
       can be applied to numerous sectors (IFC 2016). However, governments have to establish
       autonomous regulatory agencies to oversee the private agents. The terms of the
       partnerships have to be monitored carefully to ensure PPPs deliver a normal return and not
       a monopoly profit.
      Strengthening public investment management systems. An effective public financial
       management capacity is critical in scaling up infrastructure investment spending. Countries
       should seek to strengthen capacity for project selection and appraisal, and enhance
       monitoring of project execution to minimize leakages. Operation and maintenance
       expenditures for existing infrastructure should be fully integrated in a medium-term
       expenditure framework to ensure that they receive adequate budgetary resources.
      Promoting regional integration of infrastructure. A regional approach to the provision of
       infrastructure services is needed to overcome the region’s geographic and physical
       challenges. This will require effective regional institutions, setting priorities for regional
       investments, harmonizing regulatory frameworks and administrative procedures, and
       facilitating cross-border infrastructure (Kessides and Benjamin 2012).

VIII. Conclusion

This paper documents regional perspectives on the recent slowdown in investment growth in
EMDEs. It finds that the deceleration in investment growth since 2010 has been more pronounced
among BRICS and in EMDE regions with a large number of commodity exporters. It also finds
that infrastructure investment needs are sizable across EMDE regions, reflecting the challenges to
support expanding economic activity, accommodate rapid urbanization, and achieve sustainable
development goals. While public investment efforts have improved infrastructure stock and
quality, the infrastructure deficit remains significant, particularly in the energy and transport
sectors. Across EMDE regions, governments need to expand, upgrade and maintain roads, power
generation, water and sanitation systems, telecommunications infrastructure and education and
health care institutions.

Public investment can help address the investment weakness in EMDE regions. Public investment
directly boosts overall investment in the economy, and can foster private investment. Some
countries, such as the GCC countries, have the ability to ramp up public investment thanks to their
high incomes. However, many other EMDEs, including those in Europe and Central Asia and Sub-
Saharan Africa, have little fiscal space to increase public investment because of their high debt-to-
GDP ratios and the need for fiscal consolidation. External financing conditions have tightened,
with increased uncertainty in the United States and Europe, which makes tapping debt markets
increasingly difficult and risky. At the same time, in many regions, low tax revenues, weak banking
systems and underdeveloped capital markets limit the share of domestic resources that can be
allocated to public investment. In low-income countries, regulatory and implementation capacity
constraints are key obstacles to scaling-up public investment in infrastructure. Against this
backdrop, a number of policy measures could allow EMDEs to boost investment.

Improve the efficiency of public investment. A key priority for EMDEs should be to increase the
efficiency of public investment. Increasing public investment efficiency is particularly crucial for
lower-middle and low-income economies given their limited resources. The efficiency of public
investment in EMDEs in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia consistently lags behind other
EMDEs. This reflects weaknesses in their public investment management, including poor project
selection, weak enforcement of procurement procedures, and failure to complete projects.
Medium-term budget frameworks can improve spending predictability; greater transparency of
expenditures and independent spending evaluations can improve incentives to tighten efficiency;
and better coordination between various levels of government can reduce duplication and
inconsistencies. Improvements in public investment efficiency could also involve strong rules to
protect capital expenditures during periods of fiscal consolidation, and strengthening capacity in
project selection and appraisal, and monitoring of project execution.

Create more fiscal space through domestic resource mobilization and changes in the composition
of expenditures. Additional domestic tax revenues could help create space for public investment
in priority spending areas such as infrastructure. Domestic resources could be mobilized through

                                                 51
increased revenue collection, by enhancing tax administration, broadening the tax base, or raising
tax rates. Revenue-to-GDP ratios are particularly low in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Efforts to remove exemptions, tighten tax administration, and broaden tax bases could help
generate budgetary resources to finance public investment projects. Spending on public
investments could also be boosted by reallocating expenditures toward growth-enhancing
investment from expenditures that are less clearly aligned with policy priorities. Such expenditures
could be identified in periodic public expenditure reviews that assess all government expenditures
against policy priorities.

Facilitate private investment. Empirical studies show that an increase in public investment would
raise private investment, but this crowding-in effect may be temporary (World Bank 2017a). A
favorable business environment, including stable macroeconomic conditions and predictable
policies and regulations, may not be sufficient to attract private investment. Countries may need
to develop appropriate innovative fund and deal structures, such as guarantees and risk sharing,
and promote blended finance instruments that can leverage private sector development financing.
Public-private partnerships are a tested strategy that can be applied to numerous sectors. However,
governments must establish autonomous regulatory agencies to oversee the private agents.
Multilateral development institutions can help EMDEs address these issues.
