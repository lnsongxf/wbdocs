Executive Summary




There is no one definition of the smart grid concept. Instead, smart grids are
defined differently around the world to reflect local requirements and goals.
   What is clear, however, is that the grids of today will not support the energy
goals of the future. The integration of large shares of renewable energy, improve-
ments in the reliability of services, and the achievement of higher levels of energy
efficiency across the value chain will require power grids that are largely different
from those of today.


What Are Smart Grids and Why Are They Relevant to Utilities in All
Countries?
To support the policy goals of the energy sector, electricity grids require constant
updates. The so-called “smart” grid should be understood as a conceptual vision
of a grid that will enable the achievement of sector goals. Grid updates may be
routine in nature or comprehensive, but they should always be carefully planned
to align with sector goals. Planners would also do well to take note of interna-
tional experience. In many cases, operators will be able to save significant time
and money by understanding the lessons learned elsewhere around the globe.
   Necessary updates encompass grid modernization using conventional infra-
structure as well as advanced digital information and telecommunication tech-
nologies. Improvements in grid monitoring, protection, and control will enable
the delivery of electricity services in a more efficient, reliable, and sustainable
manner. The resulting smart grids are therefore key to achieving sustainability
goals in the power sector.
   Both the “soft” and “hard” components of grids need be modernized to enable
the integration of renewable energy resources, facilitate more active consumer
participation, and improve the quality of services and the resiliency of grids in
varied and challenging operational environments. The soft components relate to
operational rules and regulations that support grid operation and development.
The hard components involve the grid infrastructure itself and the introduction
of new control and communication technologies.
   The concept of the smart grid is relevant to any grid regardless of its stage of
development. What varies are the magnitude and type of the incremental steps

       toward modernization that will be required to achieve a specific smart grid
       vision. For instance, a grid that intends to integrate 40 percent of renewables will
       require different modernization steps from a grid that plans to integrate a smaller
       amount of renewables but also improve its reliability.


       What Can Utilities Do to Define Their Smart Grid Vision and Plans?
       Defining a smart grid vision that is aligned with broader power sector goals is key
       to determining which modernization steps should be taken. The current state of
       the grid, the desired vision, and available technologies—properly prioritized by
       their costs, benefits, and risks—should then be used to define the incremental
       steps needed to move forward.
          This document provides some practical guidance on how utilities can define
       their own smart grid vision, identify priorities, and structure investment plans.
       While most of these strategic aspects apply to any area of the electricity grid
       (transmission, distribution, off grid), the document focuses on the segment of
       distribution.
          The guidance includes key building blocks that are needed to modernize the
       distribution grid. One such block is the intelligent electronic device (IED) that,
       when installed in substations and feeder locations, will enable the electric distri-
       bution utility to visualize and control the electric distribution system in ways
       that were not possible with previous-generation electromechanical devices.
       Another key building block is a two-way communication network that will
       enable the electric distribution utility to monitor and control the performance of
       its electric distribution assets from its headquarters or a distribution control
       center.


       How Can Smart Grids Benefit the Distribution Sector?
       Smart grids impact electric distribution systems significantly and sometimes
       more than any other part of the electric power grid. At many electric utilities,
       the operation of the electric distribution system is being transformed from
       mostly manual, paper-driven business processes through the introduction of
       electronic, computer-assisted decision making. Advances in control and com-
       munication technology now permit the automatic or semi-automatic and remote
       operation of distribution equipment and facilities that in the past could only be
       operated manually.
          In developing countries, modernizing the distribution grid promises to benefit
       the operation of electric distribution utilities in many and various ways. These
       benefits include improved operational efficiency (reduced losses, lower energy
       consumption, and so on), reduced electrical demand during peak load periods,
       better overall service reliability, and ability to accommodate additional distrib-
       uted generating resources without adversely impacting overall power quality.
       Benefits of distribution grid modernization also include improved asset

Executive Summary	                                                                         xvii


utilization (allowing operators to “squeeze” more capacity out of existing assets)
and workforce productivity improvement. These benefits can provide more than
enough monetary gain for electric utility stakeholders in developing countries to
offset the cost of grid modernization.
   Some of these core smart grid benefits may be achieved by electric distribu-
tion utilities that have not, as yet, advanced very far in their process of grid
modernization. For example, lowering the voltage set point on an existing elec-
tromechanical voltage regulator can reduce electrical demand and improve the
overall efficiency of the distribution system.


Which Funding and Regulatory Issues Should Be Taken into
Consideration?
The amount of effort and investment needed to accomplish a high level of grid
modernization depends upon the current level of modernization, which can
range from having manual control only (no automation at all) to fully automated
control and continuous monitoring of all available distribution assets. Four levels
of grid modernization are outlined in this report. The guidance suggests how
electric utilities in developing countries can progress from their current level of
grid modernization to an advanced level, and identifies projects that may be
accomplished at each level to achieve valuable benefits such as higher efficiency,
lower demand, improved reliability, better ability to accommodate distributed
generation (including distributed renewables), and improved asset utilization
overall. The report also provides examples of grid modernization projects and
explains the potential benefits that can be achieved (in monetary terms) for a
given investment range. Importantly, a utility that is at a relatively low level of grid
modernization may “leapfrog” across one or more levels of modernization to
achieve some of the benefits offered by the highest levels of grid modernization.
   Finally, the report describes some funding and regulatory issues that may need
to be taken into account when developing smart grid plans. Traditional capital
investment plants in the power sector need be informed and complemented by
the costs and funding requirements of appropriate levels of grid modernization.
With regard to funding, the report suggests that some level of modernization
should always be part of utilities’ capital expenditure programs. Only higher
levels of modernization that use untested technologies or will radically transform
a grid’s business bottom line may require special regulatory treatment.

The Concept, Role, and Priorities
of Smart Grids




Introduction: Smart Grids and Their Function
As the energy industry embraces the concept of smart grids and the benefits they
can offer to the environment, consumers, utilities, grid operators, and other
stakeholders, it is essential that well-designed plans be developed to ensure the
successful materialization of smart grid goals and objectives.
   The smart grid is variously defined to reflect specific requirements and needs
around the globe. A number of organizations and governments have published
their own definitions (table 1.1), including characteristics and objectives. Devel-
oping a clear vision is very important in the planning process.
   Regardless of the country context or overall level of development, grid mod-
ernization promises to help electric distribution utilities achieve many categories
of benefits and solutions to core business problems. Such benefits include
improved efficiency by reducing electrical losses (technical and nontechnical)
and promoting energy conservation, reduced electrical demand during peak load
periods, improved reliability, better utilization of existing assets, and more effec-
tive integration of a high penetration of distributed generation with variable
output. With a smart grid in place, customers will be better informed and may
receive incentives to voluntarily modify their energy consumption patterns as
needed to help address the utility company’s operational problems from the
demand side.
   Some of the core benefits may be achieved by electric distribution utilities
that are just starting to modernize their grid. For example, lowering the volt-
age set point on an existing electromechanical voltage regulator can reduce
electrical demand and improve the overall efficiency of the distribution
system.
   While there is no common definition of a smart grid, there is a clear consensus
that the grids of today will not be able to meet the energy demands of the future.

                     A smart grid is an enabler of overall energy sector objectives and should not be
                  viewed in isolation. Figure 1.1 outlines the role of a smart grid within sample
                  policy and regulatory requirements. For example, an overall energy goal might be
                  to reduce fossil-fuel consumption. One way to reduce fossil-fuel consumption is
                  through the introduction of renewable energy (such as solar or wind energy) in
                  the power sector. Some renewable sources may require special policy support
                  mechanisms such as economic incentives, technology-specific auctions, feed-in
                  tariffs, or others. To ensure that these sources are reliably and efficiently inte-
                  grated, the power grid will need to be “smarter” as the share of these sources
                  grows in the grid, that is, a smart grid is needed to implement higher-level policy
                  goals. The integration of larger shares of renewables requires better grids, new
                  technologies, and regulations such as interconnection performance requirements.
                  Without these transformations the grid will be a barrier to achieving sector goals.
                     A smart grid is therefore a conceptual goal whose achievement will require
                  continuous grid modernization through the use of conventional and advanced
                  digital technologies. Better monitoring, protection, and control of the grid will in
                  turn enable the delivery of electricity services in a more efficient, reliable, and
                  sustainable manner.

   Smart grids incorporate technology that computerizes the electric utility grid
to enable digital communication among grid components. For example, in con-
ventional grids, utilities have to send workers out to read meters, measure volt-
age, and gather other types of useful data. In a smart grid, the components of the
grid—variable and thermal generators, loads, wires, substations, transformers,
even consumer appliances—have integrated sensors that carry data as well as
two-way communication capabilities between the device and the utility’s opera-
tions center. That way the utility can adjust and control each device or millions
of devices from a central location.

High-Level Description of a Smart Grid
Each individual smart grid of the future will encompass different goals, expecta-
tions, and assumptions. The grid is a very complex arrangement of infrastructure
that interacts with natural laws. Its functioning depends on a large number of
interconnected elements (monitoring, control, protection, telecommunications).
A simplified way to visualize a smart grid is to think of it having four major layers
(as illustrated in figure 1.2):

•	 “Hard” infrastructure, or all the physical components of the grid, such as the
   generation, transmission, and distribution assets that produce, transport, and
   deliver energy to consumers. This includes all generation technologies as well
   as energy storage facilities.
•	 Telecommunications, that is, all communications services that enable applica-
   tions to monitor, protect, and control the grid. This includes all forms of com-
   munication from wide area networks, field area networks, home area net-
   works, and local area networks. Technologies encompass telephony, optical
   fiber, leased lines, wireless communications, mesh radio, WiFi, and others.

    Elements of these four layers are combined to create grid features that
improve the grid’s ability to achieve certain goals, such as integrating more
renewables, improving reliability, and further reducing energy consumption
among all elements of the grid, including the consumer. Deciding which specific
application is required to achieve the smart grid vision is an important part of the
planning process.
    For example, if reliability is an issue at the distribution level, these layers
should be combined to produce better automation of the grid and to reduce fault
numbers and durations. If there is a need to implement better pricing (for
example, time of use or real time) to incentivize consumers to use energy more
efficiently or to control nonpaid energy, the grid may need better meters (smart
meters) that can track hourly consumption and can collect such data remotely
for more efficient billing. A grid that will integrate large shares of solar power at
the distribution level may need better monitoring and grid regulations to ensure
that distribution generation does not impact grid reliability negatively and that
the expected performance is achieved.
    Since there is an unlimited number of potential applications that combine
features of these four layers of the grid to improve performance, it is very impor-
tant that priorities are defined. A smart grid vision, which will further develop
into specific applications and investments, needs to follow from clearly defined
energy sector goals.
    A popular industry approach to developing smart grid plans involves the
development of road (route) maps that (i) facilitate understanding and coopera-
tion among the many stakeholders in the smart grid arena; (ii) identify the vision
for a particular smart grid as well as the pillars to support this vision; (iii) estab-
lish milestones with actionable policy, regulatory, and technology elements; and
(iv) define metrics to measure success. This chapter will describe some elements
that can be used in general (for any sector, such as transmission and distribution)
to define such priorities and meet specific grid challenges.


Examples of Electric Utilities’ Smart Grid Road Maps
Utilities structure their vision of a smart grid around specific challenges. An
international survey carried out in 2010 (figure 1.3) shows that drivers for coun-
tries with more developed power grids (including policy and regulation)—such
as Canada and the countries of Europe and Oceania—place higher emphasis on
the integration of renewable energy, demand response management, environ-
mental concerns, and enabling consumer participation and choices. Most other
countries focus on the basics of improving reliability, restoring power, improving
revenue collection, and reducing losses. Some drivers were equally important for
all the countries, independent of their power sector development stage, such as
reducing operating and maintenance costs and improving power quality. It is
likely, therefore, that the smart grid vision for each of these countries should be
different.

   The following subsections summarize the main pillars of the smart grid visions
in several utilities in select countries. Appendix B describes road maps from
other countries and utilities in more detail.

China State Transmission Grid
The State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) is the power transmission entity
serving the electricity sector throughout most of China, and has focused its smart
grid vision on the development of a “strong and smart” grid based on an ultrahigh
voltage (UHV) grid backbone to optimize energy resources allocation, improve
clean energy access, and meet power demand growth. The SGCC-proposed
UHV grid backbone is coordinating the development of subordinate grids at all
levels; each is based on information technology (IT), automated, and
interactive.
   Figure 1.4 shows the strategic road map proposed by the SGCC. This com-
prises the definition of a goal, guidelines for the technology and management of
assets, development phases (pilot, rollout, assessment, and improvement), sys-
tems, features (characteristics), and domains of action.

The Toronto Hydro-Electric System Ltd. (THESL) approach to smart grid
development and long-term plans is depicted in figure 1.5. It is a 25-year road

                                        map that is expected to be completed in three phases. The vision includes three
                                        targets: energy security, increased customer satisfaction, and climate protection.
                                        The pillars include fully electrified transportation, the creation of microgrids, and
                                        the adding of distributed power, among others.

                                        Colombia Electricity Sector
                                        The Colombian approach to smart grid development and long-term plans is
                                        depicted in figure 1.6. The vision includes clearly defined goals such as increased
                                        security, efficiency, reliability, profitability, and environmental quality. The
                                        baseline, challenges, and actions to be taken (pillars) have been identified.
                                           The focus areas in transmission include increased cooperation with neighbor-
                                        ing countries, the use of phasor measurement units (PMUs) to improve system
                                        monitoring, and overall reliability. On the consumer side, demand-side manage-
                                        ment and home area networks are included as potential areas of action. On the
                                        “soft” side, the plan identifies needs to improve some regulations and work on
                                        human resources development.
                                           The common elements of these road maps include a clear vision of the objec-
                                        tives being pursued and the areas or pillars of action, and a description of some
                                        of the specific actions that will be pursued to modernize the grid. Some road
                                        maps include pillars of action for other institutions, or the enabling regulatory
                                        aspects that need to be developed to pursue some of the actions.

   The following sections provide some guidance on the process of structuring a
road map (and investment plan) for smart grids in the distribution sector. Under-

      utilities, countries, or regions embarking on smart grid programs. Once a smart
      grid road map is prepared and approved by stakeholders, it will form the founda-
      tion for all future smart grid activities. It should be complemented by detailed
      implementation plans to realize the ultimate smart grid vision.
          With the global focus on strategies to develop smarter energy grids, many enti-
      ties at the national, regional, and local levels are developing plans to capitalize on
      the benefits that a smarter grid can provide to its stakeholders.
          A key element of the successful deployment of a technology initiative, such
      as a smart grid, is the development of a strategic road map. A road map (i) brings
      to focus the interest of stakeholders into a succinct plan, (ii) sets a vision,
      (iii) identifies technology needs, (iv) supports better investment decisions, and
      (v) provides a timeline for achieving goals.
          The development of a road map—also known as road mapping—is an evolution-
      ary process. Road maps must be reviewed and updated regularly to meet changes
      in requirements, reflect advancements in technology, correlate with workforce
      development, reflect time constraints, and harmonize with budgetary constraints.
          There are many stakeholders in the energy industry, each with special perspec-
      tives on the industry and its services. These stakeholders may include governmen-
      tal bodies; regulatory entities; utilities for generation, transmission, and distribu-
      tion of electricity; independent power producers; merchant transmission compa-
      nies; industrial complexes; residential, industrial, and commercial consumers;
      technology firms; research organizations; academia; and others. It is important to
      leverage the knowledge of all stakeholders to develop an all-encompassing and
      holistic plan.
          A review of available literature and the road maps developed by several utili-
      ties reveals there are several key steps involved in preparing a smart grid road
      map. Appendix A contains an overview of various road mapping methodologies

that have been proposed by organizations such as the International Energy
Agency (IEA), the U.S. Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the U.S.
Sandia National Laboratories (SNL).
   It is important to mention that smart grid road maps may have various scopes.
For example, a road map could be for an entire vertically integrated utility, a
transmission company, or a broader country plan where other industrial policy
objectives are involved.

a road map.

1.	 Vision statement. The long-term vision for smart grids is established based on
    energy sector goals. Key roles and responsibilities of actors are defined.
2.	 Definition of a timeline. The timeline for achieving the smart grid vision is
    established—it may be incremental and in phases. Each phase has clear objec-
    tives and goals.
3.	 Pillars of action. Based on the vision of the road map, the key pillars of action
    are established. The current baseline is reviewed to leverage achievements
    and current assets to estimate the additional effort needed. Risks, costs, and
    potential barriers are analyzed.
4.	 Technology and functional applications. Policies, regulations, and technology for
    each time period and each pillar are suggested. The challenges associated with
    smart grid implementation are also addressed.
5.	 Metrics and monitoring. Performance metrics are developed to measure the
    success of smart grid implementation.

Step 1: The Smart Grid Vision Statement and the Importance of Governance
A vision statement is a succinct articulation of the goals and objectives of a smart
grid for the nation or the entity engaged in smart grid implementation. The vision
is established by reviewing overall long-term objectives at a national, regional,
local, or company level. Examples of broad government objectives for the power
sector may include the following:

•	 Active participation by consumers
•	 25 percent of renewable generation by 2020

12	                                                        The Concept, Role, and Priorities of Smart Grids


      •	   20 percent reduction in carbon footprint
      •	   20 percent energy-efficiency gains among all classes of consumers
      •	   Development of new products, services, and markets (workforce development)
      •	   Improved financial health of utilities
      •	   Increased reliability and efficiency of electricity transmission and distribution.

         This vision will form the basis and foundation for all smart grid pillars and
      activities.
         Deploying smart grids at the utilitywide level or in specific segments of the
      sector will require proper coordination of actors. Some form of governance
      should be established to structure the vision and the rest of the components in a
      road map. Establishing a steering committee and technical groups is common
      while developing a road map.

      Step 2: Establishing a Timeline
      The smart grid is a concept that should be implemented in phases to allow for
      refinement and to ensure that the modernization activities with the highest ben-
      efits are implemented first. Different phases can be identified, and ideally will
      follow the general timelines set for overall sector or company goals. Actions that
      can immediately render benefits should be included in the short-term; medium-,
      and long-term projects include smart grid applications that require feedback
      from previous phases or actions supporting long-term goals. Not all actions
      should be performed at the same time, and not all grids require the same level
      of modernization.

      Step 3: Pillars of Action
      A smart grid enables the achievement of a stated vision and objectives. It is con-
      venient to define a pillar that supports each of the vision elements. These pillars
      will help identify the potential actions to improve the grid. Figure 1.8 provides
      an example of how each vision objective may be transformed into a pillar. This
      includes, for example, the objective of managing a certain percentage of renew-
      ables; as a pillar, this will support energy efficiency goals. In developing coun-
      tries, where demand continues to grow and reliability continues to lag behind,
      the smart grid vision will most likely include improving grid reliability. As such,
      a pillar of the smart grid plan should include all the actions that can help improve
      reliability.

      Step 4: Technologies and Functional Applications
      Deciding which technologies or functions will be deployed in each pillar requires
      assessing which of these applications—or their combination—have the best
      chances of achieving a given goal. This is perhaps the most complex step in
      defining the priorities of a road map. This step requires knowing the state of the
      grid, identifying the gaps and potential technologies to improve its performance,
      analyzing if such applications are cost-effective, making sure risks are identified,

and highlighting potential barriers (for example, regulatory) to effective imple-
mentation. Not all applications need to be advanced in nature; some applica-
tions, already commercially viable and tested in other places, may not need any
special regulatory treatment.
   Some approaches to identifying applications in each pillar are as follows:

1.	 Gap analysis. Using future goals, the smart grid vision, and the pillars, a gap
    analysis is conducted to identify the missing or incomplete components
    between the current baseline and future targets. For example, if a future goal
    calls for reducing the duration of outages in a year, it becomes necessary to
    identify the actions that are needed to achieve this (for example, automatic
    reclosing, and tree trimming). Another example may include the necessary
    actions to mitigate the complexities of the significant penetration of distrib-
    uted generation.
2.	 Cost-benefit analysis. This analysis will help identify a high-level estimated cost
    of the actions necessary to mitigate the gaps identified in the gap analysis. What
    costs are associated with the various pillars—for example, improving the finan-
    cial health of a utility? Do the benefits of an application outweigh its costs?

      3.	 Risk analysis. This analysis helps identify the risks associated with taking or
          not taking a particular action. For example, does infrastructure require an
          upgrade to meet technology needs, or are there any capacity-building or
          training needs to deploy a given technology?
      4.	 Highlighting barriers. This analysis identifies the barriers that must be over-
          come. These may relate to policy, regulations, technology, human resources,
          finances, and so on.

      Step 5: Metrics and Monitoring
      If the smart grid is to meet sector objectives, it is important to monitor perfor-
      mance metrics. Examples of such metrics include reliability improvements and
      reduced outage periods (improved System Average Interruption Duration Index

      to deploy such procedures in the distribution segment. An important step is

The Evolution of Electric
Distribution Systems




The Smart Grid in the Distribution Segment
Grid modernization (to achieve the so-called smart grid) impacts electric distri-
bution systems more than any other part of the electric power grid. At many
electric utilities, the operation of the electric distribution system is being trans-
formed from mostly manual, paper-driven business processes through the intro-
duction of electronic, computer-assisted decision making. Advances in control
and communication technology now permit the automatic or semi-automatic
and remote operation of distribution equipment and facilities that in the past
could only be operated manually.
   Electric distribution utilities have always focused on maintaining “acceptable”
conditions out on the distribution feeders. Goals included the following:

•	 Maintain safe conditions for the electric utility workforce and the general
   public.
•	 Minimize electrical losses on the electric distribution system. This is an espe-
   cially important objective for electric distribution utilities in developing
   countries that experience high levels of electrical losses, including both tech-
   nical (I2R) losses and nontechnical losses (energy theft and unmetered loads).
•	 Protect the electric distribution assets from potentially damaging short circuit
   currents and voltage surges and sags.
•	 Maintain voltage within established limits (typically nominal voltage, plus or
   minus 5 percent) for all customers at all times under all loading conditions.
•	 Ensure that the loading of all electrical equipment is well within the estab-
   lished thermal ratings of the individual devices (often device loading has been
   limited to half of what the device is physically able to carry).
•	 Ensure reliability of the service—that is, limit interruptions and their
   severity.

         All of the above goals continue to be fundamental and essential operating
      requirements. But today’s electric distribution utilities are seeking to make dis-
      tribution system operation even more efficient and reliable—and improve asset
      utilization—without compromising safety and the protection of distribution
      assets. Utility companies are also seeking to accommodate new distributed gen-
      erators that are powered by clean and renewable energy resources (wind power,
      solar power, and so on), and to empower end-use customers to make informed
      decisions about their energy usage.


      The Traditional Distribution System and the System of the Future
      The electric distribution system has undergone significant changes over the
      years. This chapter identifies the changes that have occurred in terms of the level
      of staffed operation; operating objectives; monitoring and control capabilities;
      and protection, automation, control, and back-office commercial and technical
      management systems. The next sections describe the ways distribution systems
      have changed on a decade-by-decade basis. Not all electric utilities have moved
      forward with these grid modernization efforts at the same pace, however. While
      many utility companies have moved forward over the decades in the ways
      described in the following sections (see figure 2.2), some electric utilities con-
      tinue to rely on mostly manual paper-driven processes, and have yet to deploy
      the intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and communication facilities needed for
      grid modernization (see figure 2.1). As a result, the short-term vision and strate-
      gic road map for grid modernization will differ for each utility.
         The progression of electric utility distribution grid modernization over the
      years is outlined in the following sections. Key aspects of electric utility opera-
      tions are identified during each time period—for purposes of comparison—in the

following categories: overall level of automation, distribution protection and
control, power-generating sources, level of centralized management and control,
and the end-use customer. Table 2.1 summarizes the progression of key ele-
ments of distribution grid modernization over the years.


Before the 1980s
Before the 1980s, most electric utilities had very little or no automation and
remote monitoring and control on their electric distribution system. Distribution
protection, control, and metering (including end-use customer revenue meter-
ing) were handled by electromechanical devices. Figure 2.3 shows electrome-
chanical devices that are typical of this era. These electromechanical devices
performed their basic functions well but did not support automation, remote
monitoring, and remote control. As a result, electric utilities were required to
travel to the device location to retrieve information and perform maintenance
and diagnostic activities. To reduce travel costs, many electric distribution sub-
stations were permanently staffed during this period to prepare log sheets, con-
duct routine inspections, and respond as quickly as possible to distribution
outages.

   Most electric power was supplied by large-scale central generators connected
to the transmission grid. No significant generating sources were connected to the
distribution system during this period.


The 1980s and Early 1990s
During the 1980s and early 1990s, many electric utilities made significant efforts
to reduce their dependence on field personnel for performing routine monitoring
and control actions. Most, if not all, personnel were removed from distribution
substations during this period. The implementation of some microprocessor-
based IEDs, automatic data loggers, and supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) facilities at electric distribution substations eliminated many of the
manual tasks performed in the past by dedicated substation operators. Figure 2.4
shows a representative substation SCADA system of the early 1990s. Most utili-
ties also added reclosing relays to their distribution protection systems to auto-
matically restore power quickly following temporary (self-clearing) short cir-
cuits. Remote monitoring and control during this era was still limited to the
distribution substations at most utilities.
   During this period, little or no remote monitoring was provided for monitor-
ing and controlling devices located out on the feeders themselves (outside the
substation fence). But some utilities began deploying loop control schemes (a
simple form of fault location isolation and service restoration, FLISR) on some
feeders. Figure 2.5 illustrates the operation of a 1990s version of a simple loop
control scheme.
   Most electric power was still supplied by large-scale central generators con-
nected to the transmission grid. But a growing number of cogeneration facilities
were installed by industrial customers on their premises to serve their own load,
and sell and deliver excess power to the electric distribution utility.

                      Some commercial and industrial (C&I) customers had communicating reve-
                   nue meters that were being read via telephone circuits. This allowed the C&I
                   meters to be read more than once per month, thus enabling time-of-use (TOU)
                   rates. Residential meters were still being read manually during this period.


                   The Mid- to Late 1990s and Early 2000s
                   During this period, the use of digital IEDs gained widespread acceptance for the
                   protection, metering, and control of electric utilities due to the IED’s improved
                   functionality and flexibility, smaller packaging, and remote monitoring and diag-
                   nostic capabilities. While the majority of installed devices were still electrome-
                   chanical, most utilities had decided to gradually phase out electromechanical
                   devices by installing digital IEDs in all new substations and replacing failed
                   electromechanical devices with IEDs. Substation SCADA systems that used
                   these IEDs as data sources had become the standard approach in distribution
                   substations.
                      The level of remote monitoring and control of the distribution feeders them-
                   selves (outside the substation fence) also increased during this period. A consid-
                   erable number of utilities deployed distribution SCADA-based FLISR and volt/
                   VAR control systems to improve reliability, reduce electrical losses, and improve
                   the overall performance of a small number of their worst-performing feeders.

Figure 2.6 shows a typical distribution SCADA-based volt/VAR control system
from this era. While the remote monitoring, control, and automation of feeder
devices was not widespread, the feasibility of using grid modernization to
improve the overall performance and visibility of the electric distribution system
was demonstrated during this period.
   While most power was still being supplied from large central generators, a
growing number of distributed generators were appearing on the distribution
system. At this time, most of these units were fossil-fuel fired (diesel, natural gas,
and so on), but some generators were powered by renewable generating resources

      (wind, solar, bio-fuels, and so on). The level of deployment of distributed genera-
      tion (DG) out on the distribution feeder generally remained small compared to
      the total load. But in some cases, the power inputs from distributed generators
      were starting to become significant enough to impact operations, including some
      high-voltage and protection problems caused by the reverse power flow.
         During this period, there were a number of advances in residential customer
      metering. Some distribution utilities began installing automatic meter reading
      (AMR) systems with one-way communications (including “drive-by” systems).
      AMR provided the opportunity to read meters more frequently and at a lower
      cost, and to implement new functions such as prepayment meters. Load man-
      agement systems were installed at this time for peak saving purposes to reduce
      the need for additional generation and transmission facilities.


      The Mid-2000s to the Present (the “Smart Grid Era”)
      Electric distribution utilities are experiencing many significant changes during
      the current period, referred to in this report as the smart grid era. One of the
      most significant changes is the level of deployment of distributed energy resourc-
      es (DERs), especially those powered by renewable resources (wind and solar
      power). High penetrations of wind and solar-powered generation on the electric
      distribution system are especially challenging due to the highly variable output
      from this type of generator. Sudden drop-off of solar power due to passing clouds
      and of wind power due to lower winds will result in a significant increase in
      power drawn from the electric utility substation and a resulting voltage reduc-
      tion that must be countered by voltage regulator and capacitor bank operations.
      The sudden return of wind and solar power generators may produce high-voltage
      conditions that must be similarly countered. The potential for reverse power
      flow caused by a high penetration of DERs on the distribution feeder also poses
      significant challenges to existing voltage-regulating mechanisms.
         In addition to providing a mechanism for mitigating the adverse consequences
      of variable distributed generation, grid modernization will enable electric distri-
      bution utilities to actively control customer-owned DG units to improve the
      efficiency, reliability, and overall performance of the electric distribution system.
      DG units equipped with “smart” AC inverters play a role in managing the volt-
      age profile along the feeder as well as supplying reactive power to improve the
      power factor and reduce electrical losses. In addition, DG units coupled with
      energy storage and advanced control systems will enable electric distribution
      utilities to establish islanded microgrids that can continue to serve customers in
      the local community even when the microgrid becomes separated from the main
      grid and/or a widespread power outage occurs.
         The need to deal with increasing penetration of DERs, coupled with the need
      to reduce electrical losses and improve overall efficiency, has resulted in the
      growth of advanced distribution model-driven volt/VAR optimization (VVO)
      systems. Many utilities have implemented or are currently demonstrating

ization strategy. Figure 2.7 shows a representative advanced VVO system.
   Feeder automation schemes for reliability improvement, such as advanced
FLISR, are also becoming more prevalent during the smart grid era.
   Many utilities are also considering implementing a distribution management
system (DMS) to assist in decision making and managing the increasingly com-
plex distribution system. DMS-based applications are potentially more flexible
and effective than the traditional “rule-based” systems that had previously been
implemented. Figure 2.8 illustrates the major DMS components.
   Many utilities are now deploying two-way advanced metering infrastructure
(AMI) systems to support a wide variety of revenue-related applications (includ-
ing energy theft detection) and to furnish a wealth of new, near-real-time infor-
mation about customer behavior and distribution system electrical conditions.
AMI systems have allowed the creation of demand-side management (DSM)
programs such as demand response, which is becoming an essential system for
peak-load management.

          The addition of AMI and many new intelligent sensors in the field (in substa-
      tions and out on the feeders themselves), along with high bandwidth communi-
      cation facilities for integrating these devices, has enabled electric distribution
      utilities to acquire a wealth of new information about the performance of their
      assets. The deployment of PMUs at the distribution will greatly add to the huge
      volume of information being collected. In addition to the real-time and near-real
      time information that is being collected, there is a wealth of new “geospatial”
      information that is being stored in the electric utility’s geographic information
      system (GIS). The result is the collection of data sets so large and complex that
      it becomes difficult to process this information using available database manage-
      ment tools or traditional data processing applications.
          As a result of this massive data-processing problem, many electric distribution
      utilities are turning to data analytics for managing and analyzing large and com-
      plex data sets. Data analytics involve the application of computer technologies
      and statistical models to enable electric utilities to make more effective decisions
      by transforming data into actionable intelligence.
          Another element of the smart grid era is the growth of electric vehicles, which
      pose a significant new type of “mobile” load on the distribution system and also
      provide opportunities for distribution system management (vehicle-to-grid capa-
      bilities, vehicle-to-home capabilities, and so on).

Technology Innovations
in Distribution Grids




This chapter covers major technological innovations (relevant to the distribution
system) in the following areas: protections; automation for reliability and service
improvement; control and optimization (losses/reactive power); distributed gen-
eration interconnection, including protections and interfacing issues; and inte-
grated supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or more advanced
back-office energy management systems (EMSs). These innovations are some of
the building blocks needed to establish a smart grid. While the list is not com-
plete it reflects some of the most important applications being pursued by vari-
ous utilities.
   The next section provides an overview of the advanced control systems and
decision support systems being deployed on the electric distribution system.


Distribution System Monitoring and Control
Advanced distribution applications, such as volt/VAR optimization (VVO) and
fault location isolation and service restoration (FLISR), require near-real-time
data from distribution substations. Required measurements include voltage and
current, real and reactive power flows, and equipment status indications. Protec-
tive relay and controller intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) can supply the
necessary information via substation monitoring and control networks. Figure 3.1
depicts the vision for sources of information on the modern distribution system.
Great progress has been made in recent years in migrating from traditional elec-
tromechanical devices to substation IEDs, but many utilities have a long way to
go to complete this transition. Progress on smart distribution objectives may be
slowed until utilities upgrade their substation monitoring and control facilities.
   Smart distribution also includes numerous measurement and indication
devices installed at strategic locations out on the distribution feeders. Distribu-
tion sensors include faulted circuit indicators (FCIs) that detect faults and in
some cases provide fault direction as well as general-purpose sensors that record

      and support analytical needs. Distribution sensors include stand-alone devices
      and sensors that are imbedded in switches and other power apparatus.


      Distribution Management Systems
      The “smart” electric distribution system requires management by a system that
      has a broader, more holistic view of power system conditions: the distribution
      management system (DMS).
         The “heart and soul” of the distribution system of the future is a DMS that
      integrates monitoring (“sensorization”), grid analytics, and control applications
      into an effective decision support system that will enable distribution dispatchers
      to effectively manage a distribution system of growing complexity during normal
      and emergency conditions. Figure 3.2 is a diagram of the conceptual DMS
      architecture.
         Electric distribution utilities have found that mostly manual, paper-driven pro-
      cesses are not able to address these new operating requirements and challenges.
      Figure 3.3 (panels a and b) contain photographs that illustrate the transition from
      a paper-driven control center to a modern control center with computer-driven
      video displays. The distribution system of the future must include computer-
      assisted decision dispatcher support capabilities. These capabilities will improve
      the operating efficiency with semi-automated and fully automated controls that
      are able to respond rapidly to varying system requirements. These facilities are
      essential during unplanned events in which the management of many resources is
      beyond the capability of manual business processes. The transition from tradi-
      tional manual paper-driven processes to computer-assisted decision support and
      closed loop control systems is at the core of grid modernization.

28	                                                                Technology Innovations in Distribution Grids


         Another reason for the added complexity of today’s distribution system is the
      greatly increased emphasis on improving (“optimizing”) efficiency, reliability, and
      asset utilization. Today’s electric distribution utilities are seeking to reduce green-
      house gas (GHG) emissions through lowering electrical losses and promoting
      energy conservation, demand reduction, and managed charging of electric vehicles.
      Utilities are also seeking to “squeeze” more capacity out of existing distribution
      system assets through increased loading to minimize future capital expenditures.


      Distribution Protection Systems
      Like all elements of the electric power grid, the electric distribution system must
      be protected to minimize the damage that may be caused by high magnitude
      current flows that may occur following a short circuit on any energized compo-
      nent of the electric distribution system. An electric distribution protection sys-
      tem typically includes protective relays, reclosers, and fuses. These devices must
      be time coordinated so that protective devices located farthest from the substa-
      tion operate faster than protective devices that are located closer to the substa-
      tion. Over the years, distribution protection systems have undergone significant
      changes in the technology used and the functions performed.
         Traditional protection systems have relied primarily on electromechanical
      devices, such as the electromechanical protective relay shown in figure 3.4a.
      Electromechanical protective relays relied on the movement of mechanical com-
      ponents (spinning disk, electrical solenoid, and so on) to close and open physical
      electrical contacts that connect to the circuit breaker control circuit.
         Electromechanical protective relays have served the industry well for many
      years. But many electric distribution utilities are gradually replacing electrome-
      chanical devices with microprocessor-based IEDs (see figure 3.4b) that per-
      form protective functions along with other functions that are key to distribu-
      tion grid modernization.

  The new grid modernization functionality made possible with distribution
IEDs includes the following:

•	 Distribution sensor and communication capabilities. Protective relay IEDs store
   real-time values of current flow, voltage, and other electrical parameters need-
   ed to perform basic protective functions. These quantities can be telemetered
   to control systems and system operators for improved visualization and
   advanced application functions. As such, the protective relays and other IEDs
   that are installed on the distribution system are considered a basic enabling
   function for grid modernization.
•	 Adaptive protection functions. The modern distribution grid may experience
   many changes that impact the protection system requirements. In some cases,
   the protective relay settings or controller settings may need to be altered to
   reflect changing system conditions. For example, feeder reconfiguration may
   require new relay settings to provide complete protection of the feeder. The
   varying conditions associated with high penetrations of DERs may also dic-
   tate the need for dynamic or adaptive relay setting changes. IEDs also help
   these setting changes to be made via remote control with no intervention by
   field crews.

   The transition from electromechanical protection and control devices to IEDs
is one of the major steps in the transition to grid modernization.


Volt/VAR Optimization
Volt/VAR control is a fundamental operating requirement for all electric distri-
bution utilities, but this topic has taken on a whole new dimension. Volt/VAR
“control” has become volt/VAR optimization (VVO), which can help electric
utilities improve efficiency, reduce demand, and promote energy conservation.
   VVO can play a major role in reducing the “technical” electrical losses that
occur on the electric power delivery system. Technical losses primarily consist of
electric power that is consumed by the power delivery facilities themselves (con-
ductors, transformers, and so on) in the form of heat. This is energy that must
be produced by central and distributed generators, but does not perform any
useful work for the end-user or result in any revenue for the electric distribution
utility. Many electric utilities in developing countries experience a high level of
technical losses, so rescuing these losses is often a key business objective for these
utilities. VVO can reduce electrical losses by switching capacitor banks on or off
to compensate for reactive power drawn by the distribution feeders. Switching
in a capacitor bank reduces the amount of reactive power that would otherwise
be supplied by the central generators via the transmission system. This reduces
the current flow on both the transmission and distribution systems and, as a
result, reduces the nontechnical losses given by the formula I2R. Figure 3.5 illus-
trates how switched capacitor banks can help reduce the current flow and the
associated heating losses on an electric distribution system. As an example,

                                    improving the power factor from an average of 0.80 to near unity would reduce
                                    nontechnical losses by approximately 36 percent.
                                       Many utilities are considering conservation voltage reduction (CVR), which is
                                    the intentional lowering of voltage to the lower portion of the acceptable range
                                    of service-delivery voltage. Experience has shown that many appliances use less
                                    electricity with slightly reduced voltage. Figure 3.6 shows the impact of voltage
                                    reduction on various types of lighting and electric motors. As seen in the figure,
                                    the electric power consumed by an incandescent light bulb is reduced by 1.505
                                    percent for every 1 percent of voltage reduction. Energy consumed by a typical
                                    electric motor can be reduced by. 778 percent via a 1 percent voltage reduction.

Electric utilities have used voltage reduction for many years during temporary
power shortages, such as loss of a major generating facility during a heavy load
period. Distribution utilities are now considering activating CVR in nonemer-
gency situations to reduce demand during peak-load periods, and some utilities
are considering running at reduced voltage around the clock to improve overall
energy efficiency. Typically, electric utilities have been able to achieve between
2 percent and 3 percent energy reduction by deploying conservation voltage
reduction on their distribution system. Figure 3.7 shows the use of voltage reduc-
tion for peak shaving at one electric distribution utility.

         Numerous utilities have demonstrated that CVR is a very effective energy
      efficiency tool that does not adversely affect electricity consumers. But the indus-
      try has learned that voltage reduction does not produce the same benefits on all
      circuits. Some feeders show significant efficiency improvement when voltage is
      reduced, while others exhibit a less prominent effect due to differences in load
      mix and circuit characteristics. Leading research institutions such as the Electric
      Power Research Institute (EPRI), Pacific Northwest National Labs (PNNL), and
      National Electric Energy Testing Research and Applications Center (NEETRAC)
      are developing ways to predict CVR behavior so that utilities can prioritize their
      VVO investments.

      “self-healing” grid. There have been numerous developments in the areas of fault
      anticipation (detection of equipment problems before faults occur) and fault
      location. When actual faults occur, electric utilities are able to identify fault loca-
      tion with much improved precision using information from substation protective
      relay IEDs, FCIs, outage management systems, and short circuit models. These
      new fault-locating facilities will enable utilities to locate permanent faults as well
      as recurring temporary faults that have not yet caused an extended outage.
         Many utilities are implementing systems that automatically detect faults, isolate
      the damaged portion of the feeder, and restore as much service as possible within
      seconds as part of their strategy to achieve a “self-healing” grid. Figure 3.8 illustrates
      the “self-healing” actions by comparing grid status before and after an event. One
      problem with current FLISR systems is that service restoration is often blocked
      due to heavy loading on backup feeders. The next generation of automatic restora-
      tion systems should take advantage of other advanced control facilities that are
      being deployed as part of the smart grid. For example, when encountering a load
      transfer limit, the automatic restoration system may initiate actions to free up
      capacity on the affected feeders, thus enabling the load transfer to proceed. Capac-
      ity release strategies may include initiation of demand response actions, activation
      of CVR, and temporary reduction of fast charging activities for electric vehicles.

Outage Management Systems
One of the key systems in the modern control center is the outage management
system (OMS), which assists the electric distribution system operator in detect-
ing feeder outages, determining the approximate location of the root cause of the
outage, dispatching field crews, estimating the expected restoration time, tracking
damage assessment and restoration activities, and developing outage statistics
(System Average Interruption Duration Index, System Average Interruption Fre-
quency Index, and so on). Traditionally, an electric utility response is triggered by
the receipt of telephone calls from customers whose electric power is off. The
modern OMS will also accept inputs from advanced customer meters that are
capable of detecting and reporting local power outages and from distribution
SCADA facilities. Upon receipt of such outage indications, the OMS will use the
“as-operated” model of the distribution system to group-related pieces of outage
information and predict the approximate location of the expected fault. This
information is sent to field crews (first responders) to begin the outage restora-
tion process.


Management of Distributed Energy Resources
Increasing penetration of customer-owned generation sources, especially highly
variable “renewables” (such as wind and solar power), have added a high degree
of uncertainty (unpredictability) to the day-to-day, hour-to-hour operation of the
distribution system. These distributed generating resources can dramatically alter
the flow of power and the voltage profile along the feeder in a manner that is
sometimes difficult to predict. Changes to existing protection systems and volt-
age regulation facilities are needed to ensure that such power fluctuations do not
result in unacceptable service levels for distribution customers or cause a poten-
tial safety hazard for field crews.
   The complexity of integrating solar electric and wind power into the electric
distribution system is primarily due to the variable nature of these generating
sources. The output of these renewable generating sources rises and falls with
passing clouds and changes in wind speed. When clouds block the sunlight, the
output of solar photovoltaic (PV) units is reduced, and more power must instan-
taneously be drawn from the electric utility substation to make up for the lost
solar generation. This additional power drawn from the substation results in an
additional voltage drop along the feeder, and customers will momentarily experi-
ence lower voltage. After a short (intentional) delay, conventional voltage regula-
tors and load tap changers at the substation will operate to restore normal voltage
on the feeder. When bright sunlight returns, the process is reversed and custom-
ers momentarily experience higher than normal voltage until voltage regulators
and load tap changers make the necessary voltage adjustments. With high pene-
tration of renewables, the voltage variations will cause “flickering lights” and will
also impose significant wear and tear on expensive voltage-regulating equipment.
Figure 3.9 illustrates the types of voltage fluctuations that can be experienced on

      the distribution feeders during power output fluctuations from a large concentra-
      tion of solar PV units and resulting voltage corrective actions by voltage regula-
      tors. Large voltage drops (as shown in the figure) occur when cloud cover causes
      a large drop-off of solar PV output, and voltage increases occur when solar PV
      output is restored or corrective actions by voltage regulators occur.
          To minimize the magnitude of the voltage variations, electric distribution
      utilities have limited the total amount of renewable generating sources that can
      be connected to a given feeder. This is at best a temporary solution to the prob-
      lem. To accommodate greater amounts of renewable generation, the distribution
      system of the future must include new fast-acting (high-speed) controls that can
      mitigate load and voltage fluctuations without tight constraints on the amount
      of generation that may be connected to the distribution system. Figure 3.10
      shows voltage fluctuation over time with and without high penetrations of solar
      PV existing on the feeder. The figure also shows how voltage fluctuations can be
      reduced by deploying fast-acting controls to counteract these voltage
      fluctuations.
          The electric utility industry is currently demonstrating advanced control capabili-
      ties, such as using alternating current on each renewable generator, to mitigate the
      consequences of load and voltage fluctuations. For example, the next generation of
      smart AC inverters can include a volt/VAR operating characteristic similar to that
      shown in figure 3.11. When sudden changes in renewable power output occur, the
      smart AC inverter can detect this situation and rapidly inject reactive power (VAR)

to compensate for the loss of real power output. This will mitigate the voltage
swings and reduce the operating duty on conventional voltage-regulating devices.
While such control actions by smart AC inverters will be instantaneous and autono-
mous, the specific control actions that are needed at any given time may vary with
current power grid conditions and feeder configuration.

      Demand Response
      Demand response (DR) involves a reduction in the consumption of electric
      energy by customers from their expected consumption in response to an
      increase in the price of electric energy or to incentive payments designed to
      induce lower consumption of electric energy. DR refers to the ability of cus-
      tomers to respond to either a reliability trigger or a price trigger from their
      utility system operator, load-serving entity, regional transmission organization/
      independent system operator (RTO/ISO), or other DR provider by lowering
      their power consumption.
         Electric utilities in many countries are considering DR as an effective alterna-
      tive to adding new generation and power delivery facilities. That is, utilities are
      seeking to reduce the demand during peak-load periods rather than build new
      generators and power delivery facilities to meet rising loads. DR requires effec-
      tive mechanisms to initiate DR control actions when needed and verify that the
      requested DR activities have been performed.
         Some DR programs signal the customer via a text message, e-mail, or in-home
      display (IHD) that demand reduction is needed, and leave it to the customer to
      voluntarily reduce consumption in return for a pricing incentive. In such cases,
      an effective mechanism is needed to determine that the customer did indeed
      reduce consumption in response to the signal. Other DR systems directly control
      end-use appliances via direct on-off controls, programmable thermostats, and
      other devices to achieve the desired demand reduction. Figure 3.12 is a concep-
      tual diagram of a typical DR system.


      Data Analytics for Managing “Big Data”
      The addition of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and many new intelli-
      gent sensors has enabled electric distribution utilities to acquire a wealth of new
      information about the performance of its assets. To make such information use-
      ful, modern database management and mining tools will be required. As noted
      in chapter 2, data analytics is the application of computer technologies and sta-
      tistical models to enable electric utilities to make more effective decisions by
      transforming (often large and complex) data into actionable intelligence.
          Data analytics software is generally able to extract considerable value from
      advanced metering data in the following areas:

      •	   Revenue protection: Theft detection and case support
      •	   Meter operations: Defective meter identification and historical repository
      •	   Care center: High bill inquiries
      •	   Billing: Estimation support
      •	   Distribution operations and planning: Transformer load management, overload
           protection and device sizing, improved system planning, and project
           prioritization

    Interval load data from advanced meters can be aggregated to provide a granu-
 lar view of loading conditions at any point along a feeder. Load data can be
 analyzed to target customers for demand response to reduce peak loading on
 distribution transformers. Data analytics can be used to target customers for
 programs based on individual load characteristics and housing data (for example,
 peak day kWh/square foot). Data analytics can also be used to measure program
 impacts and calculate incentives for performance-based programs (for example,
 DR). AMI/automatic meter reading (AMR) data results can also be used to sup-
 port regulatory evaluation and cost-recovery.

      lytics can also be used to validate real system outages (indicated by protective
      relay information and significant changes in consumption) versus false meter
      outages. Outage data analytics can also be used to screen for an increasing fre-
      quency of momentary outages at or near a given location, which possibly indi-
      cates a potential reliability issue.
         Voltage analytics can identify meters whose voltage varies notably from those
      of other customers on the same transformer, indicating either power quality or
      customer diversion issues. Power quality issues due to low voltage can be mea-
      sured directly over time rather than derived through load-flow modeling.
         Geospatial data can be used to improve the connectivity of distribution sys-
      tem models. Outliers to a geospatial grouping (such as a customer that is assigned
      to the incorrect transformer) can be identified with an algorithm.

Networking in the Smart Grid




This chapter provides an overview of a standardized approach to the architec-
tural design of communications systems or an upgrade of an existing communi-
cations system for electric power systems.
   The variety of proprietary protocols with custom communications links from
various vendors made it difficult for automation devices deployed in electric
power systems to communicate or “interoperate” effectively. To solve this prob-
lem, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61850 standard was
developed so that electric utilities and vendors of electronic equipment could
produce standardized communications systems. IEC 61850 contains standards
for client/server and peer-to-peer communications, substation design and con-
figuration, and testing.
   High-speed switched Ethernet networks that are based on the IEC 61850
standard in electric power substations and distribution systems support the
following:

•	 Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) communications.
•	 Engineering access and asset management.
•	 Peer-to-peer communications for high-speed, mission-critical protection and
   control applications.

   Communications-assisted protection and control schemes, as well as automa-
tion designs, require an understanding of the applied data transmission media
and protocols in order to be used correctly to accelerate the execution of the
underlying applications.
   The IEC 61850 standard describes the behavior of intelligent electronic devices
(IEDs) in networks and provides specifications on IED communications methods.

                Design and specification of a communications system based on IEC 61850 proto-
                cols and methods require the use of many other standards, as shown in Table 4.1.


Table 4.1  International Standards That Are Used to Design Systems Based on IEC 61850
International
standard          Purpose
IEC 61850         To define various message performance classes that provide guidelines for transmission times of
                     digital messages to satisfy specific applications.
IEC 60834         To identify maximum transmission latencies and scientific measures of dependability and security
                     to support mission critical applications.
IEC 60870         To identify scientific measures of device and system reliability and maintainability.
IEEE 1613
IEC 15802         To identify Ethernet frame construction guidelines for efficient message transfer through the
IEEE 802.1           Ethernet network.




                   System design is based on understanding and mitigating the potential impacts
                to the latency and determinism (described in subsequent sections) of the mes-
                saging in order to predict and remove as much risk of failure as possible.

                •	 Understanding all the factors involved in the transport or transmission of mul-
                   tiple message classes across networks and how the factors affect message deter-
                   minism is critical for creating robust communications-assisted applications.
                •	 Different IEC 61850 message classes require specific criteria for determinism,
                   message delivery, and availability.
                •	 Communications designs must account for these factors in order to satisfy
                   application requirements.
                •	 Message transport through the network must be able to meet application
                   requirements for delivery and availability across all anticipated conditions.

                   IEC 61850 describes engineering design methods, data mapping, and com-
                munications methods to support several of the application requirements in an
                IED network, including those shown in table 4.2.
                   However, in order to build feature-rich systems, the IEC 61850 standard also
                describes the use of Ethernet. By using Ethernet, an IEC 61850-based system
                also supports other compatible Ethernet-based protocols on the same network.
                Complementary Ethernet-based protocols, such as those shown in table 4.3,
                coexist in the IEDs and on the network with IEC 61850 protocols. In this way,
                the Ethernet network supports all necessary communications applications
                including those not yet supported by IEC 61850 protocols.

*MIRRORED BITS communications is a relay-to-relay communications technology patented by Schweit-
zer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. (SEL)that exchanges the status of eight internal logic points called
MIRRORED BITS, encoded in a digital message, from one device to another. This technology opens the
door to numerous protection, control, and monitoring applications that would otherwise require more
expensive external communications equipment wired through contacts and control inputs.



   Complete system automation, however, requires additional communications
applications that are not addressed by the IEC 61850 standard and that are typically
accomplished with other compatible methods, such as those shown in table 4.4.

      Determinism of Message Streams
      Deterministic communication is the ability to consistently transfer data packets
      across a specified communications channel with predictable end-to-end varia-
      tion. The variation between packets is called jitter or packet delay variation.
      Ethernet packet latency is the time duration between the publication and deliv-
      ery of a packet through a network. The communication-assisted protection and
      automation functions require low latency and deterministic packet delivery to
      adequately use digital messaging to convey protection signals that were formerly
      conveyed via hardwired connections.
         Time division multiplexing (TDM) is one protocol that provides a high
      level of determinism of message streams over a physically private network
      (PPN), such as direct serial or Ethernet cables and multiplexer ePipe Ethernet
      circuit connections, which provide their entire bandwidth for a single purpose
      or path.
         The benefit of not sharing bandwidth is that these methods provide time-
      deterministic message delivery without interference or saturation from other
      unwanted messages, and they are able to meet specific performance criteria
      better.
         Switched Ethernet is deployed via a connection to an intermediary Ethernet
      switch instead of directly to a single subscribing device in order to support
      numerous data paths and multiple subscribing devices. Switched Ethernet com-
      munications is based on dividing message streams into multiple packets to share
      the network bandwidth better. Therefore, it involves receiving, buffering, priori-
      tizing, and forwarding messages within the network.
         This makes its applications for protection and control inadequate for mission-
      critical protection functions, such as tripping, interlocking, or sending permissive
      or blocking signals. The Ethernet system design must satisfy the determinism
      requirements for the network-supporting substation protection and control
      schemes.

   Consider the situation of a simple bus-blocking scheme. Good system design
anticipates the following questions when a blocking signal sent over Ethernet is
being considered:

•	 How should the coordinating timer be set?
•	 What is the worst case message delivery time, given the network design?
•	 How do we ensure that this time does not change with network expansion or
   upgrades?
•	 How do we test for this worst case message delivery time?
•	 Is the message delivery jitter acceptable to meet the application requirements?

   These questions must have measurable and deterministic answers for com-
munications engineers and protection engineers.
   IEC 61850 standardizes the data flow aspects of automation systems to per-
form many of the required substation communications applications.
   In addition, the goals of IEC 61850 communications standardization are to
create an internationally recognized method of supporting the interoperability of
products between multiple manufacturers and multiple product lines of indi-
vidual manufacturers for retrofitted and new systems, as well as future additions
to existing systems.
   As a standard, IEC 61850 describes new names, engineering processes, and
communications methods to replace existing technology. Compatible protocols
and methods must coexist on the Ethernet network with IEC61850–based
­
protocols in order to accomplish the following:

•	   Communications performance.
•	   Reliability-centered maintenance.
•	   Asset management.
•	   Configuration revision management.
•	   Substation automation functions.
•	   Cybersecurity.

   The IEC standard refers to important and necessary elements of system auto-
mation that are not addressed by the standard. These are “local issues,” meaning
that they are left to the local integrator or manufacturer to address.
   These local issues are addressed by accompanying standards and best practices,
some of which are also described in this document. Knowledge of IEC 61850 is
necessary for understanding and supporting the behavior of networked IEDs,
although knowledge of the local issues guided by experience with the companion
international standards is essential to effective system design that is compatible
with IEC 61850.

      IEC 61850 Interoperability
      Interoperability is the capability of the two or more IEDs of the same or different
      supplier to exchange information and use this information to properly execute
      the specific functions (IEC 61850-1).This is accomplished through standardized
      communications techniques and the ability to send and receive standardized
      messages.
         Even though devices are expected to be interoperable if they conform to the
      same standard, industry experience with other standard protocols proves that
      different development teams may create conforming, but non-interoperable,
      devices.
         One way to improve the chances of interoperability is to choose devices
      that are all created by the same development group. However, the best meth-
      od to assure interoperability is to test and observe it. To test every interoper-
      ability permutation as recommended by the standard is quite challenging.
      However, specific scenarios can and should be tested prior to product
      ­
      selection. If this information is not available to the end user for their intended
      application, it will be necessary for the end user to arrange for the proper test-
      ing to be done.
         It is necessary to understand the interoperability requirements among IEDs
      and applications for the final design to function properly and to verify that this
      interoperability has been demonstrated or to arrange for it to be demonstrated.
      Therefore, the IEDs to be used must be tested by the user to be interoperable
      with other manufacturers’ devices, so that even if the initial design is from a
      single manufacturer, there is confidence that devices from other manufacturers
      can be added in the future. Interoperability testing typically happens during a
      factory acceptance test (FAT).
         The purpose of this conformance testing is to reduce the risk of failed interop-
      erability between devices when put in service. However, the standard addresses
      a huge amount of communications scenarios and data models, of which only a
      subset will be implemented within any specific physical device or client. There-
      fore, vendors will typically only publish those elements of the standard to which
      their products have been tested for conformance.
         In order to be considered interoperable by the end-user, each device will
      need to support the appropriate data and services. Vendors intend to use the
      method outlined by the standard in which they identify the data and services
      supported within the device, as well as the method that has been proved to
      conform to the standard. According to the IEC 61850 standard, vendors must
      state implementation conformance, which includes the level of support for the
      following services:

      •	 Basic Exchange.
      •	 Data Sets.

   Over time the GPS description was understood to support IRIG-B (inter-
range instrumentation group time code), and new Ethernet-based precision time
protocol (PTP) methods are being developed. However, the IEC 61850 standard
also recognizes that the functionality of an IED, although out of scope, is
supremely important (IEC 61850; part 5). It refers to the requirements that IED
reactions must satisfy desired functionality, and IED functionality must perform
even during communications degradation.


Local Issues
Local issues refer to design specifications that must be understood and requested
by the system owner based on the individual primary power system component
and required performance. A number of important local issues are not addressed
by the IEC 61850 standard. For these and other details, the IEC 61850 commu-
nications standard is designed to refer to and rely on other international standards
to fully describe system requirements. Some of the standards used to specify
some of these local issues around Ethernet-based, communications-assisted pro-
tection and automation systems are listed in table 4.5. Local issues not addressed
by the IEC 61850 standard are dealt with locally in the IED by the developer, in
the substation by the user, or a combination of the two.

         These local issues are the description of the functionality that is required from
      the system and that clarifies the IED requirements that are necessary in addition
      to “IEC 61850 Compliance.”
         Local issues are not documented, and in addition to that, not every contin-
      gency has been identified or standardized within IEC 61850. Much useful sys-
      tem information in the IEDs is not represented in standardized object models,
      such as asset management; diagnostics; reports; settings; notifications; and perfor-
      mance indicators. However, they are often provided using customized object
      models created by vendors following the IEC 61850 modeling rules.
         Adding to the complexity of completing a substation automation system
      (SAS) is that many other important aspects remain outside the scope of IEC
      61850, including the following:


      •	 Method of designing, creating, and installing internal IED automation and
         protection.
      •	 Process for all aspects of engineering access.
      •	 Application functionality of devices, as well as performance characteristics of
         these applications. For example, it is possible, but perhaps not advisable, to
         interchange a relay with one that operates much more slowly to detect and
         operate on a fault.
      •	 Method of installing IED IEC 61850 configurations.
      •	 Methods of IED, system, and network analysis and diagnosis.

         It is essential that IEDs not only conform to the functionality of the data flow
      described by the IEC 61850 standard, but that they also conform to local issues
      essential to building a system based on IEC 61850.


      Performance Criteria for SAS and DAS under IEC 61850
      As SASs and distribution automation systems (DASs) are connected to remote
      SCADA systems, even more local issues arise. This is because most SCADA
      masters in the past rely on legacy non-IEC 61850 protocols. These legacy proto-
      cols generally use simple data types that do not translate into more complex
      61850 data types. Mandatory 61850 attributes are often not available via
      SCADA protocols, such as quality; time; control origin; and activation.
         Other non-mandatory details describe the IED functional capabilities that are
      necessary to satisfy system performance requirements. These details include the
      following:

      •	 Real time message sequence number, state number, and time to live values.
      •	 Real time display of message configuration including dataset name, virtual
         LAN (VLAN), destination MAC, GOOSE ID.

   gate messages not received, number of corrupted messaged received, priority,

necessary to satisfy integrated communications.


Message Requirements under IEC 61850
The IEC 61850 standard refers to the use of Type 1A message with Performance
Class P2/P3 and is defined to have a transfer time requirement of fewer than
3 milliseconds as illustrated in figure 4.1. A Type 1A message is defined for Trip
applications such as a communications-assisted tripping scheme.
    IEC 60834-1 requirements for security, reliability, and dependability are met
if the system meets the 3-millisecond transfer time 99.9999 percent of the time
and has a delay no longer than 18 milliseconds for the remainder.
    The IEC/TR 61850-90-4 network engineering guidelines for IEC 61850 Eth-
ernet traffic suggest that GOOSE messages used for protection should be
designed to have the highest priority and the shortest maximum delay. Control
blocking schemes, via GOOSE messaging or any other method, require a
99.99 percent success rate, and direct control schemes require a 99.9999 percent
success rate of the receipt of digital messages (reliability).
    Direct tripping through delivery and processing of a GOOSE or other mes-
sage is typically expected to occur within a transmission time of 20 milliseconds.
Failure is defined by the absence of the message at the receiving end or, for direct
control, a delay in delivery greater than 18 milliseconds. Therefore, the use
of Class P2/P3 messages requires that the system be designed to meet the
3-millisecond transfer time.
    This requires a high level of device reliability to keep the path failures to a
minimum. System availability analysis based on IEC 61850-5 measures of reli-
ability are used to predict the ability of each system to meet IEC 60834-1
dependability and security requirements. For example, a GOOSE application
configured to publish confirmation messages every second publishes 86,400
messages every 24 hours.
    Applying the IEC 60834-1 standard to a GOOSE signal exchange for direct
tripping, as illustrated in figure 4.1 with a 1-second heartbeat requires that the
network deliver every single GOOSE message packet, no exceptions (depend-
ability), and deliver fewer than 9 unwanted GOOSE message packets (security)
during every 24-hour period.

                      In summary, the systems need to support the following performance criteria:

                  •	 Signal < 3 msec, packet transit < 1 msec 99.99% of the time.
                  •	 Signal < 18 msec with transit < 15 msec remaining 0.01%.
                  •	 Zero dropped GOOSE, < 9 extra messages every 24 hours.

                    Systems made from networked IEDs need to be IEC 61850 conformant and
                  must support the following performance criteria:

                  •	 Immediate delivery by source, delivery by network, and reaction by destinations to
                     received GOOSE messages. (IEC 61850, IEEE 60834)
                  •	 Message delivery speed. Each mission-critical operational technology (OT)
                     machine-to-machine, peer-to-peer multicast message defined as IEC 61850
                     Performance Class 2 or 3 needs to be delivered in fewer than 3 milliseconds,
                     regardless of quantity, frequency, or network configuration. (IEC 61850)
                  •	 Performance requirements. OT applications are generally time-critical, with the
                     criterion for acceptable levels of delay and jitter dictated by the individual
                     installation. Protection class systems require deterministic responses in fewer
                     than 3 milliseconds 99.99 percent of the time, regardless of distance, with
                     never more latency than 18 milliseconds. (IEC 61850, IEC 60834, IEC 15802,
                     IEEE 802.1)
                  •	 Goodput ratio. Goodput is the amount of useful data, user data, or payload
                     that can be processed by, passed through, or otherwise put through a system
                     and received at the correct destination address. It is actually application infor-
                     mation throughput, a measure of the amount of information exchanged
                     between devices participating in an application, as opposed to traditional
                     communications message throughput. Goodput is a ratio of the delivered
                     amount of information and the total delivery time minus any packet headers
                     or other overhead and minus any information lost or corrupted in transit.

Networking in the Smart Grid	                                                                                               49


   The system must include demonstration of a high goodput data set, message,
   and Ethernet network design. (IEC 61850)
•	 Message delivery latency. Permissible latency referenced by the IEC 60834-1
   standard, which describes performance requirements for teleprotection sys-
   tems within the smart grid, includes 15-millisecond maximum message deliv-
   ery latency, 20-millisecond application latency for the permissive tripping
   teleprotection function and 25-millisecond maximum message delivery
   latency, 30-millisecond application latency for direct tripping. (IEC 61850,
   IEC 60834, IEC 15802, IEEE 802.1)
•	 Message delivery security. Security defined by IEC 60834-1 indicates the
   acceptable number of unwanted messages because they may cause unwanted
   operations, as illustrated in table 4.6. For a GOOSE exchange between devic-
   es with a heartbeat message sent once a second and signal status sent imme-
   diately after change of state to support the inter-tripping teleprotection func-
   tion, the requirement is that each IED should receive fewer than 9 unwanted
   messages in a 24-hour period. Therefore, each source IED must deliver no
   unwanted GOOSE messages. (IEC 61850, IEC 60834)
•	 Message delivery dependability. Dependability defined by IEC 60834-1 indi-
   cates the acceptable number of delayed or dropped messages because they
   may prohibit communications-assisted operations, as illustrated in Table 4.6.
   For a GOOSE exchange between devices with a heartbeat message sent once
   a second and signal status sent immediately after change of state to support
   intertripping, the dependability requirement is that the Ethernet network
   should delay or drop fewer than one (essentially zero) messages to each IED
   every 365 days. (IEC 61850, IEC 60834)

•	 Availability requirements. Many OT processes are continuous in nature. Unex-
   pected outages of systems that control industrial processes are not acceptable.
   Outages often must be planned and scheduled days or weeks in advance.
   Exhaustive predeployment testing is essential to ensure high availability for

         OT. Also, many control systems cannot be easily stopped and started without
         affecting production. In some cases, the products being produced or equip-
         ment being used are more important than the information being relayed.
             Therefore, network outages must be resolved in a matter of a few millisec-
         onds, and IED and switches must have a high mean time between failures
         (MTBF). High availability of IEDs and systems, verified through high MTBF
         based on observed field data, reduce the likelihood of a system fault. Also, fast
         detection and isolation of a fault and fast data path reconfiguration and re-estab-
         lishment of data communications are essential for appropriate failover or recon-
         figuration if a system fault should occur. (IEC 61850,IEC 60834, IEEE 802.1)
      •	 Risk management requirements. For an OT system, the primary concerns are
         human safety and fault tolerance to prevent loss of life or endangerment of
         public health or confidence, regulatory compliance, loss of equipment, loss of
         intellectual property. The personnel responsible for operating, securing, and
         maintaining OT must understand the important link between safety and
         security. Products and systems must meet NERC PRC-005 (or any other rel-
         evant or equivalent national standard), IEEE 1613, and IEC 61850 reliability
         requirements. The system must be isolated from IT connections via a security
         gateway acting as a demarcation point between IT and OT. (NERC PRC-005,
         IEEE 1613, and IEC 61850)
      •	 Architecture security focus. For OT, IEDs, such as protective relays, program-
         mable logic controllers (PLC), operator stations, and distributed control sys-
         tem controllers, need to be carefully protected because they are directly
         responsible for controlling the end processes. The protection of the central
         server is also very important in an OT system because the central server could
         possibly adversely impact every edge device.1 Routers, switches, and multi-
         plexers use OT routing information within the network layer addressing to
         route messages. When positioned at the intersection of OT and IT networks,
         these devices act as intersection devices. Routers, switches, and multiplexers
         are edge devices that must satisfy OT and act as a perimeter intersection
         demarcation device. (NERC PRC-005 or any relevant or equivalent national
         standard, IEEE 1613)
      •	 Physical interaction. OT networks have very complex interactions with physi-
         cal processes and consequences in the OT domain that can be manifested in
         physical events. All security functions integrated into OT must be tested
         offline on comparable OT to prove that they do not compromise normal OT
         functionality. The required environmental ruggedness and reliability of com-
         munications networking devices installed in OT networks are dictated by
         standards such as IEEE 1613. All IEDs, including edge devices, must meet
         stringent temperature, electric shock and noise, and vibration survivability
         standards.(NERC PRC-005, IEEE 1613, and IEC 61850)

•	 Time-critical responses. In OT, automated response time or system response to
   human interaction is very critical. For example, requiring password authenti-
   cation and authorization on a human-machine interface (HMI) must not
   hamper or interfere with emergency actions for OT. Information flow must
   not be interrupted or compromised. Access to these systems should be
   restricted by rigorous physical security controls.(NERC PRC-005, IEEE 1613,
   and IEC 61850)
•	 System operation. OT operating systems and applications do not tolerate
   typical IT security practices. Legacy systems are especially vulnerable to
   resource unavailability and timing disruptions. Control networks are often
   more complex and require a different level of engineering expertise (for
   example, control networks are typically managed by control engineers, not IT
   personnel). Software and hardware are more difficult to upgrade in an opera-
   tional control system network. Demarcation devices must support encryption
   capabilities, error logging, and password protection.(NERC PRC-005, IEEE
   1613, and IEC 61850)
•	 Change management. Performing, documenting, and archiving configuration,
   software, and firmware changes are paramount to maintaining the integrity of
   both IT and OT systems. Unpatched software represents one of the greatest
   vulnerabilities in a system. Software updates on IT systems, including security
   patches, are typically applied in a timely fashion based on appropriate secu-
   rity policies and procedures. In addition, these procedures are often auto-
   mated using server-based tools because their potentially negative impact on
   network and device availability is considered acceptable. Software updates on
   OT cannot always be implemented on a timely basis because these updates
   need to be thoroughly tested by the manufacturer of the industrial control
   application and the end user of the application before being implemented.
   OT outages often must be planned and scheduled days or weeks in advance.
   The OT system may also require revalidation as part of the update process.
   Another issue is that many OT systems use older versions of operating sys-
   tems that are no longer supported by the manufacturer. Consequently, avail-
   able patches may not be applicable. Change management is also applicable to
   hardware and firmware. The change management process must be performed
   by OT staff and requires infrequent patches and upgrades. The system must
   be designed with contingencies for continued operation during change man-
   agement maintenance.(NERC PRC-005, IEEE 1613, and IEC 61850)
•	 Component lifetime. Typical IT components have a lifetime of 3–5 years, with
   the brevity resulting from the quick evolution of technology. For OT, where
   technology has been developed, in many cases, for very specific use and
   implementation, the lifetime of the deployed technology must be 20–30 years.
   (NERC PRC-005, IEEE 1613, and IEC 61850)

        OT and modern IT networks need to be engineered, not simply assembled. IT
      experts need to be familiar with the following important facts:

      •	 PCM IEDs are peripheral devices that are VLAN aware.
      •	 PCM IEDs that manage IEEE 802.1 QVLANs require a new category of
         switch connection for a peripheral device with more network control than an
         edge, such as VLAN management, but not all the features expected for a
         trunk.
      •	 IEC 60834-1 defines latency, dependability, and security requirements.
      •	 Protection-class application dependability and security require near-zero
         message loss, not buffer and resend.
      •	 PCM networks have static configurations, device addressing, and limited mul-
         ticast routing. Dynamic reconfiguration is not acceptable.
      •	 Failure to address the root cause of Ethernet packet loss has burdened periph-
         eral devices with numerous recovery processes.
      •	 Every dropped packet is a near miss. Each near miss has the potential to over-
         lap message delivery of a malfunction and delay prevention of a catastrophe.
      •	 IT, OT, and PCM experts need to continue to collaborate on appropriate solu-
         tions for all applications.
      •	 Failure and rerouting times between switches are interesting, but the critical
         measure is time to restore communications to the peripheral devices.

      Distribution automation systems often rely on wireless communications due to
      long distances between IEDs, remote installations, and cost constraints. Substa-
      tion distribution automation controllers often need to communicate wirelessly to
      distribution pole mounted devices including recloser controls, capacitor bank
      controls, meters, and voltage regulators.
         Modern radios have several serial or Ethernet ports that support different
      simultaneous connections and protocols. By using radio frequency (RF) synchro-
      nization technology, two radios are collocated to communicate back to back and
      exchange data as repeaters without interference.
         The value and benefit of inexpensive and robust dual-ring communications
      among remote sites using this technology are that pairs of radios located at each
      site and connected through synchronization technology provide continuous peer-
      to-peer communications simultaneously in both directions around the ring.
      These radio pairs also support both a primary and failover SCADA link for con-
      stant data acquisition and control, even in the event of a single-point communi-
      cations failure.
         Many existing devices and applications use serial communications networks
      and protocols, such as DNP3 or Modbus®, to communicate between remote sites
      and a centralized SCADA system.

   These client-server protocols support data acquisition and commanded con-
trol messages from the centralized SCADA client to the remote devices via
SCADA radios at each site. This client-server polling scheme traditionally
requires that the SCADA radio at the client communicate directly with each
remote SCADA radio, one at a time. The protocols support data acquisition and
control status responses from the remote sites back to the SCADA client over
the same radio pair.
   Because of the nature of these protocols, they cannot be used for bidirectional,
high-speed automation and control purposes. High-speed, peer-to-peer, real-time
data exchange requires one or more additional, separate communications paths
for bidirectional monitoring and control.
   Traditionally, this peer-to-peer application required a second pair of radios
between sites, resulting in increased cost associated with installation and equip-
ment, such as antennas, feedlines, and surge arrestors.
   To address this issue, synchronized radios can be installed in a ring topology to
enable reliable, bidirectional, high-speed communications for automation and
control. These radios have several serial or Ethernet links multiplexed over one
radio channel. Each port can be configured to communicate a different
protocol.
   These radios are installed in pairs at each site. The example in figure 4.2 rep-
resents a typical setup for a dual high-speed ring. In this example, one port is

      dedicated for SCADA control and monitoring using DNP3 protocol to an IED
      or remote device port.
         A second port is used for inter-site, high-speed, peer-to-peer communications
      via MIRRORED BITS® communications or GOOSE to another IED port. These
      MIRRORED BITS communications or GOOSE links simultaneously transmit
      data in both directions between the radios.
         Because IEDs have multiple ports that support peer-to-peer communications,
      data coming from one direction into a communications port are often passed
      through and published out of the second peer-to-peer communications port. In
      this way, the IEDs and radios perform high-speed data repeating.
         In the case of radio repeater sites, a third port (Port 3) is interconnected
      between the local radio pair. It performs conventional repeating of the received
      protocol messages among radios without passing the messages through the IEDs.
      This is accomplished using directional antennas at repeater sites, which improves
      the link range because the antennas are more effective than the omni-directional
      antennas used in non-repeater applications.
         The connection between the Port 3 of each radio also performs radio hopping
      synchronization for minimum interference between the radios. This synchroniza-
      tion allows two radios to synchronize publications, referred to as hops, to the next
      radio in the ring in order to prevent the radios from interfering with each other.
         This configuration allows continuous bandwidth at a lower latency compared
      with using another separate radio as a repeater and attempting to communicate
      through simultaneous receipts and publications. This synchronized transmission
      minimizes the interference and maximizes the radio performance. In the ring
      topology, multiple channels between sites provide flexible topologies and allow
      the use of more than one protocol between the central SCADA system and
      remote sites, as well as between sites.


      Advantages of Dual High-Speed Ring Topology in LANs
      A ring topology enables bidirectional data flow between sites. This allows mes-
      sages to travel around the ring in both directions to remote sites by being repeat-
      ed at each site along the way. It also supports peer-to-peer messages between sites
      in both directions. The multiple ports on the radios support simultaneous peer-
      to-peer communications and SCADA protocols, such as DNP3, to multiple sites
      located far away from the central site. This simplifies site-to-site path studies,
      installation, and communications with sites that do not have a direct line-of-sight
      to the central site. The advantages of the dual high-speed ring topology include
      the following:

      •	 The dual-ring topology supports redundant client-server connections to
         improve reliability. This feature is possible if the client device, such as a Real-
         Time Automation Controller (RTAC), supports dual primary interrogation
         ports. This provides data flow redundancy of SCADA protocols for more

   reliable communications simultaneous with bidirectional peer-to-peer com-
   munications over the other channel.
•	 Every radio location has the ability to monitor SCADA and engineering
   access messages to and from every other site. Technicians can diagnose and
   troubleshoot communications problems from multiple locations.
•	 The data load between sites is shared over multiple channels for consistently
   enhanced performance of three separate IED communications channels. Due
   to its ruggedness, longevity, and ability to transmit and repeat both peer-to-
   peer and centralized data acquisition and control communications, the radio
   ring is a great fit for use in control and monitoring applications, especially for
   geographically distributed remote sites. Bidirectional data flow enables peer-
   to-peer data exchange to support rapid communications-assisted decision
   points at multiple remote sites. A dual high-speed ring used for control and
   monitoring applications improves automation system operation, performance,
   and reliability because it allows the following to be done:
   •	 Perform early detection of communications and process failures at each site
      and adjacent sites.
   •	 Create and store typical process data in order to permit future comparisons
      to detect abnormalities.
   •	 Use timely detection of abnormalities in the process to alert end users of
      channel failure and trigger condition-based maintenance.
   •	 Automatically react to data from any site to trigger fail-safe or preventative
      actions.
   •	 Improve troubleshooting and diagnostic calculations and reduce calculation
      time because data are shared between sites over multiple channels.
   •	 Improve operational efficiency by decreasing the application downtime,
      and improve processes with system-wide situational awareness.


Cybersecurity Policy for Utility Engineered Systems (ESs)
Cybersecurity has become increasingly important and requires a separate specifica-
tion to work in a coordinated fashion with this communications specification. It is
important to protect systems from threats posed by hackers, disgruntled employ-
ees, terrorists, and countries with sophisticated information warfare plans and
capabilities. This is a specialized, fast-moving subject and, for this reason, IEC
61850 intentionally avoids describing encryption and authentication techniques
and instead relies on other related standards to describe compatible methods. IEC
61850 protocols and methods do work with other technologies in communications
network and IEDs to provide practical and forceful cybersecurity protection.
   All parts of the utility are responsible for satisfying cybersecurity, but the real-
time prevention of cyber intrusion rests in the substation and distribution com-
munications network. In conjunction with a separate utility-wide cybersecurity
policy, the substation and distribution communications network must quickly
reduce the threats to vital power system assets.

          The policy guidelines in the following section, summarized here, must be
      adhered to in order to maintain a consistent, high quality of service, along with a
      high level of security to protect confidential information and sensitive data. The
      cybersecurity design must ensure that the communication network delivers all
      published digital signals dependably and confidentially. It might also ensure that
      all unwanted digital access be identified, prevented, alarmed, and documented.
      General, recommended practices include the following:

      •	 Disable all unused communications ports, including USB (Universal Serial
         Bus), to prevent unwanted access via cables and memory drives.
      •	 Use and manage strong passwords. For example, strengthen a weak password,
         such as “Webster” by changing it to a stronger version, such as “W3b$t3r.”
         Choose IEDs that do not use default passwords, and permit easy changes to
         passwords periodically and when an employee leaves. When possible, deploy
         a firewall that performs automatic and scheduled password changes.
      •	 Secure communications with encryption and authentication tools.
      •	 Use Media Access Control (MAC) filtering to allow maintenance access to
         only those tools and engineering workstations that are preauthorized.
      •	 In a separate location, securely store all engineering computers, passwords,
         encryption equipment and keys, instruction manuals, and software.
      •	 When possible, support more than one secure communications path.
      •	 Use appropriate communications network design to minimize the likelihood
         and impact of a denial-of-service attack.
      •	 Send security alarms through SCADA and a second path.
      •	 Archive and review log files on firewalls, alarms, and access activity.
      •	 Coordinate the communications network and cybersecurity with physical
         security via network IEDs with physical security I/O.
      •	 Practice “security in depth.” Physical—Cyber—Communications—Training—
         Culture. Have a clear, concise, and well-thought-out plan in place beforehand
         about how your company will respond to a cyber incident.

      Employees
      Background checks and reference checks will be performed for prospective
      employees. Utility employment is contingent on successful completion of a drug
      test. Employees are subject to periodic, random, and for-cause drug testing. Util-
      ity ES repeats background checks for applicable employees before they complete
      seven years of service.

      Training
      All new employees will receive training on Utility security practices. In addition,
      Utility provides continuing security education to employees through regular
      training and security awareness sessions.

Physical Access Controls
Employees’ physical access will be restricted to the locations and times needed for
them to perform their jobs. An audit of all employees’ access permissions may be
performed on a routine basis. Utility will use multiple layers of defense in depth
to ensure a secure work environment, as well as to aid forensic investigations.

Data Security Access Controls
Utility ES uses need-to-know principles in storing Utility and customer informa-
tion. Electronic files are stored and secured using role-based access controls that
the project administrator and supervisor maintain. Electronic files are stored on
file systems that require authentication and control authorization. Employees
who are no longer employed by the Utility are automatically removed from
access to systems.

Security Policy for Customer Documentation
Employees will consider all information and documentation for customer sys-
tems to be confidential to the Utility. They are to dispose of old or outdated
customer hardcopy information using appropriate measures, such as locked
shredding bins provided by the Utility.

Security Policy for IT Controls on Customer Systems
Utility ES personnel will adhere to the Utility computer use policy and will use
this policy to secure Utility ES customer information systems, such as servers and
workstations.

Password Policy
Utility ES employees will use strong and non-default passwords on all systems
that contain or transmit private information on the customer or sensitive infor-
mation on the Utility. Passwords must be stored in encrypted vaults or stored in
a physically secure location.

Systems and Change Management
Employees are required to submit a formal written change request for all system
changes, both scheduled and unscheduled, to project management. Each change
request must receive formal Utility ES security and network approval before
employees may proceed with the change. Utility ES must have prior customer
notification and approval for each change.
   A change management log must be maintained for all changes. The log must
contain the following information:

•	 Date of submission and date of change.
•	 Owner and custodian contact information.

      Data Protection in Transit and at Rest
      Confidential and sensitive data must be stored and transferred using approved
      secure means. Critical data are to be stored on centralized network storage and
      systems. Utility laptops must run full-disk encryption, real-time anti-virus, and
      firewalls. Utility laptops are subject to centralized patch management.USB stor-
      age use is limited to business need and only with approved devices. Employees
      must use Utility’s encrypted file transfer algorithm (FTA) to transfer files secure-
      ly between Utility and outside sources. Standard email and FTP are not suitable
      for transferring confidential Utility data. Connection to internal Utility resources
      requires strong authentication through the use of a Utility virtual private net-
      work (VPN) or similar.
          Non-electronic data must also be treated with similar care. Employees must
      keep confidential documents put away and must use locking cabinets if needed.
          Examples of confidential or sensitive data include data labeled Utility Confi-
      dential, Utility Secret, or NERC CIP data, as well as customer drawings and
      configuration data, personally identifiable information, and credit card data.

      Anti-Malware
      Utility ES employees shall use defensive in-depth principles to protect against
      malware. All Utility employee systems shall follow the Utility Computer Use
      policy and have some active form of the following tools:

      •	 AntiVirus/AntiMalware (Whitelist).
      •	 Patch management.
      •	 Client firewall.

         Enterprise email is to be protected and scanned by a spam filter. Employees
      are to be protected from web-based malware by a web gateway. Finally, security
      monitoring solutions are in place to detect threats against clients.

      Data Disposal
      All confidential data shall be securely wiped or shredded when no longer needed.
      Hard drives, including those in computers, faxes, and printers must be securely
      wiped, degaussed, or destroyed. Solid state drives require destruction of encryp-
      tion key or entire drive.

      Disaster Recovery
      Utility shall have a disaster recovery plan to address the continuation or recovery
      of business in the case of a serious event. Critical systems, including those that
      contain customer data, shall include disaster recovery plans and must be tested

Conclusion
Implementing a comprehensively engineered IEC 61850 solution is not a trivial
task. Training is a primary issue that must be addressed, because the change in
thinking is more revolutionary than evolutionary. Ethernet networks and multi-
function devices have changed the processes and possibilities of system specifica-
tion, design, construction, commissioning, testing, troubleshooting, and
maintenance.
   For many, the first experience with substation ethernet is for engineering
access, which is neither time nor mission critical. Unfortunately, design practices
for engineering access connectivity are not adequate for protection, control, and
monitoring (PCM) communications. Therefore, networks designed for engineer-
ing access need to be enhanced, or instead, utilities need to design substation
networks that satisfy the reliability and determinism requirements of protection
and control communication from the beginning. This chapter reflects knowledge
guided by experience of multiple teams that have deployed Ethernet and IEC
61850 in electric power systems around the world.
   It is important to ensure that the systems include well-engineered modern
solutions based on secure and deterministic digital communications. Degraded
performance of ICT networks based on shared bandwidth techniques of Ether-
net and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) must be observed, alarmed, and
replaced. ICT designers must understand the fundamental first principles of
Ethernet and MPLS to use them dependably and securely. In fact, IT and OT
ICT network designers must collaborate to address completely different expecta-
tions for similar acceptance criteria terms of dependability and security. IT prac-
tices and poor OT design and configuration of both PCM IEDs and network
switches and routers will fail to prevent dropped packets. Moreover, network
switches and routers used to build OT networks must have extended features,
such as temperature ranges and must be substation rugged as these devices per-
form under harsh environmental conditions. Using rugged substation OT devices
with high mean time between failures (MTBF) will provide a reliable communi-
cation network.
   Within Ethernet networks, delayed and dropped messages are inevitable. Tests
demonstrate the degradation of application performance and eventual failure if
near misses are ignored and networks are not designed to meet mission-critical
standards. However, tests also show that when designed appropriately, with PCM
IEDs designed with knowledge of the fundamental first principles of communi-
cations, Ethernet can behave in a deterministic, dependable, and secure manner.
Designers, consultants, integrators, manufacturers, and end users are duty bound
to understand and deploy best engineering practices to maintain the safe and

      causes are not only good practice, but are the obligations of designers, consul-

      communications constraints and should seek appropriate technical assistance
      when defining and implementing a smart grid modernization strategy.

Defining a Distribution-Level Grid
Modernization Strategy
and Investment Plan



This chapter covers recommended strategies for distribution grid modernization.
Each utility’s grid modernization strategy will be somewhat different based on
the technology starting point, level of available resources, and vision. Electric
distribution utilities in developing countries may lack some of the basic building
blocks and resources needed for grid modernization. This chapter describes grid
modernization strategies for various initial starting points and covers prudent
investments that can facilitate the transition to a smart distribution system.
   The amount of grid modernization that can be accomplished depends on the
availability of key equipment including controllable power apparatus (line
switches, capacitor banks, voltage regulators, and distributed energy resources
[DERs]), the number and locations of distribution sensors, and the availability of
reliable and effective telecommunication facilities. And, of course, the grid mod-
ernization activities that can be accomplished are constrained by the availability
of financial and technical resources.


Getting Started
As stated earlier, the process of developing a distribution grid modernization
strategy begins with a careful assessment of key business drivers and a long-range
vision for grid modernization. This should be followed with an assessment of
existing technologies that are currently in place at the utility. Use of existing
facilities is a key factor in accomplishing grid modernization with available finan-
cial and technical resources. In particular, the utility should assess the following
technology issues to determine its current level of technology deployment,
which in turn will help determine what level of grid modernization can be done
with limited financial and technical resources.
   Figure 5.1 outlines the basic building blocks of grid modernization. These are
essential components that are needed to achieve the business objectives

      established for the grid modernization project. This is followed by a description
      of the fundamental elements of each building block.

      •	 Controllable, electrically operable power apparatus. The recommended grid
         modernization strategy requires the ability to control certain key distribution
         power apparatus based on an assessment of varying operating conditions to
         meet established reliability, efficiency, and performance objectives. Control-
         lable components that are fundamental to grid modernization include medi-
         um voltage (MV: 12 kilovolt to 35 kilovolt) line switches, voltage regulators,
         and capacitor banks that are located distribution HV/MV substations and out
         on the feeders themselves. If power apparatus can only be operated manually
         by field crews and does not support automatic and remote control, the
         amount of grid modernization that can be accomplished is severely limited.
         To achieve maximum grid modernization benefits, automatic or remote con-
         trol of power apparatus is essential.
      •	 Intelligent sensors. Most grid modernization application functions require
         measurements and equipment status indications from power apparatus that
         can be located anywhere on the distribution system. Many older control sys-
         tems relied solely on “local” measurements (that is, measurements taken at
         the device itself) and local controllers that were implemented as part of the
         associated power apparatus. To achieve grid modernization application func-
         tions, the advanced control functions require inputs from devices installed
         at different locations across the power grid. This is needed to permit well-

   on local measurements). Grid modernization requires intelligent sensors and
   controllers that are able to acquire “local” measurements and transmit these
   pieces of information to centrally located distribution system operators and
   control systems.
•	 Telecommunication infrastructure. As stated above, the ability to acquire near
   real-time (within 5–10 minutes of the actual measurement time) measure-
   ments and status indications from intelligent sensors (located anywhere on the
   electric distribution system) and issue control commands to power apparatus
   (that can also be located anywhere on the system) is a cornerstone of grid mod-
   ernization. Providing digital communications between the distribution control
   center and HV/MV substations is a starting point. But providing a telecommu-
   nication system that is able to reach the extremities of the distribution system
   is often needed to accomplish the ultimate vision for grid modernization.

    The next section provides guidelines and recommendations for achieving spe-
cific grid modernization objectives for different starting points. For each grid
modernization level, the section explains what objectives can be achieved and
outlines a strategy for achieving them. The section also provides strategies for
advancing to the next grid modernization level.


Grid Modernization Levels
This section describes four levels of grid modernization—that is, the levels of
automation that currently exist at a given electric distribution utility and progres-
sively more sophisticated levels of grid modernization that may be needed to
accomplish the utility’s vision for grid modernization. The levels are listed below:

•	 Level 0: Manual control and local automation define a situation in which most
   processes are performed manually with little or no automation. This is a situ-
   ation that exists at many utilities in developing countries.
•	 Level 1: Substation automation and remote control build on level 0 by adding
   IEDs and data communication facilities to achieve greater monitoring and
   control capabilities at HV/MV substations.
•	 Level 2: Feeder automation and remote control build on level 1 by extending
   remote monitoring and advanced control to the feeders themselves (outside the
   substation fence).This level also includes information from communicating
   meters at some large customers for improved control and decision making.
•	 Level 3: DER integration and control and demand response—the highest level
   of grid modernization described in this report—add energy storage, static VAR
   sources, and advanced communication and control facilities to effectively
   integrate and manage high penetrations of DERs on the distribution feeders.
   This level of grid modernization also includes deployment of AMI to enable
   on-demand reading of customer meters along with DR capabilities.

         While increasing levels of grid modernization represents a natural progression
      from manual paper-driven processes to electronic computer-assisted decision
      making with automation, it is possible (and in many cases recommended) that a
      utility that is presently at a low level of grid modernization bypass one or more
      higher levels of automation. That is, a utility at a relatively low level of grid mod-
      ernization may “leapfrog” one or more levels of grid modernization to achieve
      some of the benefits offered by the highest levels of grid modernization. Most
      utilities in developed countries have followed a gradual progression by imple-
      menting the best available technologies at any given time. But it is not necessary
      for a utility that is currently using electromechanical technology from the 1970s
      or earlier to gradually modernize by first installing 1980–90 technology (solid
      state devices), and then replace these units at some later date with 21st-century
      IEDs. Utilities in developing countries that have not completely built out their
      electric system may elect to bypass some of the traditional modernization steps
      (see section “Summary of Grid Modernization Projects” for details).
         The following subsections describe each grid modernization level in more
      depth, outline a strategy for achieving each level, and identify grid modernization
      benefits that can be achieved at each level.

      Level 0: Manual Control and Local Automation
      At this grid modernization level, operation of the distribution system is mostly
      manual. Level 0 grid modernization is depicted in figure 5.2. Automatic functions
      are limited to distribution feeder protection, voltage regulation, and in some cases
      capacitor bank switching for power factor correction. Protective relays, voltage
      regulators, and capacitor bank controllers may be electromechanical devices, elec-
      tronic devices, or IEDs. Most likely, these devices are all electromechanical devices
      (especially in developing countries), which means they lack the intelligence to
      adapt to varying operating conditions and they lack the ability to supply local
      measurements to a remote processor for additional analysis and control.
         Another characteristic of this grid modernization level is the lack of data com-
      munication facilities that are needed for more advanced data acquisition and
      control functions. As a result, all automatic control actions performed by protec-
      tive relays, voltage regulators, and switched capacitor banks are based on “local”
      (at the device itself) measurements and equipment status indications.
         Out on the feeders (outside the substation fence), most (if not all) line
      switches are manually operated. But some switches may be line reclosers, which
      are fully automatic fault interrupting devices. It is assumed that most distribution
      feeders have normally open ties to adjacent feeders, and that these tie switches
      must be operated manually by field crews. No communication facilities exist for
      feeder devices; hence, remote monitoring and control of feeder devices is not
      possible at this level.
         The grid modernization objectives that can be achieved with this level of
      automation are somewhat limited due to the lack of communication between

devices and availability of information from intelligent sensors. Following are
descriptions of the grid modernization objectives and benefits that may be
achieved when the starting point is grid optimization level 0.

Reliability Improvement
•	 Limited FLISR. If properly coordinated line reclosers exist on the feeder, and
   normally open tie switches are available between adjacent feeders, it is possi-
   ble to obtain some of the benefits of the FLISR grid modernization applica-
   tion function. The following additional equipment and control logic is needed
   to provide this functionality:
•	 If normally open tie switches are load-break switches, replace these switches
   with line reclosers that are fully automatic and have fault interrupting
   capability.
•	 Equip all line reclosers (including normally open tie switches) with loss-of-volt
   detection (undervoltage relays). If voltage is lost at a normally closed line
   switch for a specified time period, then this switch would automatically open
   to isolate an “upstream” fault (that is, a fault that is closer to the substation
   than the switch). If voltage is lost on either side of the normally open tie
   switch, this switch should close to restore service to the deenergized
   component.

  This strategy would enable the utility to significantly improve feeder reliability.
But since the service restoration logic does not verify that sufficient capacity exists

      on backup sources at the time of the fault, there is a risk that the load transfer will
      result in an overload on the backup feeder. Another downside to this approach is
      that the normally open tie switch may close into a faulted section of the feeder,
      thus subjecting the feeder equipment to additional through fault current.

      Reduction of Electrical Losses
      Reducing electrical losses is an especially important business objective for utili-
      ties in developing countries, where the level of losses may exceed 25 percent of
      total energy consumption. This is considerably higher than the rest of the world.
      Electrical losses of concern include both technical losses (I2R heating of ener-
      gized components) and nontechnical losses (energy theft and unmetered loads).
      For these utilities, electrical loss reduction should be an integral part of the grid
      modernization strategy.

      •	 Volt/VAR control using local stand-alone controllers. At grid modernization
         level 0, electric distribution utilities may use stand-alone controllers for oper-
         ating switched capacitor banks, voltage regulators (including substation trans-
         formers with under LTCs), and other volt/VAR control devices. In the past,
         these controllers were in effect switches that turned the associated power
         apparatus on or off at specified times corresponding to peak load and mini-
         mum load conditions. Newer IED-based stand-alone controllers can base
         their operation on a number of “local” measurements (current, voltage, reac-
         tive power flow, ambient conditions, and so on) to improve the overall perfor-
         mance of the volt/VAR control system. This, in turn, allows the utility to
         further reduce electricity losses and improve overall efficiency. Figure 5.3
         depicts the local controller approach to local volt/VAR control.

      The electric distribution utility should also consider adding new switched
   capacitor banks to the distribution feeder. Optimal locations for placing new
   capacitor banks should be determined using distribution engineering analysis
   software tools (optimal capacitor placement).
•	 Reconductoring of primary and secondary distribution networks. Given that
   the load losses of the distribution system are directly proportional to the
   series resistance of distribution components, electrical losses can be reduced
   by replacing existing primary and secondary lines with conductors of greater
   capacity. While it is clear that the larger the conductor’s cross-sectional area,
   the lower the line losses, the benefits/costs associated with reconductoring
   depend on the system. Benefits include improving the voltage profile (due to
   a reduction in the voltage drop along the feeder) and adding available capac-
   ity for load transfers to or from neighbor feeders, which also has a positive
   impact on system reliability.
•	 Voltage upgrading. For some distribution systems (for example, high-load-
   density areas, long rural feeders), a design practice recommended to eco-
   nomically decrease conductor losses through current reduction is to increase
   primary voltage; this is known as voltage upgrading or voltage conversion.
   The apparent power in a conductor is proportional to voltage and current;
   doubling primary operating voltage will reduce the conductor current by
   half for the same feeder power flow. Hence, the resulting load loss is 25 per-
   cent that of the original voltage using the same feeder conductor and length,
   as shown in figure 5.4. Going from 11 kilovolt to 33 kilovolt will reduce the
   load current by two-thirds, so the load losses will be one-ninth of the original
   losses. Figure 5.4 illustrates the impact of voltage upgrading on feeder con-
   ductor losses.
•	 Transformer losses. These are an important purchase criterion and make up an
   appreciable portion of a utility’s overall losses. This applies to both substation
   transformers and distribution service transformers. The Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory (Knoxville, TN, United States), a leading research institution, esti-
   mates that distribution transformers account for 26 percent of transmission

         and distribution losses. A current best practice is to install high-efficiency
         distribution transformers to reduce overall distribution losses. Many utilities
         in developing countries are replacing old, highly inefficient transformers with
         modern silicon-steel-core transformers. Moreover, modern transformer load
         management (TLM) systems are being implemented for tracking transformer
         loadings (for example, distribution transformers are typically at maximum
         efficiency when loaded at 50 percent of the nominal rating). This tool allows
         the more accurate economic evaluation of transformer loadings, taking into
         account several cost components (losses, capital, loss of life, and so on).
      •	 Network reconfiguration and load balancing. Network reconfiguration consists
         in changing the status of distribution switches (from normally open to nor-
         mally closed and vice versa) to improve the paths of load flow to better serve
         varying location and time-dependent factors of distribution load. By switch-
         ing to better distribute load, the system I2R delivery losses will decrease. This
         is because the total losses on one heavily loaded feeder and one lightly loaded
         feeder are greater than the total losses on two medium-loaded feeders. Load
         unbalance is a common occurrence in three-phase distribution systems. It can
         be harmful to the operation of the network and reduce reliability and safety.
         Furthermore, measurements and computations reported by the international
         literature show that losses increase due to unbalanced loads, mostly due to the
         circulation of unbalanced currents through neutral conductors. For, instance,
         for a 15 percent current unbalance, the losses of a real low-voltage network in
         Brazil were 4.1 percent more than those of a fully balanced network. This
         problem in distribution networks exists in both three- and four-wire systems
         due to the fact that loads are switched on and off by end-users. Figure 5.5
         shows the impact of feeder load balancing on technical losses.

         Extreme load unbalance also causes voltage unbalance, which affects sensitive
      electronic equipment and causes the overheating (and the increase of losses) in
      motor loadings. Though the problem is challenging, the solution is low cost:

performing load balancing typically involves only metering equipment and labor
costs, not capital investments. Load balancing is therefore a primary way that
utilities try to reduce losses, and is a highly recommended option for utilities in
developing countries.

Efficiency Improvement
Efficiency improvement refers to the process of accomplishing the same amount
of work while consuming less energy to perform this work. Efficiency improve-
ment projects can help utilities avoid having to build new generating facilities
and add new transmission and distribution power delivery facilities.

•	 Limited conservation voltage reduction. The utility should replace voltage regu-
   lator controls (as needed) in HV/MV substations and out on the feeders with
   new controllers that include line drop compensation (LDC) capabilities. The
   settings of the new voltage regulators should be lower than normal voltage
   settings to achieve the benefits of voltage conservation. Due to the lack of
   voltage feedback from feeder extremities, utilities that deploy this strategy
   may be forced to build additional operating margins into the voltage regulator
   settings to avoid unacceptably low voltage when running conservation voltage
   reduction (CVR) during peak load conditions.

DER Integration
Voltage regulation with reverse power flow. The recommended level 0 strategy is
to install bidirectional voltage controls (with a cogeneration feature) on voltage
regulators installed out on feeders that have a high penetration of DERs. A high
penetration of DERs on a given feeder can produce reverse power flows (back
toward the substation) and a potential for voltage rise on feeder locations fur-
ther from the substation. To avoid potential high-voltage conditions at certain
feeder locations due to such reverse power flows, the recommended bidirec-
tional voltage controls take suitable control actions (opposite from the normal
control direction) when reverse power flow is detected. The impact of reverse
power flow on voltage regulation is shown in figure 5.6.

Level 1: Substation Communication and Automation
Modernization of HV/MV substations should receive high priority in the distri-
bution grid modernization strategy. This is because most of the equipment that
is responsible for controlling the performance and protection of the distribution
grid resides in the HV/MV substations, and significant grid modernization ben-
efits can be achieved through improved monitoring and control of this equip-
ment. Hence, for utilities that are currently at grid modernization level 0 (as is
the case in many developing countries), implementation of level 1 grid modern-
ization should be the first step in the utility’s grid modernization strategy. Level 1
modernization enables continuous near-real-time monitoring and advance con-
trol of HV/MV substation power apparatus, thus enabling a number of the grid

      modernization applications that have been identified. Level 1 grid modernization
      is depicted in figure 5.7.
          Level 1 grid modernization includes the replacement of electromechanical
      controllers, protection, and metering devices in the substation with substation
      IEDs, along with substation remote terminal units (RTUs) or data concentrators
      that acquire, store, process, and transmit information acquired from IEDs to a

control center. Installing substation IEDs is a resource-intensive process that is
often completed over many years at a rate of several substations per year. Strate-
gies for implementing substation IEDs include replacing electromechanical
devices as they fail with IED versions of the same device and using IEDs for all
new construction work and substation modernization projects. This strategy may
take many years to complete due to the limits of available resources to perform
the device upgrades. Because the expected lifetime of substation IEDs is
20–25 years, the entire upgrade project should be completed before IEDs
installed at the beginning of the project begin to fail. Figure 5.8 depicts the gen-
eral architecture of the modern, IED-based substation.
   Level 1 also includes the addition of reliable and effective communication
facilities between the HV/MV substations and the distribution control center (or
equivalent centralized facility). These communication facilities enable telemeter-
ing of information from the IEDs to a control center and the delivery of control
commands from the control center to the IEDs. There are many possible choices
for the substation communication infrastructure. Choices include public com-
munication infrastructure (leased telephone lines, cellular networks, and so on)
and private networks (licensed radio; optical fiber, especially optical ground wires
[OPGW]).

Level 1: Grid Modernization Applications
Grid modernization application functions that can be accomplished with level 1
modernization include:

Reliability Improvement
•	 Early detection of service interruption. Protective relay IEDs in the substation
   are continuously monitored, so when a feeder circuit breaker trips, distribu-
   tion system operators are informed immediately so that service restoration
   activities can begin without waiting for customers to call. This reduces the
   duration of outages.
•	 Fault location. When a feeder fault occurs, protective relay IEDs are able to
   compute and report (via the substation communication network) the electri-
   cal distance to the fault. As a result, field crews can be dispatched to a more
   precise fault location, resulting in shorter fault investigation time and reduced
   outage time.
•	 Fuse-saving schemes. Protective relay IEDs are able to store multiple relay set-
   ting groups that can be selected as needed by the distribution system operator.
   During inclement weather, when temporary faults are most likely to occur,
   the operators can select a “fuse-saving” setting group that will allow the sub-
   station circuit breaker to clear a temporary fault and then reclose (reenergize
   the circuit) before downstream fuses blow to cause a permanent fault. This
   reduces the duration of outages and also the time needed to replace blown
   fuses.

•	 Intelligent bus failover. The substation automation scheme can be used to
   implement a medium bus failover scheme at substations that do not have
   firm capacity. When a substation transformer fails or a bus fault occurs, only
   those distribution feeders that can be safely transferred to the remaining
   healthy bus or transformer would be restored to service.
•	 Reliability-centered maintenance. The substation IEDs are able to monitor and
   report information about the operating and maintenance status of key substa-
   tion equipment. By tracking parameters such as substation battery condition
   and circuit breaker contact wear and trip-cycle timing, the utility is able to
   identify incipient problems that may be corrected before a full-blown failure
   occurs.

Reduction of Electrical Losses
•	 SCADA “rule-based” volt/VAR optimization. Arguably the most common
   approach to VVO in use today is the SCADA “rule-based” approach. This
   approach determines what volt-VAR control actions to take by applying a
   predetermined set of logical “rules” to a set of real-time measurements from
   the associated substation and feeder. An example rule is: If the voltage mea-
   sured at point “X” is less than 120 volts AND the reactive power flow mea-
   sured at the substation end of the feeder is greater than 900 kVAR (lagging),
   then switch capacitor bank “1” to the ON position. These rules are deter-
   mined in advance by the distribution engineers and operators using power
   flow analysis. Figure 5.9 depicts a distribution SCADA, rule-based volt-VAR
   control system that might be included in grid modernization level 1.

   The SCADA rule-based approach is similar to the stand-alone controller
approach in that both approaches rely on intelligent controllers to interface with
the switched capacitor banks, voltage regulators, LTCs, and other volt/VAR con-
trol devices. The most significant difference between the SCADA rule-based
approach and the stand-alone controller approach is the addition of communica-
tion facilities that are typically part of a distribution supervisory control and data
acquisition (DSCADA) system. The communication facilities enable the system
to base its control actions on overall system conditions rather than just on local
conditions at the site of the capacitor bank or voltage regulator. The communica-
tion facilities also enable the electric distribution utility to monitor the operating
status of the field voltage control and VAR control equipment so that appropri-
ate actions can be taken immediately when a component failure occurs.

•	 On-line power flow. Substation IEDs are able to monitor and telemeter near
   real-time electrical parameters from the substation end of the feeder. These
   electrical parameters allow the deployment of an on-line power flow (OLPF)
   program that will improve the operator’s situational awareness. OLPF results
   can also be compared with customer billing records to assist in identifying
   technical and nontechnical electrical losses. An application commonly referred

                      tude and direction at the substation end of the distribution feeder would
                      enable the utility to detect reverse power flow conditions at the substation
                      end of the feeder. This may occur on distribution feeders that have a high
                      penetration of DERs, especially when these DERs are operating at maximum
                      capacity during light load conditions. Such reverse power flows can produce
                      unacceptable high-voltage conditions out on the feeder that must be prompt-

                   ization at electric distribution substations. Associated investment in substations
                   will enable an electric distribution utility to improve asset utilization, reliability,
                   efficiency, and overall performance while providing a foundation upon which to
                   build the more advanced levels of grid modernization. Table 5.1 summarizes the

      Level 2: Monitoring and Control of Feeder Devices
      For utilities that have automated some or all of their HV/MV substations (level 1
      grid modernization), the next evolutionary step in distribution grid moderniza-
      tion should be to implement remote monitoring and control of distribution
      power apparatus located out on the distribution feeders themselves (outside the
      substation fence). In this report, this is referred to as level 2 grid modernization.
         The level 2 grid modernization strategy includes the addition of remote moni-
      toring and automatic control facilities to existing line switches, capacitor banks,
      voltage regulators, and other utility-owned equipment (see figure 5.10). The
      remote monitoring and control facilities allow well-coordinated optimal control
      of the field devices to achieve overall distribution system needs (versus “local”
      needs). All power apparatus that are included in the level 2 grid modernization
      strategy must be “electrically operable,” that is, each device must be equipped
      with an operating mechanism that can be controlled via an electrical trip signal.
      Devices that can only be operated manually by field crews are not suitable for
      level 2 grid modernization. To be included in the level 2 strategy, manually oper-
      ated devices must be retrofit with an electrical operating mechanism or replaced
      with a device that is designed for remote control and fully automatic operation.
         The level 2 strategy also involves implementing intelligent sensors at many
      strategic locations on the feeder, such as main feeder branches, major equipment
      locations, points of connection for large customer-owned DERs, and feeder
      extremities. Intelligent sensors that are incorporated (embedded) in the electri-
      cally operable power apparatus and associated controllers should be used to the
      fullest extent possible. The level 2 grid modernization strategy may also include

the addition of separate stand-alone intelligent sensors, such as faulted circuit
indicators and end-of-line voltage meters.
    Level 2 also requires an extensive network to provide one- or two-way com-
munications to each intelligent device out on the feeder. Two-way communica-
tions are needed for power apparatus that require remote control and data acqui-
sition facilities. One-way communications are sufficient for sensors (such as
faulted circuit indicators) that only report data (no control needed). Since the end
devices mentioned above can be located anywhere in the distribution utility’s
service territory (including its furthest extremities), implementing the required
communication network is especially challenging. A wide variety of communica-
tion technologies are available for accomplishing these communication require-
ments. Technologies that may be used include licensed and unlicensed radio (only
used where permitted by telecommunication regulations), public telephone net-
works (including cellular networks), satellite radio (for extremely remote areas
only), optical fiber, and power line carrier. Note that power line carrier commu-
nication technologies may not be suitable for implementing FLISR, fault location,
and other applications that must perform reliably when line damage is present. In
most cases, the communication network for level 2 grid modernization will
involve a hybrid design of more than one communication technology. The com-
munication strategy should leverage the substation communication network to
the fullest extent possible; for example, a feeder device may communicate to the
distribution control center via the associated substation that is equipped with a
substation communication network (level 1 grid modernization).
    Because of the enormous technical and financial resources needed to auto-
mate all distribution feeders, the recommended practice is a phased approach
that automates a portion of the feeders each year. To obtain the maximum incre-
mental benefits for the initial investments, priority should be given to the worst-
performing feeders (feeders with poor reliability, high losses, and so on).

Level 2 Application Functions
Grid modernization application functions that can be accomplished with level 2
modernization (in addition to level 0 and level 1 benefits) include the following:

Reliability Improvement
•	 Fault location isolation and service restoration (FLISR). Level 2 grid moderniza-
   tion enables the utility to implement rapid service restoration for customers
   on healthy sections of the feeder without risking overloads of adjacent backup
   feeders and without exposing the substation and feeder equipment to addi-
   tional fault current during unsuccessful reclosures.
•	 Fault location. Telemetered fault detector and faulted circuit indicator outputs
   from strategic feeder locations allow the utility company to narrow down the
   possible fault location considerably. This reduces fault investigation and patrol
   time, and thereby overall outage duration. Figure 5.11 depicts the results of
   the predictive fault location program.

                                                                                Location

      •	 Improved intelligent bus failover. Further improvements can be made to the
         intelligent bus transfer scheme proposed for level 1 modernization. When a
         substation transformer fails or a bus fault occurs during heavy loading condi-
         tions, some feeders may be transferred (if necessary) to adjacent substations
         by closing normally open tie switches via remote control.

      Reduction of Electrical Losses
      •	 Coordinated volt/VAR control. Adding communication facilities and controller
         IEDs to the feeder voltage regulators and switched capacitor banks enables a
         true VVO system that provides fully coordinated operation of all volt and
         VAR control devices. This enables the utilities to achieve various operating
         objectives, including reduced electrical losses and lower demand. The level 2
         VVO system also allows the utility to minimize the quantity of voltage regu-
         lator tap positions, which in turn can lower maintenance costs and extend the
         lifetime of this equipment. The level 2 communication system also enables
         the utility to determine the operating status of voltage and VAR control
         devices, so the failures of such equipment can be detected and corrected as
         quickly as possible with requiring routine physical inspections by field crews.

      Efficiency Improvement
      •	 Conservation voltage reduction. End-of-line voltage monitoring sensors pro-
         vide feedback to the CVR application, thus enabling the utility to maximize
         voltage reduction and associated benefits without the risk of unacceptably
         low voltage.
      •	 Improved online power flow. Intelligent sensors added during level 2 modern-
         ization improve the accuracy of OLPF results. Improved accuracy enables the
         utility to operate the feeder with lower operating margins to improve loading,
         efficiency, and overall performance.

•	 Optimal network reconfiguration. The addition of remote-controlled line
   switches coupled with numerous new sensors for load and voltage measure-
   ment enable the utility to deploy optimal network reconfiguration (ONR) as
   part of its suite of grid modernization application functions. ONR identifies
   and executes feeder switching scenarios to achieve better load balance among
   adjacent feeders, which will lower total electrical losses. Figure 5.12 depicts
   the operation of ONR.

Integration of DERs
•	 Bidirectional voltage regulation. Level 2 grid modernization enables the utility
   to detect reverse power flow that occurs out on the feeder due to the pres-
   ence of a high penetration of distributed generating sources. This flow results
   in a voltage rise further from the main substation source of supply, which, in
   turn, can cause unacceptably high voltage. The use of remote-controlled, bidi-
   rectional voltage regulators (equipped with a “cogeneration” feature) helps
   the utility to address this situation and possibly enables a higher penetration
   of distributed generating resources on the feeder.
•	 Monitoring and transfer tripping of DG units. Level 2 grid modernization
   includes continuous near-real-time monitoring of DERs, which improves the
   accuracy of OLPF results and thus operator situational awareness. The avail-
   ability of feeder communications also allows the transfer tripping of larger
   DG units when feeder outages occur as part of an anti-islanding scheme.

Level 2 Summary
The level 2 activities expand the grid modernization investments made in level 1
from the substations to the feeders themselves (that is, to a portion of the feeders
outside the substation fence). Level 2 grid modernization enables the utility to
implement more advanced application functions such as volt/VAR control and

FLISR to improve efficiency and reliability. It also establishes an appropriate level
of continuous monitoring out on the feeders to support the advanced functions
that will be deployed in level 3 grid modernization to optimize the distribution
system performance. Table 5.2 summarizes grid modernization level 2 activities
and their qualitative costs, benefits, and associated risks.

Level 3: Active Control and Management of DERs and Demand Response
Level 3 is the highest level of distribution grid modernization that is envisioned
at this time. This includes all of the substation automation and feeder automation
strategies listed above, plus the addition of devices for active control and manage-
ment of DERs, such as energy storage units and static VAR resources. This com-
bination of new power apparatus technologies and advanced controllers enable
the distribution utility to address many of the adverse impacts associated with
DERs, such as the time-varying output of wind-powered and solar photovoltaic
(PV) units. This, in turn, enables the utility to accommodate additional DERs on
its distribution feeders. Figure 5.13 depicts level 3 grid modernization.
    The recommended strategy for level 3 grid modernization includes the addi-
tion of energy storage units either in the HV/MV substations or near the custom-
ers in the form of community energy storage (CES). The energy storage units
should include advanced controller IEDs that manage the charging and discharg-
ing strategy for the energy storage units based on local settings that can be over-
ridden via remote control by the distribution system operator. The energy storage

Practical Guidance for Defining a Smart Grid Modernization Strategy (Revised Edition)

      units can be used for many purposes that support the utility’s business drivers,
      including peak shaving on all or part of the distribution feeder, management of
      power fluctuations from renewable generating resources, and management of
      microgrid operations.
         Another controllable resource that is recommended for grid modernization
      level 3 is static VAR sources. These are able to inject or absorb reactive power
      from the feeder when needed to mitigate the impact of power and voltage fluc-
      tuations caused by DG units with varying output. For example, when the output
      of the solar PV units suddenly drops off due to cloud cover, the static VAR source
      can quickly inject VARs to prevent significant drop-off (or collapse) of distribu-
      tion feeder sources. It is technically possible to use conventional switched capaci-
      tor banks and voltage regulators to perform the necessary voltage adjustments or
      reactive power compensation. But conventional devices have several problems
      that limit their effectiveness in responding to such variations:

      •	 Switched capacitor banks and voltage regulators have time delays before per-
         forming the requested actions. By the time the capacitor bank or voltage regu-
         lator operates, customers may already be experiencing noticeable low voltage.
         Time-varying conditions may change soon thereafter, resulting in another
         time-delayed control action for the conventional devices.
      •	 The frequent operation of switched capacitor banks and voltage regulators
         increase maintenance requirements and reduce the expected lifetime of these
         devices.
      •	 Frequent capacitor bank switching introduces harmonics into the voltage
         waveform that could adversely impact customer-owned equipment.

         The recommended static VAR sources are able to respond rapidly to inject (or
      absorb) precise amounts of reactive power to address power and voltage fluctua-
      tions caused by renewables. These devices do not cause waveform distortion
      (harmonics) and are capable of performing many more operations than conven-
      tional devices, making them ideally suited to level 3 grid modernization.
         Level 3 grid modernization should also include the deployment of “smart” AC
      inverters on customer-owned DERs, such as solar PV units. These smart inverters
      are able to operate using a wide variety of operating characteristics that enable
      the customer-owned equipment to respond rapidly to changing feeder require-
      ments. For example, the volt/VAR smart inverter will supply or absorb VARs
      automatically based on the changing voltage level.

      Level 3 Application Functions
      Grid modernization application functions that can be accomplished with level 3
      modernization (providing benefits in addition to those from levels 0, 1, and 2)
      include the following.

Reliability Improvement
•	 Microgrid operation. Energy storage and other fast-acting voltage and frequency
   control systems, coupled with distributed generating sources, enable
   “microgrid” operation. This allows (healthy) portions of the distribution sys-
   tem that have become disconnected from the power grid to be reenergized
   and operated as self-contained islands until the normal grid connection is
   restored. The advanced controls that are implemented as part of level 3 grid
   modernization will be responsible for balancing energy storage and generating
   resources with existing load, and for maintaining the proper voltage and fre-
   quency at all times while in the microgrid mode of operation.
•	 Energy storage-enhanced FLISR. Conventional FLISR service restoration oper-
   ations are often blocked due to lack of available capacity on backup alterna-
   tive sources. With energy storage-enhanced FLISR, the system automatically
   switches available energy storage units to discharge mode to lower the amount
   of load that needs to be transferred or to raise the available capacity of backup
   sources. This enables load transfers for service restoration to be performed
   that would otherwise be prevented due to loading constraints.

Efficiency Improvement
•	 Enhanced volt/VAR control and optimization. Distributed static VAR resources
   enable the distribution utility to supply (or absorb) the precise amounts of
   reactive needed at each feeder location. This will enable the utility to operate
   at close to near unity power factor at all times. This reduces electrical losses
   and improves overall efficiency. In addition, intelligent dispatch of DERs
   enables optimal power flows that further improve efficiency.

Integration of DERs
•	 Management of power and voltage fluctuations (dynamic voltage control). The
   maximum amount of distributed generation that can be deployed on a given
   distribution feeder is often limited by the potential drop-off in voltage if the
   DER output suddenly drops off along the feeder. Advanced control of energy
   storage units and static VAR sources will mitigate the impact of DER power
   fluctuations and thereby enable the utility to accommodate more distributed
   generating resources on any given feeder. In addition, DERs can be actively
   controlled by the utility to improve voltage regulation, improve VAR support,
   and (in the future) support microgrid island operation to improve reliability
   during widespread power outages.

Level 3 Summary
Level 3 builds upon level 1 and level 2 investments to integrate distributed
energy resources and enterprise-level application functions into the grid modern-
ization strategy. Table 5.3 summarizes level 3 activities, costs, benefits, and risks.

      Grid Modernization Risks
      There are significant risks associated with deploying any new technology. Major
      risks associated with grid modernization are summarized below, along with sug-
      gested mitigation strategies for each risk.

      Learning Curve for Field Personnel
      System operators who are experienced in working with mostly manual paper-
      driven business processes may have difficulty adapting to an electronic computer-
      assisted decision support system with a considerable amount of automation.
      There is a risk that operators will not be very effective and efficient in using the
      new system.
         The following actions are recommended for mitigating this risk:

      •	 Involve the operators in all aspects of the planning and design phases of each
         application function. This will ensure that each application is designed with
         the operators’ needs in mind, which, in turn, will improve acceptance and
         buy-in from system operators.
      •	 Provide a comprehensive training program for all operators well in advance of
         system commissioning. This training program should provide details about
         how each application works under normal and failure mode conditions.
         Operators should fully understand how to recognize when something is
         wrong and what to do about it.
      •	 Utilize a “train-the-trainer” approach in which most of the training is con-
         ducted by senior operating staff. This will ensure that the training is presented
         from an operator’s perspective.
      •	 Implement a training simulator to provide each operator with a realistic train-
         ing environment that does not impact the actual live power system operations.
      •	 For fully automated applications, start with a period of semi-automatic
         (supervised) operation in which the operator must approve all control actions.
         Then gradually transition to fully automatic operation with no manual inter-
         vention as the operator’s comfort level grows.

      Information Overload
      Substation IEDs are able to supply a wealth of new information pertaining to the
      loading, performance, and operating status of each distribution asset. There is a
      strong risk of providing too much information for distribution system operators
      to digest. As a result, the operators may elect to ignore information. In the worst
      case, operators may be confused by the new data and make incorrect operating
      decisions based on their assessment of the available information.
         The following actions are recommended for mitigating this risk:

      •	 Only provide information that is “actionable.” If no operator response is needed
         following receipt of a piece of information, then the information is most likely

•	 Avoid supplying multiple messages that provide the same information. Often
   distribution SCADA systems will supply several messages that contain the
   same data. Only the first message is valuable—the second message is a nui-
   sance and contributes to information overload.

Risk of Cyber Attack (“Hacking”)
Several grid modernization applications include communication facilities that
enable remote monitoring and control of power apparatus in the distribution
substations. Any time communications are introduced, there is increased risk of
a cyber-security breach that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive data
and control facilities. Unauthorized access to these facilities could disrupt the
power supply to end-use customers, damage expensive energized high-voltage
power apparatus, and pose a serious safety hazard for the field workforce.
   The following actions are recommended to mitigate this risk:

•	 Develop a security plan early on (not as an afterthought) that will protect
   remote monitoring and control facilities from unauthorized access.
•	 Provide suitable physical access controls to buildings and control rooms that
   house consoles and other equipment that could be used to control the power
   apparatus.
•	 Apply encryption and other suitable security measures as needed.
•	 Prudently apply security measures required for critical infrastructure
   protection.
•	 Provide suitable training to inform all system users about the risks associated
   with a breach of security along with practices to protect sensitive information
   such as passwords.

Immature Technology
Some advanced software applications associated with grid modernization, such
as model-driven volt/VAR optimization, are not yet proven by several years of
successful operation in the field. As a result, there is considerable risk that some
features may not operate correctly under all circumstances and/or that the soft-
ware may stop running altogether (“crash”) during live operation.
   The following actions are recommended to mitigate this risk:

•	 Avoid implementing applications that are not fully developed and proven by
   many years of successful operation in the field. In fact, all applications that
   require a significant amount of development effort should be carefully scruti-
   nized and tested or avoided altogether if possible.
•	 Conduct extensive testing of each application to verify that the software is
   ready for deployment. Testing should exercise all capabilities of each applica-
   tion function, including operation in the presence of bad data.
•	 Prior to placing the advanced software into operation, conduct a lengthy
   period of supervised operation in which all control actions identified by the

        software must be approved and manually executed by the operator. This will
        ensure that any failures encountered do not disrupt ongoing operations. This
        supervised method will also provide an excellent training opportunity for the
        application.


      Summary of Grid Modernization Projects
      Tables 5.4 through 5.7 summarize the grid modernization projects that are pos-
      sible at each grid modernization level. The information provided for each project
      includes an indicator of the general types of benefits the project provides
      (improved efficiency, reduced demand, improved reliability, the accommodation
      of additional DG, and others), along with a cost estimate range for project imple-
      mentation and a monetary estimate of the range of benefits that may be achieved.
      All monetary benefits are expressed in U.S. dollars.


      Defining a Smart Grid Investment Plan
      The previous sections outlined four smart grid modernization levels relevant to
      the distribution sector. Each level is characterized by the incremental use of more
      advanced applications to progress toward grid objectives such as improved effi-
      ciency, reduced losses, improved reliability, and the integration of renewable
      energy resources. Utilities may use the descriptions of the four modernization
      levels to assess where they are in the process and to identify potential new smart
      grid applications that could help modernize their grid and achieve strategic
      objectives.
          There are many smart grid applications that a utility can choose to promote
      its modernization level. A utility needs to clearly assess the cost, benefits, and
      potential risks of implementing new applications to define a sensible investment
      plan. This section provides guidance on creating such an investment plan to
      include the specific list of projects to be implemented, their cost, and time
      frames for their implementation. Creating an investment plan is key to ensuring
      that the overall budgeting process considers the needs of modernization.
          The broad steps toward defining the investment plan are described in the fol-
      lowing subsections. Figure 5.14 illustrates the steps in a flowchart format.

104	                      Defining a Distribution-Level Grid Modernization Strategy and Investment Plan



       Step 1. Identify Business Requirements
       There is no single investment strategy for grid modernization that applies to
       all electric distribution utilities (that is, no “one size fits all”). This is because
       pressing operating needs and challenges differ from utility to utility, due to
       differences in customer expectations, regulatory climate, geographic con-
       straints, available labor and financial resources, economic conditions, and other
       such factors that are relevant to distribution grid modernization. The identifica-
       tion of business requirements must address the issues facing the electric distri-
       bution utility on a day-to-day basis as well as the unique challenges posed by
       emergencies, such as widespread storms and natural disasters. An effective grid
       modernization investment strategy will address the issues and challenges faced
       by a specific utility.
          The first step toward creating a grid modernization investment strategy is to
       develop a thorough understanding of the key business requirements that apply
       to the electric utility in the short term (the next three to five years) and the long
       term (beyond a five-year horizon). This will provide a foundation upon which
       the specific functional and technical requirements of distribution grid modern-
       ization may be based.
          While business requirements vary from utility to utility, common objectives
       include the following:

       •	 Improve efficiency—specifically, to satisfy a given amount of electrical load
          using less electrical energy. Efficiency programs for electric distribution utili-
          ties are usually focused on reducing losses (technical and nontechnical) and
          lowering overall energy consumption without actually shedding any load.
       •	 Reduce demand, with a focus on mechanisms to lower the electrical power
          requirements during peak loading intervals, when electrical demand is often
          considerably higher than the average demand. This is an especially important
          business requirement, because the power generation and delivery infrastruc-
          ture must be able to serve this load even though the peak demand may last
          for a only small portion of the day.
       •	 Improve reliability, with a focus on the frequency and duration of power out-
          ages on the electric distribution system. Since most service disruptions on the
          electric distribution system result in power outages for one or more custom-
          ers, this requirement is tied closely with overall customer satisfaction. Estab-
          lishing microgrids to serve critical loads during widespread power outages is
          becoming a key element of the grid modernization strategy of many electric
          utilities.
       •	 Accommodate distributed generation. In an effort to reduce emissions from
          fossil-fuel-fired central generating units, many jurisdictions are seeking to
          deploy clean energy-generating resources (solar, wind, and so on) on their
          electric distribution systems. Such “renewable” generating resources may
          produce abnormal electrical conditions on the distribution feeders (for
          example, reverse power flows, voltage fluctuations) that usually limit the

   amount of such generation that may be implemented. Hence, a growing
   number of electric distribution utilities are deploying grid modernization
   measures to allow increased amounts of DG without adversely impacting
   power quality.

   Other business requirements that may be addressed by distribution grid mod-
ernization include safety, security, workforce productivity and training, and dis-
tribution asset management and utilization.
   Understanding the key business requirements should begin by interviewing the
persons who “own” the problems: the electric utility executives. These senior-level
managers will furnish information on the most important business problems that
are facing the utility company as well as a vision for future long-term needs. In
addition to management perspectives, the needs of persons who are responsible
for planning, designing, constructing, maintaining, and operating the electric dis-
tribution system must also be well understood. To this end, interviews should
include representatives of the departments that are responsible for performing
these duties.

Step 2. Identify the Current Level of Grid Modernization
The grid modernization strategy should leverage the electric distribution utility’s
existing assets to the fullest extent possible. This will help ensure that the mod-
ernization plan is practical and possible using available resources. Therefore, gain-
ing a thorough understanding of where the organization is today is an important
first step toward grid modernization.
    It should be noted that the level of grid modernization may vary at different
locations across an organization’s service territory. For example, there may be
“pockets of automation” where some grid modernization technologies have been
demonstrated (that is, pilot projects), and newer technologies installed in only a
small portion of existing facilities. The overall strategy should not be based on the
assets of only a small number of substations and feeders, but rather on the facili-
ties and operating practices that exist across a majority of substations and distri-
bution feeders.
    The following is a list of guidelines that may be used to determine the current
level of automation.
    The grid is at level 0 (manual control or local automation) if the following
conditions apply to a majority of substations and feeders:

•	 The majority of substations are staffed on a routine basis by operating person-
   nel who monitor the status of power apparatus and operate the equipment
   manually when necessary (this does not include personnel stationed only dur-
   ing construction and maintenance activities or during local emergencies).
•	 Some automatic control devices (line reclosers, capacitor bank controllers,
   voltage regulators, and so on) may be found on electric distribution feeders,
   but their control decisions are based solely on local measurements.

106	                      Defining a Distribution-Level Grid Modernization Strategy and Investment Plan


       •	 There are no permanent data communication facilities between power appa-
          ratus and supporting facilities or substations/feeders and the control centers
          associated with these facilities. Voice-only communications may exist.
       •	 The majority of protective relays and local controllers are electromechanical
          or solid-state electronic devices (not IEDs) and are not connected to any com-
          munication facilities (including dial-up facilities).

          The grid is at level 1 (substation communication and automation) if the fol-
       lowing conditions apply to a majority of substations and feeders:

       •	 Most of the protective relays, controllers, meters, and other instruments that
          are currently installed in distribution substations (HV/MV) are IEDs.
       •	 Most HV/MV substations include communication facilities and remote ter-
          minal units (RTUs or equivalent devices) that support remote monitoring and
          control of the substation power apparatus.
       •	 Most HV/MV substations are not permanently staffed for routine operational
          purposes.
       •	 Some automatic control devices (line reclosers, capacitor bank controllers,
          voltage regulators, and so on) may be found on electric distribution feeders,
          but their control decisions are based solely on local measurements.
       •	 No facilities exist for communicating with feeder devices.

          The grid is at level 2 (monitoring and control of feeder devices) if the follow-
       ing conditions apply to a majority of substations and feeders:

       •	 Most of the protective relays, controllers, meters, and other instruments that
          are currently installed in distribution substations (HV/MV) are IEDs.
       •	 Most HV/MV substations include communication facilities and RTUs (or
          equivalent devices) that support remote monitoring and control of the sub-
          station power apparatus.
       •	 Most HV/MV substations are not permanently staffed for routine operational
          purposes.
       •	 Some automatic control devices (line reclosers, capacitor bank controllers,
          voltage regulators, and so on) exist out on the electric distribution feeders.
       •	 Some facilities exist for handling two-way data communications between
          feeder devices and the associated control center. These facilities may be used
          for remote monitoring and control of feeder devices.

         The grid is at level 3 (active DER control/demand response) if the following
       conditions apply to a majority of substations and feeders:

       •	 All of the conditions specified for grid modernization level 2 apply.
       •	 Some distributed generating units (utility owned or customer owned) are
          equipped with remote monitoring and control facilities that may be used

   to manage the output of the DG unit from a utility-operated control
   center.
•	 Some noncritical loads at customer premises (programmable thermostats, hot
   water heaters, and so on) may be controlled. Most of the protective relays,
   controllers, meters, and other instruments that are currently installed in distri-
   bution substations (HV/MV) are IEDs.

Step 3. Generate a List of Potential Projects
In this step, the organization should develop a list of potential (candidate) grid
modernization applications that appear to have technical merit in addressing the
organization’s needs and strategic goals. Such applications should be analyzed
further to determine if their expected benefits outweigh the costs required to
implement and sustain them.
   Tables 5.4 through 5.7 list specific projects that can be accomplished at each
level of grid modernization. For example, table 5.4 lists recommended projects
for grid modernization level 0 (manual control and local automation), including
projects that can provide valuable business benefits without additional commu-
nication facilities or other major infrastructure improvements. Project 0.2 imple-
ments a basic form of VVO (CVR) using existing stand-alone controllers, for
example, while project 0.5 involves a transition from level 0 to level 1 (substation
communications and automation).
   Table 5.5, focused on level 1, lists projects using IEDs and SCADA facilities
for substation monitoring and control. The 10 recommended projects offer
numerous ways to exploit the information supplied by the latest generation of
substation IEDs, and one project involves transitioning to level 2 (monitoring and
control of feeder devices). Several projects can be accomplished for almost no
incremental cost, such as project 1.5, which involves using IED data to imple-
ment a reliability-centered maintenance program.
   Similarly, tables 5.6 and 5.7 list project lists for electric utilities that are cur-
rently at grid modernization level 2 and level 3 (active DER control and demand
response).
   In each table, a brief project description is followed by general types of func-
tional benefits (that align with the strategic goals of planning step 1). The table
column under the benefit is shaded if the project makes a significant contribu-
tion to the electric distribution network’s aim to:

•	 Improve efficiency by, for example, reducing electrical losses and/or lowering
   energy consumption for a given load or amount of work.
•	 Reduce demand by, for example, executing demand response events, running
   distributed generators, and lowering the voltage or reducing losses during
   peak load conditions.
•	 Improve reliability by reducing the average frequency or duration of outages
   experienced by end-use customers. This can be accomplished by pinpointing
   fault location (and thus shortening investigation time), performing automatic

          sectionalizing and service restoration, and operating in island mode as a
          “microgrid” when major widespread outages occur.
       •	 Integrate renewables by managing voltage problems caused by reverse power
          flows and voltage fluctuations that are attributable to distributed renewables.
       •	 Other benefits, including deferring capital expenditures for capacity addi-
          tions, reducing maintenance costs for expensive substation equipment, and
          labor savings.

       Step 4. Undertake a Cost/Benefit Analysis
       Once potential grid modernization applications have been identified, it is neces-
       sary to determine if the cost to implement each application and the associated
       risks are outweighed by the expected benefits over the life of the investment
       (10–15 years). As part of this step, the organization should perform a cost/benefit
       analysis and risk assessment of potential grid modernization applications, then
       develop a list of applications recommended for implementation.
          Tables 5.4 through 5.7 provide ranges of specific benefits and costs for each
       proposed project. The cost figures are expressed in units of U.S. dollars per dis-
       tribution feeder. The benefit range indicates the cost range per feeder on an
       annual basis over the life of the project.
          The following methods were used to convert functional benefits into mone-
       tary terms:

       •	 Reliability improvement benefits were converted into monetary benefits
          using an assumed customer cost of outage (for example, US$10 per kilowatt-
          hour, kWh).
       •	 Efficiency improvements were converted to dollar amounts using an assumed
          marginal location pricing (for example, US$50 per megawatt-hour, MWh).
       •	 Demand reduction benefits were converted to dollar amounts using the aver-
          age cost to add new centralized generation units to serve that demand level
          (for example, US$50,000 per megawatt of new capacity).
       •	 Benefits that allow the utility to accommodate renewables were monetized
          using the capacity cost of centralized generation displaced by the distributed
          renewable (for example, US$50,000 per megawatt).

       Step 5. Create an Investment Plan
       The final step is to create an investment plan for the recommended applications—
       using limited organizational resources (including labor and financial resources) in
       an optimal manner, to achieve maximum payback on investment as quickly as
       possible, with minimum risk. In almost all cases, a phased implementation strat-
       egy is best. Projects that promise the greatest benefits should be completed at the
       earliest possible date. Also, “foundational” (enabling) elements (communication
       facilities, controllable devices, and so on) should be put in place to serve the
       needs of the application functions to be implemented during later phases.

Modernizing the Grid: Gradual Transitions versus Leapfrogging
The previous section describes how an electric utility may gradually progress to
a higher grid modernization level. Most utilities in developed countries have fol-
lowed this gradual progression by implementing the best available technologies
at any given time. But it is not necessary for a utility that is currently using elec-
tromechanical technology from the 1970s or earlier to gradually modernize by
first installing 1980–90 technology (solid-state devices), and then replace these
units at some later date with 21st-century IEDs. Utilities in developing countries
that have not completely built out their electric system may elect to bypass some
of the traditional modernization steps through a process called “leapfrogging,”
which is described in the following subsections.

A Gradual Transition to Smarter Grids: Developed Countries
Many electric utility companies (especially those in developed countries) have
been delivering electric power to residential, commercial, and industrial custom-
ers for decades. In most of these cases, utility companies started out by supplying
electric power to customers in the most densely populated areas of their service
territory: the cities and surrounding suburban areas. The electric power infra-
structure for these electric utilities has evolved significantly over the years to
meet the growing expectations of their consumers. Energy consumption has risen
dramatically over the years due to the almost universal acceptance of electrical
appliances; an increase in the use of central heating, ventilation, and air condi-
tioning (HVAC) among residential customers; and new types of loads including
(most recently) electric vehicles. In addition to growing to meet new energy
demand, the power delivery infrastructure has been expanded geographically out
from urban areas to all but the most remote rural locations.
   Electric utilities have met the growth of electricity consumption by increasing
the capacity of the existing power delivery infrastructure and by adding new
substations and extending transmission and distribution lines to reach new cus-
tomers in rural areas far from the metropolitan load centers. In most cases, this
transition has taken place gradually over several decades, and has been supported
by government agencies such as the U.S. Rural Electrification Administration.
   As new substations and feeders were built, the electric utilities used the best
available technologies at the time. Distribution substations and feeders that were
constructed in the 1970s and earlier used mostly electromechanical devices for
protective relays, meters, and controllers because that was the only technology
available at the time that was field proven and accepted by somewhat conserva-
tive electric utilities. Few if any distribution substations were equipped with
SCADA and communication facilities, because these technologies were expen-
sive at the time and deemed unnecessary for distribution systems.
   As new communication and control technologies were developed and became
widely accepted, electric utilities began to deploy these technologies in new

       substations and in existing substations during capacity expansion projects. And
       when the older-style electromechanical relays failed, these devices were often
       replaced by the latest technology components, including microprocessor-based
       IEDs. In the past five to ten years, major technology advances have occurred in
       communication systems, thus making it cost-effective to deploy remote monitor-
       ing and control facilities for substation equipment and devices located out on the
       feeders themselves.
          Since growth patterns for electric utility companies have not been uniform
       across developed countries, some utilities have not progressed beyond the early
       days of electromechanical components and have little or no remote management
       capabilities. But it is expected that when older-style components need replacing,
       they will be replaced with the latest technology IEDs, thus “leapfrogging” the
       natural technology-driven progression to modern devices.

       The Case of Developing Countries
       Electric utilities in developing countries generally do not have the same decades-
       long history of growth and geographic expansion. Many electric distribution
       utilities continue to rely on electromechanical components that were installed
       many years ago. Most organizations rely exclusively on manual, paper-driven
       business processes with almost no automation or remote monitoring and control
       capabilities. In addition, the electric power delivery infrastructure has not been
       sufficiently built out to provide reliable continuous electricity supply to com-
       munities that are far from major cities.
          While this document has presented a strategy for progressing gradually from
       manual business processes (level 0) to increased levels of grid modernization
       (levels 1 to 3), it is unnecessary to proceed one step at a time to the next-highest
       level. In fact, it is possible to “leapfrog” several levels and go directly from grid
       modernization level 0 to level 2 or 3. This is comparable to transitioning from
       having no telephones to implementing cellular telephone technology without
       going through the tradition steps of building out the infrastructure needed to
       support a wired telephone system.
          As an example, it is possible for a utility company that is generally at grid
       modernization level 0 or level 1 to implement a microgrid/demand response
       system, which is identified in this report as a grid modernization level 3 project.
       Most electric utilities in developed countries view the microgrid as a mechanism
       to supply critical customers when the existing power delivery infrastructure
       experiences massive damage. For utilities in developing countries, meanwhile,
       microgrids can be viewed as an effective mechanism to supply power to isolated
       communities that do not have reliable continuous electricity supply. As in the
       case of cellular phones, the microgrid example allows utilities to “leapfrog” the
       traditional step of building a wired power delivery infrastructure. The level 3
       microgrid project will use advanced metering, demand response, and available
       communication facilities (such as the Internet), all of which are level 2 projects,
       to accomplish the microgrid objectives.

Defining a Distribution-Level Grid Modernization Strategy and Investment Plan	             111



   There are other steps that a utility at grid modernization level 0 or 1 can take
to facilitate an eventual transition to higher levels of grid modernization:

•	 If a manual feeder line switch needs to be installed or replaced, install an
   electrically operable switch that can later be retrofit with a communication
   interface to accomplish level 2 projects such as FLISR.
•	 Electromechanical substation protective relays that fail should be replaced
   with a functionally equivalent IED that will be able to support future applica-
   tions at levels 1, 2, and 3.
•	 Advanced metering facilities should support two-way communications, thus
   enabling the future addition of DR capabilities.
•	 Communication facilities that are installed to support new metering systems
   should be designed to also support communication with distribution automa-
   tion devices (line switches, voltage regulators, capacitor banks, and distributed
   generating units) using standard interfaces (for example, IPV6). This will ease
   the implementation of FLISR, VVO, and other level 2 and 3 projects.
•	 Inverter-based distributed generating units (for example, rooftop solar panels)
   should be equipped with smart inverters that may be used to support a wide
   range of advanced projects, such as microgrid management, DER-enhanced
   FLISR, and DER-enhanced VVO.

More on Leapfrogging
Analyzing the grid modernization levels helps clarify a logical path to imple-
menting grid modernization, beginning with substation modernization (level 1),
followed by modernization of the distribution feeders (level 2), and finally the
addition of advanced application functions (level 3).
    As noted in the previous subsection, it is not necessary to implement the entire
set of level 1 grid modernization activities before proceeding with level 2 mod-
ernization. In fact, a very effective strategy is to move forward with some level 2
activities following the partial completion of level 1 activities. For example, it is
possible to proceed with SCADA rule-based volt/VAR optimization (a level 2
activity) following the implementation of feeder protective relay IEDs (one of the
numerous level 1 activities). This will enable the utility to derive some of the
lucrative level 2 benefits, such as electrical loss reduction, before fully completing
all of the level 1 activities. Similarly, it is possible to implement one or more of the
level 3 activities prior to completing level 1 and level 2. Level 3 functions such as
switch order management (SOM) may be implemented before sensors, control-
lers, and automated switches are added as part of levels 1 and 2.
    A regional implementation strategy may also vary the modernization activities
implemented across a utility’s total service area, customizing them to meet vari-
ous needs. One example of this approach is to invest heavily in the worst-
performing service areas in order to improve their efficiency and reliability. In
this case, the worst-performing areas may rapidly advance to grid modernization
level 3 to gain the maximum benefit for the grid modernization investment.

Regulatory and Financing Issues




Fully realizing the benefits of grid modernization does not depend strictly on
technology applications. Technology applications require enabling environments
for their deployment—and the assurance, among other things, that (i) companies
have the incentive to pursue technologies that improve grid performance, (ii) the
technologies introduced comply or surpass technical requirements for their per-
formance on the grid, and (iii) vendors are neutral, and different technologies can
communicate with one another, allowing network modernization to progress and
not stall.
   Regulatory aspects will be more or less important depending on the current
level of grid modernization and the technology applications that are being pur-
sued. Deploying one smart grid vision may require completely different regula-
tions than another vision. For example, deploying certain technologies (such as
for storage) may require new add-ons to current regulatory arrangements so that
storage providers understand the market or cost-recovery mechanisms that will
make their business proposition valuable. Similarly, a grid that should enable vast
amounts of PV requires defining clear performance requirements for such tech-
nologies to achieve the common goals of maintaining grid reliability and service
quality.
   This chapter does not intend to be a comprehensive review of all regulatory
aspects related to smart grid deployment, but provides some suggestions that
should help identify when special requirements may be needed, and provides
further references.


Cost Recovery and Funding
Funding grid modernization projects, programs, road maps, and plans requires
careful consideration of the regulatory aspects related to recovering investments.
Grid modernization should be an integral part of the capital expenditure pro-
gram of utilities. Technologies that have been proven and largely tested in other

       places and whose risk of deploying somewhere else are low should be part of
       conventional investment plans and the cost-recovery base. Since a key function
       of the regulatory process is to make sure investments are efficient, regulators
       should always question whether the utility is making enough effort to identify
       modernization possibilities that can clearly benefit consumers. Cost-efficiency
       principles should not be applied in narrow ways that seek to immediately reduce
       capital costs; instead, the long-term benefits of modernization should be
       considered.
          The cost of service regulations should include the cost of proven, lower-risk
       smart grid technologies as part of utilities’ regular capital expenditure programs.
          Not all smart grid applications should require special regulatory treatment
       from the cost-recovery point of view. The modernization costs of basic (proven)
       technologies should be part of utilities’ capital expenditure programs and, with
       that, the costs of deployment may be transferred to tariffs. This is especially true
       for those modernization activities that include applications largely tested in other
       markets and for which the costs and benefits are robust and the risks are rather
       limited. For example, reducing losses may require the introduction of automated
       capacitors. This technology has been largely tested, and while it may not be in
       use in a country, it has easily verifiable and robust benefits beyond its costs.
          As discussed in previous chapters, not all utilities start at the same moderniza-
       tion level. A first step toward modernization might, for example, focus on inte-
       grating technologies that are well tested in various environments. Thus, recoup-
       ing costs would not require any special regulatory process beyond widely avail-
       able cost-recovery models.
          More advanced, less tested, or larger smart grid deployments require careful
       attention from the regulatory and funding perspective.
          Investments in smart grid programs can involve thousands of high-voltage
       components (voltage regulators, switchgear, capacitor banks, and so on) and pos-
       sibly millions of secondary devices (meters, controllers, protective devices, sen-
       sors, and so on). In addition, they may involve new technologies and regulations
       (for example, real-time pricing via smart metering programs) that have not been
       tested or piloted and whose risks of not achieving expected benefits may be high.
       Some smart grid deployment may therefore require special regulatory treatment
       to ensure costs are rightly allocated. Untested technologies or innovations may
       require special funding vehicles such as government grants.
          Programs that involve large reductions in the demand served by utilities,
       meanwhile, may require special regulatory treatment to ensure service providers
       remain viable despite decreasing energy sales. Highly advanced levels of modern-
       ization or more ambitious smart grid visions may require an alternative regula-
       tory framework. A number of cost-recovery and performance incentive programs
       may be needed to ensure utilities have the incentive to apply new technologies
       that will lead to lower energy sales. The National Action Plan for Energy Effi-
       ciency lists several mechanisms that go beyond traditional cost-recovery options:

•	 Performance incentives. Providing financial incentives to a utility to perform
   well in delivering energy efficiency can change the business model by making
   efficiency profitable rather than merely a break-even activity. The three major
   common types of performance incentives center on:
•	 Performance targets. A percentage of the total program budget is set aside to
   reward the achievement of specific metrics (percentage of losses, average out-
   age duration, and so on) of the smart grid program.
•	 Shared savings. Utilities are given the opportunity to share, with rate payers,
   the net benefits resulting from successful implementation of energy efficiency
   programs.
•	 Lost margin recovery. This mechanism is designed to estimate the revenue
   margin that might be lost due to a successful energy-efficiency program, and
   compensate utilities for any resulting reduction in sales. But the incentive
   does not change the linkage between sales and profit.


Smart Grid Standards and Interoperability
The electric grid includes many high- and medium-voltage devices and associ-
ated protection and control equipment that are expected to maintain acceptable
electrical conditions throughout the distribution system during periods of normal
and emergency operation. In the past, this fundamental operating goal could be
achieved effectively using stand-alone protection and control devices that were
able to determine and initiate appropriate responses to load changes and electri-
cal disturbances using “local” measurements made at the device itself. Coordina-
tion between these devices was achieved through time delays and other such
measures that did not require physical integration of individual components.
   Today, electric distribution utilities are seeking to satisfy the more stringent
needs of electricity consumers and to maintain optimal electrical conditions at all
times. Achieving these objectives in today’s operating environment is far more
challenging due to the growing presence of distributed generators powered by
variable renewable energy sources (especially solar PV and wind power sources).
Achieving optimal performance in this environment requires a level of perfor-
mance that can only be achieved through fully coordinated operation of intelli-
gent and flexible protection and control devices that are able to adapt to meet
continuously varying system-level conditions and varying operating objectives. A
new generation of communicating sensors and control devices is needed to satisfy
the needs of today’s smart grid, along with a reliable, robust, and secure com-
munications infrastructure that allows this new class of protection and control
devices to exchange information and “interoperate.”
   Interoperability1—the ability of diverse systems and their components, sup-
plied by a plethora of manufacturers, to work together—is vitally important to
the performance of the smart grid at every level. It enables integration, effective
cooperation, and two-way communication among the many interconnected

       elements of the electric power grid. To achieve effective interoperability, a unify-
       ing framework of interfaces, protocols, and other consensus standards is needed.
           The deployment of various smart grid elements—including smart sensors on
       distribution lines, smart meters in homes, and widely dispersed sources of renew-
       able energy—is already under way and will be accelerated as a growing number
       of electric utilities worldwide proceeds to implement their smart grid strategy.
       Without standards, there is the potential for technologies to interoperate poorly in a
       multivendor environment, to become obsolete prematurely, and to be implemented
       without measures necessary to ensure security. To meet this need, international stan-
       dards bodies, including the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology
       (NIST), are coordinating the development of a framework that includes proto-
       cols and model standards for information management to achieve the interoperability
       of smart grid devices and systems.
           Standards have been part of the historical development of technology in the
       electricity sector. In many cases, existing standards will suffice to deploy many
       applications that are already well proven, but may not be in use in all countries,
       given their modernization level. For example, there are numerous protocols and stan-
       dards that have been used very effectively in SCADA systems that require integra-
       tion and interoperability among a wide variety of protective relays, intelligent control-
       lers, and communicating sensors associated with electric distribution transformers,
       switches, and other conventional power apparatus. Examples include DNP3 (IEC
       61850-5) and the IEC 61850 set of standards. The ANSI C12.19/IEEE 1377/
       MC12.19 standards and data models are becoming widely accepted for use with
       advanced metering systems, which are a great tool to protect the revenue of utilities
       and to incentivize demand response.
           In other cases, however, new standards must be developed for the new interactions
       made possible by the smart grid. For example, important smart grid interoper-
       ability standards that are still under development include the following:

       •	 Demand response. OpenADR is going through the Smart Grid Interoperabil-
          ity Panel (SGIP) process, with the expected outcome that the two defined
          profiles of OpenADR 2.0 will be entered into the SGIP Catalog of Standards.
          In parallel, the OpenADR Alliance is working with the International Electro-
          technical Commission (IEC) with a mutual objective to develop an interna-
          tional automated DR standard.
       •	 Smart inverters. To achieve the kind of advanced grid functionality required to
          accommodate higher levels of solar energy, smart inverters will need to
          include a range of automated control capabilities that will help smooth out
          potential grid fluctuations. Various industry stakeholders are currently
          involved in the development of the necessary international standards and
          regulatory compliance testing protocols that will help ensure the transition to
          an advanced, stable grid.
       •	 Electric vehicle charging standards. As more and more EVs enter the fleet, and
          annual sales continue to increase, the question of charging—and charging

   protocols—becomes ever more critical. While we are still in the early days of
   the EV adoption cycle, it is important to sort this out. At the end of the day,
   EV mobility will depend upon the build-out of a network of charging stations.
   Drivers will want to be able to charge at home, but to overcome range anxiety
   they will want to charge on the road as well—quickly and conveniently.
•	 Communication standards. Interoperability in most smart grid networks is
   achieved in the upper layers of the protocol stack. IEC 60870-5-101/104 and
   DNP3 are the most commonly used SCADA protocols used to implement
   distribution SCADA and automation applications. IEC 61850 is also begin-
   ning to see limited use in DA systems and more profound use in high-voltage
   applications, especially outside the United States.
•	 Internet Protocol (IP). Networks are used extensively in modern DA networks
   to provide end-to-end connectivity from devices in the field to back-office
   systems. IP can carry a variety of protocols yet allow the utility build a single
   network. This eliminates the need for complex or proprietary protocol gate-
   ways, allows the network designer a great deal of flexibility, and is popular
   since IP is widely accepted and understood. Furthermore, DA protocols can
   continue to evolve over time, but the supporting network does not need to be
   replaced as long as IP continues to be the bearer service. But while IPv6 has
   made significant inroads into the AMI application space, many smart grid
   devices are still largely the domain of IPv4.

   There are hundreds of standards; when analyzing potential applications, it is
important to understand if the particular technology will lock in future develop-
ments. Researching which standards may be available to help ensure applications
deliver their full benefits is a critical step. There are standards that apply for the
generation segment, the distribution segment, and system operations across dif-
ferent consumption areas. The sources available, such as the Smart Grid Stan-
dards Map from the National Institute of Standards, can serve as a good platform
to identify related standards that may be of importance to each potential smart
grid application.

Planning Practices to Further Benefit
from Grid Modernization




Advanced monitoring and control facilities provide many new opportunities for
power system planners. Innovative uses of these facilities will enable planners to
postpone capacity additions and solve complicated power quality problems.
New planning tools and methods will be needed to enable planners to exploit
the smart grid facilities.
   This chapter outlines the methods and tools used by distribution system plan-
ning engineers across various grid modernization facilities. Capacity planning has
always been a major responsibility of the planning engineer. In the past, planners
usually addressed growing loads with new facilities (substations, new feeder posi-
tions, line upgrades). Grid modernization has provided a number of new ways to
address growing loads, including peak-shaving techniques (demand response,
voltage reduction), optimal network reconfiguration, and other techniques that
enable the planner to postpone adding new power system facilities.
   Planners must properly account for the presence of new DERs out on the
feeders, which may (or may not) help meet the peak load. If DERs can be
counted on during peak load conditions, then new construction may be post-
poned. But if DERs include a high penetration of (potentially variable) renew-
ables or do not largely coincide with peak demand, their contribution to peak
shaving will largely be limited.
   The impact of zero net energy homes on capacity planning must be consid-
ered. With zero net energy, utilities must provide capacity to serve each cus-
tomer, but may receive no net revenue from kilowatt-hour sales. Planners are
responsible for providing advanced controls for dealing with the power swings
and voltage fluctuations associated with renewables to mitigate unacceptable
impacts on power quality.
   More networking may be needed to enable higher loading on existing feeders.
Software tools used by distribution planning engineers must include many new
features to assist in addressing the issues posed by grid modernization. Such
features are described on the following pages.

       DER Analysis (Steady-State and Dynamic Studies)
       The capability to conduct combined steady-state and dynamic studies for distrib-
       uted energy resource (DER) impact and integration analysis is arguably the most
       urgent need of distribution utilities. High penetrations of DER (particularly PV
       distributed generation, DG) is rapidly becoming a reality in North America,
       which differentiates it from other foreseen smart distribution system incipient
       trends and planning needs.
          Most commercial software tools provide models of conventional (synchro-
       nous) DG technologies and mainstream alternative DG technologies (wind and
       PV). These software tools enable the electric distribution utility to conduct con-
       ventional DG steady-state analysis, such as power flow studies and short circuit
       analysis. The types of studies that are deemed critical for planning and designing
       smart distribution systems include the following:

       •	 Ability to conduct sequential (time-series) simulations, which is critical when
          analyzing variable DG and estimating impacts on distribution line equipment
       •	 Support for enhanced models of LTCs and line voltage regulators to include
          new features provided by equipment and controller manufacturers, including
          selectable operation modes (cogeneration, bidirectional, and so on) and alter-
          native feeder configurations (open delta)
       •	 Advanced models of DES technologies, particularly of Battery Energy Storage
          Systems (BESS), which are starting to become a feasible alternative for vari-
          able DG integration, particularly through the introduction of the Commu-
          nity Energy Storage (CES) concept
       •	 Modeling of less common DG technologies, such as microturbines and fuel cells.

          Planning tools also need to address the dynamic/transient analysis of DER
       technologies.


       Advanced Distribution Automation and Reclosing
       Planning tools must be able to accurately and flexibly model automation schemes
       for complex control schemes that are being implemented on the distribution
       system. For instance, accurately modeling a distribution automation (DA)
       scheme involving more than two feeders (in a flexible manner, without time-
       consuming customization and programming) would be beyond the capabilities
       of existing commercially available tools. Here, accurately modeling implies taking
       into account equipment and feeder ratings, customizing switching times, and
       keeping track of reliability indices, including MAIFI and MAIFIE.
          For volt/VAR control and optimization, most of the tools provide solutions for
       identifying the optimal location of capacitor banks. But very few have specific
       modeling and simulation capabilities for handling the complex logic associated

Planning Practices to Further Benefit from Grid Modernization	                            121


with advanced volt/VAR optimization schemes, such as DMS model-driven,
multi-objective VVO.


Sequential Simulation and Batch Processes
Planning tools should include a convenient mechanism for performing sequential
(time-series) simulation, which is critical for estimating dynamic impacts of vari-
able DG over a period of several minutes or evaluating the impact of advanced
control systems (for example, VVO) over an extended period of time (for
example, one year)—or accurately estimating system losses.


Advanced Distribution Reliability Modeling and Analysis
Planning tools should be able to estimate expected values of distribution reliability
indices. But few programs offer the ability to calibrate the reliability parameters to
match the actual field results. In some cases, this function performs well with small
systems, but has difficulties with large systems. Therefore, this is an area that needs
further improvement. Automated calibration is a desirable feature that would
allow planners to conduct simulations in a faster and simpler manner, and would
also increase the adoption of this type of analysis. This would also facilitate the
implementation of integrated distribution planning (joint capacity and reliability
planning), which is a very complex task using existing software tools.
    Another limitation that has been observed is the ability to model the reliabil-
ity of individual components, which allows studying the impact of individual
deteriorated or aged components. Some of the software tools model reliability
using generalized parameters; for example, all distribution lines on a feeder or all
switches are assumed to have similar, generic failure rates and repair times. But
this approach can produce inaccurate results, and it is usually preferable to assign
parameters directly to each component. With this approach, the program should
provide the capability to easily select and assign reliability parameters to a group
of similar components.
    Another related area that requires further development is the ability to calculate
MAIFI and MAIFIE. This is especially important when advanced DA and reclosing
schemes are used. Few software tools are able to perform Monte Carlo analysis or
reliability optimization to determine the best locations for protective and switching
devices to improve reliability. These are areas that may become more important in
the future, as utilities look into risk-based analysis and planning.
    Finally, another area that is expected to grow in importance alongside the high
penetration of combined DG/DES is intentional islanding and microgrid opera-
tion. Further, R&D work is required to develop capabilities to model and analyze
the impact of islanding and microgrid operation on distribution system reliability
and performance.

       Interfacing with Utility Information Systems
       Most developers offer some ability to interface with utility enterprise informa-
       tion systems, particularly SCADA and AMI. But it is difficult to objectively assess
       such claims. This is a desirable capability not only from a planning point of view
       but also from an operations perspective, since it would allow system operators to
       conduct off-line “what if” simulations, which is a feature offered by some DMS
       developers.
          Interfacing with utility information systems requires the implementation of
       internal utility procedures for gathering and processing raw data, which is some-
       thing that general utilities are still discussing or working on (for example, how
       frequent smart meters should be queried, how these data should be stored and
       processed, and so on).


       Advanced Load Forecasting
       Load forecasting has not been addressed in detail by the software tools for engi-
       neering, planning, and design that were reviewed in this project. A few tools are
       able to use the outputs of specialized spatial load forecasting programs and evalu-
       ate the effect of load growth on distribution system components. Nevertheless,
       no intrinsic spatial or time-series load forecasting capability was identified in any
       of the software tools that were evaluated.
          In general, load growth in many areas has been minimal due, in part, to the
       global economic turndown. But load forecasting is expected to gain renewed inter-
       est, especially in how DER, DR, and PEVs will affect utility infrastructure. One
       issue of concern is the growing interest in establishments that have near-zero net
       energy consumption due to the use of consumer-owned distributed generation.
       But the electric utility must plan on providing sufficient capacity to meet the peak
       load of the establishment if local customer-owned generation is not available.
          Another topic of rising interest is reactive load forecasting. This is needed to
       ensure that the power grid and the distribution system are able to satisfy reactive
       power requirements (in addition to real energy requirements) under all loading
       conditions.


       PEV Modeling and Analysis
       Another incipient and growing need is the ability to conduct comprehensive
       modeling and analysis for the integration and impact evaluation of plug-in elec-
       tric vehicles (PEVs) in distribution systems. Of those evaluated for this report,
       one engineering software vendor claims to have specific models and simulation
       features to address this subject.
          It is possible to conduct this type of analysis using several of the engineering
       analysis tools, because PEV charging patterns may be modeled by using

Planning Practices to Further Benefit from Grid Modernization	                          123


conventional loads with customized load profiles. This can be accomplished
using sequential simulations or a script language. But since this alternative
approach to PEV modeling and analysis may be time consuming and require
advanced programming skills, the preferred and recommended approach is to
add specific features to tools to address PEVs. It is especially important to be able
to model PEVs in conjunction with other smart distribution technologies, spe-
cifically with DG and DES, since interaction among them is expected.


Joint Modeling of Transmission and Distribution Systems
There is increasing interest from utilities in jointly modeling and analyzing distri-
bution and part of transmission and subtransmission systems. Several of the
engineering analysis tools reviewed in this project offer this capability; others
require purchasing additional modules for detailed modeling of distribution sub-
stations. It should be possible to import transmission and subtransmission models
from databases of standard transmission software. Furthermore, analytical tools
for electric distribution systems have been designed to handle circuits that are
primarily radial in nature or “weakly meshed.” To properly handle transmission
and subtransmission networks, the engineering tools must be able to work cor-
rectly for networked (heavily meshed) circuits as well as circuits that are primar-
ily radial in nature.


Power Quality Modeling and Analysis
Utilities are increasingly interested in assessing how the increased high penetra-
tions of DC/AC inverters used for DG and PEV integration will affect total
harmonic distortion (THD) levels in the distribution system. Moreover, there are
growing concerns about voltage fluctuations due to variable DG. To address these
concerns, several engineering software tools offer harmonic analysis capabilities
and some of them offer flicker-level evaluation.


Advanced System Component Modeling
New components such as static VAR compensators (SVCs), distribution
STATCOMs, energy storage devices, “smart” AC inverters, and other devices with
advanced controllers are being deployed in greater numbers at the distribution
level. These new devices can be fairly complex and provide enhanced abilities for
enhanced steady-state and dynamic control to improve efficiency, reliability, and
power quality. It is expected that they will become even more commonplace as
a means for integrating variable DG and PEVs and increasing the reliability,
power quality, and efficiency of distribution systems. But few tools offer specific
models of these technologies.

More on Road Map Methodology
Approaches




This appendix provides pointers to different frameworks that can inform the
preparation of the smart grid road map and a brief description of their approach-
es. Examples include the work of Sandia National Laboratory (SNL), the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the International Energy Agency (IEA).


Sandia National Laboratory
Since 1949, SNL has developed science-based technologies that support national
security missions and include strong portfolios in energy efficiency and renewable
energy. SNL develops technologies to sustain, modernize, and protect nuclear
arsenals; prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction; defend against ter-
rorism; protect national infrastructure; ensure stable energy and water supplies;
and provide new capabilities to armed forces. Sandia’s strategic mission areas
include nuclear weapons; energy, climate, and infrastructure security (ECIS);
nonproliferation, defense systems, and assessments; and homeland security and
defense. SNL is operated and managed by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation. Sandia Corporation operates SNL as
a contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DoE’s) National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration (NNSA) and supports numerous federal, state, and local
government agencies, companies, and organizations (SANDIA website).
   In 1997, Marie L. Garcia and Olin H. Bray from the SNL Strategic Business
Development Department published the Fundamentals of Technology Road Map-
ping. It includes three phases:

•	 Phase 1. Preliminary activities consisting of three elements:
   –	 Satisfying essential conditions (for example, confirm the need for a road map)
   –	 Providing leadership/sponsorship
   –	 Defining the scope and boundaries for the technology road map

                  •	 Phase 2. Development of the technology road map:
                     –	 Identifying the focus of the road map
                     –	 Identifying critical system requirements and targets
                     –	 Specifying major technology areas
                     –	 Specifying drivers and targets
                     –	 Identifying alternatives
                     –	 Recommending technology alternatives
                     –	 Creating a road map report
                  •	 Phase 3. Follow-up activities:
                     –	 Critique and validation of road map
                     –	 Developing an implementation plan
                     –	 Review and update.


                  Electric Power Research Institute
                  EPRI is an independent nonprofit organization involved in research and develop-
                  ment (R&D) in the electric power industry. The EPRI members fund collabora-
                  tive R&D programs. The EPRI membership includes industry representatives
                  from the United States as well as international entities.
                     In 2012, the EPRI published its methodology for the development of smart
                  grid road maps. The approach consists of five keys steps (EPRI 2012), as
                  described in figure A.1.

                  •	 Defining the vision. This is a summary of what the utility/ISO intends to
                     accomplish and why. This step also includes a mission statement that provides
                     “how the vision statement will be accomplished.” The process of defining a
                     vision statement begins with evaluating the essential business objectives and
                     drivers that can be addressed by technology investments. Examples of objec-
                     tives include increasing grid reliability and/or efficiency, ensuring cyber secu-
                     rity, reducing costs, and so on.
                  •	 Identifying the requirements. One of the key elements of the EPRI approach is
                     the use of cases based on an IntelliGrid approach to identify and define the
                     requirements. It includes the needs and interactions of various actors (persons,
                     applications, processes, and so on). It also includes logical interfaces with the
                     relevant attributes such as timing, accuracy, volume, and so on.

•	 Assessing and selecting the technology. The EPRI has deployed a number of
   technology assessment methods that involve ranking a technology by impact
   and effort. The process has a goal to select technology candidates for road
   map implementation. The SG road map is responsible for selecting the top
   candidates based on their rank. A gap analysis follows to identify the gaps
   between the current and desirable technology state.
•	 Planning. An important element of the EPRI planning process is the establish-
   ment of fishbone diagrams that show the current situation as the “tail” and the
   future objective as the “head” of the fish. The steps to be taken are the “scales”
   of the fish (figure A.1).
•	 Implementing the road map. This includes the delivery of a report docu-
   ment, distribution to stakeholders, and project implementation and
   governance.


International Energy Agency
The IEA is a Paris-based intergovernmental organization established in the
framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) in 1974. It is an autonomous organization that works to ensure reliable,
affordable, and clean energy for its 28 member countries and beyond. The IEA’s
four main areas of focus are energy security, economic development, environ-
mental awareness, and engagement worldwide.
   The IEA has developed a methodology for its members for the development
of a road map and used this methodology to develop a smart grid technology
road map for IEA member countries, as shown in figure A.2 (IEA 2011).
   The IEA road map methodology includes the following elements:

•	 Goals. A clear and concise set of targets that, if achieved, will result in the
   desired outcome
•	 Milestones. The interim performance targets for achieving the goals, pegged to
   specific dates
•	 Gaps and barriers. A list of any potential gaps in knowledge, technology limi-

Additional Examples of Road Maps
from Electric Utilities




This section briefly describes the smart grid road maps of some power utilities
and provides pointers to additional information.


California Utilities: Pacific Gas and Electric
California state policies of 2009 resulted in smart grid deployment plans for each
of the several California utilities. Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), in collabora-
tion with the EPRI, Southern California Edison Company, and San Diego Gas
and Electric Company (SDG&E), developed a California road map for the
state’s smart grid of the future (EPRI 2011). PG&E has developed its own smart
grid deployment plant, which was developed according to the state’s future goals
(PG&E 2011).

Vision
PG&E’s vision is to “provide customers safe, reliable, secure, cost-effective, sus-
tainable and flexible energy services through integration of advanced communi-
cations and control technologies to transform the operations of PG&E’s electric
network, from generation to the customer’s premise.”

Drivers
Drivers of the PG&E smart grid program support California’s energy and envi-
ronmental policies:

•	 Safety, reliability, and security
•	 Customer empowerment. PG&E wants customers to be able to control their
   consumption through demand response (DR) programs and advanced meter-
   ing infrastructure (AMI) technologies

California Utility: San Diego Gas and Electric
Vision and Drivers
San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) is another California utility that came
with its own smart grid deployment plant (SDG&E 2011) in accordance with
California’s future energy goals. SDG&E’s vision is to “create the foundation for
an innovative, connected and sustainable energy future, in collaboration with key
stakeholders.” SDG&E’s vision is being driven by the following facts:

•	 Solar distributed generation (DG) is growing fast within SDG&E in an effort
   to help customers reduce their carbon footprint.
•	 Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are currently being introduced into the San
   Diego market in an effort to help individual customers reduce fuel consump-
   tion and associated emissions and costs.
•	 There are new technologies that allow customers to manage their energy con-
   sumption and associated environmental impact.

Pillars of Action
After discussions with stakeholders and customers, SDG&E identified three areas
of interest: customer behavior/education, demand response, and rate design. Its
pillars of action were based on these areas (see table B.1).
   SDG&E’s deployment plan includes implementation of a set of actions before
2015, while completion is expected to happen in 2020. More information can be
found in SDG&E (2011).

U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology
•	 The NIST engaged the EPRI to prepare a smart grid standards road map.
•	 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) identified four smart
       grid functional priorities that include:
   –	 Wide area situational awareness
   –	 Demand response
   –	 Electricity storage
   –	 Electric vehicles
•	 Two additional categories of applications:
   –	 Distribution grid management initiatives
   –	 Advanced metering infrastructure

       Table B.1  SDG&E’s Deployment Plan: Pillars of Action
       Key Themes of the SDG&E Smart Grid Deployment Plan
       •	 Educate customers on energy opportunities and choices. Customer and stakeholder education
          around smart grid issues is important for the success of the program. This can happen through
          utilizing peer-to-peer education.
       •	 Facilitate energy efficiency and demand response. This can happen through utilizing AMI technolo-
          gies and launching DR programs. Customers need to be offered cost-based and time-differentiated
          rates to participate in peak demand reduction schemes and achieve cost reductions.
       •	 Enable plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Community planning is important to facilitate the construc-
          tion of charging stations. Also, time-differentiated charge/discharge rates can be an effective way
          to encourage effective peak reduction during peak hours.
       •	 Enable and integrate energy storage as a means to reduce the impact of solar intermittency on the
          distribution network.
       •	 Expand collaboration among SDG&E and its vendors, suppliers, business partners, community
          organizations, key stakeholders, and academia to enhance exchange of knowledge and enable
          success of the smart grid plan.
       •	 Support workforce readiness. People with new talents and skills are needed to design, implement,
          manage, and operate the new smart grid technologies. SDG&E will work with the industry and
          academia to create a new local “reservoir” of talent.
       •	 Integrate distributed energy resource (DER) with an emphasis on distributed combined heat and
          power (CHP) plants.
       •	 Expand technology development. In order for the smart grid to succeed, new technologies must be
          introduced in the market and older technologies must be modernized. Investments should target
          the development of technologies that interface well with the smart grid.

       Canada–Toronto Hydro-Electric System Ltd
       Vision Drivers and Pillars of Action
       Toronto Hydro-Electric System Limited (THESL) plans to implement a smart
       grid in accordance with Ontario’s Green Energy Act, which mandates the imple-
       mentation of a smart grid with the following characteristics (THESL 2009):

       •	 Enables the increased use of distributed renewable energy sources
       •	 Expands opportunities to provide DR programs driven by the time-varying
          price of electricity
       •	 Accommodates the use of new technologies that promote energy efficiency
          and system control applications
       •	 Supports other objectives that may be prescribed by regulations

                      Ireland has published three road maps that involve smart grid technologies—
                   one for the smart grid, one for wind energy, and another for electrical vehicles.
                      The Irish smart grid objectives include the following:

                   •	 Decarbonization of electricity with annual savings of over 13 million tons of
                      CO2 by 2050. Eight million tons of this will be derived directly from the
                      implementation of a smart grid. A further 5 million tons will come from the
                      displacement of fossil fuels due to the electrification of transport and thermal
                      loads, facilitated by the smart grid.
                   •	 Increased electrification of thermal loads in the residential and services sector. It
                      is estimated that the annual demand in this sector will exceed 28,000 gigawatt-
                      hours by 2050.
                   •	 Electrification of transport. Domestic transportation sector will be expected to
                      demand close to 8,000 gigawatt-hours by 2050.
                   •	 Renewable energy integration. Overall annual electrical final energy demand
                      will be in excess of 48,000 gigawatt-hours by 2050 with a corresponding peak
                      demand of 9 gigawatts. Onshore wind generation will be able to supply up to
                      33,000 gigawatt-hours of the total demand.
                   •	 Reduction of energy imports. Greater integration of indigenous renewable ener-
                      gy sources will see a net reduction in energy imports in excess of 4.3 Mtoe1
                      (equivalent to € 3.2 billion–€ 7.2 billion savings in direct fuel offsets by 2050).

•	 Increased interconnection. By 2025, Ireland aims at having 1.4 gigawatts of
   interconnection. Analysis indicated that a further 1.6 gigawatts of intercon-
   nection will be required by 2040.
•	 Job creation. It is estimated that more than 10,000 Irish jobs will be created by
   implementation of smart grid infrastructure and its associated technologies.

  The main components of the Irish smart grid road map to achieve the stated
decarbonization goals include the following:

•	   Peak and load shifting and demand-side management (DSM)
•	   Reduced line losses, infrastructure improvements, and volt/VAR management
•	   Integration of renewables
•	   Electrification of transport
•	   Electrification of heating, cooling, and hot water
•	   Electrification of industrial heating/cooling loads.

   Furthermore, the smart grid road map for Ireland calls for the following
actions within the next 10 years:

•	 Establishment of a test-bed facility, strengthening Ireland’s position as a lead-
   er in smart grid technology research
•	 Development and deployment of training courses in smart grid systems and
   technologies
•	 Review of policies dealing with energy and CO2 ratings of buildings to encour-
   age electrification
•	 National rollout of smart meters with DSM and variable time-of-use tariffs
•	 Development of interoperability standards and secure communications and
   data protocols
•	 The continuation of the grid investment programs Grid-West and Grid 25
•	 Development of an overlay of secure, high-speed communications onto the
   electricity system.

In the publication “Road Map for Smart Grids and Electricity Systems Integrat-
ing Renewable Energy Sources,” four main challenges are identified in the Euro-
pean context:

•	 Attain emissions reduction objectives for greenhouse gases (GHG) set for
   2020 (20 percent reduction) and for 2050 (factor 4), notably via energy-
   efficiency schemes
•	 Compliance with European objectives for the integration of renewable
   energy
•	 Maintaining the quality and security of supply in the electricity system

       •	 Consideration of social issues related to electricity supply.

          The road map considers two time frames—up to 2020 and up to 2050:

       •	 The time frame up to 2020 is focused on attaining European objectives
          (20/20/20), while maintaining high-quality supply and system security.
       •	 The 2050 time frame allows for contrasting representations of future electric-
          ity networks and systems, based on the unfolding of trends identified in the
          2020 time frame, subject to different regulatory options envisioned for grids
          and electricity systems.

          The road map identifies three key drivers that, in the long term, will play a
       determining role in the form and nature of smart grids and electrical systems:

       •	 The degree of intelligence in the electricity system and grids, and the range of
          products and services associated with this capacity
       •	 The degree and type of decentralization in the system and grids
       •	 Regulatory choices, business models, and the role of players affecting smart
          grids and electrical systems.

          Variation in the parameters of the different key drivers (intelligence, decen-
       tralization, regulation) leads to four contrasting visions of the electricity system
       and networks. Two visions for the 2020 timeframe and two visions for the 2050
       timeframe are as follows:

       •	 Vision 2020—1: Demand flexibility and storage facilities coupled to large-
          scale variable generating capacity
       •	 Vision 2020—2: Demand flexibility and management of dispersed storage
       •	 Vision 2050—1: Demand flexibility, storage, and distributed energy resource
          (DER) in a centralized grid architecture
       •	 Vision 2050—2: Demand response and DER in smart clusters.

Some Guidelines on the Cost-Benefit
Analysis of Smart Grid Applications




This sections list some references to useful documents that describe guidelines on the CBA of
smart grid applications.


Guidelines                             Brief description
U.S. Smart Grid Development and        This presentation by Eric Lightner, director of the Smart Grid Task Force to the
   Global Smart Grid Coordination        Board on Global Science and Technology, describes the vision, character-

                                         United States. Additionally, the presentation provides details regarding a
                                         metric reporting and analysis process to quantify the monetary benefits
                                         related to smart grid functions.
Guidelines for Conducting a Cost-      This report by European Union’s Joint Research Center, Institute for Energy
  Benefit Analysis of Smart Grid         and Transport, provides step-by-step guidance for conducting CBA of
  Projects—European Union (CBA           smart grid projects. This framework is based on a similar methodological
  Methodology) (Giordano and oth-        approach developed by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the
  ers 2012)                              United States. CBA includes three main tasks—the definition of boundary
                                         conditions and implementation choices, identification of costs and ben-
                                         efits, and sensitivity of CBA results to variations in key parameters.
Building a Smart Grid Business Case    This guidance brief by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL),
  (NETL 2009)                            United States, helps in developing regional smart grid road maps. Assessing
                                         the gap between the current state and desired future state of the grid, busi-
                                         ness cases, and implementation plans can be analyzed and integrated into
                                         a road map. Business cases, thus devised, help in disaggregating the costs
                                         incurred and benefits accrued by diverse smart grid stakeholders such as
                                         consumers, utilities, and society. This document provides guidance for gap
                                         analysis, formulation of business cases, and road mapping.

Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.
In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and
print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide.
Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances
decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas
emissions, and waste.
   We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled
content. The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached
­
using totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced
elemental chlorine–free (EECF) processes.
   More information about the Bank’s environmental philosophy can be found
at http://www.worldbank.org/corporateresponsibility.




             Practical Guidance for Defining a Smart Grid Modernization Strategy (Revised Edition)
                                                     http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-1054-1
P    ractical Guidance for Defining a Smart Grid Modernization Strategy: The Case of Distribution guides
     stakeholders on how utilities can define their own smart grid vision, identify priorities, and
structure investment plans. While most of these strategic aspects apply to any area of the electricity
grid, the book focuses on distribution. The guidance includes key building blocks for modernizing
the distribution grid and provides examples of grid modernization projects. This revised edition
also includes key communication system requirements to support a well-functioning grid.
   The concept of the smart grid is relevant to all grids. What varies are the magnitude and type of
the incremental steps toward modernization for achieving a specific smart grid vision. A utility that is
at a relatively low level of grid modernization may leapfrog one or more levels of modernization to
achieve some of the benefits of the highest levels of grid modernization.
   Smart grids impact electric distribution systems significantly. In developing countries, moderniz-
ing the distribution grid promises to benefit the operation of electric distribution utilities in many
and various ways. These benefits include improved operational efficiency (such as reduced losses
and lower energy consumption), reduced peak demand, improved service reliability, and ability to
accommodate distributed generating resources without adversely impacting overall power quality.
   Practical Guidance for Defining a Smart Grid Modernization Strategy concludes by describing
funding and regulatory issues that may need to be taken into account when developing smart grid
plans.
