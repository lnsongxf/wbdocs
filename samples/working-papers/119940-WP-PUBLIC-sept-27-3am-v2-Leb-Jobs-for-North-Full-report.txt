EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




Overview of Report Objectives and Methodology

This report provides an assessment of constraints and opportunities for the creation
of more and better quality jobs for Lebanese in the more fragile and conflict-affected
regions. The geographical focus is North Lebanon, including Tripoli. This analysis,
accompanied by further dialogue with the key public and private sector professionals,
can serve to inform the design and development of a jobs-focused program of financial
support for North Lebanon. This diagnostic and program development approach can
also be replicated in other high-priority, lagging regions of the country.
	 The diagnostic followed a three-pronged approach in order to assess the gaps that
need to be overcome to respond effectively to job opportunities, foster productivity, and
increase earnings: 1) an assessment of the investment climate in North Lebanon; 2) a
value chain analysis (VCA) of selected sectors and the interventions required to unlock
competitiveness and job creation; and 3) a review of the supply of labor and skills in the
region, a stock-taking of training providers. Enterprise surveys were conducted of the
key agents in two targeted value chains, as well as a household-level skills survey of the
working age population in North Lebanon. Complementary semi-structured interviews
and focus group meetings were also undertaken. Consultations with the Government
and other stakeholders took place from May through August, 2016.


Social and Economic Characteristics of the North

The North of Lebanon faces significant structural, socio-economic challenges. The
economy of North Lebanon is largely split between agriculture, dominant in Akkar
and Minieh-Danniyeh, and the urban industrial and services economy centered in
Tripoli. Productivity in these different sectors is relatively low. Decades of political,
community, and social insecurity have impeded investment, curtailed growth, job
creation, and fostered out-migration of talent. According to the latest poverty data,
36 percent of the population in the North are poor, significantly above the national
average of 27 percent. This is second to the Bekaa, which has a lower absolute number
of poor. Areas of Tripoli and its immediate northern hinterland including also areas
of Akkar are assessed as some of the most vulnerable localities in the country. The
evidence suggests that this region has high levels of inequality.

     	 Employment challenges for the Lebanese in this region have been exacerbated,
     particularly for the poorest segments, by the country’s fragility and history of conflict,
     and more recently by the influx of more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees. This is
     strongly impacting Tripoli and the North, where the ratio of refugees to population
     is almost 32 percent and which houses 29 percent of total refugees (or 445,000
     individuals). This represents an increasingly unsustainable stress on social services
     and the job market.


     Key Findings

     A.The Jobs Challenge in North Lebanon
     The working age population in the North is estimated at 610,000 individuals, of which
     53 percent are inactive, leaving a total labor force of 289,000. Within the participating
     labor force, 20 percent are employers and 22 percent are self-employed – both largely
     informal. Just 49 percent of the labor force are wage employed and, of those, only 15
     percent are formal wage workers. The remaining nine percent are unemployed.
     	 Among those who are working in North Lebanon, the vast majority are in poor
     quality, low productivity jobs working in enterprises of less than ten employees. The
     majority of workers are employed in the wholesale and retail trade sector, characterized
     by low productivity.
     	 The total labor force in the North is expected to increase from 289,000 to 362,000
     people by 2025, due to existing trends in the growth rate of the Lebanese working age
     population and current labor market participation rates. This implies that the regional
     economy would need to create an average of 8,000 jobs each year simply to maintain
     a steady state situation in the labor market.
     	 Addressing the employment gap in North Lebanon to bring performance in line
     with the national average requires substantial job creation. Closing the employment
     rate gap to the national average would require almost 14,000 new jobs in the region– or
     around 2,800 annually if a five-year target was set to reach this goal. An employment
     rate above 60 percent, typical of upper middle income countries, would require more
     than 120,000 jobs or 24,000 per year over a five-year period. To improve the quality
     of jobs and bring the region in line with the national average of 62 percent of the
     employed in waged jobs, an additional 21,000 waged jobs (or more than 4,000 per
     year over five years) would need to be created to replace existing self-employment.
     	 The number of unemployed is relatively small (around 22,000 or nine percent of
     the active workforce) and they are younger and better educated than the population
     as a whole. This highlights a demand side problem – i.e. not enough good jobs are
     being created. But it also suggests that this group may be well-positioned to shift into
     employment with appropriate support.




16   Jobs For North Lebanon
B.	 The Labor Market in North Lebanon
The low labor force participation rates and low education levels limit both the
quantity and quality of the workforce in North Lebanon. The participation rate in
North Lebanon is amongst the lowest in the country, while the actual labor force
is amongst the biggest given that the majority of its population is of working-age.
This high inactivity is driven by the very low participation rates amongst women
and youth in the labor market. Amongst those who are active, the majority has low
levels of education, especially amongst the adults. Forty five percent of the active
population has elementary education or below, while 31 percent have completed
tertiary education. Youth and adults less than 34 years of age achieve higher levels
of education with 31 percent (youth) and 42 percent (adults), respectively, having a
bachelor degree or higher.

There are important variations in labor market outcomes between different population
groups, especially among women:

  •	 Only one in five working age women participate in the labor market, compared
     to 73 percent among working age men.
  •	 The majority of active women are wage employees, while self-employment is
     more prevalent among men. For women, 80 percent are wage employees and
     only 20 percent are self-employed or employers, while the latter is 40 percent
     among men.
  •	 Twenty-three percent of youth below age 25 are not in Education, Employment
     or Training (NEETs), and 13 percent are unemployed.

C.	 The Investment Climate for Job Creation in North Lebanon
Lebanon fares poorly in eight out of ten different dimensions of the doing business
life-cycle measured in the Doing Business Indicators. Even in the two areas where
Lebanon has made some progress — starting a business and getting credit ¬— it
remains far from the frontier of the best performers. Moreover, Lebanon has not made
progress in any other Doing Business Indicator since 2006. Many investment climate
constraints are more acute in the North:

  •	 Informal competition and corruption represent major obstacles to investment
     in both formal and informal firms. In the North, 84 percent of firms indicate
     they compete against informal firms versus just 57 percent of firms nationally.
     In terms of corruption, 62 percent of firms in the region report they expect to
     pay bribes to public officials compared with 21 percent of the firms for the rest
     of Lebanon.
  •	 The infrastructure constraint is greater in terms of electricity access and quality.
     Electricity connections in the North take almost twice as long as for the rest
     of Lebanon (which is already cumbersome). Additionally, firms in the North



                                                                     Jobs For North Lebanon   17
           also tend to have a higher number of electrical outages and a greater reliance
           on generators.
        •	 Access to finance does not appear to be a leading constraint in Lebanon,
           however this finding conceals some critical gaps. In Lebanon, as in many other
           countries in MENA, smaller and more informal enterprises have significantly
           less access to finance than large firms, disproportionately impacting a region
           dominated by such firms.

     Myriad constraints restrict firms in the North from taking sufficient advantage of
     exports as a source of growth and job creation. Close to 60 percent of all jobs in
     Lebanon are accounted for by large exporters. Yet just six percent of firms in the
     North export even one percent of their sales directly, around half the national average.
     Despite a strategic position and a production structure that aligns well with Lebanon’s
     trade comparative advantage, firms face constraints in logistics, trade facilitation, and
     quality standards, along with disruption to traditional trade routes. This contributes to
     anemic levels of foreign direct investment in the region.

     D.	 Value Chains as Sources of Inclusive Job Creation
     Two value chains were selected in consultation with the Government of Lebanon to
     assess their potential to drive inclusive job creation in the North: potatoes and solid
     waste/re-cycling. The potato sector is one of the largest agricultural activities in the
     North. It has a strong reach into the rural areas of the region (particularly Akkar),
     while also connecting to urban areas through trade and processing. Whereas, the solid
     waste and recycling sector offers the opportunity to leverage substantial investments
     being made through the Office of the Minister of State for Administrative Reform
     (OMSAR) (funded through the European Union) in solid waste and sorting facilities
     across the North.

     Potatoes
     Around 9,000 jobs exist across the potato value chain, including 1,800 permanent and
     around 7,200 seasonal jobs. Converting seasonal workers into full-time equivalent
     (FTE) positions (40 hours a week, year-round) results in close to 3,000 FTEs in the
     value chain. The majority of these jobs are in farming, accounting for two-thirds of
     permanent jobs and 85 percent of seasonal jobs. Traders also account for a sizable
     number – more than 500 FTEs and almost 400 permanent jobs.
     	 Lebanese occupy almost all high-skill jobs across the potato value chain, as well as
     the large majority of low-skill permanent positions in processing and trading activities.
     There is over 40 percent Lebanese female employment in permanent positions in input
     suppliers and processors. Most of the jobs for Lebanese youth are in trading (more
     than 80 percent of low-skill, permanent jobs). Foreign workers dominate seasonal
     employment and low-skill employment in potato farms.




18   Jobs For North Lebanon
The assessment of the jobs creation potential for Lebanese at the higher skill end of
the employment spectrum resulting from growth in the potato value chain was based
on two scenarios:

  •	 An expansion of exports: Where Akkar farmers take half of the EU quota of
     50,000 Metric Tons (versus none at present) over and above existing domestic
     and other export markets. This can create an estimated 350 additional permanent
     jobs and another 1,550 seasonal jobs. Around 70 percent of jobs would be in
     farms. The remaining jobs would be in trading and inputs.
  •	 New large-scale investments in potato processing: At the high end of the
     scenario, close to 2,200 new permanent jobs can be created. This includes 1,200
     in processing, trading, and input supply that tend to employ largely Lebanese
     workers, including significant skilled positions.

In practice, the number and nature of jobs created in any growth scenario for this value
chain will depend to a large degree on the type of investment driving growth (e.g.
expansion versus greenfield investment), as well as the decisions by firms on capital
and labor mix.

Solid Waste and Recycling
A fully operational solid waste management and recycling supply chain infrastructure
has an estimated employment capacity of close to 4,600 versus approximately 1,300
workers currently employed in this value chain. Female participation is low, only 6.7
percent of the labor force across the entire value chain. Foreign workers account for
about 30 percent, mainly in low-skilled jobs.
	 Based on an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, the estimated number of jobs along
the entire value chain can be projected to reach 5,000 by 2020 and 5,400 by 2025.
This calculation is based on the assumption that waste management facilities in North
Lebanon are fully operational, accounting for the collection of at least 99 percent of
municipal waste, and all sorting lines are operational with a functioning supply chain
infrastructure for recyclable products.
	 The highest number of jobs is expected to be concentrated around traders of
recyclable material (more than 1,900 jobs by 2025), followed by steel processing
(more than 750 by 2025). A further breakdown of jobs according to type indicates
that nearly one quarter of new jobs (approximately 475) would be permanent high-
skilled jobs, while 70 percent would be permanent low-skilled jobs. The highest
concentration of permanent high-skilled jobs (around 30 percent) is expected to be in
the trading sector, followed by the paper sector (25 percent).
	 Analysis of these two value chains indicates both have significant potential to
create better quality jobs for Lebanon, with further induced job creation effects
through the impact of wage expenditures in the local economy. These value chains
represent a relatively small share of the overall economy in North Lebanon. So, it is



                                                                    Jobs For North Lebanon   19
     not a ‘silver bullet’ to solving the jobs challenge. Moreover, substantial investment
     and other interventions across the value chain would be required to have a pronounced
     impact on job creation and quality.


     Conclusions and Recommendations

     As elucidated in this report, job creation challenges in North Lebanon are substantial.
     The North is a very informal, high poverty-level, regional economy facing significant
     and prolonged external shocks compounding an existing situation of persistent internal
     insecurity. It is a region that has a strong sense of neglect from the central government
     that has been unable to progress with the key reforms required to provide a broad-
     based competitive improvement to its economy. Nor has it been able to provide
     sufficient targeted support to this lagging region. This sense of marginalization was
     confirmed during the unexpected reversals that the leading political parties suffered in
     the recent 2016 Tripoli municipal elections.
     	 In a labor market providing just one salaried job for every five working age
     adults, the crux of the problem lies on the demand side – a private sector that fails
     to generate productive jobs. Tens of thousands of relatively educated, working age
     adults are unemployed or outside of the labor force completely. More still are stuck
     in low quality jobs. The available evidence suggests a market dominated by small and
     micro businesses - too many in the informal sector with limited job creation capacity.
     Together with the limited growth potential currently prevalent among SMEs, future
     employment creation in the absence of new investment is highly constrained. Some
     inroads can be made through better job search and matching facilities, particularly
     for those better skilled unemployed workers. But substantial improvement will prove
     elusive without more being done to mobilize demand side investment.
     	 This report highlights where opportunities exist. But it also recognizes there is
     significant distance still to be travelled to bring the supply and demand sides of the
     market into more effective partnerships. This effort needs to be undertaken with a
     keen sense of what is possible and where the regional economy can advance over the
     short, medium and long term. It also requires innovative enticement of private sector
     risk-taking and investment in fragile settings that are traditionally seen as antithetical
     to private investment.
     	 There will be no one “transformative approach” to the jobs challenge in the North.
     A series of actions – calibrated to what is politically possible and a bit beyond – will
     need to be taken and implementation sustained over an extended period. Many of the
     significant constraints to business entry, growth, and job creation are long-standing
     problems in Lebanon. The solutions are well known but have not, for whatever
     reason, been implemented. While efforts should continue to promote such reforms,
     solutions to the regional jobs challenge should not depend in any way on these macro,
     national-level reforms coming to fruition.



20
	 Different strategies will be required over time. Over the shorter term this entails
a focus on SMEs, taking as given the current policy and infrastructure environment.
Over the longer term, an increased focus on higher potential value chains – through
selective (i.e. “not-so-politically sensitive”) sector-specific reforms and supporting
investments – can mobilize marked new private investment. In both cases, there are
specific labor market and skills issues to be addressed and outcomes to be achieved.


Next Steps - Ways Forward for Job Creation in Lagging and
Vulnerable Regions in Lebanon

1.	 Short-Term Agenda: Supporting SMEs and Self-Employment
Starting with a shorter 3-5 year period, no significant policy change can be expected
to take full effect. This represents the time period before potentially growth-inducing
new infrastructure investments – including the Tripoli Special Economic Zone and
port and railway developments - come into effect. The challenges will be to support
SMEs to improve market performance and develop new market niches. This focus
should also include the informal sector where the majority of North Lebanon’s work
force is concentrated. Micro-level, informal, locally oriented businesses dominate the
employment landscape but lack the means to absorb even the relatively small active
labor force. Some of the potential solutions to address short-term job creation and
inclusion needs are:

  •	 Delivering new forms of finance that can improve access to key inputs needed
     to start and expand MSMEs in ways that foster job creation and help mitigate
     lending risks;
  •	 Supporting MSME and BDS/entrepreneurship;
  •	 Developing targeted programs to support female and youth business start-ups.

Respondents in the labor market survey indicated access to finance and wage
subsidies are some of the most critical elements in strengthening the performance of
this sector and, ideally, in providing the inducement for firms to formalize. Getting the
incentives right in developing such products and mitigating against market distortions
- but recognizing that jobs created in highly fragile, policy constrained regions bring
with them significant additional social externalities - requires distinct innovative
approaches to address the heightened investment risks.

2.	 Long-Term Agenda: Sustainable Jobs Through Value Chain Investments
Efforts to bring about national level policy reforms in politically fragmented fragile
settings often fall short, as the weight of politically vested interests takes its toll.
This perspective - held even by senior Lebanese policy makers and almost all private
sector stakeholders engaged in the preparation of this report - led to the focus on value



                                                                                            21
     chains. It builds first on the notion that targeting sub-sectors from production to end-
     market offers a more tractable reform context and more targetable and measurable
     investment opportunities. It also allows for a better calculation of winners and losers.
     In other words, it is less threatening to the political and institutional rigidities that
     block wider change efforts.
     	 The value chains analysis also indicated that while not a panacea, substantial job
     potential for Lebanese exists in selected value chains, provided that downstream value-
     adding activities can be instigated. To be successful, this requires clear determination
     of market opportunities, associated with new investments in facilities, labor force
     skills development, and some core infrastructure improvements. Far greater attention
     is also required to establish effective partnerships and networking within value chains
     and clusters operating in the region.
     	 Interventions to support the development of competitive value chains need to be
     complemented with efforts to bring labor force supply closer to private sector needs.
     This means raising skills levels and making them more relevant to the evolving
     demands of the private sector. It also requires improving matching between workers
     and jobs through more effective registration and profiling of the labor force and
     improved information flows between public employment and training institutions and
     the private sector.
     	 The value chain development approach proposed as part of a multi-phased job
     development program recognizes the specific enabling conditions on the ground in the
     North. To achieve larger-scale job creation, private sector investors willing to invest in
     the North as a base to serve wider markets are needed. This means building on sources
     of comparative advantage in the North. These include its strategic geographical
     position where the port of Tripoli provides connectivity to the wider region, as well
     as specific value chains (mainly agricultural). Serving wider markets is not simply
     about exporting, but also serving markets nationally and within the region. This, too,
     requires increasing connectivity (including to Beirut) and re-establishing Tripoli’s
     central role in the regional and national economy.

     3.	Ongoing Imperative: Strengthening the Competitive Position of North
     Lebanon
     It will be critical to build on the new infrastructure investments already underway
     and then look to the region’s other key economic assets. This includes the further
     development of a relatively deep-birth seaport that can strengthen the region’s longer-
     term competitive edge in terms of the GCC export market and the previously mentioned
     future reconstruction of Syria. Solutions to reinforce the strategic positioning of
     Tripoli and the North include:

       •	 Continued investments (including customs) to develop the Port of Tripoli as a leading
          container terminal for regional shipping and, to the extent feasible, expanding
          private investment in various aspects of port development and operations;



22
  •	 Investments in transport infrastructure to improve connectivity between Tripoli
     and other regions of Lebanon, as well as between Tripoli and key districts in
     the North;
  •	 Investments in industrial infrastructure, such as special economic zones and
     industrial parks, to support a competitive manufacturing sector;
  •	 Investments in urban infrastructure and municipal capacity to promote improved
     “livability” for residents of Tripoli;
  •	 Investments to position Tripoli to support post-conflict reconstruction in Syria.

At some point, value chain development and associated targeted infrastructure
development will experience diminishing returns, both in terms of private investment
and jobs. Further attracting investment to establish and expand outward-oriented
businesses in Tripoli and the North will, eventually, require addressing significant,
long-standing investment climate constraints. This includes issues of governance and,
most notably, electricity. Operating competitively without a robust and supportive
investment climate is almost impossible, particularly for firms attempting to compete
in export markets.

Introduction and Overview




A.Outline

1. Objectives
This report assesses the opportunities and requirements to support the creation of more
and better quality jobs in the more fragile and conflict-affected regions of Lebanon.
By focusing on job creation in lagging regions, this activity is intended to contribute
to the reduction of poverty and inequality. The geographical focus is Tripoli and the
wider North Lebanon Governorate, referred to also in this report as “the North”.
	 This analysis, accompanied by further dialogue with key public and private sector
stakeholders can also serve to inform the design and development of a jobs-focused
program for North Lebanon. This diagnostic and program development approach can
potentially be replicated in other high-priority lagging regions of the country.

2. Methodology
The diagnostic followed a three-pronged approach: 1) assessment of the labor supply
and job demand environment in North Lebanon, covering labor market outcomes
and the investment climate; 2) assessment of the structure of employment and the
interventions required to unlock competitiveness and job creation through value chain
analysis (VCA); and 3) assessment of the skills base of the region and the gaps that
need to be overcome to respond effectively to job opportunities and foster productivity
and earnings growth. The diagnostic entailed an enterprise survey of the key agents
in two targeted value chains and a household survey of the labor market and skills
profile of the population in North Lebanon. The survey work and complementary
semi-structured interview and focus group meetings were undertaken between March-
May 2016.
	 Results were presented to the Government Working Group chaired by the Director
General of the Ministry of Economy and Trade on May 17th, 2016, with further
meetings held on July 21st, and July 26th, 2016. A concluding meeting, hosted by the
Tripoli Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, involving Northern-based
stakeholders took place on August 11th, 2016. Further details on the methodology

     adopted is included in the relevant technical reports prepared as background to this
     final report.

     3.	 Report Outline
     This report is structured in six chapters. The remainder of Chapter I provides an
     overview of the social and economic development challenges facing Tripoli and the
     North. Chapter II provides an assessment of the jobs challenge in the North through
     an analysis of the labor market and of the nature of firm demand for labor. Chapter III
     looks at the supply side of the market, including education and skills and patterns of
     labor market participation. Chapter IV turns attention to the demand side by looking
     at the investment and trade environment that shapes firm investment and hiring
     decisions in Lebanon, and in North Lebanon in particular. Chapter V then reports
     on the results of the value chain analysis, providing a lens through which to assess
     both the demand and supply sides of jobs opportunities and challenges in the region.
     Chapter VI addresses the conclusions and next steps arising out of the diagnostic work
     done to date.

     B.	Overview of the Economy in Tripoli and the North

     1.	 The Socio-Economic Challenge Facing North Lebanon
     The North of Lebanon faces significant structural and socio-economic challenges.
     Decades of political and social insecurity have impeded investment, curtailed growth
     and job creation, and fostered out-migration of talent. Job creation has been largely
     restricted to low productivity agricultural and informal services.
     	 The recently concluded World Bank Group Systematic Country Diagnostic of
     Lebanon1 (SCD) highlights the disadvantaged condition of North Lebanon. According
     to the latest poverty data, the North has a poverty headcount measure of 36 percent,
     which is significantly above the national average of 27 percent. It is second only
     to Bekaa, which has a lower absolute number of poor (estimated at 170,000 versus
     290,000 in the North). Based on socio-economic and other vulnerabilities2, areas of
     Tripoli and its immediate northern hinterland together with significant parts of Akkar,
     are assessed as some of the most vulnerable localities in the country (Figure 1). The
     SCD notes that the North has the lowest elasticity of poverty to consumption growth,
     which suggests that the region has high levels of inequality. Such inequality most
     likely stems from weaker employment and earnings opportunities in the North. This
     is evidenced by the region having the poorest labor market outcomes in the country,
     which in turn results from an environment that undermines the incentive for job-
     creating private sector investment.

	 The employment challenge has been exacerbated, particularly for the poorest
citizens, by the country’s fragility and history of conflict, and more recently by the
influx of more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees. These factors are likely to continue
exerting significant pressure on the Lebanese economic and social situation4. This
reality is becoming more tenuous as Lebanon tries to cope with the deepening and
prolonged impact of the refugee influx arising from the Syrian conflict. As of January
2016, since the commencement of the Syrian conflict in March 2011, over one million
Syrian refugees/displaced persons are officially registered in Lebanon (representing
over 25 percent of the Lebanese population). The GoL estimates the number at 1.5
million, which is in line with the estimation of total number of refugees, including
those unregistered5. This is strongly affecting Tripoli and the North, where the ratio
of refugees to population is almost 32 percent6 and which houses 29 percent of total
refugees (or 445,000 individuals). This represents an increasingly unsustainable stress
placed on the region.
	 The fragility confronting Tripoli and the North has its origins well before the onset
of the current Syrian crisis. In Tripoli, there have been long-standing tensions between
the Sunni area of Bab al-Tabbaneh and the Alawite community in Jabal Mohsen that
have resulted in violent interludes. Tensions have since deepened as the sectarian
groups in the city align to different interests at play in the Syrian crisis. This in turn
has resulted in a heightened military presence and security alertness. But the sense
of economic marginalization of the indigenous community, the evidence of which
is further reinforced by the findings of this report, has played its part in this social
conflict and proclivity to violence7. In focus group meetings and other consultations
that took place in preparation of this report, stakeholders across the private sector

                                                                                             27

               and civil society voiced their concern for what is seen as a longer trend of economic
               neglect toward the North.
               	 What is clear, despite the cursory nature of this overview of the socio-economic
               and sectarian-driven depressed circumstances of North Lebanon, is the importance
               of a pro-active policy of economic inclusion, through the creation of meaningful
               employment that provides not just an income, but also generates a range of social
               externalities. This includes both human capital development and the inclusion in
               employment of the most marginal groups, such as women and youth. The starting
               point for determining options to best affect this economic outcome is to understand
               the endowments of the Northern economy and how this is manifesting in terms of the
               supply and demand for labor and the creation of jobs. From this vantage point, policy,
               programming, and investment options can be developed.

               2.	 The Economy in North Lebanon
               The economy of North Lebanon is largely split between agriculture, which dominates
               in Akkar and Minieh-Danniyeh, and an urban industrial and services economy centered
               in Tripoli. Within the national context, the region is specialized in agriculture (Table
               1). Outside of agriculture, the economy is dominated by low productivity service
               sectors, namely wholesale and retail trade, as well as transport (mainly automotive
               repair). But the region also has a fairly sizeable industrial economy, in particular, food
               processing and wood products (furniture).

Jobs For North Lebanon




Faced with an unfavorable investment and trade environment and a highly fragile wider
regional political setting, the North is greatly disadvantaged in terms of job creation
opportunities. This is exacerbated by a central government that has been unable to
move forward with the economic reforms required to transform the economy. In this
context, what can be done over the short, medium, and long term – within the bounds
of what, from a political economy and policy perspective, is feasible – to address one
of the overriding challenges in North Lebanon, that of good quality jobs?
	 The Government has reiterated the paramount importance of addressing the
constraints to job creation, job quality, and access to jobs, including targeting
impoverished neighborhoods where Syrian refugee communities live alongside
lower income Lebanese. Such jobs-focused objectives in Tripoli and the North would
address two explicit priorities of the Lebanese government simultaneously: reducing
poverty and inequality, as well as improving social cohesion in the most conflict-
prone region and in local communities with the heaviest presence of Syrian refugees.
More specifically, the Government has been moving forward on a number of recent
and prospective economic developments in the Tripoli area. These include: (i) the
recent concession of container services at the Tripoli port and the prospective flow of
further investments; (ii) significant public investments entailing port, rail, and road
infrastructure development, and (iii) the planned Tripoli Special Economic Zone
(TSEZ). As can be seen in Table 2, the Government is committing substantial new
funding to the North.

                 Taking a closer look at the range of investments currently underway in North Lebanon,
                 Table 3 indicates that approximately $127.2 million or 33 percent of the total target
                 infrastructure investment in the region could potentially have a direct impact on
                 enterprise productivity and growth. While historical data is not available to determine
                 trends, feedback from stakeholders in North Lebanon indicates that this volume of
                 investment significantly increased over past periods

                 These port, TSEZ and other infrastructure initiatives, if they build on existing
                 comparative advantages in the region, can open new prospects to reposition the region’s
                 economy and foster stronger job creation in the future. In the short term, this will
                 likely come from exploiting opportunities to expand and add value in the agriculture
                 sector. Moreover, by better utilizing the Information and Communication Technology
                 (ICT) sector, the potential exists to build on the indigenous entrepreneurial capacity
                 in the North. The relative proximity to Beirut – with its strong entrepreneurial culture
                 and globally competitive firms - together with lower local costs (wages, rents) are
                 potential competitive advantages of the North. Over the longer term, potential exists
                 for Tripoli to become a key entrepot, logistics, professional and technical goods and
                 services hub for the neighboring countries of the region, including the reconstruction
                 of Syria, once the conflict is over.

A. Snapshot of the Labor Market in North Lebanon

The data in Figure 2 illustrates the main components of the Lebanese labor market in
North Lebanon, based on the Household Survey undertaken as part of the diagnostic
work. It outlines several anomalies that will be discussed in more detail in subsequent
sections. Most notably, while the North has a relatively large working age population
(around 610,000), only 47 percent (289,000) are active. And, while the inactive
population includes a fairly large number of youth who are still in school (79,000),
the majority of the inactive population are working-age women (168,000). Among
the active labor force, wage employment accounts for 49 percent (142,000), while 42
percent are either self-employed or employers. Unemployment is relatively low, at
nine percent versus a national average of 11 percent.

     Box 1: Definition of Key Labor Market Indicators – 2013 World Development
     Report: Jobs

     Jobs: While precise definitions vary, jobs are labor activities that generate income,
     monetary or in kind, without violating fundamental rights and principles at work.
     Jobs can take the form of wage employment, self-employment, and farming.
     The concept of a job is much broader than wage employment. However, as an
     individual can be employed in multiple jobs which can be formal or informal.
     Working age population: Persons aged 15 - 64 as a fraction of the total population;
     in percent.
     Participation rate: Share of the working age population that is in the labor force,
     with the labor force defined as persons who work or are unemployed; in percent.
     Inactivity rate: Share of the working age population that is not in the labor force.
     The sum of the participation rate and inactivity rate would be equal to 100 percent.
     Unemployment rate: Share of the labor force that is unemployed, with the
     unemployed defined as persons who are available to work and are actively
     looking for a job during a reference period; in percent.
     Employment by work status: Share of employment in wage, self-employment or
     employer; in percent.
     Informal employment: Share of workers not contributing to social security.
     Self-employment: Share of workers working alone with no employees; while
     employers have at least one employee.
     Youth not in education, employment or training (NEET): Share of the population
     aged 15–24 who is not engaged in education, employment, or training; in percent.




     B.	Analysis of Labor Market Outcomes in North Lebanon

     1.	 Labor Force Participation
     The majority of the Lebanese population in North Lebanon is of working age, but labor
     force participation is among the lowest in the country. Based on the latest available
     demographic data (2009), one-fifth of the Lebanese population resides in the North
     Governorate with almost two thirds of working age (15-64 years). Compared to other
     regions in Lebanon, the size of the working age population in the North is second only
     to Mount Lebanon (Figure 3).

Notwithstanding the high absolute numbers in the labor force, North Lebanon is
characterized by high inactivity. Less than half of the working age population is active
in 2016, compared to 52 percent in 2009 (Figure 2). This is in line with the national
average of 48 percent9 (based on the latest data available), but low by international
standards. (See Section III.)
	 The low activity rate is primarily due to the very low participation rate among
women and youth. Only one in five working age women participate in the labor
market, compared to 73 percent among working age men (Figure 4). In addition, less
than two out of five youth (between 15-24 years) are active. Participation rates are
bell-curved as it is low among youth then increases to 57 percent among individuals
aged 25-34 and decreases to 47 percent among those above 45 years of age. The
level of education does not seem to affect the decision to be active, although it is
slightly higher among those with elementary education or below. Recent evidence at
the national level points to the fact that the economic slowdown and influx of refugees
as a result of the Syrian civil war may have made it more difficult for young Lebanese
to enter the labor market.10 There are significant differences between the participation
rates of Syrian refugee youth compared to Lebanese, particularly among males. Only
nine percent of host community men aged 15-19 are active, compared to over 70
percent among Syrian refugee men of similar age. This difference is also significant,
although to a lesser extent, among those aged 20-24 as 71 percent of host community
men are active compared to 88 percent among Syrian refugees.
	 The reported reasons for inactivity differ greatly by gender. The majority of
women (64 percent) are inactive due to household duties and an additional 28 percent
due to studies. Among those who reported “studies” as the main reason for inactivity,

                                                                                                                      33

     83 percent are less than 34 years old and 75 percent are less than age 24. Among men,
     the majority is inactive due to studies (45 percent), 92 percent of which are less than
     24 years old.

     2.	Employment
     In line with the above, male adult employment rates11 are higher with no major
     differences in education levels. Sixty-eight percent of the male working age
     population is employed, compared to only 17 percent among women (Figure 5). Only
     one-third of the working age youth is employed compared to half of the adults. The
     rest are either in education (around 40 percent), unemployed or inactive (Figure 5). In
     terms of education, workers with elementary education or below had a slightly higher
     employment rate (47 percent) than those with higher levels of education (41 percent).
     This could be explained by low-educated workers not being in the financial position
     to stay unemployed or inactive. Thus, they engage in any job they can find. Those
     with higher levels of education often can afford to stay unemployed until they find a
     satisfactory job.

Regarding employment type, keeping other characteristics constant, women are
significantly more likely to be wage employees (22 percentage points) compared to
men, and less likely to be self-employed or an employer (11 percentage points each).
Age or education attainment does not seem to play an important role in the type of
employment held (Table 4).

                  	 Wage employment is most prevalent among women, youth, and workers with
                  higher education. While over 80 percent of women are wage employees and only
                  15 percent are self-employed or employers, these rates are, respectively, 60 percent
                  and 40 percent among men. In fact, more than half of those aged 45 and above are
                  self-employed or employers compared to just 12 percent of youth. Workers with
                  tertiary level education account for 69 percent of wage employees, versus 58 percent
                  among those with low levels of education. The share of employers with low levels of
                  education is much higher (26 percent) than those with tertiary education (14 percent).

Wage employment is prevalent in non-trade services (79 percent), while self-
employment and employers are prevalent in retail and wholesale trade (63 percent).
Analysis shows that 80 percent of employers and 60 percent of self-employed work in
wholesale and retail trade, while only 37 percent of wage workers are employed in this
sector (Figure 9). Moreover, self-employment and employers represent the majority
of jobs in manufacturing (59 percent), suggesting that this sector is dominated by
artisanal rather than formal industrial activities.

                 Note: Number of observation in Agriculture is too low to make robust conclusion on
                 the distribution of the type of employment in this sector (left graph).

                 3.	Informality
                 	 Informality dominates the labor market in the North. Among the wage employed,
                 more than 85 percent are employed informally, that is without access to social
                 security. This is also the case among virtually all the self-employed and employers.
                 Formal sector employees are more educated than informal employees. More than
                 half of those in formal employment have higher education; around 20 percent have
                 secondary or elementary education or below. Yet, among informal employees, half of
                 workers have elementary education or less. (Figure 10.) Given the relatively higher
                 educational attainment of youth, it is not surprising that youth are more likely to be
                 formally employed.

4.	 Unemployment and Idleness
While unemployment overall is relatively low, unemployment is twice as high
among women (15 versus 7 percent for men), higher among youth and slightly
higher among high school graduates. Unemployment also decreases with age – from
13 percent among youth to five percent among those aged 45 and above. Ten percent
of high school graduates are unemployed, compared to nine percent among those
with tertiary education and eight percent among those with low levels of education.

Women and youth are more likely to be out of the labor force. Controlling for a
set of characteristics, women are 28 percentage points more likely to be out of the
labor force. The level of education does not seem to play a role in the decision to
be economically active or not. Concerning the age category, it is not surprising that
younger individuals tend to be inactive since the majority are still in school. A widow
is 24 percentage points less likely to be active, probably due to cultural reasons and
care-taking responsibilities. Conversely, the male head of household is less likely to
be inactive by the same margin at 25 percentage points. (See Table 4.)
	 Idleness is high among youth. While a large share of youth aged between 15 and
24 are studying, more than one in five is not in the labor force, education, nor training
(NEET). (Figure 12.) This rate is even higher among young females (33 percent)
compared to men (14 percent), and among low educated youth (41 percent).
	 Joblessness has worsened over time among Lebanese youth, particularly males.
Among this population group, joblessness in areas with less than five percent
of Syrian refugees decreased from 27 to 20 percent over the period 2010-2015. It

     increased significantly, on average, from 10 to 36 percent over the same period in
     regions with more than 20 percent Syrian refugees.12 There are no significant changes

     compared to those with low prevalence.

     C.	Summary: Quantifying the Jobs Challenge

     Drawing on the labor market dynamics outlined above, this section quantifies the
     number of jobs needed to close the gaps in current labor market outcomes. It first
     discusses the annual job creation requirement based on demographic trends to
     maintain steady-state outcomes. Then, it assesses the scale of the gap in terms of
     overall employment and the availability of waged jobs.

     1.	 Demographics and labor force growth
     Demographic trends have important implications in shaping the labor market.
     Fertility rates dropped significantly in the 1990s and early 2000s in Lebanon. They
     started increasing again in the 2010s, reaching 1.7 children per woman in 2014. Life
     expectancy has also increased from 70 to 79 in two decades. These trends will have
     significant implications on the labor force (Figure 13). In the short-to-medium term,
     it will mean a somewhat reduced rate of new labor force entry in the coming decade,
     slightly lowering pressure on the labor market. The current population in the North,
     not including the Syrian refugees, is approximately one million.

Even with this slightly declining population rate and assuming that participation rates
remain at current low levels, demographics alone will still push around 8,000 new
Lebanese entrants into the labor market on average per year.13 Assuming that the

     continue to grow at annual compound rates of 2.5, 2.4 and 2.6 percent respectively
     (rates between 2000-2014), and that participation rates remain at 47 percent, the
     total labor force in the North is expected to increase to 362,000 people by 2025. This
     implies the regional economy would need to create approximately 8,000 jobs per year
     over the next five years and beyond, simply to maintain a steady state situation in the
     labor market (Figure 14).

     2.	 Closing the Employment Rate and Waged Employment Gaps
     Addressing the gap in employment in North Lebanon and bringing performance in
     line with the national average requires substantial job creation. With an employment
     rate of just 42.8 percent of the working age population, the North region is behind
     the rest of Lebanon, which at 45 percent is already among the bottom 15th percentile
     globally.14 As Figure 15 shows, closing the gap with the national average would
     require almost 14,000 new jobs in the region – or around 2,800 annually if a five-year
     target was set to reach this goal. Reaching an employment rate above 60 percent,
     typical of upper middle income countries, would require more than 120,000 jobs or
     24,000 per year over a five-year period.
     	 But even this formula only addresses one component of the jobs challenge in the
     North. Among the relatively small share of the population that is employed, self-
     employment rates are exceptionally high (at 46 percent of the employed, according to


42
Jobs For North Lebanon




data from the Household Survey conducted). This suggests that a substantial share of
the population may be forced into self-employment in the absence of available waged
jobs.
	 Figure 16 shows that beyond the jobs required to close the employment rate gap, an
additional 21,000 waged jobs (or more than 4,000 per year over five years) would need
to be created to replace existing self-employment, in order to bring the region in line
with the national average of 62 percent of the employed in waged jobs. To achieve the
upper middle income benchmark of 64 percent would require more than 26,000 jobs.

     Drawing on the labor market outcomes discussed above and the demographic
     characteristics of the working age population, it is possible to identify what needs to
     be addressed in order to face the jobs challenge in the North. Starting with the roughly
     240,000 inactive population, Table 5 examines the characteristics of those for whom
     labor participation “activation” efforts would need to be targeted. The largest group –
     around 168,000 – is female adults. Almost 80 percent of this group is a partner to the
     male head of household and over the age of 35. The majority also has an elementary
     education or less, although there are 40,000 with a tertiary degree. The second key
     group is youth outside of education, training, and the labor force. Among the 37,000 of
     this group, the majority is again women who are non- “head-of-household” partners.
     The average education level of this group is slightly higher. Finally, another 37,000
     of the inactive are adult males, the majority of which are above the age of 45 with
     an elementary education or less. Given these demographics, a target of reaching the
     national average employment by activating around 40,000 over a five-year period as
     suggested earlier would seem a challenging goal. However, within this group there are
     tens of thousands of relatively young, educated, (mainly) women who may have high
     potential for productive employment.

     Table 6 summarizes the characteristics of the active labor force. While the number of
     unemployed is relatively small (around 22,000), they are younger and more educated
     than the population as a whole. This suggests a demand side problem. Yet, it also
     suggests it is likely that this group may be well-positioned to shift into employment
     with appropriate support. Turning to the self-employed and employers, both are

older and overwhelmingly male. The main difference between the two is the higher
education level of employers. Overall, there are 48,000 self-employed and employers
with at least a secondary education.

     Results from the Household Survey15 highlight a number of potential factors impeding
     labor market supply from income-earning opportunities. These encompass impediments
     to wage and self-employment labor, as well as cultural and other institutional factors
     (including job search methods) that result in labor market inactivity. These factors are
     considered, in turn, below.
     	 The methods used by workers to search for jobs and by employers to fill vacancies
     are important determinants in labor market outcomes. In North Lebanon, private
     networks are by far the most prevalent mechanism. In North Lebanon, over half of the
     unemployed search for jobs through personal networks – 32 percent through relatives
     and 23 percent through friends (Figure 17) and only nine percent use the internet. The
     public employment office – the National Employment Office (NEO) – hardly plays
     any role. Therefore, individuals without useful social contacts (often young workers
     in low income families) might be less likely to access the best jobs, even if they have
     the right qualifications.

There are no major preferences among workers between self- and wage-employment.
The data reflects that 55 percent of workers would rather be wage-employees and
cite “less responsibility” (32 percent) and “higher income levels” (27 percent) as the
two primary reasons, followed by access to social security (22 percent) and greater
job flexibility (10 percent). As for the remaining 45 percent who would rather be
self-employed, the vast majority (88 percent) explained this preference to be due to
high flexibility, followed by higher income levels and better prospects but these two
reasons seem to be less important. (Figure 18 to 20)

     The main constraints, revealed in the Household Survey, faced in establishing or
     expanding a business relate to access to finance/credit and financial risks. In the
     Household Survey, 55 percent of workers identified “financial risks” and another 22
     percent cited “access to finance/capital to invest” as the main constraints to starting
     their own business. Among those already self-employed (Figure 21), 42 percent
     would like to expand their business. However, 72 percent face constraints in doing
     so. The leading cited constraints are “financial risks” (55%) and lack of “access to
     finance/capital to invest” (22 percent). The challenge of accessing capital or finance
     can, in part, be related to the low capacity to develop robust business plans and all
     the necessary documentation when applying for a loan, as the majority of the active
     population only has primary education or below.

B.	Education and Skills Levels in North Lebanon

Skills levels and acquisition are important factors in employment outcomes and
productivity. Unemployment and low productivity employment is often attributable
to skill mis-matches relative to the requirements of available job openings. In many
countries, education and training systems often fail to close this gap due to poor
quality and/or weak labor market relevance. This leaves workers ill-prepared for the
labor market. This analysis aims to measure the level and type of skills of workers,
both employed and unemployed, in North Lebanon. The aim is to identify accurately
the gaps between the skills available and those needed by the selected value chains
and to support the creation of specific jobs most suited to the skills available.

1.	 Education
The majority of the active population has low levels of education, especially among
adults. The survey reveals 45 percent of the active population has elementary education
or below, while 31 percent have completed tertiary education. Youth and adults less
than age 34 achieve higher levels of education with 31 percent (youth) and 42 percent
(adults), respectively, having a bachelor degree or higher. This decreases with age to
reach only 24 percent among those aged 45 and above. Among this latter age category,
more than half have only primary education or below. There are significant differences
in education attainment by gender – half of women have completed tertiary education
compared to just 25 percent of men (Figure 22).

     2.	 Profile of Workers by Skill Levels
     The majority of workers are in unskilled occupations, but women and workers in
     the services sector are more likely to be in skilled occupations.16 The survey reveals
     42 percent of women are doing skilled work compared to 30 percent of men. Not
     surprisingly, a higher share of workers with tertiary education are in skilled occupations
     (52 percent) compared to those with primary education or below (21 percent). There
     are slightly more skilled workers in the services sector (37 percent) compared to the
     wholesale and retail trade sector (32 percent). (Figure 25.)

     C.	The Skills Mismatch

     1.	 Current Situation
     Skills mismatches17 are common, particularly among low-skilled workers and
     employers. Consequently, 48 percent of workers report to have an education degree
     or studies that do not match at all, or only somewhat, those required by the job.

Low-skilled workers reported a higher level of mismatch (54 percent) than high-
skilled workers (36 percent). Additionally, 61 percent of employers reported a high
mismatch between their education attainment and the job held (Figure 24). This rate
is 48 and 43 percent among the self-employed and wage employees, respectively.
Mismatches at the lower-skilled end suggest technical skills, over more traditional
degree and professional training, to be a priority.

2.	 Measuring Skills in a Multi-Dimensional Way
To obtain further perspective on the skills base in North Lebanon and the implications
in terms of potential areas for job initiatives, skills were also measured on a multi-
dimensional level. This entails assessing the skill content embedded in the type of
tasks performed for a given occupation.18 The best way to assess skills information is
to unbundle the qualities required to perform “tasks” at work (for the employed) or in
past jobs (specifically, for the unemployed). The “task approach” methodology breaks
down a job in a series of tasks that can be mapped to a particular type of skill – or
skills bracket. The proposed methodology thus allows for a multi-dimensional notion
of skills. The self-reported answers as to the frequency or intensity of each of the tasks
performed were then used to infer the skill levels of workers in North Lebanon.
	 Five skill brackets were constructed to analyze the skills base in North Lebanon.
This approach was initially developed by Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003) and later
updated by Acemoglu and Autor (2010).19 The skills include:

  i.	 non-routine cognitive analytical: analyzing data/information, thinking
      creatively and interpreting information for others – examples of occupations
      are researchers and artists;
 ii.	 non-routine cognitive interpersonal: establishing and maintaining personal
      relationships, guiding and managing people, coaching and developing others
      – examples of occupations are managers, teachers and sales representatives;
iii.	 routine cognitive: abstract activities that require repeating the same tasks, being

            accurate or exact, and doing structured work – examples of occupations are
            telephone operators, bookkeepers, and cashiers;
       iv.	 non-routine manual: operating vehicles/equipment, using hands to handle/
            control objectives/tools/controls, or any other manual tasks difficult for
            machines to perform as they require dexterity and spatial orientation – examples
            of occupations are truck drivers and janitorial services;
        v.	 routine manual: working at pace determined by speed of equipment,
            controlling machines and processes or any other manual tasks that are intensive
            in repetitive, exact, and structured movements – example of occupations are
            machine operators and repetitive assembly.

     Figure 27 provides an overview of the skills brackets, sub-skills and examples of
     corresponding occupations related to those skills. (Further technical details of this
     methodology are provided in the accompanying technical report.)

     As previously mentioned, the “task approach” is used to infer the level of self-reported
     skills of workers, according to speed and repetitiveness, whether they are manual,
     analytical or interpersonal. Skill indices were calculated at the individual level and the
     analysis reveals significant differences in the skill mix used by workers, depending
     on gender, education level, age group and type of employment. The main results are:
       i.	 By gender: women and men tend to perform different tasks in their jobs. Men
            tend to use more cognitive interpersonal and manual non-routine skills than


52
Jobs For North Lebanon




      women. Women tend to use more cognitive routine skills.
 ii.	 By education level: workers with high levels of education use more cognitive
      analytical and interpersonal skills than those with lower levels of education.
      Cognitive routine and manual skills are more often part of the job for workers
      with secondary education or below.
iii.	 By age group: youth (age 16-24) use more cognitive routine skills than the
      average worker, while adults between 35-44 use cognitive analytical and
      interpersonal skills, as well as manual non-routine skills more often.
 iv.	 By employment type: employees seem to be performing more cognitive routine
      tasks than average workers, in line with the majority of wage-employees
      working in the service sector. Self-employed use more manual skills (both
      routine and non-routine), also in line with the type of tasks required in the
      wholesale and retail sector.

	 Correlations among the five different skills brackets provide new insights into
skill characteristics of different groups (see Table 7). In North Lebanon, analytical
skills are positively correlated with interpersonal and manual non-routine skills but
negatively correlated with routine skills (cognitive and manual). Interpersonal skills
are highly correlated with manual non-routine and to a lesser extent with manual
routine. Routine and non-routine manual skills are correlated. These correlations
suggest that the skill dimensions are certainly not independent from one another. In
other words, there is a certain degree of heterogeneity in the type of skills used to
perform a job; i.e. workers do not use only one type of skill but a combination of
skills. For example, workers using cognitive interpersonal skills to perform their job
usually also use their analytical skills, given the positive correlation among those
(Table 7). Therefore, if training is to be offered to certain occupations, it is important
to provide a combination of technical, cognitive, and non-cognitive skills, as all those
skills are needed for a given job.

     D.	Training and Skills Providers

     The availability of skills training services to cater to demand and address the
     mismatches that exist in the North is another key factor. To better ascertain the market
     for service providers, a stock-taking was undertaken, which indicated the following in
     terms of registered education and skills training providers in the North:

       •	   10 Universities, including 1 public university
       •	   98 Technical Institutes: 41 public, 57 private
       •	   Certified Trainings offered by Ministries of agriculture, labor and social affairs.
       •	   Training Providers (NGOs, INGOs)
       •	   634 Schools (K-12): 347 public, 77 semi-public, 210 private

     	 This analysis indicated that there were some 55,600 registered students20 for
     certified degrees at the bachelor and technical levels in the North (2014/2015). At the
     bachelor level, the total number of registered students is 18,170.21 Within this group,
     36 percent are female. At the technical degree level, the total number of students is
     37,428, of which 44 percent are female, divided across public and private institutes.
     These numbers exclude those studying at unlicensed institutions. It is worth noting,
     while bachelor level students in the North constitute approximately ten percent of the
     national total, students at the vocational level represent approximately 40 percent of
     the registered total in the country. This suggests the region may have a comparative
     advantage in terms of the vocational training level of its workforce. Additionally, as of
     2015, there were 4,970 students registered in short-term training courses in the North,
     excluding those registered in the numerous trainings offered by NGOs and INGOs.
     A number of conclusions about this landscape can be drawn from the assessment
     conducted:

       •	 Relevant specializations: Many of the specializations required to support the
          growth of key value chains, such as in the agribusiness and waste management
          sectors, are offered in the North, with some key exceptions in technical
          specializations. A deeper review of the curricula would be needed to identify
          what exactly the current programs cover and what they lack for specific value
          chains.
       •	 Collaboration with the private sector: There is limited private sector coordination,
          including on curricula amendments. Interviews with training providers indicate
          that public providers, and even private technical institutes, do not partner with
          the private sector. Also, changes to the curricula are tightly regulated by the
          government. Insofar as it takes place, it is limited to the private universities.
       •	 Financial access: Private education is quite expensive whether at the bachelor
          level or at the technical level. Providers confirmed the survey results that
          the main reason behind dropouts is financial challenges. The exception to


54

      this is agribusiness specializations at the technical level. Here, the Ministry
      of Agriculture provides all education at this level, covers the tuition fees and
      provides subsistence subsidy.

E.	Conclusions on Labor Market and Skills

The above findings provide what is at times a stark picture of the labor market in
North Lebanon. It is characterized by substantial informality that potentially amounts
to more than 90 percent of all those employed, which is in itself just 38 percent of the
working age population. It is further indicative of a fragile and vulnerable economy,
one in which youth and women are highly disadvantaged, as summarized in Box 2:




Box 2: Summary of Key Labor Market Outcomes by Gender and Youth

Gender
There are significant differences in key labor market indicators between men and
women. This points to the need for labor policies and programs to be tailored to
address the specific and different barriers to entry between men and women.
Individuals may be able to work but face nonmarket constraints to joining the
labor force (e.g. caretaking duties, lack of transportation to the work place, ability
to decide to work). Understanding those constraints by gender would be crucial
to improve labor market outcomes for both men and women. The analysis of the
2016 household level survey in North Lebanon reveals the following:
   •	 Eighty percent of women do not participate in the labor market (compared
      to 73 percent among working age men), primarily for due to home duties
      (64 percent reported it as the primary reason).
   •	 In line with low activity rate, 68 percent of the male working age population
      are employed, compared to only 17 percent among women.
   •	 Exacerbating the very low share of working age women participating in
      the labor force, the unemployment rate is twice as high among women (15
      percent) compared to men (7 percent).
   •	 The majority of active women are wage employees. While self-employment
      is more prevalent among men, 80 percent of women are wage employees.
      Only 20 percent are self-employed or employers, while the latter is 40
      percent among men.
   •	 Women have higher education attainment than men, as half of active
      women have completed tertiary education compared to 25 percent of men.
      Consistent with higher education attainment, women represent a higher
      share of skilled labor - 42 percent of women are skilled compared to 30
      percent among men.

        •	 In line with the above findings and controlling for a set of characteristics,
           women are more likely to be out of the labor force (28 percentage points).
           If active, women are more likely to work as wage employees (22 percentage
           points) compared to men.
        •	 Women and men tend to perform different tasks in their jobs - men tend
           to use more cognitive interpersonal and manual non-routine skills than
           women, while women tend to use more cognitive routine skills.

     Youth
     Age plays an important factor in the types of jobs and skills a worker attains.
     Although the active youth tend to be more educated than the older generation, it
     also has a high rate of idleness. The labor market indicators by age help identify
     the constraints faced by youth in accessing the labor market. Focusing on the
     youth age group, the analysis of the 2016 household level survey in North
     Lebanon reveals the following results:
        •	 One-third of the total youth population within the working age is employed,
           compared to 50 percent among adults. The rest are either in education
           (around 40 percent), unemployed or inactive. Youth still in education is the
           main reason behind the inactivity.
        •	 There is a high rate of idleness among youth as 23 percent of the youth
           aged below 25 are not in Education, Employment or Training (NEETs). This
           rate is even higher among young females (one third) compared to men (14
           percent), and among low educated youth (41 percent).
        •	 Youth have the highest rate of wage employment with an 80 percent share.
           Whereas, only 49 percent of workers above age 45 are wage employees.
        •	 Youth seem to have achieved a higher level of education, with 31 percent
           having a bachelor degree or higher compared to 24 percent for adults older
           than 45.
        •	 Formal employment is more prevalent among youth, possibly due to their
           higher education attainment.

                                                                                                                             box continues next page

  •	 Despite the general low level of skills, youth seem to be more skilled than
     their older counterparts. Sixty-five percent of the youth labor are unskilled
     compared to 71 percent of adults older than 45.
  •	 The skills used by youth (age 16-24) tend to lean toward routine-based
     work such as cognitive routine skills and manual routine. Whereas, adults
     between 35-44 use cognitive analytical and interpersonal skills, as well as
     manual non-routine skills, more often.



One of the most striking findings is the relatively limited mechanisms through which
supply and demand sides of the market actually work together to address constraints.
Barriers to entry into the labor force come in the form of poor job search capacities.
People largely rely on personal networks to seek jobs. Training institutes show little
engagement with the private sector pertaining to job opportunities and requirements.
Furthermore, there is hardly any coordination on curricula. Given the significant
levels of skills mismatch cited in the survey, this suggests a seriously short-sighted
approach by the private sector and training institutions.
	 Despite these challenges, there are some positive aspects of the labor market in the
North on which to build. First, labor market participants show significant flexibility.
There is a readiness to switch between wage and self-employment depending on
market conditions, no doubt out of economic necessity. Yet, such flexibility offers an
important mechanism for managing labor market risks. Second, while the labor force
as a whole has low levels of education, youth and women in particular are relatively
well educated. Moreover, there are training and skills institutions in the region that
appear to have a core of relevant training products. This is something upon which to
build. This is particularly true for vocational skills which will be critical for the region
to develop potential in key value chains.

     Labor Demand – The Investment
     Climate and Trade Dynamics for Job
     Creation




     A.	Firms and Job Creation in North Lebanon

     With a labor market providing just one salaried job for every five working age adults,
     the main jobs challenge in the North is almost certainly on the demand side. Put
     simply - not enough firms are investing and hiring. The previous section described
     a number of gaps on the supply side of the labor market, both in terms of overall
     education, skills mismatches and, perhaps most importantly, social and cultural
     barriers to participation. Yet, there remains tens of thousands of relatively educated,
     working age adults outside of the labor force and more still that are stuck in low
     quality jobs. This suggests a gap in job creation by the private sector and a market
     dominated by small and micro businesses, with limited growth among SMEs, very
     few large employers, and almost no significant foreign investment.
     	 On average, every nine out of ten jobs are created by the private sector.22 This
     is the case in Lebanon. In contrast to much of the Middle East, where public sector
     formal employment predominates, the Lebanese private sector is the provider of 87
     percent of the total employment (Figure 28). Yet, while jobs in North Lebanon are
     dominated by the private sector, the public sector, share at 20 percent, is higher than in
     the rest of the country. Figure 29 provides the breakdown of private sector jobs across
     sectors for North Lebanon and the country as a whole.

Data from the household survey (Figure 30) indicates that the majority of wage
employees (54 percent) work in firms with less than nine workers, out of which 41
percent in firms less than five workers. Factoring in the large share of workers who are
self-employed, the data suggests that almost half the working population in the North
works in establishments with no other employees, and well over 60 percent work in
establishments with less than five employees (i.e. micro businesses).

     This finding is supported by available data on the size distribution of firms in Lebanon
     which indicates that almost 95 percent of establishments in the North have less than
     five employees, and 98 percent have fewer than twenty. While no recent data is
     available through national statistical sources, a 2004 census highlights significant
     differences in the firm size structure in Beirut and Mount Lebanon versus the North
     and other regions (Figure 29). Certainly, things will have changed over a decade, but
     it is unlikely that the broad structure will vary much. In fact, no new large employers
     have established in North Lebanon for some time. The census also reveals that just
     15 percent of establishments in the North were registered (formal) compared with
     37 percent in Mount Lebanon and 50 percent in Beirut. Again, this is indicative of
     a small-scale private sector that is unlikely to be oriented toward growth and job
     creation.

     A look at the largest employers in the North reinforces the image of a small-scale
     private sector. Data taken from various national employment directories23 indicates
     that only six of the top 20 employers in the North are private sector companies – the
     rest being mostly hospitals, schools, and the electricity company. The largest company
     in the region – Hallab (a company producing sweets) – is a significant job creator,
     employing around 500. Beyond this, however, no private sector company employs
     above 200 workers and just five employ 100 or more. These include companies in
     food processing, tourism, textiles, and ICT.
     	 Finally, available data suggests that major investments are highly concentrated
     in Mount Lebanon, with very limited activity in the North. Data from 2013 on
     industrial permits issued by the Industry General Directorate and required for large
     investments, indicates that Mount Lebanon accounted for 60 percent of all permits
     issued for construction and new investments. Only 17 of 285 permits issued in 2013
     (six percent) went to investments in the North.

	 All of this gives a picture of a region where the private sector is insufficiently large
and dynamic to generate the scale of employment required to provide adequate quality
jobs for the labor force. In fact, the picture of the North shows an extreme case of what
is already defined as the demand side problem for the country overall. What are the
factors driving this and to what degree is the situation in the North different from the
national picture? More importantly, are there specific barriers in the investment and
business operating environment that, if addressed, could unlock investment and job
creation in the North? The remainder of this section assesses the climate for trade and
investment in Lebanon, including a focus on specific factors in the North.

B.	The State of Trade Competitiveness in Lebanon

1.	 The Trade Sector and Jobs
Expanding existing firms and attracting new ones in North Lebanon will rely on firms
in the regional economy serving larger markets. Trade, therefore, will play a critical
role in finding a sustainable solution to the jobs challenge. For a small economy like
Lebanon with a limited domestic market, international trade – including both regional
and global markets – should be a key vehicle for raising firm productivity and creating
high-value jobs. Well positioned geographically, Lebanon borders the sea and enjoys
close proximity to larger markets - notably Turkey, Egypt, and the European Union
(EU). While Lebanon is a reasonably open economy, with trade comprising about
40 percent of GDP, it runs a large trade deficit. Goods exports account for just 11.2
of GDP, around half the regional average. This ranks Lebanon among the bottom 15
percent of countries globally.
	 Understanding the drivers of weak export performance is important as exporting
firms are a significant contributor to jobs across MENA, including Lebanon. For a
number of MENA countries, firms that export ten percent or more of their output
provide the majority of the jobs.24 For Lebanon, 58 percent of the jobs are provided
by the firms that export ten percent or more. Thus, the nature and content of current
exports, as well as the outlook for Lebanon’s export potential, would have significant
bearing on the nature and future job prospects in Lebanon.

2. Trade Performance and Investment in Lebanon and North Lebanon
Lebanon’s trade structure aligns well with the comparative advantages of the North.
The index of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indicates the sectors in which
Lebanon’s share of exports exceeds the global export share of the same sector,
suggesting that these are the areas in which Lebanon has a comparative advantage.
Among the sectors in which Lebanon has the strongest RCA are vegetables, food
processing, and wood processing, precisely those sectors in which the North is well-
positioned (Figure 32).

     	 Despite this alignment, firms in the North play a limited role in Lebanon’s export
     sector. At a national level, only a small share of Lebanese firms export. According to
     data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys, 68 percent of Tunisian and 54 percent
     of Jordanian firms export ten percent or more of their output compared to just 42
     percent in Lebanon. Export propensity is even lower in the North, just 29 percent of
     firms export directly or indirectly at least one percent of their sales compared with 46
     percent nationally (Figure 31). Also, the share of sales accounted for by direct exports
     for firms in the North is only half the level in the country overall.

     Lebanon has also experienced a decline in export volume due to the disruption of

62
Jobs For North Lebanon




traditional land export routes as a result of the Syrian crisis which is likely to have
had a particularly negative impact on exporters in the North. After a period of strong
relative growth, Lebanese exports slowed in recent years with average export growth
of close to minus one percent during the period 2012-2014. Over half of Lebanon’s
total export goes to the MENA region. Declining exports to this region are attributable
in part to the Syrian crisis. Due to recent oil price declines, there is also a threat
of further reduced demand from a number of key Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
trading partners. Notwithstanding these negative regional market developments, the
current decreasing export volume is characterized by a growing share to the MENA
region since 2011, in part due to declines in exports to the EU since 2009 (Figure 32).

A salient factor behind Lebanon’s weak export competitiveness in Europe is the lack
of quality standards. The majority of Lebanese firms do not have the capacity or
means to meet the quality standards that would be required to enter into the EU and
other high-value markets. This situation is even worse in the North. According to the
World Bank 2013/14 Economic Survey (WBES), only 13 percent firms in Lebanon
seem to have an internationally recognized quality certification, while that share is
only four percent in the North (Figure 35).

     Finally, exporters in North Lebanon fail to take advantage of its strategic geographical
     position due to high costs of trade. The Tripoli Port has recently become a container
     port, having operated only in bulk in the past. For the North, this geographical
     positioning and the availability of critical trade infrastructure through the Tripoli Port
     is among its most important sources of comparative advantage. But, this is undermined
     by a weak customs and trade environment. Both border and documentary compliance
     are more burdensome in Lebanon than in any of the comparator countries (Figure
     34). Similarly, the cost of exporting from Lebanon is also high by world standards.
     Not only is this detrimental to domestic investment, but also it is a major barrier to
     attracting foreign investment that might seek to use the North as a base for regional
     trade. For firms with a time-sensitive inventory model, this would be a significant
     deterrent to investing in Lebanon.

One impact of this failure to leverage sources of trade-related comparative advantage
in Lebanon and the North in particular is low levels of foreign direct investment and
a bias toward market-seeking investment. For a small country with scant natural
resources to extract, the best option is to attract FDI to the host economy where the
investor objective is to improve the global value chain distribution of its operations.
This type of investment, called efficiency-seeking investment, tends to generate
greater and higher paying jobs for the local population.25 In comparison to benchmark
countries shown in Figure 37, Lebanon has a dramatically higher share of FDI coming
in non-tradable activities. Investors in tradables, particularly efficiency-seeking
investors, are motivated by a low-cost, predictable, high-standard environment. The
failure of Lebanon, and North Lebanon in particular, to attract this sort of investment,
suggests gaps in the investment climate which are likely to impact not just foreign
investors but domestic ones as well.

     C.	The State of the Investment Climate in Lebanon

     Analysis in this chapter depicts firms in North Lebanon that are largely micro,
     informal, and predominately oriented to local markets. This suggests an investment
     climate that provides disincentives to job-creating investment by the private sector.
     There are three channels through which the investment climate can potentially create
     more jobs.26 First, reforming barriers to entry spurs the creation of new formal firms,
     thus creating more and better jobs. The scope of entry barrier reforms could range
     from reforming the entry process to proactive government actions. Entry process
     reforms cover business registration, tax registration, obtaining necessary entry, and
     operating permits. Government efforts could focus on promoting competition and
     providing incentives to attract investments. Second, reforms relating to the business-
     operating environment (for instance efficient, predictable and transparent licensing
     and inspection authorities and tax and custom administration) foster firm productivity
     and profitability by reducing the transaction costs of doing business. Third, by
     making the business exit process more efficient and less costly, investment risk can be
     reduced. In Lebanon and the North, there are significant obstacles at all three stages
     of the enterprise life-cycle. This is effectively a multiple choke-hold on job creation
     in the economy.

     1.	 The National Picture
     Lebanon fares poorly in comparative measures of the investment climate. The World
     Bank Group’s Doing Business indicators provide “distance from the frontier” (DTF)
     scores that measure how each country has improved overtime in comparison with
     the “frontier” (i.e., the global best practice). Based on the DTF measure of making
     progress in the doing business environment, compared with a set of countries that
     share some of Lebanon’s characteristics – small market size, open economy, economic
     structure, conflict status or geographic region (Figure 38) – Lebanon appears to be far
     away from the frontier of best practices.

Other than the modest improvement in starting a business and getting credit, Lebanon
has not made progress in any other Doing Business indicator since 2006. Lebanon
performs poorly in eight out of ten different dimensions of the doing business life-
cycle measured in the Doing Business study (Figure 39). Even in the two areas where
Lebanon has made some progress – starting a business and getting credit – it remains
far from the frontier. Lebanon also performs poorly among MENA comparators on a
number of competitiveness pillars. Most notably this includes the World Economic
Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), in particular in respect of three key
competitiveness pillars – institutions, infrastructure, and macroeconomic environment
– where Lebanon’s performance falls short of the MENA regional average.

     2.	 The Investment Climate in North Lebanon
     Results from the WBES highlight the key obstacles hindering formal businesses in
     Lebanon, principally political instability, electricity, and corruption. Many investment
     climate constraints are more acute in the North vis-à-vis the rest of the Lebanon. North
     Lebanon has fared worse than Beirut and the rest of Lebanon on almost all dimensions
     of the investment climate with the exception of labor regulations and skills (Figure

     infrastructure.

Informal competition and corruption represent major obstacles to investment in both
formal and informal firms (Figure 39). In the North, 84 percent of firms indicate they
compete against informal firms versus just 57 percent of firms nationally. In terms of
corruption, 62 percent of firms in the region indicate they expect to pay bribes to public
officials compared with 21 percent of firms for the rest of Lebanon. In the North, 32
percent of the firms have experienced at least one bribe request versus 19 percent of
firms for the rest of Lebanon. The incidence of bribery seems to be particularly high
regarding tax officials (34 percent) and obtaining a construction permit (32 percent).27

Infrastructure constraints in terms of electricity access and usage are also more acute
in the North (Figure 42). The time to obtain an electricity connection in the North
is almost twice that of the rest of Lebanon (which is already high). Firms in the
North also tend to have higher numbers of electrical outages and greater reliance on
generators than the firms in rest of Lebanon. This affects the cost of production and
competitiveness of firms in the North vis-à-vis rest of the country. Losses (as a share
of sales) appear to be much higher for firms in the North relative to those in the rest
of Lebanon.

     Electricity as a constraint varies by size and sector. The lack of electricity does not
     seem to be a major constraint among micro-firms. This may reflect the fact that these
     firms typically operate in services activities that rely less on electricity. However,
     electricity is a severe obstacle to small firms, which could be due to the inability
     of smaller firms to afford alternative electricity sources (generators) on which larger
     firms rely. Not surprisingly, manufacturing firms are more affected by the shortage in
     electrical supply than the services firms (Figure 43).

     Overall, access to finance does not appear to be a leading constraint in Lebanon and
     the evidence indicates no substantial difference between firms in the North and those
     in the rest of the country (Figure 44). However, this conceals some critical gaps. In
     Lebanon, as in many other countries in MENA, small firms have significantly less

access to finance than large firms (Figure 45) and this does impede smaller firms
disproportionately through their life cycle.

Based on the WBES sample of 77 firms in North Lebanon that had been given access
to a loan, small firms were the main contributors to job creation, adding 7.6 jobs
per firm on average, double that of microenterprises. Jobs came predominantly (65
percent) in the tourism, wholesale, and retail sectors. Small firms also added more
jobs for women and youth. Another key aspect appears to be supplier credit: less

     than five percent of working capital is financed by supplier credit, which indicates an
     institutional weakness as well as a lack of robust trust within a network of relationships.
     These limitations have constrained the ability of Lebanese firms to integrate into the
     world – or even regional – economy, as finance and credit are necessary elements
     across all levels of a value chain.
     	 Data on loans made available through Kafalat indicate limited provision in the
     North. For 2013, 12 percent of all Kafalat (Basic) loans went to firms in the North,
     amounting to ten percent of the total credit made available. This is half the level that
     might be expected given the North’s share of the national population. The North’s
     share in other parts of the Kafalat portfolio are even lower, notably in loans to
     small farmers, which might be expected to be much higher given the importance of
     agriculture in the regional economy (Figure 46).

     D.	Institutions and public-private dialogue (PPD)

     The enterprise surveys also reveal a notable lack of trust in public institutions. This
     distrust is reflected, in respect to corruption and “expectations about government
     predictability”. A strong public-private dialogue (PPD) process that facilitates
     consultations between government and private sector on policy priorities and augments
     trust and shared commitments can be a critical catalyst to investment and growth.
     These mechanisms – to be effective and not simply a vehicle for cronyism – need
     to operate with a clear mandate. This includes transparent and inclusive governance
     structures and implementation arrangements, as well as measurable outcomes. In
     the case of Lebanon, there have been minimal institutionalized PPD mechanisms to
     support policy reform. Private sector led initiatives are most commonly initiated by
     business associations and chambers of commerce to address and advocate specific
     policy constraints, and are terminated once the issues are resolved or blocked. There
     is generally little continuity or follow through on the issues raised.

	 Donor organizations and funding partners have attempted to establish more broad-
based dialogue platforms to narrow the gap between private sector and government
priorities. Impact to date is minimal. What currently exists is modest and not well
targeted on policy agendas:

  •	 In North Lebanon, a nonprofit organization was established in March 2011,
     to facilitate the implementation of economic development strategies in
     the North, from Batroun to Akkar. The North Lebanon Local Economic
     Development Agency (NLEDA) was initially established through a UNDP
     initiative. NLEDA is one example of collaboration and partnership between the
     public and private sectors, and civil society. This program, located within the
     Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture in Tripoli, provides program
     implementation, capacity building, and internship programs.
  •	 The Investment Development Authority in Lebanon (IDAL) operates as both
     an investment promotion and export council. IDAL maintains administrative
     autonomy, as it reports to the President of the Council of Ministers. The
     authority is in a position to leverage public private collaboration, in line with its
     mandate. However, it has struggled to provide a robust forum for the promotion
     and retention of foreign direct investment. The last large foreign investment
     into Lebanon was in 2010, which was in the pharmaceutical industry.
  •	 The Economic and Social Council in Lebanon was established in 1999 through
     a presidential decree to promote dialogue and cooperation between the different
     economic and social public and private sectors in Lebanon. The first general
     assembly comprised of 71 members representing all sectors, associations,
     syndicates, vocational and expatriate institutions. The tenure of the general
     assembly expired in 2002. A new general council has yet to be appointed.
  •	 The European Union, in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry, is launching
     a project to enhance the business climate for SMEs, by opening up new markets
     and providing opportunities to producers. The initiative will leverage PPD to
     address the possible modernization and internationalization of the SMEs, with
     a focus on industrial exports. The PPD mechanism will be used as an export
     promotion tool to connect to regional and global value chains. The project will
     focus on three main sectors: ICT, Aromatic Herbs, and Electronic Boards. This
     project has not yet started, as it is still pending a ministerial decree.
  •	 Between 2007 and 2009, the European Commission organized a series of
     dialogue fora, to address key economic and social reform challenges in
     Lebanon and push for reform through dialogue. The fora brought together
     parliamentarians, professional associations and academics to discuss four key
     issues: economic and social development, social policy, competitiveness of
     Lebanese enterprises and completion and, finally, agriculture. The fora reached
     common agreement on the reform priorities. However, no actual reforms were
     initiated due to the absence of the primary decision-makers at the fora.

     	 What is striking about the list above is the absence of a proactive private sector
     engagement. Initiated too often by donors and/or financed by grants, the question
     arises as to the degree of ownership on the part of the private sector and their readiness
     to use this mechanism to leverage reforms that lead to new private investment. Box
     3, provides a summary of the range of types of PPD arrangements in place around
     the world. The example of the Malaysian PPD “PEMANDU”, has a record of
     performance to date and targets the creation of 3.3 million jobs and over US$440
     billion in investment by 2020. This is the type of vision and measurable results-based
     goal that Lebanon should aspire to emulate.


     Box 3: Successful Models of Public Private Dialogue
     Public Private Dialogue fora can vary in structure and composition, based on the
     context and political economy. The diagram below28 exhibits the wide range of
     possibilities present; a dialogue to reach consensus between all parties prior to
     the implementation of a government strategy to the possibility of the imposition
     of the strategy by the government, with some degree of understanding between
     stakeholders. Stakeholders invited to participate in the dialogue process
     may also vary from a focused approach to a broader approach involving the
     majority of the active groups in the society. The countries covered by this
     research piece have used a different dialogue structures. Finland, Singapore and
     Ireland have benefited from setting up structured formal dialogue fora, while
     Australia preferred the more ad hoc formal structure using focused committees
     and councils to address specific issues, Spain and Sweden relied on informal
     structures and the Czech Republic, Malaysia, New Zealand and Republic of Korea
     resorted to a Hybrid model, combining various approaches mentioned above.

Under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad (1981-2003), Malaysia started its
industrial reform program, focusing on attracting foreign direct investment in
export-oriented manufacturing. To achieve that goal, decision making became
centralized with strong linkages with the private sector. This provided an
opportunity for the private sector to become engaged in policy dialogue with the
government officials. This was the starting point for the creation of the public-
private platform PEMANDU, which was formed in 2009. Its mandate is to monitor
the Government of Malaysia’s government transformation program (GTP) and
economic transformation program (ETP), whose target is for Malaysia to become
a high-income nation by 2020. PEMANDU is a facilitation vehicle for the design,
development, monitoring, evaluation and revision of Malaysia’s reform plans.
PEMANDU originated in Malaysia and has recently been replicated in Tanzania,
India, and South Africa.

The PEMENDU process starts with the development of a detailed action plan
that is broken down into time bound subject focused working groups (6 to 9
weeks Labs). The ‘Labs’ bring together key public and private stakeholders in
the selected area of focus. The goals are transformed into key performance
indicators (KPIs). The KPIs are verified to ensure availability of resources for
implementation and then raised approved by a steering committee. Progress
is regularly monitored across the different departments and entities involved,
to identify any implementation issues or bottlenecks. Disputes are raised to a
higher level for resolve. During the evaluation stage, goals may be readdressed
or redefined. The research indicates that at least 30% of the initial plans are
implemented without modification or revision. The remaining 70% are subject to
revision as implementation proceeds.

Malaysia is on track for its 2020 ETP income target with an annual growth rate
of more that 4 percent per annum, with public and private investment high in
absolute terms, and GNI per capita has risen to US$10,060 in 2013. GDP growth
in Q1 2014 exceeded expectations, at 6.2 percent year-on-year. Almost two thirds
of the original 13 GTP targets from 2010 have been met in 2011, and one-half
were met in 2012. Indicators that did not meet their targets, in either year, did
show an increase in absolute performance during that period. (For example, the
public transport modal share in KL increased from 12 to 21 percent from 2009-
13, but this was below the original target of 25 percent). In the ETP, similarly, key
sectors like of oil and gas, palm oil and electronics, have achieved approximately
70 percent of the core KPIs.

     CHAPTER 5

     Assessing Value Chains for Jobs in
     the North




     A.	Introduction: Why Value Chains?

     This section reports on the results of assessments carried out on two value chains
     in North Lebanon – potatoes and solid waste/ recycling. The value chain analyses
     were designed to achieve two objectives: (i) to provide a sector (value chain) specific
     lens through which to explore the opportunities and challenges of job creation in the
     North; and (ii) to consider the scale and nature of the job creation potential available
     in specific, high priority/high potential value chains. Given the unlikelihood – in the
     current political and legislative environment - of pursuing significant economy wide
     reforms to support private sector investment and growth, value chains represent one
     avenue of opportunity that, requiring less national level policy and legislative action,
     could – with targeted support - be encouraged to grow and generate new jobs. These
     value chain assessments can identify what may be achievable in terms of delivering
     more and better jobs and what is required for this to happen.
     	 In selecting two value chains for the initial analysis, a shortlist was developed
     based on key sectors in the region. A shortlist of value chains was assessed through a
     set of selection criteria that provided a high-level evaluation of each sector in terms of:
     i) existing scale, sustainability, and competitiveness; ii) potential jobs impact (quantity
     and quality) of growth in the sector; and iii) readiness of the sector to engage in
     upgrading and the degree to which an initiative would offer additionality with respect
     to recent and ongoing initiatives. Table 8 summarizes the results of the assessment.
     Four value chains stood out: vegetables (potatoes), fruits (apples), construction, and
     solid waste/recycling.
     	 Following a presentation and discussion with the Government Working Group in
     January 2016, it was decided to focus the initial analysis on potatoes and solid waste/
     recycling. Potatoes were selected primarily because it is one of the largest agricultural
     activities in the North, with a strong reach into the rural areas (particularly Akkar) of the
     region, while also connecting to urban areas through trade and processing. Solid waste
     and recycling was chosen primarily because of the opportunity to leverage substantial
     investments being made through OMSAR (funded through the European Union) in

solid waste and sorting facilities across the North. This provides the possibility to
generate significant spillover benefits that could accrue both to downstream industries
(paper, plastics, metals), and to the society more broadly (positive environment
externalities).30 This, in turn, offers potential job opportunities at higher skill levels.

     B.	The Potato Value Chain

     1.	 Global and National Context
     Potatoes are a major staple crop with global production reaching around 500 million
     metric tons and global trade US$10-15 billion annually.31 Increasingly, production is
     concentrated in Asia (especially China, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), although
     Europe (especially France, Belgium, Germany, and Poland), and the US remain
     significant players. Global trade in potatoes grew more than seven percent annually,
     while production increased almost four percent.32 Fresh potatoes account for almost
     60 percent of global trade by volume but just 30 percent by value, while trade in
     processed products dominates in value terms and starches represent the highest value
     product. Large processors are beginning to spread their operations globally, not only
     to access supply but also to establish production facilities closer to markets. This
     includes North American-based McCain’s, Lamb-Weston, and J.R. Simplot (the
     largest supplier of McDonald’s French fries). The Netherlands-based Farm Frites and
     Aviko have also recently set up large-scale processing operations in China, India,
     Turkey, and Egypt among other locations (Figure 45).

     Lebanon has long been a significant potato producer, with relatively large domestic
     per capita consumption and a competitive position in regional markets. Figure 46
     shows that production peaked just below 515,000 tons in 2008, declining sharply
     thereafter, to below 300,000 tons in 2011 and 2012, due in part to a weak regional
     export markets. But, production then rose sharply, reaching 450,000 tons in 2014. In
     most years, domestic producers capture a 70-75 percent share of the local market for
     fresh potatoes.

With production yields at about 25 tons per hectare, Lebanon is competitive in regional
markets. Yet, it remains squeezed out of global markets by the highly productive
exporters (mainly in EU and US, with yields over 40 tons per hectare, primarily for
industrial use) and the large volume, low cost producers like China and Pakistan (with
yields in the 15-20 ton per hectare range). Syria, Jordan, UAE, and Saudi Arabia
together account for 90 percent of exports over the past decade (Table 9). In the early
2000s, Syria was the leading export market, accounting for around 35,000 tons a year,
but volumes declined through the decade and then collapsed after the start of the war
– from over 15,000 tons in 2011 to just 1,300 in 2012. This contributed to a significant
decline of exports in 2012. However, by 2013 exports recovered sharply with large
increases to Jordan, UAE, Kuwait, and Egypt making up for the decline in Syria (as
well as Saudi Arabia). This export growth comes despite large transport cost increases
incurred when exports were no longer able to route through war-torn Syria to the
regional markets. Despite this robust export performance, Lebanon does run a trade
deficit in value terms, with export unit values much lower than import unit values.
This is explained in part because Lebanon imports substantial, high value potato seed
and exports only raw potatoes.

2.	 The Potato Value Chain in North Lebanon
Overview: The North region represents Lebanon’s second largest concentration of
potato production, with approximately 80,000 tons of output, coming mainly from the
Akkar plain. The main players in the value chain are summarized below and Figure
49 provides a summary of the basic structure of the potato value chain in the North:

  •	 Potato seed production: Most seeds are imported, mainly from the EU. Some
     farmers in Akkar produce seed for their own use and for sale into the late-
     season Bekaa potato crop.
  •	 Input dealers: There is a small number of key input providers, who tend to
     supply fertilizers, equipment and imported seeds. The market is seen as an
     oligopoly in the North.
  •	 Farmers: This is the primary activity in the North (see further discussion
     below).
  •	 Traders and exporters: Around 30 traders are set up in the North. Traders
     tend to be segmented between those who serve local markets and those who
     package for export markets. This is a powerful part of the value chain in the
     North, as it controls distribution and dominates the investment in post-harvest
     infrastructure.
  •	 Retailers: The majority of potatoes are sold through the smaller-scale retail
     distribution network. Substantial volumes also go through large retailers like
     Spinney’s and small volumes, via one or two farmers in North go to Carrefour
     in Beirut.
  •	 Processors: Two processing facilities exist in the North producing frozen chips
     – Master Frites and Super Frites.

                Production and Marketing: Production comes from a mix of large farms (greater
                than 20 hectares) which account for more than 30 percent of production and a large
                number of small farms (600-700) (Table 10). While most of the farms are family
                businesses, the large majority of farmers do not own the land on which they farm but
                rather lease from absent landowners.

                Akkar farmers grow both for domestic and (mainly regional) export markets. Overall,
                10-15 percent of output is exported. Up to another 20 percent of output (up to 10,000
                tons), goes into two local processing factories that produce frozen fries and chips. The
                most common variety produced in the North is the ‘Spunta’ which is favored in the
                domestic market. Some farmers produce the ‘Agria’ (‘Agrico’) variety for EU export
                and ‘Hermes’ for export to Russia.

	 The production system and post-harvest infrastructure (including cold storage and
packing facilities) is less developed in the North relative to Bekaa. This results from
and contributes to a market system that is much more reliant on timing. Producers
in the North tend to plant immediately after receiving seed and market right after
harvesting. Timing on the latter is driven by the North’s advantage of coming to the
market from mid-April until early June ahead of Bekaa’s June and July harvest. The
market system is dominated by traders. Figure 48 shows that not only do virtually
all farmers sell primarily to traders, but most input suppliers and traders are selling
to other traders. Among 91 farmers responding to the survey, 66 have three or fewer
customers and 36 sold all their output to a single trader, while the average small farm
sold 80 percent of its output to one trader. Larger farms appear to be more diversified,
with only 60 percent of their output, on average, going to a single trader. Only two
surveyed farmers export directly and only one had a contract arranged to sell directly
to a processor.

	 Performance of the potato value chain in the North has been greatly impacted by
the Syrian crisis in recent years, on both the production costs and market demand
sides:

  •	 On production costs: The Syrian crisis has contributed to rising input prices
     for farmers, including increasing costs of fertilizers and pesticides (which used
     to be obtained across the Syrian border) and dramatically raising the costs
     of land rental for farmers, given high demand from Syrian refugees needing
     shelter. Rental rates are said to have increased three to four times over the past
     five years, and can now reach the equivalent of LBP100 per kilogram (US$67
     kilogram), becoming the single largest cost category for farmers. These market
     factors have been aggravated by periodic climatic shocks (including hail storms

          the Gulf, with the closure of the Syrian route.
       •	 Additional demand and supply factors: The dramatic decline of Lebanon’s
          main export market and rising costs have hit fresh potato exports hard and
          forced a delay to the opening of a major new processing investment made by
          Daher (Masterchips) in Bekaa. The farmers from the North have also reported
          dumping of Syrian product into the Lebanese market in recent years (as they
          are unable to sell in their domestic market). Perhaps of more concern was the
          opening to cheap Egyptian imports that coincided with the Akkar harvest in
          2015. According to farmers, Egyptian product came onto the market at prices as
          low as LBP 250 per kilogram (US$167 per ton), virtually halving the domestic
          market price.

     3.	 Jobs in the North Lebanon Potato Value Chain
     Jobs in the current value chain: Drawing from the survey responses and secondary
     data, Figure 51 provides an estimate of the jobs profile of the current potato value
     chain in the North.33 It indicates that around 9,000 overall jobs exist across the value
     chain, including 1,800 permanent jobs and around 7,200 seasonal positions which
     are very short term in nature. The evidence suggests farms are making use of large
     workforces during harvest time – up to 30 workers per hectare. But seasonal workers
     often get employment only four hours per day and only two or three days during
     the week. Converting seasonal workers into full-time equivalent (FTE) positions (40
     hours a week, all year) results in close to 3,000 FTEs in the value chain. The large
     majority of these jobs come in farming, accounting for two-thirds of permanent jobs
     and 85 percent of seasonal jobs (Table 11). Traders also account for a significant
     number of jobs – more than 500 FTEs and almost 400 permanent jobs.

     As Table 11 shows, there are big variations across the value chain nodes in the types
     of jobs available. Almost 85 percent of jobs on potato farms are seasonal as are close

to 70 percent of jobs in trading. Conversely, over half of jobs in processing plants are
permanent and these require a slightly higher mix of skilled labor. Jobs in processing
as well as input supplies are relatively limited at this point in time, given the current
level of development of the value chain.

Lebanese workers take almost all high-skill positions across the value chain, as well
as the large majority of low-skill permanent positions in processing and trading
activities. Foreign workers dominate seasonal employment and low-skill employment
on potato farms (Figure 52). This is nothing new – potato farms have long relied
extensively on migrant (mostly Syrian) labor for seasonal jobs such as harvesting and
planting. Women tend to be employed in the low-skill activities. While the majority of
these jobs are coming through seasonal employment there is a significant employment
(over 40 percent) of Lebanese females in permanent positions in input suppliers and
processors (Table 12). For Lebanese youth, most jobs are coming in trading, where
more than 80 percent of low-skill permanent jobs are held by youth.

                4.	 Scenarios for Growth and Job Creation in the Potato Value Chain
                This section provides a brief overview of growth scenarios that ascertain their
                implications for jobs in the region.
                	 The first scenario is a significant expansion of exports, based on the recent
                European quota of 50,000 tons that was opened up for exporters from the North and
                Bekaa. The analysis suggests this scenario would create just over 350 permanent jobs
                and another 1,550 seasonal jobs, with around70 percent of jobs coming on farms and
                the remaining in trading and inputs. Under this scenario, it is assumed that Akkar
                farmers take half of the quota (at present they are using almost none of it) and that all
                of this comes from new production rather than diverting from existing domestic or
                export markets – i.e. an increase in production and exports of 25,000 tons. Figure 53
                illustrates the impacts of this change through the value chain.

                A second scenario focuses on attracting large-scale investment in potato processing.
                Overall, this scenario would result in close to 2,200 permanent jobs of which 1,200
                would be in processing, trading, and input supply activities that tend to employ largely
                Lebanese workers, including significant skilled positions. This scenario is based on
                the recent processing plant investment made by Daher Foods in Bekaa34 which has the

    86
Jobs For North Lebanon




capacity to process 120,000 tons of potatoes. It is assumed that all demand is met by
new production from the North. Given the large scale of such a project, employment
impacts on the farms would also be much higher than in the first scenario. Figure 54
shows that the processing scenario would create substantial jobs across all parts of
the chain. If, on the other hand, it is assumed that Akkar producers capture just one-
quarter of processing demand, this would result in an increase in potato production
of 25,000 tons, equivalent to the increase under the export scenario. The difference is
that processing demand still delivers strong job creation through the chain. Compared
to 350 jobs under the export scenario, the processing scenario would deliver almost
1,100 permanent jobs.

In practice, the number and nature of jobs created in any growth scenario will
depend to a large degree on the type of investment driving growth (e.g. expansion
versus greenfield investment), as well as the decision by firms on the mix of capital
and labor they deploy. The jobs figures quoted in the scenarios above are subject
to overstatement, if marginal rather than average employment to output ratios are
used. Analysis suggests the creation of high-skilled permanent jobs could be up to 75
percent lower and low-skilled permanent jobs up to 50 percent lower than reported
above taking into account scale economies.
	 What is clear from the analysis is that delivering large-scale, quality jobs will
require a strategy to develop a competitive agri-processing sector in the North. In this
respect, it is important to keep in mind that the assessment of the potato sub-sector is
intended to be illustrative of the wider agribusiness sector in the North. While potatoes
are among the most important crops in the region, this accounts for no more than
ten percent of regional agricultural output. So, scaling this opportunity up, through

     a strategy to upgrade the competitiveness of the wider regional agribusiness sector,
     would offer the potential for the creation of not just a few thousand, but possibly tens
     of thousands of jobs.

     5.	 What Would it Take to Deliver These Jobs?
     Market Opportunities and Competitiveness: What is realistic for the potato sector
     in the North? Export-led growth will require tapping into new markets, particularly
     given that Lebanon’s traditional market in Syria is not expected to recover in the near
     future. Lebanese exporters have not yet taken advantage of the 50,000-ton quota from
     the EU made available to Akkar and Bekaa producers up until at least 2017. Can
     Lebanese exporters compete in these more sophisticated markets? At present, average
     import prices in the European markets are US$400-500. Farmers from North Lebanon
     can typically produce as low as US$200 per ton, although recent price increases
     have pushed prices above US$250 toward US$270. Shipping costs, given the loss of
     overland route through Syria, can rise to as high as US$7,000 per container, according
     to exporters. This can push landed costs into these markets above US$500 per ton
     (Figure 53). This excludes the costs and margins borne by the traders who organize
     export. At these shipping rates, it appears difficult for Lebanese producers to take
     advantage of European export markets. Regional markets look more attractive with
     slightly higher prices. In the short term, however, transport barriers will even make
     competing in these markets challenging for Lebanese potato exporters.

     The difficult external environment suggests a focus on the processing end of the value
     chain. Here, timing risks in the market can be managed better and higher value added
     potential can mitigate the impact of some of these extraordinary costs. Figure 54 gives

a sense of the additional value available in the processing channel, where reported
buying and selling prices from the survey suggest that even trader margins in this
channel are higher than in the domestic retail and export channels.

Some Lebanese processors have already had success in exporting frozen fries and
branded potato chips to regional markets. But can this translate into success on a larger
scale? The investment patterns of the largest global potato processors suggest that
competitiveness is driven primarily by production scale and efficiency. It also tends to
be driven more by access to inputs than to markets. This is because the perishability
and low-value-to-weight ratio of potatoes makes shipping processed potatoes more
economically efficient than shipping raw potatoes for most processed product (one
exception is potato chips which, due to fragility and high volume-to-weight ratio, are
more typically produced closer to end markets). Thus, investors looking to establish
a potato processing facility will seek locations with: i) access to large volumes of
quality, competitively priced potatoes; ii) land for relatively large factories; and iii) an
environment where they can operate relatively capital intensive production and cold
storage facilities cost effectively.
	 Comparing the structures of production costs in Figure 57, what stands out is that
50 percent of the production cost of processors comes from electricity and fuel costs.
This does pose a challenge in Lebanon where electricity reliability is so poor.

     Figure 58 summarizes the main constraints to operational competitiveness across
     firms in each node of the value chain. Two constraints show up most clearly: access to
     finance and utilities (electricity and water). For farmers, the biggest constraint faced
     in production relates to irrigation and pesticide application. Akkar farmers tend to
     use overhead sprinklers rather than drip irrigation, increasing water usage and raising
     risks of moisture-related crop problems. The second main constraint farmers face that
     impacts level and quality of output is access to high yielding seeds. Purchasing these
     more expensive seeds is the primary reason farmers give for seeking improved access
     to credit. Farmers are currently only able to access credit through some traders. The
     provision of supplier credit is the only support that exists in the current supply chain.

Processors face a somewhat different set of constraints. Electricity is consistently
identified as the biggest constraint to manufacturing. Data presented earlier on the
cost structure of processors shows that electricity and fuel costs (to run generators)
accounts for 50 percent of all costs in processing firms. This makes competitive
production extremely difficult. Two other important constraints are identified by
processors. The first is the environment for trade and customs, which is seen to impact
processors both in terms of exporting and accessing important inputs (in particular,
technology). The second constraint is factory inspections by authorities, which were
identified as a major constraint by two out of three processing firms.
	 Other Constraints to Competitiveness: Figure 57 summarizes the perceived
constraints to business expansion by firms in each node of the value chain. Across
the board, the main constraint identified is market competition, in particular, price
competition. This was highlighted as particularly acute among farmers, who have in
recent years faced major competition from Egyptian imports. According to farmers,
the government allowed traders and processors to import large quantities of Egyptian
imports duty-free just prior to the 2015 harvest, which resulted in prices collapsing
from LBP350 per kilogram to LBP 250 per kilogram in the domestic market. Finally,
another key factor holding back growth of potato farmers is the existing market system,
whereby farmers operate without any control over the market and are therefore subject
to fluctuations in prices on both the input and output sides. At present, no integration
exists in the supply chain, with virtually all sales coming through ad hoc trading
arrangements. Just five percent of farmers surveyed have a formal contract, and just one
of three processors sells with a formal contract. And, when formal contracts do exist,
they typically do not guarantee price but specify volume commitments (from both
sides, subject to quality) at prevailing (daily) market prices. Focus group discussions
with farmers uncovered issues of lack of trust between farmers and processors on
contract arrangements.

               The lack of supply chain integration not only has implications for managing prices
               and costs, it also prevents learning and technological upgrading in the chain. Table 13
               shows how few actors in the value chain receive training support from their clients.
               Survey results also show low levels of technical support and technology transfer. One
               implication of poor training and technology transfer in the value chain is that farmers
               struggle to meet the quality standards required in key markets, such as Europe where
               GlobalGAP-type standards are the norm.

               Finally, it is worth considering how access to skilled labor may hold back future
               growth in the value chain, particularly development of the processing sector. While
               the greatest demand in the value chain is for workers with no educational background
               (and often no experience), this is at the farming node where demand for higher skilled
               workers is very limited. The higher skill opportunities are much better at the other
               nodes of the chain, including processing, where hiring of secondary and even tertiary
               education workers is far more frequent.

Evidence from the surveys suggests that some labor shortages and /or skills gaps exist
in the current value chain. For example, when asked why they make extensive use
of seasonal labor, in addition to seasonality (the main reason), 60 percent of farmers
and traders and all three processors indicated skills or labor shortages. It is unclear
which of these predominates. In the case of farming, it is likely to be an issue of
labor shortage, or more specifically that Lebanese workers are unwilling to take on
seasonal farm labor at the low wages (at or below national minimum wages) on offer.
This may also be the case for trading and processing. But, there is also evidence in
these activities that actual skills gaps exist. For example, Table 14 shows that all three
processors, 80 percent of input suppliers and 70 percent of traders identify skills as
a barrier to hiring. What are the specific skills that appear to be both important and
missing? In addition to job-specific technical skills (for input suppliers and farmers),
problem-solving skills were highlighted as most critical and difficult to find for
processors and traders. Other key skills gaps appear to exist in both cognitive (ability
with calculations and numbers) and non-cognitive (leadership) skills. For low-skilled
workers, the emphasis was on physical strength and dexterity, although gaps were
identified also in teamwork and time management skills.

     Despite skills gaps, firms do not appear to see training as a solution. This is
     understandable in the context of seasonal activities and possibly for low-skilled
     activities where high turnover of workers is a problem. Yet, firms even fail to invest in
     training skilled, permanent workers. No processors and just one farmer out of the 91
     surveyed provided even one day’s worth of formal training to their workers in the past
     year. None provided training to skilled workers. Even on-the-job training is minimal
     for high-skilled workers– just eight farmers reported providing on-the-job training
     for high-skilled workers, while processors provided an average of just three hours of
     on-the-job training annually.

     C.	The Solid Waste and Recycling Value Chain

     1.	 Global and National Context
     The global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation level in 2010 was approximately
     1.3 billion MT per year. It is expected to increase to approximately 2.2 billion MT
     per year by 2025. This represents a significant increase in per capita waste generation
     rates, from 1.2 to 1.42 kg per person per day. However, global averages are broad
     estimates only, as rates vary considerably by region, country, city, and even within
     cities.
     	 Generation:	 According to the Regional Solid Waste Exchange of Information
     and Expertise Network in Mashreq and Maghreb Countries (SWEEP-NET), Lebanon
     produced 2,040,000 tons of MSW per year. The per capita MSW generation in rural
     areas is 0.85 kg/person/day on average, whereas, MSW generation ranges from
     0.95kg/person/day to 1.2 kg/person/day in urban areas. The high production rate of
     1.2 kg/person/day pertains to the region of Beirut and parts of Mount Lebanon.35 The
     daily waste generation of each major district in Lebanon is summarized in Table 15.

The Ministry of Environment (MoE) of Lebanon has projected an annual national
growth rate of waste generation of 1.65 percent rising from 1.57 million MT to 2.4
million from 2009-35. This growth rate varies by region depending on the rate of
urbanization, growing consumption, lifestyles, and level of environmental awareness.

Composition:	 Several studies have been conducted to analyze the waste
composition in Lebanon since 1994.36 According to the State of the Environment
Report (SoER 2001) by the MoE, about 90 percent of the total solid waste stream
generated in Lebanon is MSW. The main sources of MSW are households, commercial
establishments, street markets, street cleaning operations, and public garden pruning.
Organic waste is by far the single largest component of the MSW stream, representing
50-55 percent of waste output (Figure 61).

     Municipal Waste Management: Waste collection in Lebanon is mainly contracted
     to private companies or managed by municipalities and local contractors. Although
     there is a generally high level of waste collection coverage, the systems in rural
     areas are poor compared to urban areas. This is because contractors often lack
     sufficient equipment, and municipalities may not always have adequate enforcement
     capacity.37Despite progress in recycling since the 2006 conflict with Israel, 77 percent
     of MSW still ends up in landfills and open dumps (Figure 62).

     While there are opportunities to compost organic material, in the absence of pre-
     sorting, the organic material contains a substantial amount of metals and plastics,
     and is considered too “hot” to compost. Pre-sorting and on-site sorting of recyclable
     material, particularly metals, plastics, and paper will be an important first step toward
     reducing reliance on landfill and dumps, while expanding composting and recycling.
     Currently, only eight percent of Lebanon’s MSW is recycled. Collection of recyclable
     materials is, to a large extent, carried out by scavengers operating at various waste
     collection sites in urban areas. It is thought that somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000
     scavengers operate in Lebanon.
     	 While scavenging continues to be an informal activity, recycling is a relatively
     well organized and profitable business with a set hierarchy of scavengers, collection
     point owners, and recycling plants. Collection points are scattered throughout urban
     centers and suburbs in empty lots and other empty wide spaces. These are “owned”
     by individuals who normally deal with a single recycling plant depending on the
     goods available for recycling. The collection point owners have their own groups
     of scavengers working for them, to whom they provide homemade carts to haul
     scavenged goods, along with food and shelter. The recycling plants, on the other hand,
     provide the collection point owners with pick-up trucks to transport recyclable items
     from the collection points to the recycling plant.

2.	 Municipal Waste Operations and Performance in North Lebanon
According to SWEEP-NET (2014), North Lebanon produces over 1,000 MT of waste
per day - approximately 18 percent of the total national waste output. Based on an
estimated population of 1.1 million inhabitants producing an average of 0.92kg of
waste per person per day, the total annual waste production in North Lebanon is
approximately 369,380 MT (Table 16).

Taking into consideration the weakness and in some locations, complete absence
of structured MSW collection and transport infrastructure in North Lebanon, the
estimated cost of collection and transport in Tripoli, for example, is US$64/MT. This
represents twice the cost in Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon (US$32/MT) where
more established MSW collection and transport systems are currently in operation.38
The supply chain for the municipal solid waste management facility in Byblos is
representative of how a waste management facility in Lebanon is generally structured.
It is, however, not operating at the level of international best practice. Specifically, no
pre-sorting is currently taking place, and the on-site sorting line is not operational due
to equipment breakdown (Figure 61). Currently, the facility allows 25 scavengers to
collect recyclable products from the landfill site free of charge. When on-site sorting
equipment was operational, the facility sold recyclable material (uncleaned), namely
plastic, paper, and metals (aluminum and steel) to traders.

Due to the absence of pre-sorting, organic material at the facility contains high
concentrations of metals and plastics, making it unsuitable for composting for
agricultural use. Additionally, in the absence of an operational on-site sorting line, all
forms of municipal waste are currently bulldozed into a landfill.

3.	 Jobs in the North Waste Management and Recycled Products Value Chain
The municipal waste management and recycled products value chain is divided into
four major market segments: (i) hauling; (ii) municipal waste management; (iii)
recyclable product trading; and (iv) processing of recyclable products.39 While there
are no official figures for the number of jobs in each of the four market segments,
survey data makes it possible to estimate the number of workers currently engaged
in this market in North Lebanon. With a fully operational waste management and
recycling supply chain infrastructure, the sector could be employing approximately
4,577 workers (Table 17).40 In reality, however, the actual number of workers
employed in this sector is currently a fraction of this estimate.

Of the relatively small number of workers in the waste management and recycled
product sectors, approximately 17 percent are permanent high-skilled and 79 percent
permanent low-skilled workers. The number of seasonal and temporary workers
is relatively low. However, this does not account for the scavengers who collect
recyclable material from the landfill (Table 18).42 Female participation in the sector
is low, at 6.7 percent of the workforce across the entire value chain. Foreign workers
account for about 30 percent of the jobs, but mainly in low-skilled work. Workers
under the age of 25 years of age were nearly 13 percent of the total.

                  4. Scenarios for Growth and Job Creation in the Solid Waste and Recycling Value
                  Chain
                  Based on a fully operational waste management to recycled products value chain,
                  the estimated number of jobs along the entire value chain is expected to reach 4,968
                  by 2020 and to 5,390 by 2025 This potential job growth was calculated based on
                  two assumptions. First, that waste management facilities in North Lebanon are fully
                  operational, accounting for the collection of at least 99 percent of municipal waste,
                  and all sorting lines are operational with a functioning supply chain infrastructure for
                  recyclable products. While it is not likely that 100 percent of the waste management
                  and recycled product supply chain infrastructure can be operationalized for a number
                  of years, the following estimate is based on the survey data which indicate the potential
                  job creation and income generating opportunities available in these sectors. Second, an
                  annual growth rate of 1.6 percent resulting in an estimated municipal waste output in
                  North Lebanon reaching 400,876 MT by 2020 and 435,058 MT by 2025. (Table 19).

The highest number of jobs is expected to be concentrated around traders of recyclable
material (ranging from 1,769 in 2020 to 1,919 jobs by 2025), followed by steel processing
(ranging from 712 in 2020 to 772 by 2025). Further breakdown of jobs according to type
indicates that approximately 24 percent of new jobs will be permanent high-skilled jobs,
while 70 will be permanent low-skilled jobs (Table 20). The highest concentration of
permanent high-skilled jobs (29 percent) is expected to be in the trading sector, followed
by the paper sector (25 percent). In part, this is explained by the fact that recyclable
products are exported and require skilled employees to manage such trading activities.
Women are expected to account for less than six percent of jobs. People under 25 years
of age will account for even fewer jobs (4.1 percent) in the waste management and
recyclable products value chain. Foreign workers are expected to account for about 30
percent of the jobs, but mostly low-skilled.

Jobs For North Lebanon




Since only eight percent of municipal waste is currently recycled, there are substantial
opportunities for waste management facilities to engage in cost recovery activities.
A critical challenge for municipalities revolves around financing collection and on-
site waste management, including sorting, so that tradable products are sold to local
companies for recycling, repurposing, and trade. According to SWEEP-NET (2014),
the total cost from collection to disposal is estimated to be US$92/MT in Tripoli.
Based on this figure, the estimated cost associated with operating waste management
facilities in North Lebanon is expected to reach approximately US$36.9 million by
2020, and US$40.0 million by 2025. If revenue from sales of recyclable products
can be realized (outlined in Table 21), Northern municipalities would be able to
cover approximately 85 percent of waste management facility operating costs, while
creating over 5,000 jobs.

5.	 What Would it Take to Deliver These Jobs?
Market Opportunities and Competitiveness: The key elements to be addressed in
order for this sector to create the number of jobs estimated include:

  •	 Awareness raising at the household level of pre-sorting waste;
  •	 Establishing a supply chain infrastructure for collection of pre-sorted waste;
  •	 Installation and efficient operation of on-site sorting at waste management
     facilities; and
  •	 Strengthening the supply chain infrastructure for sales of recyclable products to
     local and regional processors.

Central to the above actions is the installation and efficient operation of on-site
sorting of recyclable products at waste management facilities. The EUR14 million EU
investment support project (Upgrading Solid Waste Management Capacity in Bekaa
and Akkar Regions in Lebanon - SWAM) managed through the Office of the Minister
of State for Administrative Reform (OMSAR) is installing sorting lines in seven sites
in North Lebanon. This is an essential element for creating the anticipated number of
jobs, while contributing to reducing Lebanon’s reliance on imported metal, plastic,
and paper through efficient utilization of locally available recyclable material. The

                                                                                           103

              investment covers 253 municipalities with a population of 1.15 million and an installed
              MSW handling capacity of 1,085 MT/day. It includes: (i) construction of sanitary
              landfill-related infrastructure such as access roads; (ii) procurement of disposal and
              collection equipment (bins, trucks, and compactors); and; (iii) construction of solid-
              waste treatment plants with sorting and composting facilities.
              	 These activities are essential elements for efficient operation of a waste
              management to recycled products value chain. According to OMSAR, support will be
              targeted in the poorest regions, namely Baalbek, Zahle, Jeb Jannie (Bekaa), and Srar
              (Akkar). Installations at the proposed facilities are not expected to be completed for
              several more years. Continued support to ensure timely installation of the facilities
              and collaboration with the 253 impacted municipalities to implement household level
              pre-sorting activities, will be critical for the success of additional job creation along
              the waste management and recyclable products value chain.
              	 Lebanon is an importer of major recyclable products including aluminum, steel,
              plastic, and paper with import values ranging from US$166 million/year for plastics
              to US$813 million/year for steel, some of which could be sourced domestically using
              recycled material (Table 22). Price differentials between the import price of virgin
              material and the price of local scrap for each product suggest economically viable
              alternatives for replacing imported material with similar, if not the same, materials
              made from locally available recyclable material.

   Jobs For North Lebanon




   To assess whether Lebanon is a competitive manufacturer of products using plastic,
   metal, and paper and whether it has the potential to improve its competitive position
   in the regional market, three proxy products were selected as comparators between a
   number of regional countries and China. Specifically, plastic and metal furniture and
   articles made from paper (scrap) were chosen as comparators as recycled material is
   commonly used to fabricate these products. More importantly, there are a number of
   companies currently operating in Lebanon that manufacture these products for export.
   As the figures below indicate, Lebanon is not competitive, particularly against Jordan
   and Turkey, in plastic furniture within the region (Figure 62). For metal furniture,
   Lebanon is moderately competitive, but still lags behind Jordan and Turkey. However,
   for products made of paper and paper articles, Lebanon is highly competitive. Taking
   into consideration that raw material costs can account for 15-45 percent of production
   cost for plastic and metal furniture (depending on the production process and the type
   of material used), these figures suggest that switching from imported plastics and
   metals to locally manufactured materials from recycled products could possibly tip
   the competitiveness scale in Lebanon’s favor.

Analysis of the Cost Structure: Value chain maps44 were created based on the survey
data which highlights the distribution of costs across five basic stages of value
addition, namely input supply, production, packing/ storing, transport, and sales and
marketing. The maps clearly indicate that the highest cost associated with the waste
management to recycled product processing is input supply. For all value chains (with
the exception of waste management where transport cost is the highest), input supply
is the dominant cost, followed by production cost, which consists mainly of labor and
electricity (Figure 63).
	 While a large majority of entities surveyed tend to source their input material from
local sources, their sources are generally traders/importers, and thus only a limited
number of recyclable products are being utilized as a part of the operation’s input.
The value chain map suggests that recycled material usage could potentially reduce
a major portion of the cost incurred by companies currently operating in these key
sectors. Furthermore, the value chain map also indicates that production cost is a major
cost driver. In this regard, lower electricity cost could potentially be realized through
the use of Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) in power plants, which could help to improving
the competitiveness of industries operating in North Lebanon. In addition to the value
chain map, further breakdown of input costs from the survey shows that raw material is
a dominant cost driver followed by electricity, labor, and fuel. As the figures indicate,
raw material costs ranged from 26 percent to 67 percent of the production cost, which
suggests that reducing raw material costs is a key driver of competitiveness along
the waste management to recycled products value chain in North Lebanon. In this
regard, the availability of high quality, cost competitive recycled material to replace
more expensive imported inputs could be an important factor. However, in order for
this to be realized, an efficient supply chain structure starting from household level
pre-sorting of household waste to an efficient supply chain infrastructure for waste
collection, on-site sorting and sales of recyclable products is required.

      Obstacles to Current Operations: What is the view of operators at the different
      stages of the value chain to business potential and constraints? While stakeholders
      anticipate demand growth in the coming years, they were also asked to rank key
      obstacles based on eight variables which could be considered obstacles to current
      operations. Survey results indicate that managers of waste management facilities,
      traders, and plastic and metal processors found financing to be a moderate to high
      obstacle to current operations. Electricity and water were found to be moderate to
      high obstacles to current operations among all in the value chain except for operators
      of waste management facilities. Transport and logistics were considered a moderate
      obstacle among managers of waste management facilities and recycle product traders.
      Only traders found regulations to be a moderate to high obstacle to current operations,
      while crime and security ranked high as an obstacle for plastic processors. There were
      no clear indications why crime and security was a concern only for plastic processors.
      	 Obstacles to Increasing Sales: Stakeholders were also asked to rank obstacles to
      increasing sales. For traders and plastic, paper, and metal processors, price competition
      ranked high. This obstacle may however be attributable to the fact that recyclable
      products are exported and subject to international prices. Reducing unit costs is the
      most effective way to address this market reality. Other variables were not seen as
      prominent obstacles to increasing sales.

	 Importance of Skills in the Workplace: Stakeholders were also asked to rank the
importance of certain skills in the workplace. Skills were divided into the thirteen
categories, including both cognitive and non-cognitive. For permanent high-skilled
workers, nearly all stakeholders along this value chain considered almost all of the
skills categories as somewhat to very important. The top three most important skills
are provided in Table 23. When stakeholders were asked about the importance of
labor skills, companies found them to be a significant obstacle to growth, particularly
in industries like plastics and paper processing where companies are engaged in high
value adding activities. Technical training in these areas is likely to have a role to play
in improving the competitiveness and job outcomes in these target sectors.

      D.	Value Chain Conclusions and Priority Actions

      The analysis of the potato and solid waste/recycled products value chain indicates that
      both sectors have significant potential for job creation, particularly when taking into
      account induced impacts. The value chain represents a relatively small share of the
      overall economy in North Lebanon. Therefore, this is not a ‘silver bullet’ for solving
      the jobs challenge. Moreover, substantial investment and other interventions across
      the value chain would be required to have a meaningful impact on job creation and
      quality.
      	 Regarding the potato value chain, it is clear that development of the downstream
      processing sector significantly changes the jobs outcome story for Lebanese. The large
      majority of existing jobs are low-skilled, seasonal activities on farms with limited
      opportunities for Lebanese workers. Downstream processing provides substantial
      opportunities for higher skilled permanent jobs both in processed potato products
      (e.g. potato chips, french fries, and other potato products) and further downstream,
      in starches and other industrial applications. Development of processing would also
      drive job creation and improve competitiveness and earnings in the farming sector,
      assuming that land could be made available to scale up production in response to
      demand.45 Key challenges to unlock jobs potential in this value chain include actions
      to improve:

        •	   Electricity and other infrastructure to attract large-scale processing;
        •	   Post-harvest facilities and quality systems;
        •	   Access to finance to facilitate access to higher quality inputs;
        •	   Farmer practices for irrigation and pesticide application;
        •	   Supply chain coordination and integration;
        •	   Farm-level coordination and strengthening cooperatives; and
        •	   Skills for the future of the value chain.
        •	   Within solid waste/recycling, in order to realize the direct and indirect
             employment and economic impacts of operationalizing an efficient and
             effective “waste management to recyclable products” value chain, a number of

      interventions (policy, technical assistance, and financing) are needed. Among
      the priorities in each stage of the value chain are:

  •	 Hauling:
      -	 Municipal level resource needs assessment
      -	 Municipal level capacity building on international best practice
      -	 Prepare and distribute handbook on waste sorting
      -	 Pilot deposit-refund system in select municipalities
      -	 Pilot curve side and public drop-off collection schemes
      -	 Establish municipal level waste collection data system

  •	 Waste management:
      -	 Public-private dialogue (PPD) between MSWM facilities and processors to
         estimate demand, price, and quality of recyclable products
      -	 Establish waste intake and output data collection system
      -	 Collaborate with OMSAR to deliver international best practice training
      -	 Support for Parliament to pass the Integrated Solid Waste Management law

  •	 Traders:
      -	 Formalize waste collection network to increase participation of scavengers
         until sorting lines at MSWM facilities come online
      -	 Improve compliance with health, safety and environmental (HSE) regulations
      -	 PPD to engage haulers and traders for pickup and transfer of pre-sorted
         recyclable products to processors
      -	 Establish supply chain infrastructure for RDF

  •	 Processors
      -	 PPD between processors and MSWM facilities to estimate demand, price,
         and quality
      -	 Assess merit of issuing tax credit for use of recycled feedstock
      -	 Introduce penalty for purchasing recyclable material from unlicensed traders
      -	 Assess merit of introducing investment incentives for establishing processing
         line using recycled feedstock

      CHAPTER 6

      Conclusions




      A.	The Job Market in North Lebanon

      1.	 The Challenge of Fragility – Weak Job Creation Leads to Poor Labor Market
      Outcomes and Marginalization
      As portrayed starkly in this report, job creation challenges in North Lebanon are
      substantial. The North is a highly informal, high poverty-level, regional economy
      facing significant and prolonged external shocks combined with a pre-existing
      situation of persistent internal insecurity. Notwithstanding a recent period in which
      public investment has increased, it is a region that has a strong sense of neglect.
      Central government has not been able to move forward with the key reforms
      required to provide a broad-based competitive improvement to the economy of North
      Lebanon, or to provide sufficient targeted support to this lagging region. This sense
      of marginalization was confirmed during the unexpected reversals that the leading
      political parties suffered in the 2016 Tripoli municipal elections.
      	 The labor market in the North, relative to much of the rest of the country, can be
      characterized as “poor, excluded, dangerous, and limited”. Poor for reasons clearly
      portrayed in the poverty data; excluded because – as evidenced in this report – just
      43 percent of the working age population are working and over 90 percent of those
      are informally employed without access to social security; dangerous because of the
      persistent underlying conflict issues of the region; and limited, because so many are
      consigned to under-employment and seasonal work. This is a labor market that has
      exceptionally low female participation and high levels of youth NEETs, resulting in
      significant marginalization of the most educated groups in the population. Overall,
      this contributes to a cycle of alienation and insecurity.
      	 The crux of the problem lies on the demand side – a private sector that fails to
      generate productive jobs. Weak labor market outcomes in the region stem directly from
      a weak environment for private sector investment and growth. This report highlights
      that the North is dominated by micro-enterprises operating in the informal economy.
      Large, growth-oriented, export-oriented firms are severely in short supply. Moreover,
      cooperation among firms, much less integration in supply chains, is extremely limited.
      This failure of the private sector to create good jobs is, of course, not surprising in
      an environment of market and policy instability, poor infrastructure, and a variety of
      other significant shortcomings in the investment climate.

2.	 The Potential for Job Creation – New Pathways
What is also evident in the North is the clear commitment by so many to overcome
these challenges. Discussions with value chain stakeholders, the Tripoli Chamber
of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, other civil society stakeholders and survey
findings of the labor force revealed this commitment. Driven no doubt by necessity, the
informal sector is a powerful measure of readiness and willingness to work. The fact
that so many have found a living in the informal sector is a testament to this. Despite
the brain drain and the reality that over half of the region’s population has only primary
education and lower, there are important levels of untapped and misaligned expertise.
For instance, as noted earlier (Table 6), the estimated 22,000 who are unemployed are
generally younger and more educated than the general population. Creating new job
opportunities for this group must be a first step. Given so many have ICT and related
training and that wage employment growth will not meet demand, especially over the
short-term, these opportunities are likely to come first in the self-employment space.
Attention needs to be paid to foster improved entrepreneurial outcomes.
	 Then, there is fostering greater labor market participation for women. It is not
just the young who are generally better educated. It is also women, of whom some
23 percent possess first degrees and above. They have a stronger set of cognitive
interpersonal and manual non-routine skills than the average worker. If avenues can
be found to address effectively cultural factors and provide support (e.g. acceptable
forms of child care) to assist with family responsibilities, a greater possibility would
exist to bring a larger share of the working age female population into the active
workforce. And, if additionally, incentives and facilities could be developed to
encourage more women into entrepreneurship, it would most likely open up more
wage employment opportunities for women. Research in conservative, fragile markets
has shown that female-headed businesses tend in turn to create proportionately more
job opportunities for women.46 Presented earlier in the report, Box 2 summarizes some
of the key findings on women and youth. It provides guidelines as to what needs to be
addressed and what can be done to engender this segment of the labor force to a more
proactive engagement with opportunity.
	 The evidence that many employers (61 percent) consider there is a mismatch
between education and job offers, prima facie, suggests a significant opportunity to
improve productivity. The evidence shows that, even in the most hostile investment
climates, investment in good business management practices – one aspect of which
is firm investment in staff training – reaps significant gains to the business in terms
of turnover.47 In turn, this encourages investment, growth, and job creation. As this
report elucidates, there is a substantial body of training institutes that could support
this effort. A greater focus on entrepreneurship, particularly at the secondary level, is
an area of curriculum development that also needs to be encouraged and promoted.
	 However, requisite training has to be conducted differently and more inclusively.
The stocktaking of the training institutes in North Lebanon points to insufficient
attention to linkages with the private sector. While they may be privately run, they
nevertheless fall short in coordinating with that part of the private sector that will

                                                                                             113
                                                                          Jobs For North Lebanon




      actually employ their graduates. New ways of targeting specific training programs to
      market demands and remaining agile to adjust programs and curriculum accordingly
      needs to be developed to maintain sustained improvements in job outcome results.
      Given the training drop-out rate or failure to engage in the first place, effective
      mechanisms to extend tuition support are required. and must have a clear focus on
      achieving job results. In other words, these two innovations would need to go hand-
      in-hand to be fully effective.
      	 Two other important conclusions need to be highlighted relating to the importance
      of investment growth and the time this will entail. First, the overall solution to job
      challenges in the North cannot be fixed solely by addressing skills gaps and facilitating
      better job search and skills training. The problem’s scale necessitates new investment,
      growth, and recognition that increased wage employment, even with new investment,
      will only offer part of the solution. While this diagnostic does see the potential of
      considerable permanent, better quality jobs available through the further development
      of selected value chains in both agri-processing sectors and new industries, such as
      recycling, this will take time to develop. It will not, on its own, be sufficient to close the
      jobs gap. Moreover, these transformations will require significant capital investments
      in infrastructure and some related policy shifts – notably in the power sector. These
      policy shifts rest with a central government that, while entirely cognizant of what
      needs to be done, has not for many years been able to make it happen. There is no
      reason to believe this can change in the near future.
      	 Finally, there is significant distance still to be travelled to bring the supply and
      demand sides of the market into more effective partnerships in order to close skills
      gaps and open up new opportunities for job creation. This effort needs to be undertaken
      with a keen sense of what is possible and where the regional economy can go over the
      short, medium and long term. It also requires new ways of more effectively enticing
      private sector risk-taking and investment in fragile settings that are traditionally
      seen as antithetical to private investment. This can involve, for instance, use of
      more targeted, market-oriented financial support to what are fundamentally viable
      commercial ventures negatively impacted by the greater (market and government
      failure) risks resulting from the region’s fragilities. This support could be output and
      outcome-based to incentivize performance, including job creation.48

      B.	Ways Forward for Job Creation in Lagging and Vulnerable
      Regions

      This report provides a diagnostic of the opportunities and challenges to the creation of
      additional, inclusive jobs in North Lebanon. This section presents suggestions on how
      to move forward in addressing these challenges. Finding solutions in North Lebanon,
      or in any lagging region in Lebanon, two key principles should be considered.
      	 First, there will be no one “transformative approach” to the jobs challenge in the
      North. A range of actions – always calibrating to what is politically possible and a


114
Jobs For North Lebanon




bit beyond – will need to be considered with sustained implementation achieved
over an extended period. Critical throughout this period, in addition to a sustained
implementation effort, will be crowding in new private sector activity and investment.
This will entail various strategies at different points of time, often overlapping and
reinforcing. Over the shorter term, this entails a focus on SMEs, taking as given the
current policy and infrastructure environment. Over the longer term, an increased
focus on higher potential value chains – through selective (i.e. “not-so-politically
sensitive”) sector-specific reforms and supporting investments – can in turn mobilize
significant new private investment. In both cases, there are specific labor market and
skills issues to be addressed and outcomes to be achieved.
	 Second, as noted earlier, major macro (economy wide) reforms are highly unlikely.
Many of the significant constraints to business entry, growth, and job creation are
long-standing problems in Lebanon. Solutions are well known but which have not, for
whatever reason, been implementable. While efforts should continue to promote such
reforms, solutions to the regional jobs challenge should not depend in any way on
these macro reforms coming to fruition. Thus, the entry points that are recommended
are at the mezzo-level, through value chains, clusters, and spatial solutions like SEZs
and industrial zones, and at the micro-level, through interventions directly to firms
and individuals (entrepreneurs and job-seekers). (Figure 64.)

      1.	 Short-Term Agenda: Supporting SMEs and Self-Employment
      Starting with the shorter term – a period of maybe three to five years over which no
      policy change can be expected and before potentially growth-inducing infrastructure
      investment of the sort currently underway and\or in the pipeline comes into effect, the
      challenge will be to support SMEs to improve market performance and develop new
      market niches. This focus should also include the informal sector in which so much
      of the Northern labor force work. Micro-level, informal, locally oriented businesses
      dominate the employment landscape but lack the means to absorb even the relatively
      small active labor force.
      	 The current environment in Lebanon is favorable to this focus. In 2014, the
      Ministry of Economy and Trade launched “The Lebanon SME Strategy – A Roadmap
      to 2020”49 which together with the BdL Circular 331 initiative, has created a much
      stronger eco-system for SME growth, providing new sources of financing that
      complements ongoing efforts of the different Kafalat guarantee schemes and other BdL
      subsidized lending program. An important challenge is to foster greater coordination
      and synergies across these initiatives. Pathways need to be found to achieve this and
      direct the resources they entail with more purpose to the specific needs of the SMEs,
      the self-employed and the incipient entrepreneurship class in the North.
      	 Another notable development has been the entrepreneurship eco-system in
      Lebanon. The country has always possessed a dynamic entrepreneurial culture, as
      has been highlighted in the recently published BdL report “Lebanon’s Start-Up Eco-
      System Roadmap”.50 This is being complemented by an increasing number of business
      development service (BDS) providers supporting potential and existing entrepreneurs
      to follow up on business ideas and\or take investment risks to grow their businesses.
      This growing support sector – all non-governmental – has also more recently described
      in the recent World Bank Economic Monitor entitled “A Geo-Economy of Risks and
      Rewards”.51 A further example of this is the uptake of business proposals under the
      IBRD-funded iSME project which has provided 46 concept development grants
      worth US$698,000 providing support to entrepreneurs to build out their products and
      services and improve capacity and market linkages to attract early stage capital.
      	 The challenge is to foster job-creating activity in the North. A particular focus
      on the needs of women and youth and a strong commercial, market-based approach
      is required. Some of the potential solutions to address short-term job creation and
      inclusion follow:

        •	 Delivering new forms of finance that can improve access to key inputs needed
           to start and expand MSMEs in ways that foster job creation and better mitigate
           lending risks;
        •	 MSME and BDS/entrepreneurship support;
        •	 Targeted programs to support female and youth business start-ups.

      	 Respondents in the labor market survey indicated that access to finance and
      wage subsidies are some of the most important considerations in strengthening the

116

performance of this sector and, ideally, also providing the inducement for firms to
formalize. Getting the incentives correct in developing such products, mitigating
against market distortions but recognizing that jobs created in highly fragile, policy
constrained and under-invested regions bring with it significant additional social
externalities requires innovative approaches both to market interventions and
addressing investment risks.

2.	 Longer-Term Agenda: Sustainable Jobs through Value Chain Investments
Recent analysis suggests that efforts to bring about national level policy reforms
in politically fragmented fragile settings often fall short as the weight of politically
vested interests take their toll.52 It is this perspective - held even by senior Lebanese
policy makers and almost all private sector stakeholders engaged in the preparation
of this report - that led to the focus on value chains. It builds first on the notion that
targeting sub-sectors from production to end-market offers a more tractable reform
context, more targetable and measurable investment opportunities. It also allows for
a better calculation of winners and losers - in other words less threatening to the
political and institutional rigidities that block wider change efforts.
	 The value chains analysis also indicated that while not the whole solution, substantial
and real job potential exists in selected value chains, provided that downstream
value-adding activities can be instigated. As discussed earlier in the report, there are
a number of pre-requisites including clear determination of market opportunities,
associated new investments in facilities and labor force skills development, and some
core infrastructure changes. Development of these job opportunities and related value
chains in the agricultural and processing sectors, will also require far greater attention
to support effective partnership and networking within value chains and clusters
operating in the region, as well as upgrading capabilities in key parts of the value
chains. To reiterate, some of the priority interventions are:

  •	 Improved quality management and implementation of certification to support
     quality in both processes and in products, to meet the needs of global markets;
  •	 Investments in key quality and market supporting infrastructure, including post-
     harvest and market facilities and export infrastructure, as well as key supply
     chain infrastructure to support the recycling sector;
  •	 Ongoing support to promote productive coordination and integration of actors
     across the value chains, including developing appropriate contract farming
     arrangements (in potatoes and other agricultural value chains) and public-
     private dialogue;
  •	 Support for improved compliance on HSE and other standards along with
     training to support higher quality, higher value adding jobs;
  •	 Facilitating investment in post-harvest facilities and quality systems in key
     agricultural value chains; and building capacity among farmers and agricultural
     cooperatives/producer organizations.


                                                                                             117
                                                                      Jobs For North Lebanon




      Interventions to support the development of competitive value chains need to be
      complemented with efforts to bring labor force supply closer to private sector needs.
      This requires raising skills levels, making them more relevant to the evolving skills
      demands of the private sector. It also requires efforts to improve matching between
      workers and jobs, through more effective registration and profiling of the labor force
      and improving information flows between public employment and training institutions
      and the private sector.
      	 The VCA approach proposed as part of a multi-phased job development program
      is also in recognition of the specific enabling conditions on the ground in the North.
      To recap, the North has a relatively narrow economy. In order to achieve large-scale
      job creation, private sector investors willing to invest in the North as a base to serve
      wider markets are needed. This means first building on sources of comparative
      advantage in the North, specifically its strategic geographical position. The port of
      Tripoli provides connectivity to the wider region, as well as (at least initially) from
      specific value chains (mainly agricultural) where the region has already proven to
      compete in regional markets. The idea of serving wider markets is not simply about
      exporting, but also about serving markets nationally and within the region. This, too,
      requires improving connectivity (including to Beirut) and re-establishing Tripoli’s
      central role in the regional and national economy.

      3.	Ongoing Imperative: Strengthening the Competitive Position of North
      Lebanon
      It will be critical to build on new infrastructure investments already underway
      and then look to the region’s other key economic assets. This includes the further
      development of a relatively deep-birth seaport that can strengthen the region’s longer-
      term competitive edge. And, as previously mentioned, it could play a pivotal role
      in future reconstruction of Syria. Solutions to reinforce the strategic positioning of
      Tripoli and the North include:

        •	 Continued investments (including customs) to develop the Port of Tripoli as
           a leading container terminal for regional shipping and, to the extent feasible,
           expanding private investment in different aspects of port development and
           operations;
        •	 Investments in transport infrastructure to improve connectivity between Tripoli
           and Lebanon, as well as between Tripoli and key districts in the North;
        •	 Investments in industrial infrastructure, such as special economic zones and
           industrial parks, to support a competitive manufacturing sector;
        •	 Investments in urban infrastructure and municipal capacity to promote improved
           “livability” for residents of Tripoli;
        •	 Investments to position Tripoli to support post-conflict reconstruction in Syria.

      Beyond this, there is the Tripoli SEZ that has an independent legislative mandate that


118
Jobs For North Lebanon




allows for autonomous development and a unique potential to provide best practice
services to businesses. This legislative capacity is further strengthened by a Board
that is actively looking to attract private sector investment and management expertise.
These are the sorts of assets that can attract not just the private sector as users, but also
potentially as investors and providers, through “Public Private Partnership” financing
and management arrangements. This should be pursued on a priority basis.
	 Eventually, value chain development and associated targeted infrastructure
development, will experience diminishing returns – both in terms of private
investment and jobs. Further attracting investment to establish and expand outward-
oriented businesses in Tripoli and the North will also, eventually, require addressing
significant, long-standing investment climate constraints. This includes issues of
governance and, most notably, electricity, that make operating competitively almost
impossible, particularly for firms attempting to compete in export markets.

           refugees from the Syrian conflict. Around half of Lebanese villages in North Lebanon have
           seen their population more than double since the start of the Syrian conflict. Even prior to
           the arrival of the refugees, the host areas in Lebanon (including the North) had already the

The North of Lebanon is a region of great potential that has shown remarkable resilience
to recent adversity. A historic center of culture and trade, a region of rich agricultural land
with a dynamic population, the North of Lebanon faces significant structural socio-economic
challenges. The recent period of political, community and social insecurity has significantly
undermined investment and growth. The consequences can be seen in the region’s low levels
of job creation, out-migration of talent and increasingly informality of jobs and businesses.
These challenges have been exacerbated by the influx of Syrian refugees over the past
several years.

This report provides an assessment of these constraints and the opportunities for the creation
of more and better quality jobs for Lebanese in North Lebanon.

This analysis, accompanied by further public and private sector dialogue can inform the
actions that can be taken to create the jobs and new enterprises so urgently needed.
