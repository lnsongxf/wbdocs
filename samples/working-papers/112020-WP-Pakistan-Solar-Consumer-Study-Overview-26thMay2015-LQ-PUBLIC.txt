About IFC

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused
exclusively on the private sector. Working with private enterprises in about 100 countries, we
use our capital, expertise, and inﬂuence to help eliminate extreme poverty and boost shared

About Lighting Global

Lighting Global is the World Bank Group’s platform to support sustainable growth of the
international o -grid lighting market. Through Lighting Global, IFC and the World Bank
collaborate with the Global O -Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA), manufacturers, distributors,
and other development partners to support growth of the o -grid lighting market as a means
of increasing energy access. Lighting Global supports regional market transformation programs
- Lighting Africa, Lighting Asia and Lighting Paciﬁc, which work along the supply chain to reduce
market entry barriers and ﬁrst mover risks.

Lighting Global maintains a set of minimum quality standards which o -grid lighting products
must meet in order to access program services. They include:

-      Truth in advertising: Accurate consumer-facing labeling (e.g., rated run time, battery
capacity, PV power).
-      Lumen maintenance: After 2,000 hours, the products light output must not drop below
85 percent of the initial value (alternatively, products may meet this requirement by achieving 95

-      Battery: Must be durable and adequately protected.
-      Health and safety: Batteries may not contain mercury or cadmium.
-      Durability and quality: Products are designed and manufactured to avoid early failure.
-      Warranty: Products have a consumer-facing warranty with at least one year of coverage.
-      Key Statistics: Manufacturers will be required to report performance information, such as
run time and light output, on the product packaging.

The largest spending on o -grid products comes on kerosene, battery-powered torches, and
candles, with households spending on average 14 percent of their monthly disposable income on
alternative lighting. They are the major competitors to PSLS and SHS products. There are,
however, big variations between lighting technologies used by on-grid households and those

                           The Potential for Pay-as-you-Go in Pakistan

   Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) technology has played an important role in extending energy access in Africa over
   the last two years. PAYG solar devices generally use mobile payments combined with PSLS or SHS, which are
   GSM-technology enabled, meaning the product can be switched o remotely. This means consumers can
   make small payments towards the cost of a product over a longer period of time whilst reducing risk for
   ﬁnanciers and distributors.

   PAYG could be pivotal to the lighting market in Pakistan given consumer price sensitivity and the country’s
   robust microﬁnance sector. PAYG platforms can capitalize on the trends in Pakistan regarding mobile phone
   and mobile banking infrastructure to remove the upfront price barrier to solar and other modern sources of
   energy.

   PAYG has been particularly e ective in Kenya where Dlight partnered with MKO. Over 100,000 products
   were sold with $18.5 million of ﬁnancing. The payment structure involved $33 upfront with 365 payments of
   $0.44 via mobile money, usually daily. PAYG is now being rolled out across di erent markets, including some
   parts of Pakistan.
