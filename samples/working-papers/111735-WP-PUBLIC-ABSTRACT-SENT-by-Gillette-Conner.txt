INDONESIA CASE STUDY


INTRODUCTION

The term secured transactions refers to credit transactions where a creditor holds an interest in a
debtor’s movable property (collateral) to secure a loan or a debt obligation. The interest in movable
property is also referred to as security interest, pledge or charge. Collateral facilitates credit by
reducing the potential loss that lenders face from non-payment. While land and buildings are widely
accepted as collateral for loans, the use of movable collateral such as inventory, accounts receivable,
livestock, crops, equipment, and machinery, is much less common due to a lack of adequate regulatory
frameworks. Reforming the movable collateral framework thus enables businesses to leverage the
greatest part of their assets and obtain credit for growth.

While a secured transactions regime has existed in Indonesia since 1999, and transactions that rested
on secured interests of some type dates back to the colonial civil code, the World Bank Group and the
Government of Indonesia recognized a need to improve existing legislation and modernize the system
to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability in order to facilitate greater access to finance
for the small-scale business sector. The project aligned with the economic development priorities of
Indonesia, and with the mission of IFC and the World Bank to eliminate poverty and promote shared
prosperity through private sector development. Improving access to finance for micro, small and
medium-sized businesses is expected to strengthen economic growth and job creation.

A strong and modern secured transactions law regime is also a critical element under the annual IFC/
World Bank global survey on Ease of Doing Business. Since 2005, the Government of Indonesia has
worked to promote the country’s trade and competitiveness through the World Bank Group Doing
Business reform framework. Access to and provision of credit is one of the areas promoted through
the framework, which includes an assessment of a country’s ability to comply with international
best practice in modern secured transactions law regime. Until the Bank Group team engaged with
Indonesia on secured transactions reform, the country had made limited progress in this area due to
the complexity of legal reform, difficulties in cross-sectoral coordination, and a lack of knowledge of
international best practices.

Some of the challenges that were apparent in the existing secured transactions framework at the outset
of the project included fragmentation and deficiencies in the legal framework; inefficient handling of
the registration office; and a lack of understanding and coordination among a variety of stakeholders.
In order to help resolve these challenges, the team initially worked to develop a conducive environment
for reform, then worked to address infrastructure deficiencies and establish a solid framework for
the collateral registry, and finally to promote the use of movable collateral among micro, small and
medium-sized businesses.

However, in Indonesia it was clear that movables financing
remained undeveloped due to an ineffective legal/regulatory
environment and registry system coupled with a lack of
industry and public knowledge. Regulatory improvements
and strengthening the registry system were needed along
with inclusion of support to financial institutions in product

Spend time advocating and raising awareness amongst your
stakeholders.

In Indonesia, there was little public discussion about the role
of a sound legal framework in promoting economic growth.
Therefore, promoting access to finance through the Fiducia
Registry required extensive discussions to educate various
stakeholders about the benefit and impact of the reforms.
For example, the financial sector regulators did not fully
appreciate the importance of fiduciary reform as an economic
development driver. Creditors still see the Fiducia as a cost
that they need to avoid wherever they can rather than as a
useful risk-management tool, illustrating the need to continue
working with the financial sector; with law enforcement
(police/bailiffs) who are still not aware of their role in secured
transaction enforcement; and with end consumers who also
need to be educated about consumer protection rights. In this
context, the role of government in educating stakeholders and
providing stimulus for the use of Fiducia is vital.

Make sure to solicit feedback throughout the reform process.

It is only through a combination of public events (the SME
Finance Innovations Forum and a number of sensitization
events hosted by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights and
financial regulators) as well as one-on-one discussions with
banks, multi-finance companies, and financial regulators,
that the Ministry and the World Bank Group obtained
comprehensive feedback on how beneficial the ongoing
modernization of the Fiducia Registry was to its users. This
feedback informed and contributed to the improvements
in the registry and its enabling framework as the reforms
progressed and continued.

Meet your partners where they are.

Government officials are often very busy, and this puts the
onus on the project team to find solutions to engage with the
project sponsor when possible. In Indonesia, the team was
willing and able to meet the sponsor where he was and had
time. There were times, for example, that the team members
would ride with him to or from the airport when he traveled
in order to get the face time and sign off that was needed for
progressing. Their efforts highlight the success of keeping the
project on track by being willing to go the extra mile when
meeting with our partners.

WHAT’S NEXT?
The World Bank Group and the Ministry of Law and Human Rights have supported notable
improvements in the enabling environment and infrastructure for financial institutions to expand
financing to SMEs backed by movable assets. Yet a few more challenges remain in scaling up and
transforming the overall SME financing landscape, such as:

•	   Recommended amendments to the Fiducia Law have just been sent to the Parliament for
     approval. This will be followed by a need to establish effective implementing regulations and
     respective functions in the Fiducia Registry;

•	   Weak or absent enforcement of regulations around financing operations involving Fiducia. For
     example, regulation provides a sound foundation for creditors to repossess pledged vehicles
     without needing a court order on defaulted loans on the Fiducia basis, but law enforcement
     personnel are generally unaware of this regulation and very often protect the defaulted
     borrowers from creditors collecting the pledged assets;

•	   Challenges in coordinating the various policies and initiatives to support MSMEs by a number
     of ministries and agencies of the Government of Indonesia sometimes lead to only partial and
     fragmented implementation of policies, and thus do not provide as much fundamental support
     for the secured transactions reform needed to increase the use of movable assets to access
     finance by MSMEs;

•	   Access to finance for the MSME sector has not increased yet, and it may be argued that the
     Fiducia Registry’s sensitization campaign has so far only scratched the surface in a country
     with over 120 commercial banks, 1,600 rural banks, 200 multi-finance companies, and close
     to 10,000 savings and loans cooperatives. Only 3.7 percent of banks use Fiducia security to
     secure their financing, compared to a majority of non-bank financial institutions and some 99
     percent of financing of motor vehicles.

These remaining challenges form the rationale for the World Bank Group’s continued partnership
with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Government of Indonesia agencies and financial
regulators to expand finance for under-financed MSMEs. A second phase of the project aims to
continue the capacity building of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, and to inform and
educate users and beneficiaries of the online registry to increase financing for MSMEs.
