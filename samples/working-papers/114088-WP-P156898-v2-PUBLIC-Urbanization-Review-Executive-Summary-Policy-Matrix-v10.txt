﻿Urbanization and
It      Economic Growth
Urbanization presents a great opportunity for the
economic growth of the Philippines. Evidence from
today's developed countries and rapidly emerging
economies suggests that urbanization  and
economic growth go hand in hand due to
agglomeration economies embedded in the high
density of cities. The Philippines has the second
highest average urban density in East Asia and
Pacific Region and it is still increasing. This provides
a potential driver for enhanced productivity and
economic growth. Rising population and economic
densities could enable savings in transport and
communication   costs,  lead  to  frequent
interactions, enable finer specialization and
knowledge spillovers, and heighten competition in
product and labor markets. A clear densification
process has been experienced by Metro Manila
since  1990s  together  with  a   structural
transformation of the urban economy, with
industries moving out of the central urban areas
into the metro fringe and secondary cities, and
replaced by services, which can lead to a more
efficient system of cities based on experience from
developed countries.
44


﻿The economic benefits from urbanization in the Philippines,
however, are yet to be fully harnessed. Realization of efficiency gains
from urbanization have been hampered by some key challenges,
which can be summarized from the dimensions of Density, Distance
and Division.
The fast growing urban population and urban density have not been accompanied
by commensurate investments in urban infrastructure, as exacerbated by the weak
and fragmented institutions and governance for urban and metropolitan
management and service delivery, leading to congestion diseconomies associated
with land scarcity and lack of basic services such as clean water and sanitation, and
housing, increases in natural hazard risk and pollution, and rising commuting costs,
which have most clearly manifested in Metro Manila.
The country faces significant connectivity challenges from infrastructure
bottlenecks alongside the archipelagic geography. Inadequacy of urban and
regional transportation infrastructure remains a major constraint in the movement
of people and commodities between production and consumption centers as well
as between urban centers. The high domestic transport cost increases economic
distance between cities, limits the potential for cities to diversify or specialize
based on their comparative advantage and trade with each other, and thus
undermines the efficiency of the whole city network.
Division
The economic, social and spatial exclusion in urban areas are most prominently
manifested by the large scale of ISFs living in poor conditions with limited access to
basic urban services. Such divisions and inequality can also be detrimental to the
development of a vibrant urban middle class whose consumption patterns can
boost domestic demand and a more service based urban economy.

﻿Competitiveness
for Economic
Development and
Job Creation
City competiveness is important to job creation,
growth and livability.  Both national and local
governments have a role in providing an enabling
environment that facilitates firms and industries to
create jobs, raise productivity and increase the
incomes of citizens over time. The primary source of
job creation in cities all over the world has been the
growth of private sector firms, which have typically
accounted for around 75 percent of job creation. In
recent years large cities in the Philippines have been
the   main   drivers  of  growth  consistently
outperforming the national economy. The rise of
service sector, particularly the BPO industry, have led
to creation of hundreds of thousands of well paid
jobs. However Filipino cities remain behind their
international peers, suggesting the need for reforms

growth and job creation in cities. Several key issues

﻿Inclusive Growth
for Pro-poor
Development and
City Competitiveness
Inclusive urbanization, where everyone can reap
the benefits of urban growth, is a key aspect of
competitive cities. If urbanization is managed well,
it can provide a pathway out of poverty and act as
an engine of growth. If not, it can give rise to
inequality and exclusion that can derail the
development process. As mentioned above, the
challenges of division as manifested through
economic, spatial and social exclusion ultimately
affect opportunities in cities.

gradually, from 4.1% of total urban population in 2003
to 5.4% in 2012. In 2012, 5.4% of the urban population

Strong institutions and governance are critical to
the effective management of cities, the delivery of

﻿The analysis in the study raises a number of
complex, deep rooted problems that have limited
the Philippines from fully benefiting from
urbanization.  Looking ahead, there are many
opportunities for changing course towards more
competitive, sustainable and inclusive cities in the
Philippines. This will require bold actions and a
sustained commitment to prioritizing investments
in cities. Both Metro Manila and secondary cities
have substantial needs for urban infrastructure,
improving the investment climate, and the delivery
of basic services to residents. Actions are required
at both the national and local level, and will be
reliant on strong leaders who are willing to take
risks in a transparent and consultative manner, and
push forward on difficult reforms.
14


﻿Given the size and complexity in Metro Manila,
and its importance for the national economy,
there is an urgent imperative to prioritize a few
critical areas that impede competitiveness such
as congestion, urban flooding, and slums. These
issues span across administrative boundaries
and can only be solved through strong political
commitment and coalitions for change in
metropolitan   governance     and    land
administration management. At the same time,
investing in secondary cities presents an
enormous opportunity for shifting the overall
balance of spatial development in the country,
increasing productivity in urban areas and
avoiding many of the problems that have
evolved over time in Metro Manila as these cities
grow. Across all cities, there are substantial
needs to address fiscal and capacity constraints
to deliver core urban services.
Key recommendations are grouped into 5
priority areas, with two that stand out as top
priorities for broadest impact:
i) addressing the binding constraints of weak
institutions to improve the delivery of necessary
infrastructure, services and sustainable urban
planning, and
ii) improving land administration management to
open up land markets for city competitiveness.
The recommendations are discussed in greater
detail in the full report. A matrix of proposed
level of priority, time frame and implementing
agency is also included.

Managing Urbanization
for Efficiency and Growth
In order to maximize the economic gains from
urbanization, policies on land use and investments in
connective infrastructure should focus on managing the
existing  urban  density  and  prepare for further
concentration.
It is important to ensure that spatial planning, land use,
infrastructure development and service delivery can
progress commensurately with the population growth and
density increase in existing urban areas. Policy measures are
needed to make the productive factors, such as land, people
and capital, more efficiently allocated within cities. The
land administration and management need to be
strengthened and the land use planning needs to be more
effective so that the land market can function to meet the
needs  of   growing  urban  density. Infrastructure
development needs to be coordinated with land use
planning and addressed as an integrated urban strategy that
can cater to various user groups and anticipate long-term
needs. More investments and stronger management are
needed to improve intra-city connectivity and reduce the
actual distance between people and jobs. Investments
should be focused on increasing the capacity of existing
road networks on one hand, and expanding and
modernizing the mass transit system on the other hand.
Efficient land use through transit-oriented development
(TOD) has been demonstrated to be a high-value
complement to mass transit development in many other
countries.
16


﻿Improve transport infrastructure to lower
inter-city transport cost, expand market access
and generate complementary and specialized
functions for each city, and formulate an
efficient system of cities.
Given the differing roles of cities in a national
urban portfolio where each has a comparative
advantage, specialization can facilitate the
benefits of agglomeration. Primary cities such as
Metro Manila typically serve as the gateway to
the global economy with a strong service sector.
Clustering of manufacturing in secondary cites
enables cost saving for firms due to relatively
cheap land and labor. Meanwhile, producers in
the same or related industries gain from
proximity to others through the sharing of
capital inputs, information, and labor, matching
between production requirements and types of
land, labor, and intermediate inputs and can help
accelerate  industrial  diversification  and
upgrading for the country. The importance of
secondary cities is already recognized by in the
Philippines through its National Spatial Strategy.
Growth of secondary cities would also help
absorb surplus labor from rural areas and
alleviate migration pressures on Manila. Key
elements to fostering the growth of secondary
cities are improved transport infrastructure and
low transport costs between cities which can
enable firms to access local, regional, and global
markets-both for buying inputs and selling
outputs, reinforce agglomeration effects and
generate  complementary   and   specialized
functions, as well as investments in quality basic
services such as health and education to attract a
well skilled labor force. Policy measures to
improve  inter-city  connectivity  should  be
prioritized based on an integrated transport
framework that takes into account selectivity,
sequencing and prioritization. New connective
infrastructure investments should be accessed
based on their impacts on the entire existing
transport network and respective overall and
spatial economic development. Accordingly, key
data gaps, such as the absence of a national
database of local roadways, needs to be
addressed to promote evidence based planning.

﻿3 Promoting Inclusive Growth
by Creating Opportunities
for the Urban Poor
[Economic Inclusion]
Enhance livelihoods/jobs support for ISFs in close
collaboration with the private sector.
A majority of the ISFs engage in low-paying
low-skilled informal jobs due to lack of education
and skills, vulnerable to external shocks that can
push them below the poverty line. There is a need
to help them move up the job ladder and augment
their income. Such support requires a two-pronged L
approach. One for skills training and placement for
formal wage employment, and the other for
enterprise development. For the former, the
government should reorient the existing vocational
skills training and placement programs to a more
"market  demand-driven"  approach,  where
potential employers are involved in the course
design and subsidy for initial post-placement
period. For the latter, upfront support to analyze
the marketability of end products or services and
end support to link the microenterprises to market
need to be built in. A properly designed public
works program can also be an effective means to
provide complementary income support to the
unskilled poor, especially to compensate the
unstable income.
Prioritize investments in facilitating secondary
education completion to improve job prospects of
the poor.
Completion of high school education is critical in
securing job opportunities. Support to alleviate the
financial burden of uniforms, school supplies,
education materials, and transportation costs,
possibly through the ongoing conditional cash
transfer (CCT), would greatly enhance the chances
of more urban poor youths to complete higher
education.

﻿4 Strengthening Institutions
and Metropolitan Governance
for Better Delivery of Infrastructure,
Services and Resilient
Urban Planning and Management
Strengthen the institutional framework for urban
development through the adoption of a
Philippine National Urban Policy (NUP) and the
establishment of a lead agency for urban
Ua          development and housing.
A comprehensive NUP for the Philippines should
define the urban development priorities of the
country, which specifies how urban development is
integrated into broader national development
goals and defines a vision for the sustainable
spatial expansion of urban areas across the
country. Key elements include specification on the
respective roles of the national and local
governments in the urban planning, financing, and
g p g    i  iprovision of core urban infrastructure and services.
At the same time, NUP should also provide a
comprehensive urban planning framework that
integrates national level development objectives
and strategies with metropolitan- and city-level
-a     land use and development plans. The NUP should
provide for the establishment of a lead agency for
urban development and housing, which will be
responsible for the implementation of the policy's
objectives and priorities. Consistent with on-going
policy discussions to consolidate all the key shelter
agencies under one national government agency,
the  lead  agency should  also  assume  full
responsibility for the housing sector and be
empowered to provide capacity building, technical
assistance, and policymaking support to cities and
metropolitan areas.
