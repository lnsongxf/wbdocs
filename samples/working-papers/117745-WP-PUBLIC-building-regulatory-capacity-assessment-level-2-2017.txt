Overview
Urbanization is simultaneously a major driver of development, wealth creation and poverty reduction, as
well as one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century. Between 1990 and 2015, the urban extent
occupied by cities in less developed countries increased by a factor of 3.5.1 By 2050, up to 70 percent of people
will be living in cities. Urbanization can and should be embraced as an opportunity to reduce poverty. The
goal, however, can be realized only if current patterns are significantly transformed to guide urban growth in
developing countries towards a more sustainable trajectory.

The New Urban Agenda agreed upon in Quito in October 2016 conveys a sense of urgency by seeking to harness
the transformative force of urbanization and shape the future of cities. It focuses on four major priorities: national
urban policies; more effective municipal finance; territorial planning and design capacity; and laws, institutions
and systems of governance to enhance the rule of law. The Building Regulatory Capacity Assessment provides
an important contribution to help cities and project managers working with development agencies to
implement this last priority by offering a new resource to assess building and land use regulatory systems, and
facilitate the collection of critical information about the building regulatory framework in any given city or
country.

The Building Regulatory Capacity Assessment is comprised of the following “Level 1 - Initial Screening,” designed for
government officials and project managers undertaking rapid preliminary assessments. It provides an opportunity to
initiate conversations with clients and relevant parties on strategies for achieving relevant development objectives.
Level 1 is complemented by a “Level 2 - Detailed Exploration”, which provides a set of guidelines for team members
and contractors who are tasked with gathering and analyzing data and information about the building regulatory
capacity of the target country, region or municipality. Overall, the Assessment identifies critical gaps, it provides the
necessary information to develop a baseline for formulating technical assistance to clients, as well as drawing findings
that can be used to determine areas for improvement and investment.

As UN-Habitat points out in the World Cities Report2, effective regulatory frameworks based on accountability and
clear implementation mechanisms are key “development-enablers that provide a solid forward-looking framework
to guide urban development”, thus emphasizing the role of regulations as a means to integrate a wide range of
societal objectives ranging from building resilience to acute and chronic risks, climate change adaptation, promoting
accessibility in the built environment, reducing CO2 emissions, preserving cultural assets and attracting investment.

As part of the Building Regulation for Resilience Program supported by the Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery,3 we hope that this assessment tool will offer an effective resource for interventions
within a wide range of urban development initiatives in cities of low and middle-income countries.

 	 It should be noted that in this context, Regulations, Codes and Standards all have equivalent meanings, e.g., the Building
   Regulations (England) is equivalent to the Building Code (New Zealand) and the Building Standards (Scotland) or
   Building Standards Law (Japan). Terminology is a function of the country and legal system. It should also be noted
   that Standards, in this respect, are different than ‘reference standards,’ which provide details on such areas as testing,
   design, installation and maintenance, and are developed by standards-making organizations, such as the International
   Organization for Standardization (ISO) or equivalent in each country. Such ‘reference standards’ are referenced by the
   top-level regulations as means to demonstrate compliance.

     Federation (e.g., combination of national government and regional / local government responsibility)
     In federal system countries, one will need to identify the above types of information at each level of government – national,
     regional (e.g., state, territory, or province) and local (as appropriate). It will be important to know the regulatory hierarchy as well.
     For example, in the USA, buildings are regulated at the state or local level, as is planning and zoning. However, there are resource
     management and environmental regulations at national and state level. As such, understanding how the hierarchy of regulations
     works will be important to inform on what land areas it might be possible to build, what types of assessments and permission will
     be needed, and so forth.

     Potential Informants
     Texts of legislation and laws related to building regulation may be publicly accessible. However, it may be necessary to consult with
     local experts in construction law and parties active in the construction sector, including building professionals, contractors and
     owners to understand the actual functioning of the legal process. One should consult those agencies to which responsibility for
     code development and implementation has been clearly assigned.

     In a unitary (national) government system, starting at the ministerial level (or equivalent) will be helpful. In federal systems, one
     will need to reach out to parties at each level of government, consistent with project objectives.

    3.2.1     What is the form of government: national / centralized,               In a national government, the enabling legislation for building
              federation, or other?                                                 regulation will be at the national level. In a federation, the
                                                                                    enabling legislation may be at the state (territory, provincial)
                                                                                    level. However, even in a centralized system, it is important
                                                                                    to understand the level of decentralization that may render
                                                                                    national and sub-national laws and regulations at odds.


    3.2.2     Which acts, decrees, laws or similar enable the regulation of:        The first step in the assessment process is to identify whether
              (a)	 the use or condition of land upon which a building can           the fundamental enabling legislation for such regulations is in
                  be constructed (i.e., planning or zoning), and whether            place. For disaster mitigation and related projects, land use,
                  disaster risk management elements are integrated into the         building design and construction, and fire safety regulation
                  legislation;                                                      is critical, so related enabling legislation must be in place.
              (b)	 the design, construction and operation of buildings, and         A parallel condition exists for other areas where regulation
                  the strengthening or upgrading of existing buildings;             can be helpful (e.g., energy conservation, accessibility, etc.).
              (c)	 fire prevention / control, and/or the fire service;              Obtaining text of the relevant legislation is needed for the
              (d)	 resource / energy conservation;                                  assessment.
              (e)	 accessibility / usability rights; and
              (f)	 historic / cultural heritage preservation?


    3.2.3     Are there regulations7 for the following:                             Assuming the enabling legislation is in place, it is then
              (a)	 land use planning/zoning;                                        important to understand what specific regulations are in place
              (b)	 building design and construction, and retrofitting of            in each pertinent area. It will be necessary to obtain text of the
                  existing buildings;                                               pertinent regulations.
              (c)	 fire prevention;
              (d)	 resource / energy conservation;
              (e)	 accessibility; and
              (f)	 historic / cultural preservation?


    3.2.4     What entity has primary responsibility for the development of         The development and promulgation of regulations may not be
              regulations for:                                                      by the same entity, so it is important to know what entity is
              (a)	 the use or condition of land upon which a building can be        responsible for each function. For example, development may
                  constructed (i.e., planning or zoning);                           be by a private sector ‘model code’ development organization,
              (b)	 the design, construction or operation of buildings;              but promulgation is typically the responsibility of government.
              (c)	 fire prevention / control, and/or the fire service;              Here we need to know which entities are responsible for
              (d)	 resource / energy conservation;                                  the development of the associated regulations. It will also be
              (e)	 accessibility / usability rights; and                            helpful to know if influence peddling or corruption is of concern

	 Note that the term ‘regulation’ is used to encompass the document, or set of documents, which define the legally mandated building requirements.

  With respect to buildings, such documents may be referred to as Building Regulations (as in England), Building Codes (as in Australia and the USA),
  or Building Standards (as in Scotland, or the Building Standard Law, as in Japan).

Enabling Legislation for Collection
of Fees / Levies (supports Screening
Question 3.2.10)
Many jurisdictions utilize fees or levies on various
stages of the building regulatory process, including
when applying for permits to build, for plans review
and approval, and for inspection and witnessing of
building commissioning. The aim here is to identify
the enabling legislation or regulation used to allow
and govern the fee levels that can be charged.
Areas of research include whether legislation exists
regarding the adequacy, uniformity or allocation
of building permit fees, and if so, at what level(s)
of government, and whether building regulatory
legislation provides for the allocation of financial
resources to building authorities that are consistent
with their workload and associated overhead costs.

The level of fees to be charged should be
proportional to the effort and should not duplicate
other sources of funding. In general, fees charged
by local building authorities should be based on the
actual cost associated with the review of building
plans and site inspections, including overhead
costs. Fees charged for construction permitting and
building inspection may be expected to cover the
costs of regulatory services. Data to be collected
includes fee schedules for building authorities at the
local level and one should assess the uniformity of
application across jurisdictions.

 4.2.1   What are the sources for hazard / risk data, maps, etc.               Hazard and risk data, as used in regulations, needs to come from
         reference in the regulations (land use planning, zoning,              a credible source, such as a relevant government ministry, agency,
         building, and fire)?                                                  etc. in the country of the project. It is important to understand
                                                                               the level of institutionalization (e.g., research program, or fixed
                                                                               bureau/agency) of these sources, and mechanisms/frequency
                                                                               of updating, especially exposure and fragility information.


 4.2.2   Do formal land use planning / zoning regulations exist, and if        For any building project, and in particular for projects
         so, do they incorporate:                                              addressing disaster risk and vulnerability mitigation, disaster

               building is not permitted due to natural hazards;               of comprehensive planning, building and fire regulations in
         b)	 hazard maps or related means that identify minimum                place. This first question focuses on the land use planning and
               separation between residential and hazardous                    zoning regulations, as this gets to the issue of what building
               occupancies;                                                    can be constructed in which locations, and to what extent are
         c)	 maps or related means that identify areas in which                those locations within, or external to, hazards that need to
               building is not permitted in relation to natural resources;     be mitigated (natural or man-made). Obtaining text of such
               and                                                             regulations is essential.
         d)	 requirements for infrastructure associated with building
               density, population or related factors?


 4.2.3   Do formal building regulations exist, and if so, do they have         In low and middle-income countries, building codes, if they
         specific provisions for, or is there a separate building code, for    exist, may not include provisions related to indigenous,
         indigenous, “non-engineered” and/or “informal” construction           “non-engineered” and/or “informal” construction. Significant

         enforceable, and not used simply as guidance.                         particular, so having this information is critical to investment
                                                                               decisions. Texts of regulations will be needed.


 4.2.4   If building regulations exist, do they incorporate provisions for:    The extent to which a building regulation comprehensively
         a)	 structural design for normal and expected loading and             addresses the wide range of health, safety, welfare,
               hazard conditions;                                              sustainability and resiliency issues will have a direct

               disabilities;                                                   enhancing sustainability and resiliency objectives. If a robust
         d)	 fire prevention and protection systems;                           building regulation is not in place, there can be significant
         e)	 mechanical systems (e.g., heating, cooling, ventilation);         questions around the quality of buildings and the performance
         f)	 plumbing & sanitary systems;                                      they deliver. If a robust building regulation is not in place, there
         g)	 electrical systems;                                               may be need for investment to put a framework into place,

         j)	   fire service access; and
         k)	 environmental protection?


 4.2.5   With respect to material requirements (e.g., strength, testing,       The utility of comprehensive material performance criteria
         quality, etc.), are the requirements consistent with the              in the regulations is reduced or can even be negated if there

    	 As used here, a ‘consensus standard’ is a standard, developed by an accredited standards-making organization (e.g., the International Organization
      for Standardization (ISO)), which is required to have a ‘balanced’ committee of varied interests participate and reach consensus on the content.
      Consensus requires that all views and objections be considered, and that an effort be made toward their resolution.

5.2– Screening Questions
This third component of the Building Regulatory Capacity Assessment focuses on the implementation and management of the building
regulatory framework at the level(s) associated with the project scope. The screening questions are aimed at identifying a minimal
set of information for preliminary assessment of local capacity. These questions are repeated from the Level 1 - Initial Screening as
a reminder of preliminary information which has been collected. It should be noted that Level 2 - Detailed Exploration should focus
on questions and issues identified in Section 5.3 below, recognizing that some of the pertinent information may have already been
collected.

Screening Questions

             Questions                                                              Why This is Important

  5.2.1      If formal land use planning, building, and fire regulations            While it may be that a country has appropriate legislation to
             exist, are they legally promulgated and enforced throughout            enable pertinent regulation, that fact alone does not mean
             all areas of the country, region (state, territory, province), or      such regulations have been adopted into use throughout the
             city(ies) covered by the project?                                      entirety of the area addressed by the project. In order to assess
                                                                                    the effectiveness of the building regulatory framework, the
                                                                                    extent of promulgation and enforcement needs to be known.

  5.2.2      If the answer to 4.3.1 is no, estimate the percentage of the           This question gets to the issue of to what extent are (or will)
             country, region or city(ies) covered by the project does not           buildings subject to formal regulations on planning, zoning,
             have a set of comprehensive land use planning, building,               design, construction and use. In the case that a significant
             and fire regulations legally promulgated and enforced for all          portion of the building stock is somehow outside of the
             buildings. Include in this estimate any areas of indigenous,           building regulatory framework (e.g., ‘informal’ construction,
             “non-engineered” and/or “informal” construction, which may             shanties, etc.), there are limits on the effectiveness of a formal

             vulnerability mitigation, disaster recovery, urban densification,      of investment in the building regulatory framework may be
             and energy conservation type projects. Estimate the percentage         needed to facilitate the target resiliency, sustainability, or
             of buildings not currently subject to formal regulations.              energy efficiency of the building stock.

  5.2.3      What are the natural and technological hazards and risks               The range of natural and technological hazards, which can
             of concern in the country, region or city(ies) covered by the          be expected to impact the building stock that is affected by a
             project? What is the recent loss history related to such hazards       project, should be well-understood for all geographic regions
             and risks?                                                             addressed by the project. This is to help assess whether
                                                                                    the hazard / risk maps in the regulations, if they exist, are
                                                                                    appropriate to the required mitigation targets.

  5.2.4      Are hazard and risk data, maps, etc., pertinent to the country,        Related to 4.3.3 above, the presence of hazard and risk data,
             region or city(ies) covered by the project, comprehensive, up to       maps, and related information within the regulations does not
             date, and appropriately cited in the regulations and available         assure that they are up to date and appropriate to the needs of the
             for use in assessing the adequacy of the regulations in helping        project, especially for disaster risk and vulnerability mitigation. It
             to mitigate or avoid the hazard or risk as part of the project?        also does not assure that sufficient technical capacity is available
                                                                                    to properly apply and use hazard and risk information in decision-

  5.2.5      What are the 10-year historical and 10-year projected number           Aside from having the legislation and regulations in place,
             of building projects – new construction, renovation, expansion,        building regulatory capacity is largely a function of how
             etc. – for the country, region or city(ies) covered by the             many projects are being controlled, and how many people

  1.1       The project scope is: (a) national; (b) regional (state, territory, province within the              
            country); (c) municipal (city level).


  1.2       The project type is: (a) disaster risk / vulnerability reduction; (b) disaster recovery;             
            (c) rapid urbanization; (d) climate change adaptation; (e) resource / energy management;
            (f) upgrade of informal settlements; (g) protection of cultural heritage.


  1.3       What are the natural and technological hazards and risks of concern in the country,                  
            region or city(ies) covered by the project?



Chapte 3 Legal and Administrative Component provides a quick snapshot of the extent of regulatory capacity-building that may be
needed with respect to enabling legislation. Quite simply, the more enabling legislation in place, the less resources will be needed to
build capacity. All ‘yes’ responses likely means a good legislative infrastructure is in place, and investment needs are comparatively low.
All ‘no’ responses might suggest significant investment and time are needed.

  2.1       Are there acts, decrees, laws or similar that enable the regulation of building aspects                             
            pertinent to the project (i.e., land use, building design and construction, fire prevention,
            energy conservation, accessibility, or preservation of cultural heritage)?


  2.2       Are there formal regulations (codes / standards) for those areas pertinent to the project?                          



  2.3       Are there acts, decrees, laws or similar that enable the regulation / licensing /                                   
            certification of: architects / planners; engineers; builders (carpenters, masons, …);
            trades (plumbers, electricians, …); contractors / installers; building officials; fire officials?


  2.4       Are there acts, decrees, laws or similar that enable the regulation / certification / testing                       
            / quality control of: building materials (e.g., steel, timber, masonry, concrete, …); building
            products and systems (e.g., walls, doors, windows, heating appliances, lighting systems,
            etc.); and contents or aspects of contents (e.g., materials which may be toxic, …)?



Much like above, Chapter 4 Development and Maintenance Component provides a quick snapshot of the extent of regulatory capacity
building that may be needed around the specific regulations (e.g., planning and zoning, building, fire, etc.). As with the above, the more
formal regulatory components in place, the less capacity building resource will be required. All ‘yes’ responses likely means a good
regulatory infrastructure is in place, and investment needs comparatively low. All ‘no’ responses might suggest significant investment is
needed.

       3.1       If formal land use planning / zoning regulations exist, do they incorporate: (a) hazard                              
                 maps or related means that identify areas in which building is not permitted due to
                 natural hazards; (b) hazard maps or related means that identify minimum separation
                 between residential and hazardous occupancies; (c) maps or related means that
                 identify areas in which building is not permitted in relation to natural resources; and (d)
                 requirements for infrastructure associated with building density, population or related
                 factors?


       3.2       If formal building regulations (codes, standards) exist, do they have specific provisions                            
                 for, or is there a separate building code, for indigenous buildings, “non-engineered” and/
                 or “informal” construction? By ‘formal’ we mean adopted by law and are enforceable, not
                 used simply as guidance.


       3.3       If building regulations (codes, standards) exist, do they have: (a) Hazard maps identifying                          
                 expected natural hazard loads by region; (b) Requirements for structural resistance to
                 expected hazard loads; (c) Requirements for moisture resistance to expected hazard
                 loads; (d) Requirements for fire separation from other buildings, wildland interfaces, etc.?


       3.4       If formal building and fire regulations exist, do they require, by reference, the use of                             
                 nationally or internationally recognized consensus standards that specify required
                 material properties and performance (e.g., strength, durability, fire resistance, …), the
                 tests to confirm performance, and requirements for design, installation, testing and
                 maintenance of building and safety products, components, systems and assemblies? If
                 so, what standards are referenced?



     Chapter 5 Implementation Component is a more detailed assessment to determine to what extent the systems, documents and
     appropriately educated and trained people are in place to facilitate the regulatory framework. The rating here may require somewhat
     detailed information, especially with respect to percentage coverage of ‘formal’ building code, and numbers and training of regulatory
     and enforcement personnel. In particular, on 4.2, having a solid ‘formal’ framework in place is all well and good, so long as it applies to
     a significant portion of the country for which the project is targeted. If not, and the ‘informal’ sector is dominant, that much work and
     resource may be needed to achieve objectives.

      this estimate any areas of indigenous, “non-engineered” and/or “informal” construction
