Social Gains Show Signs of Stagnation in Latin America


   Poverty reduction in the Latin American (LA) region came to a halt in 2015, as the region’s economy contracted, and
    middle class growth stagnated.
   Poverty rates were effectively unchanged in 7 out of 13 countries as most countries faced an economic slowdown,
    and thus convergence towards low poverty reduction continued.
   Income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the LAC income distribution turned negative in 2015, but the income
    drop among the richest 10 percent was even larger, driving an overall decrease in inequality.
   Preliminary data suggests poverty outcomes are likely to continue to deteriorate into 2016.

BOX 1. Brazil’s Economic Crisis and Poverty
Brazil experienced a decade of success in reducing poverty and inequality, based on a policy of social inclusion,
amidst a booming economy and favorable external conditions. As the largest country in the Latin America and
Caribbean region, its success has helped drive down the region’s poverty rate. However, the 2015-2016
economic crisis in the country is posing a threat to the sustainability of these welfare gains. Brazil’s ec onomy
underwent a deep recession in 2015, with Gross Domestic Product decreasing by 3.8 percent in 2015 and 3.6
percent in 2016. Almost 1.6 million formal sector jobs were lost in 2015 and average monthly real wages fell
4.2 percent. From 2014 to 2015, Brazil’s moderate poverty increased from 18.1 to 20.1 percent (under the
US$4-a-day poverty line in 2005 PPP) and extreme poverty increased from 7.8 to 9.2 percent (US$2.5-a-day
poverty line).

Without Brazil, poverty in the LAC region would have decreased slightly in 2015. Brazil’s current economic crisis
is behind the LAC region’s increase in poverty and decrease in the middle class. With almost 38 percent of the
LAC population and 43 percent of its total household income in 2015, Brazil tells the overall story of poverty in
LAC. If Brazil were excluded from the regional aggregate, moderate poverty in LAC would have decreased from
26.5 to 25.7 percent (see Figure 4), while extreme poverty would have decreased from 12.6 to 12.1 percent.
Similarly, the region’s slight reduction in the middle class is mainly explained by the substantial drop of the middle
class in Brazil (-2.2 pp) from 2014 to 2015. If Brazil were excluded from the regional aggregate, the vulnerable
and middle class populations would have increased slightly.

Recent technical work has focused on analyzing how Brazil’s current economic downturn could affect poverty and
shared prosperity (see: “Safeguarding Against a Reversal in Social Gains During the Economic Crisis in Brazil”).
The note summarizes the poverty and distributional impacts for 2016 and 2017 under two different scenarios
for GDP, employment, and unemployment. It is based on the recently released 2015 Pesquisa Nacional de
Amostra de Domicilios (PNAD), Brazil’s National Household Sample Survey, collected in October 2015. The
microsimulation analysis suggests that poverty rates will rise in 2016 and remain high in 2017. The authors found
that the crisis has likely primarily impoverished skilled, white, slightly younger people that live in urban areas,
mainly in the southeast, and previously working in the service sector. Given the importance of Brazil in the LAC
region, it is likely that regional poverty estimates for 2016 and 2017 will also show a further decline in welfare.

The Brazil analysis also estimates that a 4.7 to 6.9 percent increase (depending on the alternative scenario
considered) in the budget from 2015 to 2017 would be needed to target the most needy among the “new poor”
households and prevent the extreme poverty rate from increasing beyond the 2015 rate. The analysis suggests
that “the depth and duration of the current economic crisis… gives rise to the opportunity to expand the role of
Bolsa Familia from an effective redistribution program to a true safety net program that is sufficiently flexible
to expand its coverage to the `new poor’ households generated by the crisis.”

outweighing effect of Brazil’s labor and non-labor
income in the change of poverty. The labor income
declines in Brazil outstripped the small but positive
effect on poverty of the aggregate labor income in
the rest of the region from 2014 to 2015. If Brazil
were taken out from the regional estimates, the story
would have changed substantially, for both labor and
non-labor income contributed in similar amounts to
reduce poverty in 2015 (Figure 8).

About this Brief
This brief was produced by the Latin America and Caribbean Team for Statistical Development (LAC TSD) in the
Poverty and Equity Global Practice of the World Bank. The core team consisted of Carolina Diaz-Bonilla, Andrés
Castañeda, Jorge Soler, and Christian Gomez. The team worked under the guidance of Oscar Calvo-Gonzalez
and received valuable contributions from Laura Moreno, Martha Viveros, Germán Reyes, Natalia Garcia-Peña,
María Ignacia Contreras, and María Laura Oliveri.

The numbers presented in this brief are based on a regional data harmonization effort known as SEDLAC, a
joint effort of the World Bank and CEDLAS at the National University of La Plata in Argentina (see Annex 4 for
the list of surveys used in this brief). They increase cross-country comparability of selected findings from official
household surveys. For that reason, the numbers discussed here may be different from official statistics reported
by governments and national offices of statistics. Such differences should not be interpreted in any way as a
claim of methodological superiority, as both sets of numbers serve the same important objectives: regional
comparability and the best possible representation of the facts of individual countries. Indicators for LA are
calculated using data from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador,
El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay (LA-17).

i  Poverty is measured based on the $4-a-day international poverty line in 2005 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) prices. Extreme
Poverty is based on the $2.5-a-day international poverty line in 2005 PPP prices.
ii Poverty increase in Bolivia (0.54 pp), Brazil (1.97 pp), Ecuador (0.52 pp), Honduras (0.11 pp), Paraguay (0.8 pp), and Uruguay
(0.18 pp)
iii Argentina, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Haiti do not have microdata available for 2015.
iv If Brazil were excluded from the aggregate, unemployment in the region would have increased as well from 5.1 percent in
2014 to 6 percent in 2015.
