x   MOBILIZING THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA DIASPORA FOR ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
     Rationale
     Why should governments and development partners
     mobilize the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
     diaspora?



     T
             he MENA diaspora can be an important catalyst and partner for governments
             and development institutions to foster cooperation, development,
             globalization, regional integration, and entrepreneurship in the MENA
     region. Diaspora members, in particular professionals and skilled individuals, are
     a critical human capital asset for their home countries and the MENA region as a
     whole. According to official United Nations data, approximately 20 million MENA
     citizens live abroad, representing 5 percent of the population of the region, a much
     larger proportion than the world average (see annex for definition of diaspora). If only
     1 percent of the MENA diaspora were mobilized, that would mean tapping into the
     expertise and network of 200,000 professionals, which is significant. The actions of a
     few could make a difference. The MENA region is one of the least-integrated regions
     in the world and has lackluster private sector investment and entrepreneurship and
     high unemployment (including among young graduates). MENA also has very low
     intraregional trade and attracts less foreign direct investment (FDI) than other regions.

     Few MENA countries have considered tapping into their professional and
     skilled diasporas, and few mechanisms are in place to facilitate the broad role
     the diaspora can play. This paper aims to bring attention to this potential and
     advocates for the need to strengthen the connection with the diaspora of countries
     in the MENA region. This paper does not discuss the benefits of diaspora returnees
     or incentives offered to diaspora members to return to their home countries to
     invest, create jobs, or work in the government. It is rather about how to tap into
     members who live abroad and can help their countries of origin in ways other than
     sending remittances.




﻿                                                                                               xi
       The MENA diaspora can transfer money and skills; enhance trade, investment,
       and business opportunities; improve the social contract; and help alleviate the
       refugee crisis. Traditionally, governments have considered emigration as a positive
       resource for home countries’ economies for three main reasons: (1) they reduce
       pressure on the domestic labor market in times of high unemployment; (2) they
       reduce poverty through money transfer, in some countries, financing infrastructure,
       hospitals, and the like; and (3) they facilitate transfer of knowledge and know-how
       from abroad. There is also empirical evidence of and historical examples that show
       the importance of diasporas in fostering entrepreneurship and helping develop
       export industries in home countries (Ghatak et al. 2009; Felbermayr and Toubal 2008;
       Morgenroth and O’Brien 2008; Dolman 2008; Tadesse and White 2011). Diaspora
       members are more likely than foreign investors to invest in home countries with
       weak business enforcement and poor governance because they tend to have more
       information on the business environment and local practices. In countries where the
       rule of law is uncertain—which includes most emerging markets—it may be harder
       to do business with foreigners. Personal ties make this easier. Diaspora members
       can also help create bridges to ease access to foreign markets and create business
       connections abroad.

       Knowledge moves when people do. Beyond the visible financial flows that have
       been discussed in the media, the economic relevance of diasporas builds on the
       flow of knowledge. Diasporas are an important source of knowledge transfer.
       Ricardo Hausmann elaborates on this idea of know-how residing in people’s brains
       and advises developing countries to focus on attracting them, instead of erecting
       barriers to skilled immigration (Hausmann 2015). The speed of industrialization in
       East Asia has relied to a large extent on economically active Chinese communities
       abroad, likewise for India, whose high-tech industry has boomed thanks to sustained
       ties with Indian migrants and even people returning from diaspora.

       Moreover, diaspora members can be a powerful engine of change and promotion
       of a new social contract because they often advocate for openness, competition,
       and better-quality democracy. Those living in democracies and in countries where
       the rule of law prevails tend to have higher standards and aspirations for their
       compatriots and family members at home. Under dictatorships, diasporas, like many
       other groups in civil society, are kept at arm’s length to avoid interference. Many
       members of the diaspora also turn their backs on their home countries, with many
       leaving to escape the lack of freedom at home and not particularly eager to remain
       engaged with their home countries, but the wave of freedom that has reached the



xii   MOBILIZING THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA DIASPORA FOR ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
          MENA countries since 2011 has encouraged many diaspora members to play an
          active role in this change process. The current transition in the region provides an
          opportunity for governments and development partners to engage with people in
          diaspora on the economic development agenda of their countries of origin. The
          MENA diaspora surveyed in the context of this activity expresses a relatively high
          level of mistrust toward institutions at home and calls for a new social contract
          between governments and their citizens living abroad.

          Finally, the MENA diaspora is a gold mine because it can be an important catalyst
          for alleviating the refugee crisis that has recently intensified in the region. In
          his speech at the Global Diaspora Week Launch Event, U.S. Secretary of State Kerry
          mentioned instances in which the diaspora has been critical to responding to urgent
          humanitarian crises. For example, Syrian-American doctors from the Syrian American
          Medical Society have lent their time and talent to supporting clinics in the Za’atari
          camp in Jordan and are providing counseling and social services for women and
          children wherever possible in Syria. After the outbreak of Ebola, the Sierra Leone,
          Liberia, and Guinea diaspora community responded quickly by sending urgently
          needed medical supplies, food, and money and often by communicating with
          people directly to institute best practices and avoid spreading the disease (U.S.
          Department of State, October 9, 2015).

          This paper advocates for the need to rally the MENA professional and skilled
          diaspora. It discusses the findings of a unique outreach exercise to the MENA
          diaspora and provides policy recommendations. First, the paper highlights the
          linkages between the diaspora and trade, investment, and knowledge transfer based
          on the literature and concrete examples. Second, it describes the outreach and the
          profile of the diaspora members surveyed. Third, it presents the main findings of
          the survey of the MENA diaspora in four areas: (i) overall engagement, (ii) appetite
          for investment, (iii) trade, and (iv) the role of institutions. The paper concludes with
          policy recommendations.

      In the early 1980s, barely a dozen countries
      had a ministry, a government department, or
      some other official institution dedicated to their
      diasporas, and a few countries, including the
      United States, ignore those who have left—except
      perhaps to send them tax demands, but these
      are a shrinking minority.

      Last year, Ireland appointed its first minister for the
      Irish diaspora; this spring it unveiled a diaspora
      strategy: Ireland Reaching Out. The government
      also supports hundreds of groups that serve
      needy Irish emigrants or court successful ones.
      One of them, ConnectIreland, uses the diaspora
      to encourage inward investment, paying for tips
      that lead to foreign companies creating jobs in
      the country.

      Many countries have come to believe that their            serious intent. India sees its diaspora, which the

       he analysis presented in this report indicates the need to harness MENA citizens living
       abroad to foster trade, investment, and technology transfer in the MENA region. It is not
       necessary for the diaspora to come back home to help; many can provide valuable support
while residing abroad.

Definition of Diaspora Member



A
        ny activity that targets the diaspora in any country or region faces one major challenge: the
        definition of the diaspora. The definition is not clear cut in the literature because belonging
        to a diaspora may rely not only on citizenship, but also on a set of shared historical and
cultural characteristics. The Irish government thinks that everybody of Irish descent—perhaps
60 million or 70 million people—is part of the Irish diaspora. Israel claims all Jews as diaspora
members. The standard typology of diaspora is as follows.


■■   Lived diaspora – individuals born in the         with the homeland. According to the International
     home country who now live permanently or         Organization for Migration, a broad definition

                                                      communities, who have left, but maintain links
■■   Ancestral diaspora – individuals with
                                                      with, their homelands.” Therefore assessing
     ancestral links to the home country (e.g.,
                                                      the size of a diaspora and defining criteria of

50      MOBILIZING THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA DIASPORA FOR ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
‘Diasporas have been a part of the world for millennia. Today two

changes are making them matter much more. First, they are far

bigger than they were... If migrants were a nation, they would be

the world’s fifth-largest, a bit more numerous than Brazilians,

a little less so than Indonesians.... Second, thanks to cheap

flights and communications, people can now stay in touch with

the places they came from. The diaspora networks have three

lucrative virtues. First, they speed the flow of information across

borders... Second, they foster trust... Third, and most important,

diasporas create connections that help people with good ideas

collaborate with each other, both within and across ethnicities’.
