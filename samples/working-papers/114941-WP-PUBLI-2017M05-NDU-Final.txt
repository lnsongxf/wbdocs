to service sector in FY2017. Education and finan-
cial sector, however, have slowed down in
FY2017.

On the demand side, gross investments con-
tributed the most to headline growth. Gross
fixed capital formation is estimated to have
reached 25 percent of GDP in FY2017, up from
21 percent the year before. Private investment
rebounded strongly reaching 20 percent of GDP
with the remainder going to the public investment.
Consumption, while it still the largest contributor
to GDP, has shrunk to 89 percent of GDP, down
from a 5-year average of 94 percent. However,
growth in public consumption rebounded strongly
at 12 percent while private consumption was more
muted at 2.5 percent in FY2017. The quality of
national accounts data, in particular from the ex-
penditure side, remains weak as the “change in
stock/statistical error” category account for 29
percent of GDP in FY2017, the highest level on
record.
