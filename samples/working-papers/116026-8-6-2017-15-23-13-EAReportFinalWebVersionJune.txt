Executive Summary

This report on environmental assessment (EA) is the third in a series to be pub-
lished by the World Bank’s Inspection Panel drawing on the main lessons that
have emerged from its caseload over 23 years. With these reports, the Panel
aims to contribute to institutional learning at the World Bank and in the larger
development community by highlighting areas where improvements can
enhance the social, environmental, and overall sustainability of Bank-funded
operations, further development effectiveness, and enhance transparency.
   The Inspection Panel was created in 1993 by the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors to receive and investigate complaints submitted by peo-
ple actually or potentially suffering harm allegedly caused by Bank projects.
Since then, the Panel has received 118 Requests for Inspection. Of those, 87
have been registered and 34 investigated.
   Of the 34 cases investigated, 29 have involved issues related to environmental
assessment, defined as the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating, and
mitigating the natural, social, and other relevant impacts (both positive and neg-
ative) of development proposals prior to making major decisions and commit-
ments. Two of the Panel’s eligibility reports were also considered for this
publication to illustrate additional important lessons. These 31 cases covered 27
countries in six regions. Most of the issues represented in these cases involved
adequate screening and scoping, and the consideration of both social and natu-
ral impacts. While all relevant Panel cases were studied as part of this report, a
special emphasis was put on drawing lessons from cases within the past decade.
   This report draws the following main conclusions from the cases:
••    Panel cases show the importance of a continuous environmental assess-
      ment process throughout the project cycle. This includes conducting
      quality impact assessments during project preparation as well as adequate
      follow-up on issues arising during implementation. Thorough assess-
      ments that integrate natural and social impacts are both required and
      essential to anticipate issues, plan proper mitigation measures, deal with
      problems that arise in an effective and timely manner, and ensure project
      sustainability in the long term.
••    Strong supervision is crucial. This includes on-site verification when
      problems are identified, multidisciplinary expertise that goes beyond
      engineering to environmental and social issues, and continuous dialogue
      to close potential gaps between the reality on the ground and perspectives
      of the project team.
••    Many of the issues found in Panel cases relate to the importance of con-
      sidering the social dimensions of a project, and the Panel’s experience
      suggests that lapses in analyzing social risks and impacts can create or
      exacerbate already complex situations.
••    Not only high-risk (Environmental Category A) projects have the poten-
      tial to cause significant harm. The Panel has received Requests related to


iv	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
     projects in all environmental categories and has investigated projects
     with Category A (18) and B (9) designations. Panel cases show that it is
     critical to identify, mitigate, and monitor all project risks, regardless of the
     project’s environmental categorization.
••   Panel cases have positively influenced World Bank practices related to
     environmental assessment. In response to Panel investigations, the Bank
     has provided clarifications related to the application of the Bank’s Policy
     on Environmental Assessment and issued guidelines to staff on how to
     address relevant policy issues. Some recent examples include the issuance
     of a guidance note on managing labor influx risks in World Bank projects,
     as well as the creation of a Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Task Force to
     develop recommendations for the institution on how to prevent and
     respond to GBV in Bank projects.
  Finally, and as stated in previous Emerging Lessons Series reports, Panel
cases tend to highlight challenging projects where things went wrong.
Therefore, these 31 cases are not necessarily reflective of the Bank’s entire
portfolio. Nevertheless, the lessons are important. This exercise is intended to
help build the institutional knowledge base, enhance accountability, foster
better project results and, ultimately, contribute to more effective develop-
ment with shared prosperity for all.

Introduction
The Inspection Panel was created in 1993 by the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors to receive and investigate complaints submitted by peo-
ple actually or potentially suffering harm allegedly caused by Bank projects.
As of March 2017, the Panel had received 118 Requests for Inspection.1 Of
those, 87 had been registered and 34 investigated. Twenty-nine Panel investi-
gations have involved the Bank’s Environmental Assessment Policy.2
   This report on environmental assessment is the third in a series of Panel
publications drawing on the main lessons that have emerged from its caseload
over 23 years. The first report, published in April 2016, focused on involun-
tary resettlement, while the second, published in October 2016, analyzed
indigenous peoples’ issues. While Panel cases tend to highlight challenging
projects where things went wrong and therefore are not necessarily reflective
of the Bank’s entire portfolio, the lessons nonetheless are important.
   Environmental assessment is the process of identifying, predicting, evalu-
ating, and mitigating the natural, social, and other relevant impacts (both
positive and negative) of development proposals prior to making major proj-
ect-funding decisions and commitments. This assessment is both a technical
tool for analysis, and a legal and institutional procedure in the decision-mak-
ing process. Its purpose is to provide information for decision making; pro-
mote transparency and participation; identify procedures and methods for
follow-up in policy, planning, and project cycles; and contribute to environ-
mentally sound and sustainable development.3
   According to the Bank’s Operational Policy/Bank Procedure 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01; see Appendix A), the EA takes
into account the natural environment (air, water, and land); human health
and safety; social aspects (involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples,
and physical cultural resources); and transboundary and global environ-
mental aspects. EA considers natural and social aspects in an integrated
way. In line with the policy, this publication uses the term environmental
impacts to encompass both natural and social impacts. Since the EA Policy
is considered the umbrella policy for all the other safeguard policies at the
Bank, it is also therefore inevitable that there is a degree of overlap between
the emerging lessons attributable to environmental assessment and the les-
sons from other environmental safeguard policies.
   On August 4, 2016, the Board of Executive Directors approved a new
Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), which includes Environmental
and Social Standard 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and
Social Risks and Impacts. The ESF also introduces protections related to
labor and working conditions; community health and safety, including road
safety; stakeholder engagement throughout the project cycle; and a stron-
ger focus on using the borrowers’ framework for environmental and social

assessment. Since the ESF is not expected to take effect until 2018, the proj-
ects included in this report are based on lessons from the application of the
previous policies.

Methods
Emerging lessons were drawn by analyzing Panel cases involving environ-
mental assessment.
1.	 A complete review of the Panel’s database led to the initial identification
    of the main issues arising in projects involving environmental assess-
    ment. Of the Panel’s 34 investigated cases, 29 have involved environmen-
    tal assessment (see Appendix B). While all of these cases were studied
    for the purposes of this report, emphasis was placed on the lessons from
    cases within the past 10 years. In addition to investigated cases, two eli-
    gibility reports were included to illustrate additional important lessons
    within the Panel’s casework, putting the total number of cases analyzed
    at 31.4
2.	 A systematic identification and classification of issues was undertaken,
    based on common themes and similarities among the cases. (The main
    cases studied are summarized in Appendix C.) Although each case is
    unique, an attempt was made to group findings into general clusters fol-
    lowing the principal features of the Environmental Assessment Policy.
3.	 Literature review was conducted and discussions were held with internal
    and external stakeholders and experts.
4.	 Two internationally renowned experts on environmental assessment and
    World Bank safeguard policies provided peer review for this publication.

    Results
    The subset of 31 cases provides a wide sample, spanning more than 23 years
    and covering 27 countries in six regions. The issue most frequently identified
    by the Panel is inadequate screening and scoping (24 cases), followed by the
    necessity of considering both social and natural impacts (23 cases).
       Figure 1 shows the frequency of the issues identified in the 29 Panel inves-
    tigations and two additional relevant cases analyzing particular EA issues,
    and forms the basis of the emerging lessons presented in this report.
       The results of the Panel’s analysis are presented in the following sections,
    which include examples from Panel cases. They are presented in a sequence
    that follows the project cycle and the main steps required to plan and imple-
    ment projects.

Project Preparation
LESSON 1: Adequate Screening and Scoping
Provide the Foundation for a Robust
Environmental Assessment Process
Screening and scoping are key steps that are completed in the early stages of the
EA process. Screening determines the categorization of the project which, in
turn, defines if the proposed project should be subjected to the preparation of
an EA report, as well as the extent and the type of environmental work required.
Scoping, on the other hand, is the process of identifying the most critical issues
and impacts to be analyzed under the EA. The findings of this process inform
the preparation of the terms of reference (TOR) for the EA. Panel cases have
highlighted the importance of properly identifying critical potential impacts
early in the process, notably during the screening and scoping stages.

Environmental Categorization Reflecting Social Risks
While Panel cases illustrate that generally projects are assigned the correct envi-
ronmental category, there are still weaknesses in adequately considering a proj-
ect’s social risks and impacts during project screening and categorization. Social
risks refer to the social context in which the project operates and includes issues
related to social safeguards on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples,


Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                               5
and also issues related to gender and disadvantaged groups, ethnic tensions, and
cultural heritage. According to Bank procedures, during the environmental
screening process the project is assigned a categorization (Category A, Category
B, Category C or Category FI), which determines the breadth, depth, and type of
EA work required.5 Panel cases showed that project categorization often fell short
of due consideration of important social impacts and their associated risks.
   Examples. The Panel’s investigation of the Emergency Economic and Social
Reunification Support Project (EESRSP) in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) serves as an example of the importance of assessing social risks in the
proper determination of environmental categorization. One project compo-
nent involved the review of logging concessions, an activity that carries signif-
icant environmental and social implications. The existing logging concessions
covered vast stretches of forest, including many areas that are home to Pygmies,
a vulnerable indigenous group whose associated risks were not adequately
considered during project categorization.6 During its investigation, the Panel
found that an environmental assessment corresponding to the project’s
Category B rating was prepared, but it only covered road elements financed
under another component of the project and did not extend to the respective
component involving logging. The Panel found that the potential impacts of
land-use planning in DRC, including the risks to the Pygmy people and their
livelihood, should have been analyzed as part of a Category A environmental
assessment. As a direct consequence of this misclassification, the project
lacked an environmental and social assessment to address these issues. Similar
shortcomings were found in the Panel’s investigation of the Cambodia Forest
Concession Management and Control Pilot Project. Following these investiga-
tions, the Bank reviewed and updated the Guidelines for Environmental
Screening and Classification. These guidelines provided guidance to Bank staff
on both classification and methods to undertake environmental and social
safeguard–related actions in Technical Assistance projects, and the proposed
wider use of strategic environmental assessments to support the preparation
and implementation of natural resource management projects.

Analysis of Alternatives for Project Selection, Location,
and Design
The analysis of alternatives is a key step in project preparation. The Bank’s
Policy on Environmental Assessment requires the examination of realistic
project alternatives, including the “without project” scenario, and a systematic
comparison of their respective positive and negative impacts. The alternatives
analysis should include a broad range of factors, and consider the resource
requirements and benefits for each alternative. The quality of the analysis of
alternatives will directly affect the environmental and social indicators for
tracking project impacts; it is a holistic process that considers more than min-
imizing adverse impacts of a potential project.
   Panel cases have shown a need for a comprehensive and rigorous analysis
of alternatives to inform the selection of a technically feasible, economically
sound, and socially appropriate project. The analysis should include

6	                           Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
consideration of not only alternative locations, but also alternative designs.
The Panel’s findings have shown the need for ensuring identification of alter-
natives prior to site selection—in particular for industrial, infrastructure and
energy projects—in order to minimize issues during the design process. The
Panel’s experience based on its caseload shows that the depth of the analysis
is as important as its breadth, and that the benefits of undertaking an alterna-
tives analysis are questionable if completed only to validate a preselected
technology, siting, or project design. Consideration of a sectoral or regional
EA prior to the preparation of a project-level EA can effectively filter out
unsuitable alternatives in the early project stages.
   Example. The Panel found that in the case of the Uganda Private Power
Generation Project, which consisted of the construction of the Bujagali
hydropower plant to provide an increase of power-generation capacity to the
national grid, project preparation did not adequately consider cultural and
spiritual matters of high significance at Bujagali Falls, and when comparing
the Bujagali and Karuma alternatives. Alternative project configurations were
unduly narrowed on the basis of a-priori judgments rather than exploring all
technically feasible options. The Panel noted that the Bank’s Policy on
Environmental Assessment required alternatives to be laid out in a systematic
way, along with their economic, social, and environmental benefits and costs,
so that judgments on optimal alternatives could be made with a full under-
standing of the trade-offs involved.

Delineating the Project’s Area of Influence and
Considering Associated Facilities
The policy requires the EA to evaluate the project’s potential environmental
impacts in its area of influence. It defines area of influence as the area to be
likely affected by the project, including its ancillary aspects, as well as
unplanned development induced by the project. Panel cases have shown that
there are challenges in accurately delineating the area of influence. The area of
influence may be defined too narrowly, and, as a result, important impacts are
not properly analyzed and mitigated, indirect and induced impacts are not
properly assessed, and important project-affected people (PAPs) are left out of
the consultations and project benefits.
   The Panel has encountered cases where the delineation of the area of influ-
ence was inadequate. In some cases, the area of influence was based solely on the
project’s geographical footprint and as a consequence important impacts situ-
ated away from the construction site were not assessed and mitigated. The delin-
eation of the area of influence should be context-specific and take into account
indirect and induced development impacts resulting from the project.
   Examples. In the case of the Lima Urban Transport Project that supported
the establishment of a mass transit system, limited attention was paid to
assessing the impacts that would take place beyond construction and oper-
ation of the bus corridor. There was no assessment of the impacts associated
with changes in traffic patterns, rerouting, and impacts on the socio-cultural
dynamics of the historic Barranco neighborhood. As a consequence of this

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                             7
narrow approach, some residents of Barranco were not included in the con-
sultations and the project generated tension and conflict. The Panel investi-
gation report, however, noted that subsequently the project created a
dialogue roundtable to discuss the complainants’ concerns, and that the
project had made important contributions to address the high traffic vol-
ume in the city.
   The Panel has also investigated many cases in which the determination of
the area of influence did not take into account the impacts associated with
important facilities and activities linked to the projects. These were conse-
quently not adequately assessed or included in the scope of the project’s
appraisal. Panel cases have also shown that Bank policies lack a clear defini-
tion of what constitutes associated activities and facilities. The project and its
associated facilities and supply areas need to be viewed as an inter-connected
system for the purposes of environmental assessments.
   In the case of the India Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project that
financed a run-of-the river hydro generation project on the Alaknanda River,
the activities associated with constructing multiple dams along the river were
not properly evaluated during the environmental assessment. Further, neither
the impacts from the proposed 30-kilometer (km) line that would evacuate
power from the project, nor those of the proposed wider transmission net-
work, were analyzed as associated activities despite being integral to the suc-
cess of the project. Specifically, the EA lacked an assessment of the impacts
related to the potential loss of farm land and forest resources due to transmis-
sion-line construction.
   During its investigation into the West African Gas Pipeline Project (WAGP),
which financed the construction of a new pipeline system to transport natural
gas from Nigeria to Ghana, Togo, and Benin, the Panel found that its
“upstream” project influences needed to be evaluated. The Panel noted that
the project and associated facilities and supply areas, although several hun-
dred kilometers away from the project itself, should have been viewed as an
inter-connected system for purposes of environmental assessment, and
should have considered both potential benefits and adverse impacts.

Determining the Scope of Cumulative Impacts
Panel cases have uncovered weaknesses in the preparation of cumulative
impact assessments. In some cases, the Panel found that cumulative assess-
ments were not done, and in other cases they did not properly take into
account the long-term impacts associated with future potential projects in the
project’s area of influence. To be effective, a cumulative impact assessment
needs to evaluate the additive effects of existing, planned, and probable future
projects in the area of influence.
  Examples. The Panel’s investigation into the Chad-Cameroon Petroleum
Development and Pipeline Project found that the project should have con-
ducted a cumulative impact assessment during the early scoping of the proj-
ect’s environmental effects to analyze the impacts associated with future
upstream oil developments in northern Cameroon, new oil/gas fields off the

8	                           Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
Cameroon coast, and large-scale regional oil and gas developments planned
for Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Nigeria. Despite the wide extent of the
pipeline spanning 1,100 km and multiple regions in two countries, project
documentation included no discussion of how the boundary of the study area
was determined, nor any mention of the potential area that could be affected
by the project. Additional projects in the vicinity of the pipeline project, such
as the Lom Pangar Dam and the European Union-funded highway linking
southern Chad to northern Cameroon, should also have been incorporated
into a cumulative impact assessment as part of the EA.
   In the South Africa Eskom Investment Support Project, which financed the
4,800-megawatt (MW) Medupi coal-fired power plant and associated infra-
structure, the Panel found inadequate analysis of the cumulative effects on air
quality from the Grootegeluk coal mine and the Medupi and Matimba power
stations. It found that although air quality in the local air shed had been
assessed as part of the EA—consistent with OP/BP 4.01—due consideration
should have been given to probable future projects in the area (e.g. additional
coal mines and coal-fired power stations) to determine the appropriate level
of mitigation measures for the project.

Early Involvement of Internationally Recognized Expertise
The role of internationally recognized expertise is very important for Bank
projects, as it complements Bank advice to the borrower on the terms of ref-
erence for the EA, methods for its preparation, implementation of its recom-
mendations, and the development of environmental management capacity.
The Bank’s EA Policy specifically requires that the borrower retain indepen-
dent experts to carry out the EA for Category A projects. Early involvement of
internationally recognized expertise in the context of high-risk or large infra-
structure projects enhances capacity and improves the quality of preparation.
This expertise is often used to fill gaps in the borrower’s capacity. It plays the
important role of transfer of expertise for design and implementation of proj-
ects, especially when early identification of issues is necessary.
   Examples. The Panel noted that in the case of the Pakistan National Drainage
Program Project (NDP), an environmental advisory panel composed of interna-
tionally recognized expertise should have been in place from the start of the
project. This would have ensured the timely integration of social and environ-
mental issues in a key drainage assessment. The Panel found the extended delay
in establishing an advisory panel contributed to the failure to identify the short-
comings in project design, which consequently affected large parts of Sindh
province and the population living at the tail end of the drainage system.
   Similarly, the Panel noted that in the case of WAGP, the failure to establish
an independent advisory panel during the planning and design stages of the
project and the delay in its establishment during project implementation led
to inadequate attention to several aspects of safeguard policies. Specifically,
there was a lack of ability to interpret and adequately follow up on the warn-
ing signs relating to social aspects that the monitoring reports had raised and
discussed.

LESSON 2: Consideration of Both Social and
Natural Impacts Should Inform Project Design
The EA Policy explicitly states that environmental assessment needs to con-
sider social and natural impacts in an integrated manner. Panel cases indicate
that in practice, the EA process often focuses on impacts to the natural envi-
ronment, and key social impacts are in many cases overlooked. Important
social impacts often not considered during the EA process include those asso-
ciated with changes in land use, control over resources and livelihood systems,
influx of workers and population growth, public health, impacts on vulnerable
and disadvantaged groups, and labor and induced development issues. The
Panel often finds weak understanding of the broader social context in which
the project operates: e.g. ethnic tensions, political economy, labor influx,
socio-cultural and historical factors, and post-conflict environments.

Assessing Social Impacts and Designing Related
Mitigation Measures
It is important to treat natural and social issues in an integrated manner, and
to consider social impacts beyond those covered in the application of Bank’s
safeguard policies on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.
Panel cases have shown that many environmental assessments contain either
no or weak analyses of potential social impacts. These cases illustrate the
need to ensure that environmental assessment documents properly analyze
key social impacts and their associated risks, and propose commensurate
mitigation measures to not only avoid harm to all project-affected people,
but also to identify opportunities to maximize benefits for affected
communities.
   The new Environmental and Social Framework demonstrates the evolution
of the Bank’s approach to this topic since the prior policy update. The ESF
broadens the scope of the assessment by adding more explicit requirements
covering social impacts and taking into account other social risks, including
those related to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.
   Examples. The Uzbekistan Second Rural Enterprise Support Project sup-
ported the rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and pro-
vided financial and capacity-building support to farmers and agribusinesses.
While the project’s social assessment mentioned child labor in cotton farms
supported by the project as a risk, the analysis and mitigation measures were
not sufficiently robust. In addition, the social assessment lacked an analysis
of issues related to forced labor in the sector, despite the fact that these prac-
tices were widespread in the country. In response to the Panel case, the Bank
signed a memorandum of understanding with the International Labour
Organization to carry out third-party monitoring of child and forced labor
in cotton fields in Bank-financed projects. All relevant project documents
were amended to require compliance with the applicable national and inter-
national laws and regulations against forced and child labor. Farming train-
ing modules under the project were also expanded to include prohibition of


10	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
forced and child labor. Finally, new efforts were introduced to support
diversification and mechanization of the cotton sector to reduce reliance on
manual labor.
   In the case of the Cambodia Forest Concession Management and Control
Pilot Project, the Panel found the lack of a social assessment specific to this
project had consequences on the ability of the Bank to comply with its
operational policies, from the design through the implementation phases.
For example, the project failed to consider or investigate complaints about
illegal logging of resin trees on the part of concessionaries covered by the
project, and the associated harm to the local people. Also, as a result of the
lack of a social assessment, there was no early consultation with project-af-
fected people and the project design was not informed by critical concerns
relating to indigenous peoples, resin tapping, community ownership of
trees, community forestry initiatives, and other matters of central impor-
tance to the affected communities. These failures caused the illegal logging
of resin trees to have negative consequences on the Requesters and the local
communities.

Meaningful Consultations Improve the Quality of Impact
Assessment
Meaningful and timely consultations with the relevant stakeholders are key
to identification and mitigation of potential impacts and their associated
risks. The Panel’s experience from its caseload shows the importance of rec-
ognizing and valuing local stakeholders’ perspectives and their often deep
understanding of the local environmental and social context. The long-range
experience of local populations and their specific expertise can complement
shorter-term assessments. The timing of such consultation is also critical, as
it opens up, or conversely closes, opportunities to integrate the feedback
from the consulted parties into project design or implementation activities.
Modalities are equally critical, since language or conceptualization barriers
can jeopardize the required two-way communication. When relevant stake-
holders are not adequately consulted about potential impacts, risks, and mit-
igation measures, the project can face unexpected obstacles, thus limiting its
effectiveness.
   Example. In the case of the Argentina Santa Fe Road Infrastructure Project
and Provincial Road Infrastructure Project, which provided for upgrading
136 km of road between the cities of Santo Tomé and San Francisco, the Panel
found that project-affected people were given the opportunity to meet project
officials to express concerns and make suggestions for design changes, and
many concerns were addressed. However, concerns about negative impacts of
the project on the hydrology of the area were dismissed; PAPs were viewed as
non-experts with insufficient competence to discuss complex hydrological
issues. The Requesters were not initially provided with all relevant informa-
tion to support the assertion that the project would not worsen flood risks.
This created tensions between the Requesters and the project that were not
addressed until after the Panel became involved.

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                          11
Mitigation through the Environmental Management Plan
Bank policy identifies an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) as an
essential feature of Category A projects and the Panel’s experience from its
caseload has shown that preparing an EMP is critical for the successful avoid-
ance, mitigation, or compensation of potential environmental and social
impacts throughout the project cycle. The EMP is a key step in project plan-
ning to operationalize mitigation measures specified within an EA report.
While there is no standard format for an EMP, Panel cases have shown the
importance of preparing an EMP prior to project implementation, with
detailed timelines, budgets, a division of responsibilities that reflects the avail-
able institutional capacity, and a monitoring program. When used appropri-
ately, the EMP provides a link between the assessment reports and operational
activities, and its content can be adequately translated into the loan agree-
ment and bidding documents to guide borrower and contractor responsibili-
ties during implementation and monitoring. The EMP should be a “living
document” that is adapted to new and changing circumstances.
   Examples. During the investigation into the Uganda Transport Sector
Development Project, which had the objectives of financing the upgrading and
rehabilitation of 66 km of road and supporting technical assistance to strengthen
the internal audit functions of the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA),
the Panel found that the contractor submitted a draft Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) to the supervising engineer nearly one year after
construction had started, and the Bank only received it after two years. The
Panel found that even when impacts were predicted in the Environmental and
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), there were no corresponding mitigation mea-
sures in the ESMP to address these impacts. For example, the ESIA had identi-
fied some potential adverse social impacts from the expected influx of labor into
the project area during implementation and required a strict no-fraternization
rule be applied between the workers’ camp and the surrounding community.
Despite these observations in the ESIA, the ESMP did not state whether the
camp should accommodate only foreign workers or also house Ugandan work-
ers. In addition, the ESMP lacked adequate mitigation measures to address the
risks related to the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) identified in
the ESIA or to minimize the negative gender impacts of the project. Unfortunately,
serious instances of sexual abuse by workers materialized.
   The Panel’s investigation into the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline Project found
that a comprehensive EMP had been prepared to address the challenges associ-
ated with environmental management of a complex project in a demanding
physical and political environment. The Panel also noted that when compared
to similar oil and gas programs, this project’s EMP reflected a practical,
“hands-on” approach to environmental management. Despite these positive
aspects, the Panel found issues with how the thoroughness of the EMP was
translated into action. For example, although a regional development plan was a
requirement of the project EMP documentation, the lack of borrower capacity
to prepare this document was evident. The project did not ensure that the bor-
rower had adequate capacity to implement the important measures prescribed


12	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
by the EMP, and that resulted in concerns about the local monitoring capabili-
ties to effectively safeguard the long-term sustainability of the project.



LESSON 3: Distinct Adverse Impacts Require
Special Attention
Impacts on Forests and Water Sources
Forests and water are examples of important natural resources that can be affected
during the lifecycle of a project. These resources often provide crucial natural
habitats for flora and fauna, as well as benefits to local human populations, when
managed sustainably. The Panel’s caseload has shown the importance for projects
to be mindful of the relationship between PAPs, forests, and water systems, par-
ticularly in relation to livelihoods. It is essential to identify and analyze early in
the project cycle “no go” and “caution” areas that could be affected by project-re-
lated activities. It is also important to emphasize that special attention needs to be
paid when there are likely impacts on the forest and water resources of projects in
all sectors, and not only those in the forest and water sectors.
   Examples. The Panel’s investigation into the South Africa Eskom Investment
Support Project found that its direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on avail-
ability and quality of surface and groundwater resources to communities were
not adequately considered. The focus on water resources in project documents
appeared to be on ensuring that the Medupi power plant would have a reliable
source of water supply, rather than on the potential impacts this new water usage
would have on existing users, especially given the scarcity of water resources in
the region. The Panel also noted that associated activities, such as the expansion
of a nearby mine to supply coal to Medupi and the additional river-bed sand
excavation, would result in further demand on river systems and water quality.
The Panel found that these instances of non-compliance likely weakened the
ability of the project to take effective steps to minimize or avoid these impacts.
   In the case of the Argentina Santa Fe Road Infrastructure Project and the
Provincial Road Infrastructure Project, the Requesters claimed that the proj-
ect would increase the risk of flooding in the area surrounding Road 19,
which was being converted into a four-lane highway with a new elevated car-
riageway. According to the Requesters, the new road was incompatible with
the area’s hydrological situation, given the flat land and insufficient rain
absorption that could create a “dam effect” in case of heavy rain and cause
harm to nearby fields and crops. The Panel found that the project design was
considerably more concerned with the impact of environmental conditions
on the road rather than the impact of the road on the environment. Although
the ESMP contained an assessment of the social and bio-physical aspects of
the project, it lacked a proper description and analysis of the project’s poten-
tial impacts on flooding risks upstream and downstream of Road 19.
   Steps were taken in the Uganda Private Power Generation Project to offset the
loss of Bujagali Falls and other natural habitats that would be inundated by dam-
ming of the Nile, but these steps were found to be insufficient. Although the


Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                                 13
project had created the Kalagala Offset Area to preserve the Kalagala Falls, the
Panel found that the offset was not being subjected to appropriate conservation
and mitigation measures in conformity with sound environmental and social
standards.

Transboundary and Global Environmental Externalities
The World Bank EA Policy requires the environmental assessment to take
into account the transboundary and global environmental impacts of a proj-
ect, including climate change, the use of ozone-depleting substances, pollu-
tion of international waters, and adverse effects on biodiversity. Panel cases
have shown the challenges of identifying and addressing potential trans-
boundary and global impacts.
   Examples. In the South Africa Eskom Power Project, the Requesters claimed
that the Medupi power plant financed by the project would make it more dif-
ficult for South Africa to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction commit-
ments, and that the climate-change impacts of the project had not been
adequately considered and addressed as required by Bank policy. The Panel
examined whether the project’s environmental assessment adequately consid-
ered and adopted technology and policy measures to control and mitigate
GHG emissions in line with Bank policy. The Panel found that steps had been
taken to adhere to this policy framework but that the magnitude of emissions
from Medupi far outweighed emissions avoided through project mitigation
measures. In addition, the Panel found that the description of the net results
of the project’s mitigation efforts failed to adequately demonstrate that the
project was directly addressing its own externalities.
   In the case of the Tajikistan Energy Loss Reduction Project, which was financ-
ing assessment studies of the proposed Rogun Hydropower Plant (HPP), the
Requesters represented non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Uzbekistan
as downstream-affected people of a transboundary project. They claimed that
the feasibility studies of the Rogun HPP financed under the project were “one-
sided” and did not take into account the concerns of all parties affected by the
project. They also feared that a potential failure of the dam would destroy six
hydroelectric power stations downstream and more than 700 settlements in
Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. In its eligibility report,
the Panel noted that carrying out assessment studies on a transboundary project
through an agreement with an upstream country could indeed raise fears among
downstream stakeholders about their ability to participate on an equitable basis
and ensure that their concerns were appropriately considered and addressed. At
the same time, the Panel noted that the project had conducted extensive consul-
tations with the governments of riparian countries, including Uzbekistan, and
had included their concerns in the terms of reference of the studies. In addition,
the Bank had agreed to separately finance and manage additional components
to address the concerns of downstream riparians, including the establishment of
two panels of experts, a study of alternatives, and a structured program of ripar-
ian consultations. As a result of the Bank’s efforts to address these concerns, the
Panel did not recommend an investigation into the project.


14	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
Impacts on Cultural Resources
The World Bank defines physical cultural resources as movable or immovable
objects, sites, structures, groups of structures, and natural features and land-
scapes that have archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, reli-
gious, aesthetic, or other cultural significance. They can be located in urban or
rural settings, above or below ground, or under water. Since a physical cultural
resource may not be visible or known to a project team from the outset, a proj-
ect’s potential impacts on physical cultural resources need to be considered early
in the project cycle. Through its Policy on Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP
4.11), the Bank assists countries in avoiding or mitigating adverse impacts on
cultural resources as an integral part of the environmental assessment process.
These impacts should be taken into account during project screening, included
in the TOR for EA, and identified and evaluated in the feasibility studies and EA
of the proposed project. The Panel has experienced several cases where this
early identification of the impacts on physical cultural resources at the environ-
mental assessment stage was insufficient.
   Examples. The Cambodia Forest Concession Management and Control Pilot
Project did not conduct a careful assessment or inventory to record and quan-
tify resin trees, and other timber and non-timber forest products traditionally
used by indigenous peoples and rural local communities. The Panel found that
such a study should have been part of a proper environmental assessment, and
should have been the subject of a participatory survey and inventory at an early
stage of the project. It also found documented cases of “spirit forests” (critical
natural habitats) being logged and destroyed without any consideration of their
spiritual or cultural values. The project also made no allowance for chance finds
of archeological sites within the vast areas of forest concessions being consid-
ered for logging. In addition, the Panel found that the identification of “spirit
forests” and surveys for archeological sites were in the hands of the concession-
aires, instead of being carried out as part of the project preparation.
   In the Private Power Generation Project, the Panel found the Bujagali Falls
were an integral part of the Busoga people’s cultural heritage and that the
project had not properly considered cultural and spiritual matters when alter-
native sites for the hydropower plant were analyzed. The Panel also found the
project had failed to adequately consult with the Busoga spiritual clan leaders
about the significant cultural patrimony of the Bujagali Falls.

Health and Safety Issues
Since 2013, the World Bank Environmental Assessment Policy explicitly
requires the Bank to assess human health and safety issues under the EA pro-
cess. According to the policy, the Bank has to follow the Environmental
Health and Safety Guidelines. This is a technical reference document that pro-
vides examples of good international industry practice and measures gener-
ally considered achievable by existing technology at reasonable cost. The
guidelines cover impacts such as noise, hazardous materials, air emissions,
and wastewater quality, as well as occupational and community health and


Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                             15
safety during construction and decommissioning of a project. However, Panel
cases have shown that these impacts have been analyzed to a limited extent
and that there is a corresponding lack of mitigation measures.
   Examples. In the case of the Uganda Transport Sector Development Project,
the Panel found that poor safety measures had led to more than 25 occupa-
tional or road accidents, resulting in at least seven fatalities and many perma-
nent injuries. The Panel also determined that the EA lacked the required
analysis of the risks to women and children caused by labor influx, in partic-
ular the impacts related to sex with minors, teenage pregnancy, sexual harass-
ment, child labor, and school dropouts. The Panel found that the project did
not properly assess the risks and had inadequately appraised human health
and safety and social impacts, specifically gender-based violence and exploita-
tion of children. In addition, the mitigation measures proposed in the EA
mainly focused on HIV/AIDS prevention and were inadequate to respond to
the multidimensional problems of gender-based violence and the need for
child protection. These shortcomings in the project’s mitigation measures
resulted in serious and long-lasting harm to the community. As a result of the
Panel’s investigation, the Bank issued a guidance note to staff on how to man-
age labor influx risks in World Bank projects and created a Gender-Based
Violence Taskforce with experts in this field to develop recommendations on
how to prevent and respond to GBV in Bank projects.



LESSON 4: Impacts Can Materialize Under
Different Financial Instruments
Over the years, the Panel has considered the assessment of environmental
and social impacts and resulting mitigation measures in the context of dif-
ferent financial instruments, including block grants in a basic services proj-
ect in Ethiopia, a Development Policy Lending (DPL) project in DRC’s
forest sector, a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) in Cambodia’s forest
sector, as well as Technical Assistance operations. It should be noted that
the safeguard policies do not apply to DPLs and Program-for-Results
(PforR) financing and that these instruments have their own policies with
requirements for assessing and mitigating environmental and social
impacts (OP/BP 8.60 for DPLs and OP/BP 9.00 for PforRs). The Panel in
these cases emphasized the importance of the Bank’s assessment of poten-
tial serious impacts and corresponding mitigation measures, independent
of the financing instrument used.
   Examples. In the Panel’s investigation of the Ethiopia Promoting Basic
Services (PBS) Phase III Project, the Requesters claimed that the Anuak
Indigenous Peoples were harmed as a result of the Bank’s non-compliance
with its policies and procedures. They argued that PBS was contributing
directly to the Ethiopian government’s villagization program and that the
Anuaks were being forced to leave their ancestral land under this program.
The Panel observed that the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) noted that


16	                         Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
safeguards were not triggered as project financing was limited to recurrent
expenditures for basic services. The Panel found that when one or more safe-
guard policies are relevant to the proposed investment lending operation, the
project should apply them. The Panel’s investigation also found that even
though the evictions were not caused by the project, there were major short-
comings in the risk assessments during project appraisal and implementation
and the mitigation measures were not adequate to manage the concurrent
roll-out of the government’s villagization program in PBS project regions. The
Panel did not question the use of this “quasi-Program-for-Results” modality in
this project, but noted that the system of delivery needs to be robust and meet
accepted environmental and social safeguard principles.
   In its investigation of the DRC Emergency Economic and Social
Reunification Support Project and the Transitional Support for Economic
Recovery Operation (TSERO), the Panel responded to a complaint alleging
that the Bank’s use of certain lending instruments led to the circumvention of
its safeguard policies. The Panel noted that the TSERO was not subject to
safeguard policies because it was a DPL project. The Panel found that the
project’s determination that there were no significant environmental and
social effects of the forest component of the TSERO was not consistent with
the objectives of Bank policies, especially as TSERO carried forward the ear-
lier EESRSP, which was subject to Bank safeguard policies and should have
been qualified as a Category A project for its component financing the
Logging-Concession Review Process.
   The Panel, in its investigation of the Cambodia Forest Concession
Management and Control Pilot Project, assessed the use of a LIL, which was
established in part to pilot concession management operations in untested
areas before scaling up such operations. The Panel observed that the main
aim of the loan was to support a legal and regulatory program to establish
the basis on which long-term concessions were to be granted, an exercise
that cannot be regarded as “learning and hypothesis-testing.” The Panel
found that the LIL was not designed for the kind of forestry project for
which it was used in Cambodia. The use of the LIL, while enabling the funds
to be disbursed quickly, facilitated project classification as Category B, lead-
ing to less attention to Bank safeguard policies and procedures, which in the
long run proved costly.



LESSON 5: Ensuring Borrower Capacity is Crucial
for Effective Project Implementation
Successful implementation of the mitigation measures outlined in the EA
depends on the capacity of the institutions involved in environmental man-
agement. Assessing borrower capacity is important for understanding the risk
profile of the project, the identification of mitigation measures, and the
enhancement of capacity to ensure successful project implementation. Such
capacity, as well as the capacity of the Bank to monitor implementation, will
determine whether the project is implemented as designed and will

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                           17
adequately prevent adverse social and environmental impacts. As the new
ESF will rely heavily on the borrower’s environmental and social framework,
adequately addressing borrower capacity will only gain in importance for
ensuring effective project implementation.

Addressing Capacity Gaps Among Relevant Stakeholders
While a careful assessment of the borrower’s capacity to implement the proj-
ect and the agreed mitigation measures is crucial for successful implemen-
tation of a project, Panel cases have illustrated instances in which
environmental assessments lack an evaluation of institutional capacity or do
not analyze capacity gaps in depth. In these cases, EAs do not review the
implementing agency’s environmental management system and deci-
sion-making processes, and do not examine available human resources and
the agency’s past track record. As a result, projects can lack the appropriate
measures, resources, and capacity to ensure that key EA-related functions
are carried out, as mandated by the policy.
   Environmental management is also invariably inter-sectoral, with respon-
sibility spread across a number of specialized and non-specialized agencies. A
good quality assessment should analyze not only the capacity of the imple-
menting agency to carry out the measures outlined under the environmental
assessment, but also the capacity of all relevant government agencies and
other stakeholders to manage their responsibilities. Therefore, it is critical
that not only local communities but also other relevant government agencies
and local administration are consulted in a systematic manner to ensure con-
sistency among the project’s EA, EMP, and local/sectoral development plans,
and to obtain information on system-wide gaps. Consideration must be given
to the responsibilities and coordination mechanisms needed to ensure good
collection and transfer of information, appropriate and timely checking of
documents and reports, issuance of licenses and permits, and project
monitoring.
   Examples. In the case of the Nepal Power Development Project, the Panel
found that the EA did not include an institutional analysis and did not assess the
capacity of the implementation agency, the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA),
to oversee the environmental and social assessments or to implement remedial
and mitigation measures. Although the Bank was aware that the borrower’s pub-
lic-sector capacity had weakened over the years, it did not ensure that this was
reflected in either the environmental assessment or other project documents.
Despite some attempts at rectifying these weakness, very little was done to pro-
vide more comprehensive support for capacity building at NEA, thus contribut-
ing to the problems the project faced during implementation.
   Poor project governance was a critical aspect contributing to harm in the
Uganda Transport Sector Development Project. The Panel found that the
main actors (the Uganda National Roads Authority, the contractor, and the
supervising engineer) did not proceed with a common purpose to address
problems. In addition, during the project’s implementation all three entities
experienced management turnover and suffered from a lack of capacity,

18	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
especially the needed social expertise. They were thus unable to respond ade-
quately to environmental and social issues occurring in the project. These
three factors (lack of collaboration, high turnover, and weak capacity) led to
frequent dereliction of responsibilities. In parallel, the Bank’s response was
insufficient, and although supervision missions took place, they neither built
the required capacity nor resulted in effective problem solving.

Assessing a Borrower’s Legal Framework and International
Obligations
Understanding the borrower’s legal framework in which the project will be
implemented is important, especially when a project is operating under the
use of country systems. It is essential to analyze existing national laws as
well as their application. In accordance with the Bank’s OP 4.01, a project’s
EA should also take into account the country’s obligations pertaining to
project activities under relevant international environmental treaties and
agreements.
  Examples. The Panel’s investigation of the South Africa Eskom
Investment Support Project was its first investigation into a project imple-
mented under the Bank’s Policy on Piloting the Use of Borrower/Country
Systems. The Bank conducted a Safeguards Diagnostic Review (SDR) to
determine whether the applicable legal and institutional framework was
designed to achieve the objectives and adhere to the applicable operational
principles of Bank policy. The Panel noted that the Bank generally did
good quality work in developing the SDR, especially given the challenging
and complex nature of this task, and that the analysis contained a detailed
review of the implementing agency’s framework and practices. Nevertheless,
the Panel found that the SDR did not adequately address certain gaps in
the legal framework pertaining to the analysis of cumulative impacts, the
capacity of key local government institutions responsible for environmen-
tal regulatory oversight, and environmental management planning. The
SDR also failed to adequately address the lack of provisions in South
African law to use an independent advisory panel for an environmental
impact assessment for a project of this scale. The Panel noted that the exis-
tence of adequate capacity to identify and address and regulate the impacts
from a project of this size and scale was a crucial factor to ensure the proj-
ect’s overall health, environmental and development outcomes, and com-
pliance with Bank policies.
  During the investigation of the Pakistan National Drainage Program
Project, the Panel found little attention given to address or mitigate impacts
on the dhands, a series of wetlands and interconnected lakes that were a
source of livelihood for 40 villages. Some of these areas are included in the
Ramsar Convention’s List of Wetlands of International Importance, which
provides an internationally agreed upon framework for the conservation and
wise use of wetlands and their flora and fauna. The Panel noted that by not
meeting its international environmental obligations, the project contributed
to the degradation of these internationally recognized sites.

   In conjunction with the Panel’s investigation into the Albania Power Sector
Generation and Restructuring Project, which included the construction of a
combined-cycle thermal power station and connection to the power transmis-
sion network, the Requesters submitted a complaint to the Aarhus Convention
Compliance Committee regarding Albania’s compliance with its laws on the
environment, public participation and cultural heritage. The committee found
that the government of Albania had failed to comply with the public participa-
tion legal requirements during the siting process, and thus did not fulfill its
obligations under the Aarhus Convention. Subsequently, the Panel found that
PAPs and local NGOs had not been meaningfully consulted throughout proj-
ect preparation and implementation on environmental, social, cultural, tour-
ism and health issues that affected them. The Panel also found that the Bank
did not ensure that project preparation activities complied with the consulta-
tion and participation requirements of the Aarhus Convention, as an interna-
tional environmental agreement to which Albania is a party.

Project Implementation
LESSON 6: Effective Monitoring, Supervision, and
Continuous Environmental Assessment Require
Appropriate Expertise and Resources
Although proper supervision is critical to all Bank projects, Panel cases have
shown the importance of initiating strong supervision practices early in the
project lifecycle. A thorough supervision plan and mobilization of appropri-
ate expertise early in the lifecycle can improve a project’s environmental man-
agement and help to identify and mitigate issues effectively.

Engaging Bank Multidisciplinary Expertise
Depending on the project and the extent of risks and impacts, effective super-
vision requires the proper allocation of multidisciplinary expertise. The
Panel’s experience from its cases has shown that in infrastructure projects
more emphasis is usually given to engineering aspects of supervision than to
environmental and social issues. It is important to note that the inclusion of
other expertise in supervisory missions can provide valuable insights.
   Examples. In the case of the Uganda Transport Sector Development Project,
while the Bank undertook numerous supervision missions, the composition
of the supervision teams lacked the requisite expertise to address the impacts



Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                          21
related to gender-based violence and child protection. As a consequence, the
Bank missed important warning signs identified in an HIV/AIDS baseline
report and was unable to detect cases of GBV even after the complaint was
brought to the Panel. Attempts to raise sensitive issues related to child sexual
abuse in large public meetings hampered identification and discussion of the
problem. As a result of this inappropriate expertise, many cases of gen-
der-based violence continued for more than a year after the first complaint
was received by the Panel.
   In the Peru Lima Urban Transport Project case, the Panel noted that for
long periods during project implementation, the team did not benefit from
the consistent presence of a social expert. When problems started to emerge
in Barranco as the construction of the Metropolitano progressed, project offi-
cials did not initially recognize flaws in the consultation process, which did
not include the residents of Barranco. Subsequently, a social specialist joined
the project team and became more active in trying to address the issues raised.
Such supervision efforts led to the creation of a dialogue roundtable with the
participation of Barranco residents and the opening of a grievance office.

Identifying Warning Signs and Proposing Solutions
through Continuous and Proactive Supervision
Effective supervision requires continuous dialogue to identify warning signs
and propose solutions to problems that develop during project implementa-
tion. Panel cases have shown that it is essential to have systems in place to
address problems as they arise. Such systems require coordination between
project management and supervision efforts to “close the loop” when problems
are identified. The lack of field verification when problems are reported has
repeatedly led to weak supervision that has failed to address instances of harm.
   Examples. In the case of the WAGP, the Panel found that an important rea-
son for the shortcomings in supervision was an apparent lack of available
resources to monitor and oversee the project’s social and environmental
impacts. The Panel noted during its investigation that senior Bank safeguard
specialists exercised project oversight; however, they were all based in
Washington, D.C. The Panel noted the challenges of overseeing safeguard pol-
icies and ensuring the borrower’s adherence to environmental and social
requirements “from a distance,” without adequate support from field staff.
   The Panel on several occasions has noted the need for Bank staff to exer-
cise greater long-term field, or on-site, supervision of projects and to rely
less on quick supervision missions. In its report following its investigation
into the Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project, the Panel recorded that a larg-
er-than-average number of supervision missions took place, including three
high-level supervision meetings. However, the missions were not an ade-
quate response to alleviate the perceptions and suspicions of PAPs due to the
fact that project staff did not meet directly with affected people in appropri-
ate settings and did not focus on social safeguard issues. Inadequate on-site
reconnaissance and supervision were one of the biggest problems of this
project.

22	                         Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
Effective Monitoring and Follow-up
The Panel’s caseload has shown that a well-designed monitoring system to
measure project impacts is a fundamental requirement for economic, social,
and environmental sustainability of Bank projects. This system can track
immediate project outcomes and longer-term impacts that may require
mitigation measures. Specifically, environmental-performance-monitoring
programs must be designed and implemented by the borrower, with over-
sight from the Bank, to ensure mitigation measures are effective in the long
term. The design of such systems should be based on a thorough under-
standing of baseline conditions, both environmental and social. Panel cases
have shown that it is crucial that monitoring is mainstreamed into the proj-
ects and the information from the monitoring reports is used to inform
project implementation. In addition, the Panel’s caseload has shown that it
is important to address capacity issues during the implementation of mon-
itoring systems to effectively track project impacts. Maintaining strong
communication strategies between the Bank and the borrower in a trans-
parent manner is an important component of environmental-monitoring
activities to not only address issues of capacity, but also to ensure the miti-
gation measures are implemented at appropriate times throughout the
project lifecycle.
   Examples. Although the EA for the Pakistan National Drainage Program
Project had expressed concern over the lack of a complete baseline study and
of a continuing systematic, scientific, and well-coordinated monitoring pro-
gram, the Panel found that these remained critical issues that had not been
addressed as recommended. While the Panel commended the Bank for sup-
porting the subsequent creation of the monitoring program, it also found that
its data interpretation and analysis practices had not been successfully imple-
mented. The consequence of the shortcomings in the EA (lack of baseline
data and of a monitoring program), led to decision making on environmen-
tally crucial elements under the project becoming less systematic, less
informed and more ad hoc.
   The Panel noted in the Uganda Private Power Generation Project case that
the need to strengthen the borrower’s capacity to perform environmen-
tal-monitoring activities and implement-mitigation measures had been rec-
ognized in initial project documents. However, the Panel found that the
needed capacity-building measures had not been implemented, resulting in
complaints that the Kalagala environmental offset area was not being man-
aged appropriately. Additionally, the Environmental Mitigation and Monitor-
ing Plan lacked a strategy for monitoring the enhancements and offset
plantings required as a part of the project’s mitigation measures.
   In the case of the Uganda Transport Sector Development Project,
although Bank missions noted shortcomings related to health and safety
measures, the project’s attempts to improve performance did not rely on a
combination of ongoing monitoring and effective accountability. The Panel
found that no serious assessment had been made of the capacity of the
implementing agency, UNRA, to undertake the required environmental

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                          23
and social monitoring or evaluation of the effectiveness of the mitigation
measures outlined in the ESIA. In addition, attempts to improve project
monitoring and implementation of mitigation measures were hampered by
a lack of collaboration among the entities responsible for project imple-
mentation, namely UNRA, the supervising engineer, and the contractor. As
a result, poor safety measures led to many accidents, resulting in both per-
manent injuries and fatalities.

Long-Term Impacts
LESSON 7: Ensuring Strong Protection for People
and their Environment is Key for Sustainable
Project Development Outcomes
Implementation of the Bank’s Policy on Environmental Assessment, which aims
to ensure identification and management of natural and social impacts, is essen-
tial for sustainable development outcomes of projects. In several of its cases, the
Panel observed that a lack of attention to the natural and social dimensions
during design and implementation limited the project’s long-term sustainability.
Moreover, the Panel’s cases have shown that a community’s proper understand-
ing of a project and buy-in are necessary for ensuring sustainability.
   Examples. The Yacyretá Hydroelectric Project was supported by several
World Bank loans and its implementation spanned more than 20 years. The
project’s execution of the environmental and social activities constantly suf-
fered from a lack of funds and the implementing agency’s weak managerial
capacity. Although most of the execution of the civil works of the dam had
been completed at the time of the Panel’s investigation, there were serious
delays in implementing the resettlement programs, and the social and envi-
ronmental problems associated with resettlement became a “liability” with
mounting financial costs. Among the problems with the resettlement pro-
gram, there was a failure to ensure sound technical aspects in the design,


Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                              25
construction and implementation of the resettlement program, leading to
poorly constructed houses, drainage systems and roads. In addition, inade-
quate environmental assessment of the resettlement programs, including a
failure to identify and mitigate the impacts caused by population influx,
resulted in adverse effects on the host community of Encarnación. The
absence of a communication strategy also significantly damaged the relation-
ship between those implementing the project and the affected people. Long
delays in implementing the resettlement and environmental mitigation activ-
ities brought substantial costs and hardships to the affected people, and ulti-
mately threatened the completion of the project and delivery of long-term
benefits to those affected.
   In its investigation of the Nepal Power Development Project, the Panel
found that the project did not pay sufficient attention to its social dimensions,
as it did not ensure adequate, timely and meaningful consultations with
affected parties both during preparation and implementation. While the Panel
acknowledged the precarious security situation in the project area during
preparation and implementation, which placed travel restrictions on the Bank
staff, the Panel noted that the lack of sustained communication and consulta-
tion with the affected community members led to the spread of misinforma-
tion about the transmission line, especially with regard to its perceived health
impacts. In the Panel’s view, this contributed to the community’s growing
opposition to the project, causing serious delays, jeopardizing the completion
of the project and thereby impacting its long-term sustainability and
effectiveness.

Conclusions
The Inspection Panel’s cases over the past 23 years cover a broad range of envi-
ronmental assessment issues from which important lessons emerge that can be
useful for World Bank staff and development practitioners more broadly.
Among Panel cases, the EA Policy has been raised most frequently to date,
demonstrating the importance of improving the understanding of the policy
and its application. Given the Panel’s mandate to respond to complaints from
communities adversely affected by World Bank-financed projects, the sample
of cases analyzed for this report may not be representative of the Bank’s overall
performance in the area of environmental assessment. Nevertheless, these les-
sons are important.
   The Panel’s emerging lessons from environmental assessment cases are
summarized in Table 1 on the following page. These emerging lessons provide
the foundation for this report’s main conclusions.
   First, Panel cases show the importance of a continuous environmental
assessment process throughout the project cycle. This includes conducting
quality impact assessments during project preparation as well as adequate fol-
low-up to issues arising during implementation. Comprehensive assessments
that integrate natural and social impacts are essential to anticipate issues, plan
proper mitigation measures, deal with problems that arise in an effective and
timely manner, and ensure project sustainability in the long term.

  Second, the Panel’s experience from its cases shows the need for strong
supervision. This includes on-site verification when problems are identified,
multidisciplinary expertise that goes beyond engineering to environmental
and social issues, and continuous dialogue to close potential gaps between the
reality on the ground and the perspectives of project teams.
  Third, many of the issues found in Panel cases relate to the importance of
considering the social dimensions of projects, and the Panel’s experience sug-
gests that lapses in understanding social risks and impacts in the environ-
mental assessment can create or exacerbate complex social situations.
  Fourth, the Panel’s case portfolio shows that it is not only high-risk (Category
A) projects that can cause significant harm. The Panel has received Requests
regarding projects with all environmental categories and has conducted


28	                            Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
investigations of projects with Category A (18) and B (9) designations. This
shows that it is critical to identify, mitigate, and monitor all project risks,
regardless of the project’s environmental categorization.
   Finally, Panel cases have positively influenced World Bank practices related
to environmental assessment. In response to Panel investigations, the Bank
has provided clarifications related to the application of Bank’s Policy on
Environmental Assessment and issued guidelines to staff on how to address
relevant policy issues. Some examples include the issuance of a guidance note
on managing labor influx risks in World Bank projects, as well as the creation
of a Gender-Based Violence Task Force to develop recommendations for the
institution on how to prevent and respond to GBV in Bank projects.
   The Panel notes that the Bank’s ESF, which was adopted by the World Bank’s
Board of Executive Directors in August 2016, requires environmental and
social assessments to be conducted in a comprehensive and integrated man-
ner. The ESF is in accordance with the emerging lessons from Panel investiga-
tions: Environmental and social assessment of projects proposed for Bank
financing needs to be conducted in an integrated manner to ensure they are
environmentally and socially sound and sustainable.

Appendix A

Summary of the World Bank
Policy on Environmental
Assessment
Background
Environmental concerns first became an explicit part of World Bank activ-
ities around 1970. The Bank played an active role in this area by becoming
the first multilateral development bank to screen projects for their environ-
mental consequences and to adopt environmental guidelines for the evalu-
ation of future lending operations. By the mid-1980s, the Bank was
financing projects containing environmental components, including sev-
eral freestanding environmental projects, which had specific environmen-
tal objectives, such as reforestation, pollution control, and water resource
management.
   One of the first significant policy statements issued by the Bank in May
1984—Operational Manual Statement 2.36: Environmental Aspects of Bank
Work—required that environmental considerations be introduced at the
time of project identification and preparation, and recognized that modifica-
tion could occur at the time of appraisal, negotiations, and implementation
of the project.
   In 1989, the Bank introduced formal environmental procedures with the
adoption of Operational Directive (OD) 4.00. The directive described envi-
ronmental assessment as a flexible procedure whose depth and breadth
depended on the type of project being planned. An updated directive, OD
4.01, issued in 1991, identified three categories of projects, each with different
requirements for environmental impact assessment: Category A, requiring
full EA; Category B, requiring environmental analysis; and Category C,
requiring neither EA nor environmental analysis.
   In 1999, OP/BP 4.01 replaced OD 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. OP
4.01 is considered to be the umbrella policy for the Bank’s other safeguard
policies, including Natural Habitats (OP 4.04), Forests (OP 4.36), Pest
Management (OP 4.09), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11), and Safety of
Dams (OP 4.37).
   In 2010, a milestone study of safeguards at the World Bank conducted by
the Independent Evaluation Group, which evaluates the Bank’s development
effectiveness and reports directly to the Board of Executive Directors, ana-
lyzed the impact that EA and other safeguard policies had had on Bank oper-
ations, in particular by spelling out the expected benefits from an appropriate
and proportional application of these safeguards. In February 2011, the policy
was updated to clarify the use of framework instruments and to add the



30	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
strategic environmental and social assessment to the list of available instru-
ments. OP/BP 4.01 was revised again in April 2013 to reflect the recommen-
dations of the Investment Lending Reform, as a result of which OP/BP 10.00
on Investment Project Financing was adopted.



Policy Objectives
The goal of OP/BP 4.01 is to evaluate potential environmental impacts asso-
ciated with Bank lending operations and identify ways to prevent, minimize,
mitigate or compensate for these impacts. To that end, the policy defines EA
as the process of examining the potential environmental risks and benefits of
projects under consideration for Bank financing to ensure that they are envi-
ronmentally sound and sustainable, and that potentially affected people have
been properly consulted.
  Underlying that definition is the Bank’s acknowledgement of the impor-
tance of considering natural and social aspects of investments in an integrated
way during the decision-making process. The Bank also recognizes that the
earlier an EA is undertaken for a proposed project and findings are integrated
into project design, the better the overall project result, including the envi-
ronmental result. Therefore, EA is to be synchronized with the project cycle,
from identification to implementation and evaluation.



The EA Process in Relation to the Project Cycle
Environmental Screening
To decide the nature and extent of the EA to be carried out, the Bank under-
takes an environmental screening of each proposed project. Taking into
account the type, location, sensitivity, and scale of the proposed project, as
well as the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental and social
impacts, the Bank assigns one of four categories to the project. Category A
projects are those expected to have significant environmental impacts, and a
full EA is required. Category B projects are those with impacts that are
site-specific and in most cases reversible, and only a partial EA is required.
Category C projects have minimal or no anticipated adverse impacts, and no
EA or other environmental analysis is required. Projects with multiple com-
ponents are classified according to the component with the most significant
adverse impacts; if there is a Category A component, the full project is classi-
fied as A. A proposed project is classified as Category FI if it involves invest-
ment of Bank funds through a financial intermediary in sub-projects that
may result in adverse environmental impacts. An EA is also required for spe-
cial project types—including projects involving multiple sub-projects, finan-
cial intermediaries and guarantees—and generally for projects in situations of
urgent need of assistance and capacity constraints.

Preparing the EA Report
OP 4.01 provides that the borrower is responsible for carrying out the EA and
the Bank is responsible for advising the borrower on the Bank’s EA require-
ments. In order to identify more precisely the likely environmental impacts,
the borrower i) retains independent EA experts in the case of Category A
projects; and ii) consults project-affected groups and local NGOs for Category
A and B projects. The main purpose of these consultations is to focus the EA
on issues of concern at the local level.

EA Review and Project Appraisal
Once the draft EA report is complete, the borrower submits it to the Bank for
review. If found satisfactory, the Bank team is authorized to proceed to
appraisal of the project. On the appraisal mission, Bank staff review the EA’s
procedural and substantive elements with the borrower, resolve any outstand-
ing issues, assess the adequacy of the institutions responsible for environmen-
tal management in light of the EA’s findings, ensure that the mitigation plan is
adequately budgeted, and determine if the EA’s recommendations are prop-
erly addressed in project design and economic analysis.

Disclosure of Information
For meaningful consultations between the borrower and project-affected
groups and local NGOs on all Category A and B projects proposed for Bank
financing, the borrower provides relevant material in a timely manner prior
to consultation and in a form and language that are understandable and
accessible to the groups being consulted. In addition, the borrower makes
the EA report available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups
and local NGOs.

Institutional Capacity
When the borrower has inadequate legal or technical capacity to conduct key
EA-related functions (such as review of EA, environmental monitoring, or
management of mitigation measures) for a proposed project, the project
should include components to strengthen that capacity.

Project Implementation and Supervision
The borrower is responsible for implementing the project according to agree-
ments derived from the EA process. The borrower reports on i) compliance
with measures agreed with the Bank on the basis of the findings of the EA as
set out in the project documents; ii) the status of mitigation measures; and
iii) the findings of monitoring progress. The Bank supervises the implemen-
tation of the project’s environmental aspects, including measures set out in
the legal agreement and the Environmental Management Plan.

Instruments
OP 4.01 identifies a range of instruments that can be used to satisfy the Bank’s
EA requirement. The definition of such instruments is included in OP 4.01,
Annex A. The instruments most used at the Bank are defined below:
   Regional EA examines environmental issues and impacts associated with a
particular strategy, policy, plan, or program, or with a series of projects for a
particular region (e.g., an urban area, a watershed, or a coastal zone).
   Sectoral EA examines environmental issues and impacts associated with a
particular strategy, policy, plan, or program, or with a series of projects for a
particular sector (e.g., power, transport, or agriculture).
   Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment describes an analytical and
participatory approach that aims to integrate environmental and social con-
siderations into policies, plans, and programs and evaluates their linkages
with economic considerations.
   Environmental Impact Assessment identifies and assesses the potential envi-
ronmental impacts of a proposed project, evaluates alternatives, and designs
appropriate mitigation, management, and monitoring measures. Projects and
sub-projects need an EIA to address important issues not covered by any
applicable regional or sectoral EA.
   Environmental Management Plan details i) the measures to be taken during
the implementation and operation of a project to eliminate or offset adverse
environmental impacts, or to reduce them to acceptable levels; and ii) the
actions needed to implement these measures.
   Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is an instru-
ment that examines the impact of projects consisting in a program and/or
series of sub-projects. The ESMF contains measures and plans to reduce, mit-
igate, and/or offset adverse impacts and enhance positive impacts; provisions
for estimating and budgeting the costs of such measures; and information on
the agency or agencies responsible for addressing project impacts.



Looking Forward
In August 2016, the Bank approved the Environmental and Social Framework
to respond to new and varied development demands and challenges that have
arisen over time. The framework’s goals are to boost protections for people and
the environment, drive sustainable development through capacity- and insti-
tution-building and country ownership, and enhance efficiency for both the
borrower and the Bank.
  The ESF is not applicable yet. Hence, the Panel’s lessons are drawn solely
based on projects where OP/BP 4.01 and, in older cases, OD 4.01 were
applicable.

Summary of the Main Cases
Studied
Chad/Cameroon Petroleum and Pipeline Project
At the time of the Panel’s investigation, this project was the largest energy
infrastructure development on the African continent and involved drilling 300
oil wells in southern Chad and the construction of a 1,100-km export pipeline
through Cameroon to an offshore loading facility. The Request for Inspection
was submitted by a Chadian member of Parliament, on behalf of himself and
more than 100 residents, and cited concerns that their cultural property, the
environment, and the people of the oil field region would be harmed because
of inadequate environmental assessment and compensation. The Request also
alleged that proper consultation with disclosure of information to the local
communities had not taken place. When considering the Requesters’ claims
about flaws in the environmental assessment, the Panel’s investigation found
evidence of shortcomings in the alternatives analysis and collection of baseline
data. The lack of baseline data on community health meant the project had no
metrics against which to compare changes in community health, such as the
number of HIV cases and sexually transmitted diseases resulting from the
project. The EA also did not clearly identify mitigation measures to address
the increase in health problems resulting from or influenced by the project.
Furthermore, the Panel’s investigation noted the exceptional operational and
managerial demands in implementing the expansive EMP in a challenging
physical and political climate. However, the Panel found that the Bank did not
explicitly consider the spatio-temporal context of the project, including how
the boundary of the study area was defined, nor the potential area that could
be affected by the project. In its review of the EMP, the Panel could not find
evidence that a cumulative impact assessment had been completed despite the
fact that one of the project objectives of the ancillary Petroleum Sector Capacity
Management Project was to assist the government of Chad with environmen-
tally and socially sound resource development, including the need for cumu-
lative/regional/sectoral environmental assessments.



Argentina/Paraguay Yacyretá Hydroelectric
Project
The project is a joint venture between Argentina and Paraguay consisting of
two 40-meter-high, five-km-long concrete dams and 65 km of embankment
dam. Additional civil works financed by the project included a powerhouse
containing turbines, spillways, and a navigation lock. The project extended
more than two decades and involved several sources of Bank financing. In the

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                             35
Request for Inspection, the complainants claimed that the raising of the
Yacyretá power plant’s reservoir to 76 meters above sea level had severe envi-
ronmental impacts, such as constant flooding of urban creeks, a higher water
table, and the spreading of disease, which forced them to live in unbearable
conditions. They alleged that the wastewater treatment financed by the proj-
ect would further pollute the environment because of its location and defec-
tive environmental assessment. The Requesters brought forward additional
concerns regarding the resettlement, compensation and livelihood resto-
ration measures under the project. In its investigation, the Panel found that
the environmental screening for the current phase of the project was appro-
priate, but that the environmental assessments for the resettlement activities
were inadequate, covered few mitigation measures, and did not reflect con-
sultation with affected parties. The Panel also noted that the environmental
assessment did not consider the effects of population growth on Encarnación,
or the effects of the resettlement developments on the city’s infrastructure. It
bypassed consideration of the project’s implication on water supply, sewers,
urban drainage, and the impact of the resettlement sites on the overall urban
system. Furthermore, the Panel recorded that while a larger-than-average
number of supervision missions took place, including three high-level super-
vision meetings, these were not an adequate response to alleviate the percep-
tions and suspicions of project-affected people. The Panel noted concerns
about the long-term sustainability and that both the natural environment and
PAPs would suffer additional harm if the project’s environmental manage-
ment practices deteriorated.



Pakistan National Drainage Program Project
The project originally was aimed at implementing the first phase of the bor-
rower’s and four provinces’ 25-year NDP Framework Project through a com-
bination of infrastructure investment, institutional reform, research, and
sector planning. The project was designed to address the problems of water-
logging and salinity in the Indus Basin that were identified as principal threats
to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan. The project’s planned
investment actions were scaled back significantly during implementation, and
the infrastructure associated with the originally envisaged National Surface
Drainage System (NSDS) was not implemented. Instead, the project supported
the development of a new Drainage Master Plan that contained significant
new proposals and approaches for drainage and drainage management. The
Request was submitted by residents of the Indus River Basin and raised issues
related to the disposal of saline effluent and the proposed construction of the
NSDS under the original project design. The Requesters alleged that the design
of the NDP was faulty and unsustainable because it did not take into account
the social and environmental difficulties inherent in the existing disposal route
and that alternative routes were not explored. The Request included additional
claims regarding harm related to indigenous peoples, natural habitats, loss of
livelihood, involuntary resettlement, loss of cultural property, community

36	                         Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
participation, and information disclosure. The Panel’s investigation found
multiple shortcomings related to the project’s EA process. The Bank’s response
to the Request acknowledged that it would have been more appropriate to
assign the project a Category A rating, as opposed to the Category B rating it
had received during screening. This finding was confirmed during the Panel’s
investigation. Additional issues were found with the analysis of alternatives,
which appeared to be out of touch with the situation on the ground by under-
estimating the potential negative environmental impacts from the expansion
of infrastructure works. Furthermore, the Panel found that the project paid
little attention to impacts on, or means to rehabilitate, the dhands—a series of
wetlands and interconnected lakes that were the source of livelihood for 40
villages. Additional actions to conserve or rehabilitate these areas were also
not taken, which was inconsistent with Bank policy. When considering the
project’s monitoring and supervision systems, the Panel noted that the envi-
ronmental advisory panel composed of internationally recognized experts was
not in place at the beginning the project, resulting in the failure to identify
early on the shortcomings in project design. Although the EA had expressed
concern over the lack of a complete baseline study and of a continuing system-
atic, scientific, and well-coordinated monitoring program, the Panel found
that these remained critical issues that had not been addressed as recom-
mended. While the Panel praised the Bank for supporting the subsequent cre-
ation of a monitoring program, it found that its data interpretation and analysis
practices had not been successfully implemented.



Cambodia Forest Concessions Management and
Control Pilot Project
The project was a technical assistance operation aimed at demonstrating and
improving the effectiveness of a comprehensive set of forest management and
operational guidelines and control procedures in forest concession areas. It
also aimed to establish an effective forest-crime monitoring and prevention
capability. The Requesters, who depend on the forests for their livelihoods,
tapping resin and collecting forest products to sell, claimed among other
things that the project was supporting the interests of logging concessionaries
with track records of illegal logging and human rights abuses. A core concern
related to serious depletion caused by intensified logging of resin-producing
trees from which indigenous peoples and local communities derive a major
source of income. They also claimed that an environmental assessment ahead
of the project might have identified forests of high ecological value. The Panel’s
investigation found that the illegal logging of resin trees had had major nega-
tive consequences on the Requesters and the local people, and that the Bank’s
decision to postpone a consultation procedure until the preparation of the
ESIAs by concessionaires was not consistent with the early consultation
requirements under Bank policy. The Panel’s report stated that the Bank chose
to give primary emphasis in the project’s design to the technical and financial
aspects of concession reform, at the expense of environmental and social

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                             37
aspects, which subsequently led to inadequate levels of local involvement,
community consultations, and social and environmental assessments. This
resulted in a lost opportunity to lead the debate on forest-sector reform, so
that forests could be sustainably managed for all Cambodians. The Panel also
found that the Prey Long Forest, a relatively undisturbed forest with signifi-
cant spiritual and cultural value to indigenous peoples in the area, was not
explicitly identified as an area of potential high ecological value. The project
also did not adequately recognize the existence of natural habitats, which
caused their protection to be omitted from the concession planning and
approval process. Given its serious potential impacts, the Panel found that the
project should have been assigned a Category A, and prepared a full environ-
mental assessment. The Panel concluded that the studies required for a
Category A project could have helped avoid serious errors in the design and
implementation of the project.


DRC Transitional Support for Economic Recovery
Credit and Emergency Economic and Social
Reunification Support Project
These operations contained components designed to address the problem of
illegal logging and improve governance in the natural resources sector of the
DRC. The Requesters were concerned with the implementation of a new
commercial forest concession system and the preparation of a forest zoning
plan for the forests of the Equateur and Orientale Provinces, where the
Pygmies, a vulnerable indigenous group, have lived for generations. The for-
est also provides spiritual purpose and a foundation of the cultural identity
of the Pygmy people. They claimed that if the projects and these activities
were implemented without consulting the indigenous peoples and consider-
ing their interests, the projects may cause irreversible harm. In its investiga-
tion report, the Panel found that despite EESRSP’s involvement in the review
of logging concessions, an activity that carries significant environmental and
social implications, this project was assigned a Category B. Additionally, no
EA was prepared for the respective project component on logging conces-
sions. As a direct consequence of this misclassification, EESRSP lacked an
environmental and social assessment to address its impacts on land, forests,
and people. Furthermore, the Panel observed that financing of policy and
institutional reforms, such as the review of the logging concessions, can lead
to significant environmental and social impacts. The Panel also noted that
the 2002 moratorium on allocation of new forest concessions had been
“bypassed” and areas canceled in 2002 (estimated at 15 million hectares),
where vulnerable people including Pygmies live, re-emerged as concession
areas under consideration for validation. The Panel found that no timely fol-
low-up efforts at a sufficiently high level were made to ensure necessary
action in response to the moratorium violations, and also identified a num-
ber of significant concerns relating to the implementation of the “Concession
Conversion Process.” The Panel noted the importance of developing a

38	                         Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
balanced approach by emphasizing appropriate models of community for-
ests as well as their actions to support community participation, land tenure,
and forest-use rights.



Nigeria/Ghana West African Gas Pipeline Project
The WAGP aimed to improve the competitiveness of the energy sectors in
Ghana, Benin, and Togo by promoting use of less expensive, environmentally
cleaner gas from Nigeria. Most of the infrastructure works took place in
Nigeria. The pipeline’s right of way and ancillary facilities involved the acqui-
sition of 144 hectares traversing 23 communities in western Nigeria. The
Requesters were composed of both Nigerian and Ghanaian citizens and they
alleged that the project would cause irreparable damage to their land and
destroy the livelihoods of their communities. The Requesters asserted that the
project’s EA should have included the impacts to the existing Escravos-Lagos
Pipeline System (ELPS) to which the WAGP would be linked. They believed
this existing pipeline was unsafe because of its history of poor maintenance
and accidents. The fishermen among the Requesters believed the construc-
tion of the pipeline polluted the water and damaged their nets, preventing
them from catching fish and negatively impacting their livelihoods. Additional
concerns regarding disclosure of information, consultation, involuntary
resettlement, compensation, gas flaring, and the project’s economic evalua-
tion were also included in the complaint. The Requesters claimed that many
of these shortcomings stemmed from the Bank’s failure to adequately super-
vise the project.
   The Panel’s investigation into the project’s compliance on environmental
issues found flaws in the EA process and the supervision of subsequent miti-
gation measures. The Panel saw no evidence that an independent advisory
panel of internationally recognized environmental experts was constituted
during the planning and design phases of the project, despite its Category A
rating. Moreover, the establishment of such a panel during implementation
was also significantly delayed. Regarding the Requesters’ concerns about the
integrity of the ELPS, the Panel found that this gas supply upstream of WAGP
was within the project’s area of influence and that the project, its associated
facilities, and supply areas should be viewed as an inter-connected system for
the purposes of the EA. The expert employed by the Panel during its investi-
gation additionally concluded that linking the WAGP and ELPS had the over-
all effect of improving the safety of the existing Escravos-Lagos pipeline.
When investigating the Request’s claims regarding inadequate supervision,
the Panel found that despite the early warning signs that appeared during the
design phase, the project lacked necessary resources including funding and
safeguard expertise. Safeguard staff mainly concerned themselves with proj-
ect preparation activities and were far less involved in the construction phase.
This lack of involvement was further complicated by long gaps between
supervision missions, highlighting the difficulties of supervising from a dis-
tance without adequate field staff.

Uganda Private Power Generation Project
The project consisted of the construction of the Bujagali hydropower plant on
the Nile River near the Bujagali Falls. It was designed to provide an increase
of 250 megawatts of power-generation capacity to the national grid. The proj-
ect was going to inundate the Bujagali Falls and other natural habitats, which
were sites of cultural and religious significance to a large community of peo-
ple, and involved displacement and resettlement of people from their lands.
The Requesters claimed that the project Social and Environmental Assessment
(SEA) did not properly address hydrological changes and their effect on
power production, nor the potential impacts of climate change. They also
raised concerns about the economic impacts of the plant, including the
affordability of energy it produces, as well as issues of disclosure and consul-
tation, use of data, dam safety, and the cultural and spiritual significance of
the project area.
   In the context of the Bank’s Policy on Environmental Assessment, the Panel
examined a range of issues, including the impact of hydrologic risk on energy
output, the potential impact of the project on the levels of Lake Victoria, and
the risks from climate change. The Panel found areas of compliance, including
that the project had been appropriately classified as Category A and that the
Kalagala Falls had been established as an offset for the natural habitats to be
inundated by the project. However, there were several important areas of
non-compliance with Bank policies. The project did not appoint an indepen-
dent panel of environmental experts, as required under Bank policy for this
type of complex project, nor did it support needed capacity building for
implementation of social and environmental aspects of the project. The proj-
ect SEA did not adequately make reference to the Strategic/Sectoral Social
Environmental Assessment (SSEA) of the separate Nile Basin Initiative, which
analyzed issues such as climate change and cumulative effects. As a result,
important information required under Bank policy was not disclosed in a
timely manner as an integral part of the project’s documentation. In addition,
neither the SSEA nor the SEA addressed the cumulative effects of the existing
and planned projects in a meaningful way. And while the Kalagala Falls had
been established as an offset, in light of institutional weaknesses there is no
evidence that this offset site will be maintained in accordance with appropri-
ate conservation and mitigation measures in conformity with sound social
and environmental standards. The Panel also found that project preparation
activities did not adequately consider cultural and spiritual matters of high
significance at Bujagali Falls, and when comparing the Bujagali and Karuma
alternatives.



Albania Power Sector Generation Project
The project’s objective was “to achieve significant improvement in power sys-
tem performance” through, among other things, the construction of a com-
bined-cycle thermal power station in Vlora. The Panel conducted an

40	                         Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
investigation of the project in response to a Request for Inspection submitted
by the Civic Alliance for the Protection of the Bay of Vlora on behalf of resi-
dents living in Vlora. The Request raised a number of environmental, social,
cultural, and economic concerns related to the project as designed. It con-
tended that a failure of the Bank to follow its own operational policies and
procedures in the design and appraisal of the project would have resulted in
serious long-term risks and harm to the people living in the Vlora area and to
the environment. In particular, the Requesters expressed concern that air and
water emissions from the thermal power plant as well as the oil terminal
located in the Bay’s waters and its potential oil spills, would have negative
polluting impacts on the tourism industry in the Vlora area, the employment
of the local population, and the fishing industry. They also asserted that the
EA misrepresented the physical characteristics of the project site and noted
the proximity of the project site to the Narta Lagoon, which is a protected area
and a sanctuary to important animals and plants that might be significantly
harmed by the project. The Requesters complained that the Bank had failed to
take into account the future cumulative environmental impact of additional
generating units as well as the other industrial investments already approved
by the government in the vicinity of the project. In response to the Request,
the Panel assessed the issues related to the environmental compliance, includ-
ing the characterization of the project site, the adequacy of the project’s EA,
the applicability of the Bank Policy on Natural Habitats to the Narta Lagoon,
the project’s impact on air and water quality, and the potential cumulative
risks and impacts related to the project. The Panel concluded that a large array
of social issues and potential economic risks to the population in the area—
resulting from design, siting, and impacts—were not considered in the proj-
ect’s preparation and EA. In particular, since there was prima facie evidence
that more than one energy-related project was being undertaken in Vlora, the
Panel noted that the Bank should have insisted on a sectoral EA and the asso-
ciated cumulative effects analysis in addition to the project-specific EA. The
Panel also found that PAPs and local NGOs had not been meaningfully con-
sulted throughout project preparation and implementation on environmen-
tal, social, cultural, tourism and health issues that affected them.



Argentina Santa Fe Road Infrastructure Project
and Provincial Road Infrastructure Project
The project aimed at improving transport conditions, including road safety, of
a segment of National Route 19 between the province of Santa Fe (PSF) and
the province of Cordoba, along a strategic road corridor linking the PSF with
regional and international markets. The Panel’s investigation occurred during
the construction phase. The Requesters claimed that the elevated carriageway
to be constructed as a part of the new four-lane highway was incompatible
with the area’s hydrological situation because the land is flat and has insuffi-
cient absorption and retention of rainwater. They believed that water drainage
in the project’s design was insufficient and would increase the risk of flooding.

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                            41
They also claimed that information disclosure and consultation of project-af-
fected people were inadequate, and alleged discrimination and intimidation
during the project’s land-acquisition process. The Panel’s investigation noted
that the road-upgrading project took place within a complex and highly
dynamic local rural development context in which agricultural and livestock
production issues are closely intertwined with water and environmental man-
agement concerns. The Panel found that the project’s ESMP had an important
shortcoming in that it did not include a proper analysis of the potential hydro-
logical impacts both upstream and downstream of Road 19, particularly
changes in area that would be flooded downstream under very different rain-
fall scenarios. Although the ESMP concluded that the road would not worsen
existing flood conditions, information to back up this conclusion was not
provided. Regarding consultation with affected people, the Panel found that
the Requesters were given the opportunity to meet project officials to express
their concerns and to make suggestions for project design modifications, and
that, in general, many of these concerns were responded to and acted on.
Nevertheless, the Requesters’ concerns about the negative impacts of the road
on the hydrology of the area were mostly dismissed as PAPs were seen as
non-experts in this field. The consultation issues for the project were also
affected by the delay in hiring a communications expert, which was discussed
on a number of occasions during project implementation.



Peru Lima Urban Transport Project
The objective of this project was to assist in enhancing economic produc-
tivity and the quality of life by improving mobility and accessibility for its
population through the establishment of an efficient, reliable, and safer
mass transit system. Specifically, the project supported the construction of
a bus rapid-transit system (BRT) through the city of Lima, including a bus
corridor in the coastal district of Barranco, which was designated a historic
district by the National Institute of Culture in 1972. Through much of its
route, the bus corridor ran through the middle of a major highway. However,
in Barranco the bus corridor ran through Avenida Bolognesi, a former
four-lane avenue that connects Barranco with the center of Lima. The
implementation of this project made critical contributions to addressing
the high traffic volume and long commuting times existing throughout the
city. In their complaint, the Requesters alleged that citizen consultations
were not carried out, and that the EA was neither rigorously conducted nor
approved by the Ministry of Transportation. They also expressed concerns
about the direct and indirect impacts of the project on the lifestyle of
Barranco residents, the area’s socio-cultural dynamics, and its architectural
patrimony as longer-term adverse impacts that would remain after the BRT
became operational. During its investigation, the Panel found evidence of
the Requesters’ claims regarding the limited assessment of impacts on the
community beyond the immediate impacts of construction and operation
of the transit system. Notably, the impacts on traffic patterns and the

42	                         Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
socio-cultural dynamics of the historical Barranco neighborhood were not
adequately considered during the environmental assessment. Furthermore,
the project generated tension and conflict by omitting the residents of
Barranco from initial project consultations. For multiple years during proj-
ect implementation, the project team did not benefit from the consistent
presence of a social expert, which caused the project-affected people to be
inadequately informed and consulted on the project and its potential
impacts. The project began to address these issues by creating an active,
steady role for the social specialist on the project team. These supervision
efforts led to the creation of a dialogue roundtable and the opening of a
grievance office for Barranco residents.



South Africa Eskom Investment Support Project
The project’s objective was to support South Africa in enhancing its power
supply and energy security in a sustainable and efficient manner for both its
economic growth objectives and long-term carbon mitigation strategy. The
project included the 4,800-MW Medupi coal-fired power plant at Lephalale
and associated infrastructure and investments. It also contained a compo-
nent for the development of renewable energy generation sources, the
Majuba Rail Project, and energy efficiency sector investments and technical
assistance. The Request was submitted by two NGOs on behalf of commu-
nity members located near Lephalale who had concerns about direct
impacts of the project and its associated facilities, as well as its broader
social impacts. They alleged harm related to increased health problems,
decreased water availability, exacerbation of the effects of climate change,
and cultural and livelihoods changes.
  This was the Panel’s first investigation into a project under the Bank’s Policy
on Piloting the Use of Borrower/Country Systems, which relies on the coun-
try’s and borrower’s legal and institutional frameworks. As a result, the Panel
analyzed compliance at two levels—the “system level,” which relates to man-
agement’s assessments of the “equivalence” and “acceptability” under coun-
try’s applicable Bank policy and the borrower’s environmental and social
safeguard systems; and the “project level,” relating to management’s compli-
ance with relevant provisions of applicable Bank operational policies. At the
project level, the Panel found that insufficient attention was given in project
documents to the potential impacts that the use of water by the Medupi plant
might have on other users, particularly considering the area already suffered
from water scarcity strains. These shortcomings on water resources included
the improper assessment of the cumulative impacts of the water requirements
for operation of Grootegeluk Mine, which supplies Medupi with coal. The
Panel noted that Bank management’s focus related to water resources appeared
to be on ensuring that Medupi had a reliable water supply, and that this was
not based on a risk-averse approach, as required by both Bank policy and
South Africa’s national environmental management principles. The Panel’s
investigation also considered the project’s relationship to climate change more

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                            43
broadly through its contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions. When
examining whether the project’s environmental assessment adequately
addressed measures to control and mitigate GHG emissions in line with Bank
policy, the Panel found that steps had been taken to adhere to this policy
framework but that the magnitude of emissions from Medupi far outweighed
emissions avoided through project-mitigation measures. In addition, the
Panel found that the description of the net results of the project’s mitigation
efforts failed to adequately demonstrate that the project was directly address-
ing its own externalities.



Tajikistan Energy Loss Reduction Project
The project financed assessment studies and technical assistance to examine
the technical, economic, environmental, and social viability of the Rogun
Hydropower Plant in Tajikistan. The objectives were to assist in the reduction
of commercial losses in the electricity and gas systems, to lay the foundation
for the improvement of the financial viability of Tajikistan’s electricity and gas
utilities in a socially responsible manner, and assist in the viability assessment
of the Rogun HPP. The Requesters stated that they were likely to suffer harm
because of flaws in the consultation process and the ecological impacts of the
proposed project’s location. Because Rogun would be constructed on a fault
line where seismic activities were possible, they feared that a failure of the dam
could create waves that could destroy downstream power systems and over
700 settlements in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. In
its eligibility report, the Panel noted that projects on international waterways
may affect relations between the Bank and its borrowers, and in this context
the Bank had made efforts to ensure that potential riparian issues were exam-
ined in the context of these studies. The Panel also noted that the Bank had
gone beyond the requirements of the Environmental Assessment Policy by
financing a panel of experts, which is typically done by the beneficiary or bor-
rowing country. In light of management’s actions and the purpose of the study
to ensure that a fact-based decision was taken on this complex and sensitive
project, the Panel did not recommend an investigation in this case.



India Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project
The Panel received a complaint concerning this project, which was being con-
structed on the Alaknanda River, a tributary of the Ganges in Northern India.
Through the construction of the run-of-the-river hydropower generation sys-
tems, the project aimed to increase the supply of electricity to the national
grid and strengthen the institutional capacity of the borrower to prepare and
implement such projects. In their complaint to the Panel, the Requesters
stated that they did not want the river to be diverted or controlled in any way
since they believe that the free flow of the Alaknanda River holds immense
spiritual and aesthetic value for them, which, in their view, had not been

44	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
estimated by the project authorities. Additionally, the complaint expressed
concerns about the impacts of the project on local water sources and water
quality, loss of biodiversity and other environmental harm, impact on liveli-
hoods and health, economic issues, and gender issues. The Panel found that
the project had conducted a solid cumulative impact assessment that incor-
porated the recommended increased minimum environmental flow (e-flow),
which is a measure to describe the quantity, timing, and quality of water flows
below a dam necessary to sustain river ecosystems and the human livelihoods
that depend on them. By increasing the minimum e-flow for the Alaknanda
River, the project was able to mitigate cultural, religious, and biodiversity
impacts. Despite the thorough cumulative impact assessment, the Panel’s
investigation also found that EA did not include adequate consideration of
the project’s associated facilities. In addition to the construction of multiple
dams, the proposed project included the installation of a 30-km line to evac-
uate power from the project. Neither this line nor the larger transmission
network were considered as associated activities under the project’s EA. This
exclusion caused potential impacts such as the loss of farm land and forest
resources from transmission-line construction to be omitted from the EA.
The project also involved significant social risks, including gender issues. The
Panel’s investigation found evidence that the project lacked attention to the
issue of women’s security as a result of labor influx into the project area.
Consequently, the project caused conflict between the laborers and local vil-
lagers that was not appropriately addressed through mitigation measures.



Ethiopia Promoting Basic Services Phase III Project
The objective of the project was to contribute to the higher-level objective of
expanding access and improving the quality of basic services by funding
block grants that ensure adequate staffing and operations, and by strengthen-
ing the capacity, transparency, accountability, and financial management of
governments at the regional and local authority levels. The Requesters stated
that the Anuak Indigenous Peoples had been harmed, claiming that the Bank
project contributed directly to the government’s villagization program in the
Gambella Region, which, according to the Request, forced the Anuak people
to leave their ancestral lands under the pretext of providing better services
and improving the livelihoods of communities. In its investigation of the PBS
Phase III project, the Panel observed that the project’s PAD noted that safe-
guards were not triggered as project financing was limited to recurrent expen-
ditures for basic services. Previously, PBS I and II had triggered the Policy on
Environmental Assessment because of small infrastructure works through a
pilot Local Investment Grant, a specific-purpose grant for capital investments
at the district level. Regarding PBS III, the Panel found that the project should
have applied safeguard policies to the extent that one or more of them are
found to be relevant to the area of the proposed investment lending opera-
tion. Additionally, the Panel found during its investigation that the Bank did
not fully assess and mitigate the risks arising from the government’s

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                            45
implementation of villagization, but also noted the difficult context in which
PBS III was prepared and the importance of implementing a robust system of
delivery that meets accepted environmental and social safeguard principles.



Nepal Power Development Project
The project objective was to develop Nepal’s hydropower potential to help
meet electricity demand, improve access to electricity services in rural areas
and promote private participation in the power sector. The Request stated that
this project was designed without informing or consulting with local commu-
nities and that it would likely result in involuntary displacement and damage
to cultural property. The Requesters also alleged that the project works would
make them more vulnerable by harming agriculture production and physi-
cally dividing communities. The Panel investigation identified several issues
in the project contributing to the Requesters’ concerns. When assessing alter-
native routes for a disputed 3.85-km section of the transmission line, the tech-
nical committee conducted limited and restrictive assessment of alternatives.
More broadly, the Panel found that although the project’s policy framework
highlighted in adequate detail the studies that were needed to assess environ-
mental and social impacts of the sub-projects, it did not discuss whether the
capacity existing at the implementing agency was sufficient to undertake the
studies or implement their recommendations. As a result of not considering
the borrower’s capacity in the EA or other project documents, little was done
to strengthen the capacity of the implementing agency, thus contributing to
the problems the project faced during implementation. Issues faced by the
project team during preparation and implementation were further compli-
cated by a lack of adequate, timely, and meaningful consultations during this
period, in part due to the security situation and travel restrictions placed on
Bank staff. In its response to the Request, the Bank acknowledged that the
safeguard policies governing information disclosure had not been fully
observed and said the situation was being rectified.


Uzbekistan Second Rural Enterprise Support
Project
The Panel received a Request for Inspection of the project and its additional
financing from three human rights organizations. The project’s goals were to
increase the productivity, financial, and environmental sustainability of agri-
culture, and the profitability of agribusinesses in the project area through the
provision of financial and capacity-building support to farmers and agribusi-
nesses. The central claim of the Requesters was that due to lack of adequate
measures to prevent Bank funding from being used for agricultural lands in
which forced and child labor is practiced, the project contributed to “the gov-
ernment’s policy of organized forced and child labor.” The Requesters further
stated that the social assessment carried out for the project failed to adequately

46	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
identify the problem of forced and child labor, adding that no serious consid-
eration or analysis was undertaken to assess if and how the project would
contribute to this problem. The Panel noted that a plausible link existed
between the project and the alleged harm. The Panel also noted that the claims
in the Request raised significant issues of policy compliance, including, among
others, in relation to environmental assessment, which requires the assess-
ment of potential significant social impacts and risks associated with a project
and inclusion of actions to avoid or mitigate such risks. The Panel observed
that in the early years of the project there may have been insufficient due dil-
igence in addressing the concerns about harm and related issues of Bank pol-
icy compliance raised in the Request, including at the time of project approval.
The Panel, however, recognized and appreciated i) management’s commit-
ment to include labor issues in the Bank’s dialogue with the government of
Uzbekistan on agricultural sector reforms; ii) the Bank’s increased dialogue
with the government and its development partners on the eradication of child
and forced labor in the country’s cotton sector; and iii) management’s com-
mitment to report to the Board of Executive Directors on these matters. On
that basis, the Panel did not recommend an investigation.



Uganda Transport Sector Development Project
The project’s additional financing supported upgrading and rehabilitation of
the 66-km Kamwenge-Fort Portal road and technical assistance for strength-
ening the internal audit functions of the Uganda National Roads Authority.
The Requesters, community members from the towns along the road, alleged
adverse impacts from the road construction, including sex with minors and
teenage pregnancy by road workers, the spread of STIs, sexual harassment of
female employees, child labor, inadequate compensation, lack of participa-
tion, poor labor practices, and lack of adequate road and workplace health
and safety measures.
   In its investigation, the Panel found that an adequate assessment of UNRA’s
capacity regarding environmental and social aspects was not conducted and
there was a lack of effective institutional strengthening measures for UNRA’s
weak capacity. The Panel also detected poor project governance, including ten-
sion and lack of collaboration among UNRA, the supervising engineer, and
the contractor. The Panel also found that poor safety measures had led to more
than 25 occupational or road accidents, resulting in at least seven fatalities and
many permanent injuries. The Bank had not ensured the design or implemen-
tation of appropriate mitigation measures to protect the community and
workers against construction impacts, thus seriously jeopardizing human
health and safety. The Panel also determined that the EA lacked the required
analysis of the risks to women and children caused by labor influx, in particu-
lar the impacts related to sex with minors, teenage pregnancy, sexual harass-
ment, child labor, and school dropout. In addition, the mitigation measures
proposed in the EA mainly focused on HIV/AIDS prevention and were inad-
equate to respond to the multi-dimensional problems of gender-based

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                             47
violence and the need for child protection. These shortcomings in the project’s
mitigation measures resulted in serious and long-lasting harm to the commu-
nity. The Panel found that the contractor submitted a draft ESMP to the super-
vising engineer nearly one year after construction had started, and the Bank
only received it after two years. The Panel also found that even when impacts
were predicted in the environmental and social assessment, there were no cor-
responding mitigation measures in the ESMP to address these impacts. For
example, the ESIA had identified some potential adverse social impacts from
the expected influx of labor into the project area during implementation and
required that a strict no-fraternization rule be applied between the workers’
camp and the surrounding community. Despite these observations in the
ESIA, the ESMP did not state whether the camp should accommodate only
foreign workers or also house Ugandan workers. As a result of the Panel’s
investigation, the Bank issued a guidance note to staff on how to manage labor
influx risks in World Bank projects and created a Gender-Based Violence Task
Force with experts in this field to develop recommendations on how to pre-
vent and respond to GBV in Bank projects.

Summary of the Discussion
at the Release of Emerging
Lessons Series No. 3:
Environmental Assessment
The Inspection Panel released “Emerging Lessons Series No. 3: Environmental
Assessment” on April 18, 2017, during the Spring Meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group.
  Otaviano Canuto, an Executive Director on the Board of the World Bank
Group and Chairman of the Committee on Development Effectiveness, mod-
erated a panel discussion about the report at the event. The panel included
Inspection Panel Member Zeinab Elbakri; Julia Bucknall, Director for
Environment and Natural Resources at the World Bank; Medha Patkar,
founder of Narmada Bachao Andolan and the National Alliance of People’
Movements in India; and Richard Fuggle, Emeritus Professor of Environmental
Studies at the University of Cape Town, who has served as an expert consul-
tant on several Panel investigations.
  Mr. Canuto opened the event by providing introductory remarks on the
publication and stated the Emerging Lesson Series is an example of the
important role the Inspection Panel plays in institutional learning at the
World Bank.
  Ms. Elbakri’s presentation followed these remarks and summarized the les-
sons and conclusions of the report, and provided examples from Panel cases
to bolster the report’s findings.
  Ms. Bucknall continued the panel discussion and said the World Bank rec-
ognizes environmental assessment is an issue that “runs throughout every-
thing that we do.” She said, “It’s not an issue of ticking boxes and then being
done. It’s a management issue that goes throughout the project cycle.”
  Ms. Bucknall also stated building borrower capacity within a country’s
environment ministry—and the supporting agency’s units—is critical, and
that the Bank has learned to be on guard for the “hidden risks” of a project.
  “When we’re financing a dam, we know that’s a big risk. We put our best
people and we put lots of attention on to it,” she said. “But there are ones
where we think there is not going to be a big risk, and there can be just as
many problems that come from those. I think that’s a lesson that we have
taken and we’re paying serious attention to.”
  She said the findings in Panel investigations and the Emerging Lessons
Series reports are extremely important, adding: “It really has helped us a lot
and I think our systems are a lot better because of it now.”
  During the panel discussion Ms. Patkar commented on the sequencing of
screening and scoping activities done in project preparation.

Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment	                          49
   “How can one decide the (environmental risk) category—A, B or C—with-
out really drawing the full scope of impacts and also the feasibility of solu-
tions at least at the primary level?” she asked.
   Speaking of the community consultation process, she asked it is necessary
to “democratize the development planning process, which only would lead to
a serious consideration of environmental and social impacts, and take up
‘options assessment’ so as to choose the appropriate technology and even
reject the wrong destructive projects.”
   Mr. Fuggle rounded out the panel’s comments by stressing the importance
of the “continuous, proactive, field-based” supervision of projects.
   “It is very important for the Bank staff, the implementing agencies and the
supervising engineers to get out of their offices, away from their computer
screens and get their boots muddy to supervise their projects effectively to
come to grips with what is happening on the ground,” he said.
   Like Ms. Bucknall, Mr. Fuggle emphasized the importance of capacity—
both the capacity of the teams that conduct the environmental assessment as
well as the capacity the borrower and the Bank teams throughout project
implementation.
   He said the capacity of Bank teams was “much improved,” adding, “Certainly,
over the nearly 20 years I’ve been working with the Panel, there is a very differ-
ent approach now from task team leaders towards environmental matters.”
   The opening comments from the panel were followed by questions and
comments from the audience, and then Mr. Canuto provided his closing
thoughts to wrap up the 90-minute session.
   Picking up on the issue of capacity-building, he said that the World Bank
can no longer focus on specific projects but rather needs to “work with capac-
ity-building in the countries so they can manage lines of projects.”
   Mr. Canuto applauded the lessons the World Bank has learned and the
adaptations it has made regarding environmental assessment, but he stressed
nothing can replace “passion, commitment and purpose” in helping the Bank
meet the environmental and social challenges posed by projects.

50	                          Emerging Lessons Series: Environmental Assessment
Notes
	1.	The Inspection Panel serves as an independent forum to provide accountability
      and recourse for people affected by IBRD- and IDA-financed projects. They can
      bring their concerns to the Panel in the form of a written complaint. A complaint
      is referred to as a “Request for Inspection” and those who submit a Request are
      referred to as “Requesters.” When it carries out an investigation, the Panel reports
      to the Board on whether the harm, as alleged by the Requesters, has totally or par-
      tially resulted from failure of the Bank to comply with its policies and procedures,
      including social and environmental safeguard policies, during design, appraisal,
      and implementation of Bank-financed projects.
	2.	While all of these cases were studied for the purposes of this report, emphasis
      was placed on the lessons from cases occurring within the past 10 years. This
      report also includes two relevant eligibility reports that include important issues
      and illustrate the breadth of the Panel’s casework. Screening and scoping, assess-
      ment of social and natural impacts, borrower capacity, supervision, and impact
      monitoring and project sustainability were the key themes in these investigations.
	 3.	 This definition of environmental impact assessment is adopted by the International
      Association of Impact Assessment (IAIA). Available at: http://www.iaia.org/
      uploads/pdf/What_is_IA_web.pdf
	4.	Even though the Panel did not conduct a compliance review in these two cases,
      the dialogue between Bank management and the Panel provided important les-
      sons that are noteworthy for this publication.
	5.	As per OP/BP 4.01, projects with potential significant and irreversible adverse
      impacts are assigned an Environmental Category A, while projects with less
      adverse and site-specific impacts are categorized as B, and those with minimal or
      no impact are categorized as C. A proposed project is classified as Category FI if it
      involves investment of Bank funds through a financial intermediary in sub-proj-
      ects that may result in adverse environmental impacts.
	6.	The name “Pygmy” derives from a Greek word meaning the measure of length
      from elbow to the fist, and is used to refer to people of short stature, encompass-
      ing different indigenous peoples groups such as the Baka, Bakola, Effe, Aka, and
      others. Because of its pejorative connotation, both anthropologists and the indig-
      enous themselves avoided the term. However, it has recently been used again by
      indigenous peoples, particularly in the context of establishing their identity.
