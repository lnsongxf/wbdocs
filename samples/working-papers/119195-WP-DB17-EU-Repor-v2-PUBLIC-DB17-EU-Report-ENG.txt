Overview

MAIN FINDINGS

 Business regulations and their implementation vary
   substantially both among and within Bulgaria, Hungary
   and Romania—with the biggest differences in Bulgaria
   and Romania.

 No city excels in all five areas measured; among the
   22 cities benchmarked, each ranks in the top half on at
   least one indicator set and in the bottom half on at least
   one other.

 Each country has cities that outperform the European
   Union average in at least one area: Varna and Pleven
   in Bulgaria in starting a business, Pecs and Szeged
   in Hungary in dealing with construction permits, all
   Hungarian cities and Oradea in Romania in registering
   property, and most cities in enforcing contracts. But no
   city is close to the EU average in getting electricity.

 Budapest and Sofia both lag behind most of the smaller
   cities in their countries. Yet Bucharest ranks in the top
   half among Romanian cities in most areas measured,
   demonstrating the potential for dealing efficiently with
   high demand for business services.

 Reform-minded officials can make tangible
   improvements by replicating good practices in other
   cities in their country. Bulgarian cities could make
   starting a business easier by adopting the good
   practices in Varna. Hungarian cities could improve
   in getting electricity by emulating the good practices
   of Szeged and Szekesfehervar. And Romanian cities
   could look to Timisoara’s example to improve contract
   enforcement.

 Note: The distance to frontier (DTF) score shows how far a location is from the best performance achieved by any economy on each Doing Business indicator. The score is
 normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better). For more details, see the chapter “About Doing
 Business and Doing Business in the European Union 2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.” The data for Bucharest, Budapest and Sofia have been revised since the publication
 of Doing Business 2017. The complete data set can be found on the Doing Business website at http://www.doingbusiness.org.

     Note: For the actual distance to frontier (DTF) score, each country is represented by its capital city (which is also its largest business city). The hypothetical DTF score is based on
     the best performances recorded among the benchmarked cities within a country. The DTF score shows how far on average a location is from the best performance achieved by any
     economy on each Doing Business indicator. The score is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the better).

Starting a Business

MAIN FINDINGS

 Budapest lags behind other cities in Hungary on the
   ease of starting a business, and Sofia lags behind in
   Bulgaria. But in Romania, Bucharest shares the lead with
   Oradea, Ploiesti and Timisoara.

 Variations in performance within Hungary are marginal
   and stem mainly from differences in lawyer fees.
   In Bulgaria and Romania, however, differences are
   substantial.

 If represented by Varna rather than Sofia in the Doing
   Business global ranking on the ease of starting a
   business, Bulgaria would jump 25 places, from 82 to 57.
   Varna is not only the Bulgarian champion; along with
   Pleven, it also outperforms the European Union average
   on the efficiency of the start-up process—the only ones
   among the 22 benchmarked cities to do so.

 Starting a business in Romania can take anywhere from
   12 days in Bucharest, Oradea, Ploiesti and Timisoara
   to 25 days in Craiova. The gap is due to differences in
   efficiency among regional branches of the national tax
   authority in issuing the value added tax identification
   number.

 All three countries have implemented electronic filing
   for company registration. But take-up of the online
   option remains limited in Romania, ranging from less
   than 1% in most cities to 24% in Constanta.

                                                                                                                          registration (EUR 28 rather than
       EUR 56). Another possible factor is that clerks at the local commercial registry do not provide guidance on applications. Instead,
       these are simply scanned and uploaded to the system and then assigned for review and processing to any registry officer in the
       country who happens to be available.

       The certificate of incorporation is issued in hard copy or certified electronic copy. In practice, however, Bulgarian companies are
       rarely required to provide a copy in dealings with institutions of public interest such as courts, banks, notary offices, and state
       and municipal authorities. The law obliges these institutions to make their own checks of the legal status of companies that
       provide their unique identification code; officials requesting additional paperwork can be subject to fines.

       Today almost three-quarters of new limited liability companies in Bulgaria are registered online. Among the benchmarked cities,
       take-up is highest in Sofia, Plovdiv and Burgas. In Ruse just over half of new limited liability companies use electronic filing. In Pleven
       the majority still use paper-based registration; while costlier, this is just as fast and easy, because the statutory limit of two days
       applies regardless of the registration method. One factor slowing take-up in Bulgaria is the still limited use of electronic signatures.

       In Romania, where online registration has been available since 2012, it saves entrepreneurs neither time nor cost. Moreover, even
       though the application can be done online, the certificate of incorporation is issued only in hard copy and needs to be picked
       up in person from the commercial registry. While public institutions can check a company’s status on the commercial registry’s
       website, they are not obliged to do so by law and therefore usually require the company to provide the relevant documents in
       hard copy.

   BOX 3.1 Three markedly different approaches to going digital in company registration in Bulgaria, Hungary and
   Romania (continued)
   On average, fewer than 10% of new limited liability companies in Romania use the online registration platform. Take-up ranges
   from less than 1% in most cities to 24% in Constanta, where the local chamber of commerce actively provides assistance to local
   entrepreneurs. In Bucharest only 6.5% of limited liability companies incorporated between January 2015 and June 2016 were
   registered online. Most applicants lack electronic signatures.

   But the number of online applications is expected to pick up with the introduction of mandatory online tax filing for companies,b
   which will make electronic signatures increasingly common. Moreover, the recent introduction of express counters at registry
   offices across Romania—where applications are registered but not checked for accuracy—might lead to fewer in-person applica-
   tions, since counter assistance will no longer be available.

   b. While the National Agency of Tax Administration has announced an intention to make online filing mandatory for companies, no formal requirements
   have been published yet.

        BOX 3.2 Is VAT registration set to become easier in Bulgaria and Romania?
        In Bulgaria and Romania corporate tax registration takes place simultaneously with company registration at the commercial
        registry. But VAT registration, undertaken voluntarily by many companies at start-up, remains a separate procedure.a

        Registering for VAT requires that company founders provide considerable information (such as tax records, proof of income,
        diplomas and summaries of experience, criminal records, and evidence of the adequacy of registered premises for commercial
        activity). This is evaluated by the tax authority to determine whether the applicant meets the criteria for VAT registration. The
        measures are meant to prevent tax fraud by ensuring that a company’s founders have no history that might raise questions about
        its risk. The process can be a long one even for companies deemed to be low risk (see figure), and the outcome is not guaranteed.

                                                                                                             Still, both countries have taken recent

        that previously had to be attached to the application. But this change did not reduce the time for registration. Instead, it shifted
        the burden to tax officers, who now have to verify the details in the application by searching different databases, such as those
        of the commercial registry, the cadastre agency and the insolvency bulletin. Most recently, ANAF Ordinance 210/2017 (in force
        since February 1, 2017) eliminated Form 088 altogether. In addition, tax officers may no longer reject an application without first
        allowing the taxpayer 45 days to dispute the decision. It remains too early to assess the impact, if any, of these recent changes
        on the ease of VAT registration across cities in Romania.

Dealing with Construction
Permits

MAIN FINDINGS

 Among the three countries, completing the construction
   permitting process for a simple warehouse is easiest in
   Hungary, where it takes 18 procedures and 164 days and
   costs 0.5% of the warehouse value on average. But the
   process is fastest in Bulgaria, where it takes 141 days on
   average.

 Construction permitting is considerably more
   burdensome in all three countries than in most other
   member states of the European Union. This is largely
   because of the number of approvals builders are
   required to obtain before applying for a building permit.

 In Bulgaria construction permitting is easiest and fastest
   in Sofia, where it takes 97 days. In Hungary the process
   is easiest and least time-consuming in Pecs, where it
   requires 17 procedures and about five months. And in
   Romania the process is easiest in Craiova, though it is
   neither fastest nor least costly there.

 Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania all perform well on the
   building quality control index, scoring 13 of 15 possible
   points and surpassing the EU average of 11.4 points.

 Among the main constraints to greater efficiency in the
   permitting process, particularly in Bulgaria and Romania,
   are lack of transparency around the requirements, lack
   of streamlined processes for preapprovals and weak
   electronic platforms.

     WHAT DOES DEALING WITH CONSTRUCTION PERMITS MEASURE?
     To measure the ease of dealing with construction permits, Doing Business records the procedures, time and cost required for
     a small or medium-size business to obtain the approvals needed to build a commercial warehouse and connect it to water
     and sewerage. This includes all inspections and certiﬁcates needed before, during and after construction of the warehouse.
     To make the data comparable across locations, it is assumed that the warehouse is in the periurban area of the analyzed busi-
     ness city, that it is not in a special economic or industrial zone and that it will be used for the general storage of nonhazardous
     materials such as books. In addition, Doing Business compiles a building quality control index that measures the underlying
     quality of construction regulations and controls. The index accounts for one-fourth of the distance to frontier score for dealing
     with construction permits (see figure).

 Note: Rankings are based on the average distance to frontier score for the procedures, time and cost associated with dealing with construction permits as well as for the
 building quality control index. The distance to frontier score is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the
 better). For more details, see the chapter “About Doing Business and Doing Business in the European Union 2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.” The data for Bucharest,
 Budapest and Sofia have been revised since the publication of Doing Business 2017. The complete data set can be found on the Doing Business website at

        BOX 4.1 High standards for transparency and construction supervision in Austria
        In Vienna and Lower Austria information and communication technology solutions have increased the transparency of land
        planning information. Authorities have put official land plans into an interactive GIS-based format and made them publicly avail-
        able online. The online system integrates information on building specifications as well as details on the location, capacity and
        availability of utility connections. This enables builders and developers to find online all the information they need for building
        permit applications. It also eliminates the need for a number of preapprovals.

        Austria has also rationalized its building inspection system while setting high standards for quality control. Legislation adopted
        in 1990 introduced a risk-based approach to inspections, replacing a regulatory system that required a building permit for
        almost any work. Different classes of buildings and construction work were introduced, with administrative procedures and
        safeguards adapted to each class according to its level of risk: class 1 projects require only a construction notice, class 2 projects
        require a simplified building permit procedure, and class 3 projects undergo a formal building permit procedure with full third-
        party review of all critical elements of construction.

        The Austrian building quality control system gives substantial responsibility to private (and highly qualified) professionals and,
        for more complex projects, requires that these professionals be third-party actors. Buildings in Austria typically must be de-
        signed by a professional designer or architect and constructed by a master builder. For large-scale or more complex projects,
        project developers are required to appoint a third-party Prüfingenieur—a highly qualified professional civil engineer who is
        legally certified and registered—to inspect important elements of construction during the project. To ensure high professional
        standards and compliance, Austria has introduced strict professional qualification requirements for the regulated professional
        groups involved in the construction industry.

Getting Electricity

MAIN FINDINGS

 Among the three countries, getting electricity is easiest
   and least costly in Hungary, where it requires five
   procedures and costs 93.9% of income per capita.
   But it is fastest in Romania, where it takes 195 days on
   average. Varna has the fastest process in Bulgaria (200
   days), Szekesfehervar the fastest one in Hungary (227
   days) and Iasi the fastest one in Romania (173 days).

 Getting electricity takes much longer in all three
   countries than in any other member state of the
   European Union. This is largely because of the multiple
   clearances required before the construction of the
   connection starts and the inspections needed after it is
   completed.

 On average, the cities benchmarked in Hungary receive
   7 of 8 possible points on the reliability of supply and
   transparency of tariffs index, those in Romania 6.7
   points and those in Bulgaria 5.7. Among the 22 cities
   benchmarked, only Szeged (Hungary) obtains the
   maximum score. All others can improve the reliability
   of electricity supply by reducing the number of outages,
   their duration or both.

 Going forward, the connection process could be made
   more efficient by streamlining preconnection approvals,
   reducing the number of approvals and inspections
   required and better communicating the process and
   requirements to customers.

 Note: Rankings are based on the average distance to frontier score for the procedures, time and cost associated with getting electricity as well as for the reliability of supply and
 transparency of tariffs index. The distance to frontier score is normalized to range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the frontier of best practices (the higher the score, the
 better). Budapest and Gyor have the same score despite the difference in the time recorded for the two cities because in both cases the time exceeds the worst performance,
 defined as the 95th percentile among all economies in the Doing Business sample (248 days). For more details, see the chapter “About Doing Business and Doing Business in
 the European Union 2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.” The data for Bucharest, Budapest and Sofia have been revised since the publication of Doing Business 2017. The

Registering Property

MAIN FINDINGS

 Among the three countries, registering property is
   easiest in Hungary, where it requires four procedures,
   takes 12.5 days on average and costs 5% of the property
   value. But the process is less expensive in Bulgaria, at an
   average of 3% of the property value—and in Romania,
   at 1.4%.

 Compared with averages for the European Union,
   registering property takes considerably less time in
   all 22 cities benchmarked in Bulgaria, Hungary and
   Romania—and is less costly but also more complex
   across the cities benchmarked in Bulgaria and Romania.

 Debrecen has the easiest property registration among
   the seven cities benchmarked in Hungary as well as
   among all 22. Oradea outperforms its peers in Romania
   while Ruse does so in Bulgaria.

 Hungary’s strong performance on both the efficiency
   and quality of land administration places the country
   among the top 10 EU member states on the ease of
   registering property and at 28 in the global ranking.

 On the quality of land administration index, the
   Hungarian cities surpass the EU average thanks to their
   reliability of infrastructure and geographic coverage,
   while the Bulgarian and Romanian cities lag behind.

          WHAT DOES REGISTERING PROPERTY MEASURE?
          Doing Business records the full sequence of procedures necessary for a business to purchase a property from another business
          and transfer the property title to the buyer’s name so that the buyer can use the property for expanding its business, use the
          property as collateral in taking new loans or, if necessary, sell the property to another business. It also measures the time and
          cost to complete each of these procedures. In addition, Doing Business measures the quality of the land administration system
          in each economy. The quality of land administration index has five dimensions: reliability of infrastructure, transparency of
          information, geographic coverage, land dispute resolution and equal access to property rights (see figure).

BOX 6.1 A long history of improvements in Hungary’s land administration system

The first cadastral surveying in Hungary took place between 1786 and 1790. This effort was triggered by the Law on Parcel
Surveying for Hungary, a decree issued by Emperor Joseph the Second, ruler of the Habsburg lands. The initiative was short-
lived, however, as all documentation was destroyed soon after the emperor’s death in 1790. But the cadastral surveying was
resumed in the 19th century for tax collection purposes, and the country has kept organized property records ever since.

Until 1971 land administration was based on a dual system, with both a land register and a land cadastre. By 1981 the country
had merged data and offices throughout its territory, establishing a unified land registration system under what is now the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

In 1990 Hungary started a program to modernize the land administration system in collaboration with the EU. The program
included setting up computer infrastructure in district land offices across the country as well as implementing legal and op-
erational changes that took years. The system was fully computerized by 1997. Hungary then launched a program to digitize
cadastral mapping, which succeeded in making cadastral maps in digital format available for the entire territory by 2007.

Today the Department of Land Administration (Foldhivatal) covers more than 10 million registered properties across the
country. Every property has a unique identification number that is used in both land books and cadastral maps. Since 2007
Foldhivatal has funded itself through revenues generated from services.

District land offices across the country communicate through TakarNet, a centralized electronic network that contains de-
tailed information on all properties. The system can be accessed for a fee by authorized users, such as bailiffs, public nota-
ries, lawyers who deal with land transactions, and banks and other financial institutions. While private individuals cannot
join the network, they can access Foldhivatal’s website (Foldhivatal Online), where they can obtain limited information on
properties for a fee.

The reform of Hungary’s land registry shows that such efforts require not only persistence and innovation but also time.
Each of the major reforms and infrastructure improvements since 1971 took around a decade to fully implement (see figure).
Today Foldhivatal covers 100% of Hungary’s territory in both its land records and its cadastral maps. This is an achievement:
globally, only 22% of economies cover all private land in their land records, and only 24% do so in their cadastral maps. In
addition, property registration has become more efficient in Hungary (as represented by Budapest). The time required to
register property has steadily fallen, from almost 80 days in 2004 to just 17.5 days today. Meanwhile, the cost has been cut
by more than half, from 11% of the property value to 5%.a Moreover, the reliability of records has been strengthened, and the
critical ingredients for online property registration have been put in place.

   BOX 6.2 Going electronic in property registration—an EU example of good practice from Denmark
   Denmark used to have a complex property registration system. At its core was an archive of around 80 million paper documents
   managed by local district courts that were not connected to one another. Completing a property transfer required working with
   thick, heavy land books in the local district court—a long and burdensome process for employees and customers alike.

   The Danish government recognized the need to modernize land administration, and in 1992 the Parliament amended the Land
   Registration Act to allow computerization—with the aim of speeding up the registration process and improving customer ser-
   vice. Between 1993 and 2000 the government scanned all records and computerized the country’s then 82 judicial district of-
   fices. While the records were being scanned, staff were being trained in how to work with the new registration system.

   In 2006, after the land records were fully digitized, work to develop a paperless registration system began. Another amendment
   to the Land Registration Act created the legal basis for implementing a digital land register, which was completed and operation-
   al by 2009. By 2011 Denmark required all applications to be submitted online, enabling more efficient screening of applications.

   Today, transferring a property in Denmark requires only three procedures, all of which can be completed online. Thanks to the
   online access to a single source of land registration data, citizens and businesses can transfer property on their own, with no
   involvement by third parties such as lawyers or notaries. They can also obtain information on any property. The Danish financial
   sector played a part: to facilitate access to credit as well as to information, it created a central hub allowing banks and the land
   registry to share land registration data.

Enforcing Contracts

MAIN FINDINGS

 Three Hungarian cities—Debrecen, Miskolc and
   Szekesfehervar—have more efficient contract
   enforcement as measured by Doing Business than
   Lithuania, the leader among member states of the
   European Union.

 Debrecen stands out thanks to a series of innovative
   court management measures informally called the
   “Debrecen Model,” a model that is readily replicable in
   other courts.

 In Bulgaria and Hungary enforcing a contract can take
   nearly twice as long in the city with the slowest courts
   as in the city with the fastest ones.

 Variations in scoring on the quality of judicial processes
   index emerge mostly in the availability of specialized
   commercial divisions of courts and in features of
   electronic case management systems.

 If the capitals of Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary had
   each attained the best performances found within their
   country, they would have ranked among the top 10
   on the ease of enforcing contracts in Doing Business
   2017—Sofia and Bucharest at 7 and Budapest at 3.

   BOX 7.1 A holistic approach to case management in the Norwegian courts

   Norway completely revamped its civil procedure in 2008. It introduced a holistic model restricting civil cases to one main hear-
   ing, emphasizing the role of preparatory pretrial conferences and strictly limiting the number of adjournments in a case.a Good
   case management practices like these can help reduce the caseload burden on courts and speed up the delivery of justice. After
   the Midhordland District Court in Norway introduced preparatory meetings in civil cases, more than 80% of these cases ended
   in a settlement rather than going to trial.b

   The Nedre Romerike District Court has also successfully implemented pretrial conference techniques. Judges schedule meetings
   shortly after a case is filed, allowing lawyers to attend in person or by phone. The judge and the parties plan the steps in the case
   and clarify the claims and main supportive arguments. They also discuss the evidence the parties plan to offer, set deadlines
   and establish the dates and number of days needed for the main hearing. Hearing dates are set in accordance with general time
   standards allowing six months for ordinary civil cases and three months for small claims. The court also follows a restrictive ap-
   proach to adjournments. If the lawyer for a case is unavailable, the administrators push for its transfer to another lawyer at the
   same firm. Adjournments are rarely granted and usually limited to illness documented by a doctor’s certificate.c

   Judicial discretion is a central feature of the Norwegian system. Judges tailor the proceedings and guide the parties by identifying
   disputes and undisputed facts. They have a duty to promote early settlement of disputes. They also assess whether mediation
   is appropriate for a case, and can refer cases for court-annexed mediation, which became available for all civil cases in 2008.d

About Doing Business
and Doing Business in the
European Union 2017: Bulgaria,
Hungary and Romania

 Doing Business measures aspects of business
   regulations affecting domestic small and medium-size
   firms defined based on standardized case scenarios and
   located in the largest business city of each economy. In
   addition, for 11 economies a second city is covered.

 Doing Business covers 11 areas of business regulation
   across 190 economies. Ten of these areas—starting a
   business, dealing with construction permits, getting
   electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting
   minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders,
   enforcing contracts and resolving insolvency—are
   included in the distance to frontier score and ease of
   doing business ranking. Doing Business also measures
   features of labor market regulation, which is not
   included in these two measures.

 Doing Business in the European Union 2017: Bulgaria,
   Hungary and Romania covers only 5 Doing Business
   indicator sets: starting a business, dealing with
   construction permits, getting electricity, registering
   property and enforcing contracts.

 Doing Business and Doing Business in the European
   Union 2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania rely on
   four main sources of information: the relevant laws and
   regulations, expert respondents, the governments of
   the economies and cities covered and the World Bank
   Group regional staff.

 Governments use Doing Business as a source of
   objective data providing unique insights into good
   practices worldwide. Many Doing Business indicators
   are “actionable”—though depending on the context,
   they may not always be “action-worthy.”

        Economy characteristics
        Gross national income per capita
        Doing Business in the European Union 2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania reports 2015 income per capita as published in the
        World Bank’s World Development Indicators 2016. Income is calculated using the Atlas method (in current U.S. dollars). For
        cost indicators expressed as a percentage of income per capita, 2015 gross national income (GNI) per capita in current U.S.
        dollars is used as the denominator. Bulgaria’s income per capita for 2015 is US$7,220 (BGN 11,534), Hungary’s income per
        capita is US$12,990 (HUF 3,296,327) and Romania’s income per capita is US$9,500 (RON 35,109).

        Region and income group
        Doing Business uses the World Bank regional and income group classifications, available at http://data.worldbank.org/about
        /country-and-lending-groups. Regional averages presented in figures and tables in the Doing Business in the European Union
        2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania report include economies from all income groups (low, lower middle, upper middle and
        high income).

        Exchange rates
        The exchange rate for the US dollar used in the Doing Business in the European Union 2017: Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania
        report is: US$1 = 1.5975 Bulgarian Leva (BGN), US$1 = 253.7588 Hungarian Forints (HUF) and US$1 = 3.6957 Romanian Leu
        (RON). The exchange rate for the Euro used in the report is the rate of the European Central Bank as of December 30, 2016:
