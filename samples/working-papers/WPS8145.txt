I. Introduction
International evidence shows that total factor productivity growth accounts for most of the income
and growth differences across countries. Research shows that both physical and human capital
accumulation are persistent processes, while growth is volatile and varies widely across countries
(Easterly and Levine, 2001). Hence, identifying the determinants of productivity is essential to
understanding growth.

Most of the productivity analysis in Nigeria is based on aggregate macroeconomic data and points
to four main findings: 1) total factor productivity increased in the period 2000-2014; 2) growth in
Nigeria is negative in periods of fast capital accumulation (Sala-i-Martin, et. al. 2012; Lennon,
2016: World Bank, 2017); 3) periods of faster positive productivity growth can be associated with
episodes of market-oriented reform and development of more inclusive political institutions
(World Bank, 2017); the 4) the most important determinants of labor productivity growth are
investment and education of the labor force (Lennon, 2016).

Yet, aggregate macroeconomic figures do not capture heterogeneity of productivity across sectors
or firms. Despite the importance and need of disaggregating the analysis of productivity, firm-
level productivity has been an under-researched topic in Nigeria. However, the World Bank’s
Enterprise Survey (ES) is a useful source of both quantitative and qualitative information of firms
in Nigeria. Between 2007 and 2014, the Bank performed three ES for the manufacturing and
services sectors. The ES contains quantitative and qualitative information of over 7,500 firms.
The survey contains balance sheet information as well as production details on output (sales) and
factor utilization. It also collects information on variables related to how infrastructure affects the
firm, on the firms’ relationship with government officials, finance and corporate governance, labor
skills, and other topics. However, evidence on the productivity of Nigerian firms is sparse and
limited to a descriptive analysis of the investment climate (McKinsey Global Institute 2014; World
Bank 2008, 2011, 2015, 2016).

The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of the investment climate and other factors on
Nigerian enterprise productivity. We consider four main dimensions of investment climate that are
insecurity, bribe or informal payment to get things done, the amount of time that management
spends dealing with government regulation, and the costs of power outage. Besides the
investment climate, other factors that can determine firm productivity are its size, the quality
of the workforce, the availability of credit, and the sector of operation.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the data and main stylized
facts of the production, productivity, resource utilization, and investment climate in Nigeria.
Section III presents the empirical strategy and shows econometric results. Section IV concludes.

II. Literature review and stylized facts of output, input, productivity, and
business climate in Nigerian firms 2007-2014

      A. Literature review

The business environment or investment climate refers to a set of factors, policies and institutions
that shape the opportunities and incentives for firms to invest productively, create jobs and expand
(Aterido et al. 2011; World Bank., 2005). The literature reveals a consensus that good business
environment fosters firms' growth, productivity and development, while adverse business
environment increases firms' transaction costs and constraints on their development. 1 As
highlighted by Dollar et al (2005), the investment climate matters for the level of productivity,
wages, profit rate and the growth of output, employment, and capital stock at the firm level. A
poor business environment reduces the opportunities and incentives for firms to invest
productively, create jobs and expand. We focus in this paper on three specific dimensions of the
investment climate: access to infrastructure, access to finance, and regulatory environment.

Well-developed infrastructure is essential to promote economic growth by reducing transaction
cost for firms as well as for households. Indeed, infrastructure services like transport, energy, water
and sanitation are used by firms in their production processes and delivery of goods and services
(Bah and Fang, 2015). Moreover, well-developed infrastructure is an asset for the competitiveness
of firms both at the national and international levels. In this vein, Bah and Fang (2015) argue that
poor infrastructure in Africa increases transaction cost and makes African firms less competitive
than their international counterparts. In Africa, as in the other developing countries, the costs of
transportation, logistics, telecommunication, water, electricity, security and bribes are high, and
firms suffer great losses due to transportation problems, power and water outages and crime (Eifert
et al, 2005). Poor infrastructure creates barriers to opportunities and increases costs and risks for
small firms as well as multinationals (World Bank, 2005) by limiting market access, shrinking the
size of the available market and reducing productivity. Eifert et al (2005) show for instance that a
substantial portion of the variance in measured productivity between China and several African
countries can be attributed to infrastructure and logistics-related losses rather than their intrinsic
capabilities. Good infrastructure connects firms to their customers and suppliers and helps them
take advantage of modern production techniques (World Bank, 2005). In Nigeria, as in other
African countries, poor quality of infrastructure characterized mostly by frequent power outages,
insecurity, and bribery negatively impacts firms’ performance and reduces the incentive to invest
productively.

A branch of the literature focuses on the effects of credit and liquidity constraints on firms'
performance. Rajan and Zingales (1998), one of the first to analyze this relationship, highlight that

industries which require more external financing grow faster in more financially developed
countries. Financial inclusion encourages investment by reducing liquidity constraints and
therefore affects firm size, competition, and industrial structure (Beck et al. 2005). Moreover, Beck
et al (2005) find that the effect of financial underdevelopment on a firm's growth depends on the
firm's size. The latter highlight that the smallest firms are consistently the most adversely affected
by negative investment climate in general but especially by financial underdevelopment. Finally,
heavy regulatory environment negatively affects firms’ performance. Djankov et al (2002) show
that heavy regulation related to the starting of businesses increases the size of the unofficial
economy. Moreover, Botero (2004) finds that heavy regulation of labor is associated with a larger
unofficial economy, lower labor force participation, and higher unemployment. Klapper et al
(2006) show that entry regulations hamper establishment entry and that the value added per
employee grows more slowly in countries with high entry barriers (Klapper et al., 2006) and small
firms may be more dissuaded from entering than large firms.

Related to the investment climate and productivity, the impact of corruption and firm productivity
is examined in detail by De Rosa et.al. (2013) in their analysis of Eastern and Central European
economies. They examine the impacts of the “bribe tax”, which is the small payments to reduce
transaction costs of the day-to-day operation and the “time-tax”, which is the time devoted by
managers to deal with red tape. The authors note that the impact of the bribe tax can be either
positive or negative, though they find a negative association between both variables. They find
insignificant the impact of the time tax.

   B. Descriptive statistics and Stylized facts of Nigerian Firms’ Output, Factors, and Business Climate


This paper uses the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys in Nigeria including more than 7,000 firms
for the three years 2007, 2009 and 2014. The 2007 survey included 2,387 firms in 26 states, the
2009 survey 3,157 firms in 11 states and the 2014 survey included 2,676 firms in 19 states. We
combined the first two surveys to ensure statistical representativeness at the national level. The
surveys did not cover the agricultural or mining sectors. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the sample
composition by size and sector, for the total sample.

Output
We associate firm output with sales, as the surveys have no information on inventory management.
Hence, we use the terms sales and output interchangeably. Total sales increased between both
periods, but the behavior was different between exporting firms and those that produce for the
domestic market (Figure 1). Sales go up between 2008 and 2014 driven by the increase in domestic
markets while sales of exporting firms decreased in the same period. The fall in the exporter firm
sales may be explained by the resource curse of the oil boom registered during the period of
analysis; these micro-level data coincide with falling non-oil and gas exports registered at the
macro level.2 Sales increased across all the regions except in the East regions (North East and
South East) where sales go down between 2008 and 2014.

Production became more concentrated at the sector level between 2008 and 2014, as implied by
the Herfindahl_Hirschman Index (HHI): the increase in concentration is more notable in the
services sector (Figure 2), which as will be shown in the next section, is the one with highest
productivity. The concentration of production at the sector level may give rise to economies of
scale, which in turn explains productivity growth vis a vis other drivers of productivity growth
such as resource reallocation towards more productive sectors (World Bank, 2017).

Access to finance
The proportion of working capital financed by banks and the proportion of firms having a loan
increased between 2008 and 2014. However, there is large heterogeneity across firms in the use of
bank financing: while 7 percent of small firms reported having a line of credit or a loan facility,
the proportion rose to 15 percent in medium sized firms, and further to 34 percent in large firms
(Appendix 2). In total, only 12 percent of the firms had a loan or an overdraft facility in 2014,
which is extremely low compared with regional peers where the proportion is more than 30 percent
(Figure 3). Also, in 2014 less than 10 percent of Nigerian firms applied for a loan 3 (Appendix 2).
Among firms that did not apply for a loan, 51 percent report that they do not need a loan, whereas
the others quote respectively complexity in application procedure, unfavorable interest rate, high
collateral requirements, insufficiency of size and maturity, and did not think it would be approved

Obstacles to doing business
Firms reported electricity, corruption, access to finance, and political instability as the four major
or very severe obstacles to their operations in 2014 (Figure 4). The firms’ perception of the major
obstacles shows a relative improvement, as the percentage of firms that ranked these factors as
major obstacles declined over time, except corruption; while 30 percent of firms ranked corruption
as a major obstacle, that fraction rose to 45 percent in 2014.

There is a large heterogeneity in the firms’ perceptions of obstacles to doing business across
regions. Electricity is perceived as the biggest obstacle to doing business in all the regions except
in the North West, where corruption is reported as the major obstacle by a small margin (Table 2).
Political instability appears within the top 3 major or very severe obstacles to doing business in
the Northern regions (NC, NE, and NW), while it is ranked in the bottom three obstacles in the
Southern regions (except the SE region, Table 2).

While the perceptions described above indicate an apparent improvement in the business climate
over time, the percentage of sales lost due to each of the factors, specifically bribes, security, crime,
and power outages increases over the same period. In 2014 Nigerian firms reported an average
total cost due to these four factors equivalent to 40 percent of sales. These costs are larger for
young, exporting, and manufacturing firms (Figures 5 to 7) and can be interpreted as fixed costs
arising from the business climate.

The costs of power outage, security, crime, and bribes do not affect homogeneously firms across
Nigeria and are negatively associated with investments (Figure 9). These costs are higher for firms
in the East and South South regions where the weighted average investment is lower. A regression
for determinants of investment estimated for a panel of firms verifies the negative impact of
investment climate variables, as well as the positive association of investment and firm size and
availability of credit. More importantly, the regional fixed effects reveal the significant differences,
with the northeast and the southeast having the largest negative effect.

Outward orientation
Exporting firms import more relative to the non-exporting ones, especially when they have foreign
ownership participation. For instance, exporting firms with foreign ownership imported 45 percent
of their inputs, while non-exporting firms with foreign ownership imported only 17 percent of the
inputs. Both figures are lower for firms without foreign ownership, but still exporting firms import
more than non-exporters (Figure 10).

Nigerian exporting firms are more productive than the non-exporting ones (Figure 11.) 4 The
positive association between the exporting nature of firms and productivity cannot be used as a
causality statement. In the empirical section, we deal with potential endogeneity issues.

Firm location and duality of the economy

The location of firms reveals striking differences that can influence firm performance. While small
firms are more evenly distributed across the country, there is a process of concentration in the
northwest and southwest (Figure 12). Large firms are extremely concentrated in the Southwest
region, where 73 percent of the large firms are located (Figure 13). Recall that the costs associated
with bribes, crime, insecurity, and power outage are lower in the Southwest relative to the other
regions (Figure 9).

Firm performance
Labor productivity and value added per worker increased in the period 2008-2014 (Figure 14).
Contribution to value added per worker became increasingly concentrated in the medium and large
firms (Figure 15).

Similarly, the costs of labor per unit of value added increased over the same period on average
(Figure 16). All else being equal, this increase in the average costs of labor per unit of value added
can be interpreted as a factor for loss of competitiveness of Nigerian firms.

However, there is significant heterogeneity in the indicator by firm size, as it decreased for large
firms, while it rose in small and medium firms. This would imply that larger firms were more
productive between 2008 and 2014, while small and medium firms face a lost competitiveness
over the same period. This striking difference in this key indicator points at the need of analyzing
productivity behavior controlling for numerous factors, including size of the firm, location, and

III. Determinants of firms’ productivity
This section explores the determinants of productivity of Nigerian firms with data from three
waves of Nigeria Enterprise Surveys (ES) as described in the previous section. The analysis uses
three different measures of productivity: labor productivity per worker, value added per worker,
and total factor productivity (TFP). Labor productivity is measured as the real annual sales divided
by the number of fulltime equivalent workers by considering the temporary workers.5 Value added
is obtained by excluding the costs of raw materials and energy from the annual sales. Value added
per worker is obtained by dividing the difference by the number of fulltime equivalent workers.

Finally, we use the TFP concept as an alternative measure of productivity at the firm level. TFP
has the advantage to account for the technology of production and the level of capital. We derive
the TFP from a Cobb-Douglas production function with the following technology                  =
           .       refers to the gross output of firm in sector in country during the previous fiscal
year with and denoting capital and labor, respectively. Using the natural logarithm, the
production could be specified as follows:          = +           +      +       +      .      is the
natural logarithm of output at the end of the previous fiscal year;   and      represent the natural
logarithm of the net book value of capital and the total permanent full-time employees (labor) at
the end of the previous fiscal year.      captures unobservable productivity shocks; and       is an
independent and identically distributed shock, which does not affect firm decision. Estimating the
TFP at the firm level is challenging because of the potential correlation between productivity
shocks and inputs. Firms facing a positive productivity shock could respond by using higher levels

time equivalent workers.

                                                                                                                        15
of inputs. Following Levinshon and Petrin (2003) and Saliola and Seker (2012), we address this
potentially endogenous issue by using the cost of energy as a proxy of unobservable productivity
shock. The TFP is estimated as the residual from the production function based on the following
equation:

          ≅        −           −          −           ;

where , , and          are the estimated coefficients from the previous equation.


Using different measures of productivity helps us ensure the robustness of our findings.
Fortunately, the correlation across the different measures is high (Table 3), indicating that despite
the empirical difficulty of estimating TFP, our preferred measure of productivity, results will not
depend on the choice of the specific measure.6

                          LP=labor productivity; VA= value added per worker.

Factors affecting productivity

When the measure of productivity is labor productivity, we include the stock of capital measured
by the gross book value of capital reported by firms. Two factors that capture features of the labor
input are the proportion of temporary workers and the average educational attainment of a typical
worker. To capture the availability of financing we included a dummy variable that takes the value
1 if the firm has a line of credit or an overdraft facility. The impact of the investment climate can
be captured by including several variables: the percentage of the top manager’s time spent in
dealing with the government regulations (“time tax”), the costs of bribing, the costs of power
outages, and the costs of security, all expressed in terms relative to the volume of sales and reported
in the ES.7 We included a dummy to capture whether the firm was an exporter taking the value 1
if a firm has a positive share of its sales directly or indirectly exported.

  The high correlation between labor productivity and TFP could be interpreted as evidence in favor of a simple neo-
classical growth model for Nigeria, in which TFP is the main driver of labor productivity. New growth models in
which labor productivity depends on the amount of resources devoted to the production of capital may not be
applicable due to the low investment levels or the low elasticity of output with respect to capital, or because the
economy is so oil-dependent that new capital goods are not produced and irrelevant in this undiversified economy. A
dynamic growth model is needed for a complete interpretation of these correlations (see Sargent and Rodriguez, 2000;
McGgrattan and Prescortt, 2012; or Romer, 1987).
7
  We do not include the losses due to theft, robbery, vandalism or arson in the estimations because of missing
observations. We lost more than 80 percent of the sample by including this variable.

                                                                                                                16
We control size, age, sector, region, and time effects. The size is proxied by the market share of
the firm, measured by the ratio of the firm sales over the total sales by sector-region-year. The age
is proxied by age category dummy variables: Young for firms aged between 0 and 5 years; mature
between 6 and 15 years; and old more than 15 years (old is used as a reference). Sector, region and
year dummies are included to control for some potentially important omitted variables, the
differences in demand conditions and survey differences. The estimated equation could be written
as follows:

                            =      +                                      +            +     +      +     +

where,                     is the measure of productivity of firm in sector , state at time ,
                          , the investment climate variables described above,     firm individual
characteristics, , , states, sector and year fixed effects respectively, and       the error term.
All estimates deal with potential multivariate outliers using the methodology proposed by Weber
(2010), a refinement of the procedure described by Hadi (1992, 1994).


Identification strategy

The estimation is done in two steps. First, all variables are assumed to be exogenous, and in a
second step the estimation accounts for the potential endogeneity of exporting nature8 and bribery
costs by using an instrumental variables methodology. Exports we instrumented with the
proportion of material inputs and supplies of foreign origin. The intuition is that firms connected
to the international market through imports are more likely to export, as shown in the stylized facts
section. Bribery was instrumented by average bribe by location-sector-size cluster “to get things
done”. The underlying intuition of this instruments is based on the literature on the social
conformity effect (Fortin et al., 2007; Myles and Naylor, 1996; Gordon, 1989). If paying a bribe
“to get thing done” is a social norm for a group of firms, an establishment belonging to this group
will be more likely to be involved in corruption activities. As argued by Alm et al (2016) the
culture of bribery reduces the stigma and social costs involved with all forms of bribery.9


8 See Melitz (2003) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) for more extensive discussion on the relationship between
exports and productivity.
9
  The way the average is calculated and matched to firms is particularly important to address properly the endogeneity
problem (Aterido et al., 2011). Indeed, the average must be calculated so that it considers the fact that firms may
change size over the period for which we have data, i.e., at t-3 and t. To do so, we follow a two-step approach like
Aterido et al (2011). First, we compute the average size of each firm. Based on average size, we calculate for each
location-sector-size cluster the average amount of bribe paid “to get things done”. Given that the bribery environment
may be different for firms that have changed size over time relative to what is typical for firms of a given size category
for a while, we match the average based on their initial size. Indeed, matching based on the current size may leave
endogeneity untackled as other characteristics of the current cluster may affect a specific firm productivity through

                                                                                                                      17
Fixed effects are used to control for omitted variable bias, namely other effects this norm of bribes
might have on institutional variables at the state level and on a firm-specific level of productivity.
Given that we have two instruments for two endogenous variables, we are not able to test for over-
identifying restrictions. The first step estimations are reported in Table A2 in Appendix 4.

Results
Tables 4 to 6 summarize the estimates of the determinants of productivity, for the three measures
of productivity. When labor productivity is used (Table 4), the stock of capital is a strong
determinant of the firms’ labor productivity. A 10 percent increase in the stock of capital raises
the labor productivity between 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent. The effect is statistically significant at
the 1 percent level.

The average educational attainment of a typical worker increases firms’ productivity with all
measures of productivity. A 1-year increase in the average educational attainment of a typical
worker increases productivity between 8.9 percent and 20.9 percent. The proportion of temporary
workers has a positive effect on labor productivity and value added per worker. However, the
coefficient is barely significant at the 10 percent level in only two regressions.

Firm size is also positively associated with productivity, regardless of the measure. The firm’s age
is insignificant. Having a credit line or an overdraft facility increases productivity from 17.9
percent to 50 percent relative to firms that do not have a credit line or an overdraft facility. The
effect is strongly significant at the 1 percent level whatever the measure of productivity. This result
is puzzling given that only 12 percent10 of Nigerian firms have a line of credit or an overdraft
facility in 2014.

Among the investment climate variables, the cost of power outages is a consistently negative and
significant determinant of firm productivity. A 10 percent increase in the cost of power outage
reduces productivity between 4.9 percent and 15 percent. Bribery appears positively related to
productivity (Tables 4-6), but the impact decreases with firm size (Table 7). This finding
highlights that the unfriendly business climate imposes disproportionately on small firms the
burden of corruption as a means to raise their productivity. Weak identification test confirms that
our instruments are valid. The statistic of the test ranged between 13.9 and 16.7.




other channels than just its own amount of bribe paid. We therefore match the average based on initial size, arguing
that the owner/manager of a firm carries part of this norm of bribes from its earlier situation into its current situation.
We assume however that the norm of bribes and costs of insecurity remain constant over time in a location-sector-size
cluster and this allows using the information on conditions faced small firms at t to measure conditions faced by small
firms at t-3.


10
     This is extremely low compared with regional peers where the fractions oscillate between 30 percent and 50 percent.

                                                                                                                       18
The positive association between the exporting nature of firms and productivity (Column 4, Tables
4-6) vanishes when the 2SLS method is used (Column 5, Tables 4-6). Weak identification tests
confirm that our instruments are valid. The statistic from the weak identification test ranges
between 14.6 and 15.2. To clarify the relationship between productivity and being an exporter, we
examine the impact of productivity on the likelihood of being an exporting firm by estimating a
Probit model. Results reported in Table A2, Columns 5-7, show that, regardless of the measure of
productivity, the more productive firms are more likely to be exporters. Similar to the results of
Melitz (2003), and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), the level of productivity increases the likelihood
of being an exporter.


We performed a series of robustness checks, such as using different methods of dealing with
outliers and estimating the models without the weights, and none of the results change (Appendix
4).

IV. Concluding remarks
Government policies influence the investment climate and productivity through their impacts on
costs, risks and barriers to competition. Key factors affecting the investment climate through their
impact on costs are: factor markets (labor, intermediate materials and capital), infrastructure, taxes,
the regulatory burden, corruption, corporate governance and red tape in general, technological and
innovation support, and the availability and cost of finance. A significant component of country
competitiveness is having a good investment climate or business environment.

The paper found that the costs of a bad investment climate, proxied by the costs of power outages,
corruption, insecurity and crime, and the time that managers have to spend dealing with
government regulation (“time tax”) are fixed costs that affect more the small, young, exporting
firms. These costs are also negatively associated with investment, and partially explain why
investment is low in some regions.

This paper examined the evolution and determinants of productivity of Nigerian firms. The paper
used three alternative measures of productivity: labor productivity, value added per worker, and
total factor productivity (TFP) which were found to be highly correlated. The more notable trends
in the data show: a rise in productivity, with output of exporting firms decreasing; increasing
concentration of production, reflected by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index rise by a factor of three;
increasing costs of crime, power outages, lack of security, and bribery, measured as foregone sales
due to these factors; and significant heterogeneity of these costs along several dimensions, such as
size, age, location, and exporting or domestic nature of the markets. These costs are inversely
related with investment.

Regardless of the measure of productivity utilized, the main determinants of firm productivity are
the education of the worker, the size of the firm, the availability of credit, the amount of time that
management spends dealing with government regulation (“time tax”), and the cost of power
outages.

When labor productivity is used, the stock of capital is also a major determinant of productivity.
Firms in the services sector are the more productive ones. There is a positive association between
productivity and exporting nature, but when the endogeneity and reverse causality are controlled
for, we find that productivity is a weak determinant of the likelihood of a firm exporting, while as
well as the credit availability, the foreign participation in ownership, and the integration to foreign
markets via imported inputs are robust determinants of this likelihood.

Appendix 3- Investment and costs from the business environment

One of the interesting stylized facts in Nigeria is the relationship between firm’s investment and
the fixed costs generated by the investment climate. Indeed, regions with higher fixed costs (bribe,
costs of power outage, crime, and security as percentage of sales) have a lower level of investment.

We assess the magnitude of the relationship between firms’ investment and investment climate by
analyzing the potential determinants of firms’ investment. We include the same financing, size and
age variables, as in the previous estimations. As fixed costs generated by investment climate, we
include separately bribe, costs of security and power outage, and the percentage of time in a typical
week the top manager spends in dealing with the regulations imposed by the government. We do
not include the costs of crime in the regression because this variable makes us lose an important
number of observations. Also, to take into account the panel dimension, we focus only on the panel
data.

The results reported in the Table A2 show that having a credit line or an overdraft facility, and the
size increase firms’ investment. However, all the investment climate variables, except the cost of
power outage, decrease the firms’ investment. A 10 percent increase in the time the top manager
spends in dealing with the regulations imposed by the government decreases investment by 18
percent. Similarly, a 10 percent increase in the firms’ payment in bribes and security as percentage
of sales decreases firms’ investment between 84 percent and 87 percent for bribes and 59 percent
and 70 percent for cost of security.

Appendix 4- Robustness checks

To assess the sensitivity of our findings, we perform two robustness checks in addition to using
three different measures of productivity. First, we examine whether our results hold without using
the weights. Indeed, the literature is not unanimous on the use of weights in regression and there
is not strong econometric argument in favor of using weighted estimation. As highlighted in the
implementation report of the Nigeria 2014 Enterprise Surveys data set,11 both OLS and weighted
OLS can be inconsistent under regular conditions, even if the weighted OLS has the advantage to
provide an estimate that is independent of the simple design. Columns (1) to (3) of Table A3 report
estimates of unweighted 2SLS for all measures of productivity. Second, we examine whether our
results are sensitive using an alternative criterion to deal with outliers. We use Hadi’s (1992, 1994)
methodology for multivariate outliers. This methodology uses the covariance matrix to identify a
set of outliers over more than one variable. Columns (4) to (6) of Table A3 below present results
from estimation excluding the set of outliers identified by Hadi’s (1992) approach. The results
remain quantitatively and significantly the same. As it can be seen, our findings remain
quantitatively and significantly the same.
