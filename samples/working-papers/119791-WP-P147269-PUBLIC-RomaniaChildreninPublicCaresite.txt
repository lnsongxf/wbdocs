This book was written under the coordination of Mr. Andrew Mason, with overall guidance from Ms.
Elisabetta Capannelli. It is part of the background studies conducted for the Government of Romania’s
National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 and related draft Action Plan,
accompanied by nine Flagship Initiatives.
The study was initiated in 2014 by Gabriela Coman, President of the National Authority for the
Protection of Children’s Rights and Adoption (ANPDCA), who asked UNICEF and the World Bank for
technical assistance to conduct some research in preparation for a new wave of reforms to Romania’s
child protection services. The ANPDCA team was coordinated by Gabriela Coman and Elena Tudor.
The World Bank team was coordinated by Emil Teșliuc, Vlad Grigoraș (Task Team Leaders), and
Manuela Sofia Stănculescu, while the UNICEF team was coordinated by Voichița Pop. Fiona
Mackintosh edited the book.
The report was subjected to a peer review process conducted by Penelope Jane Aske Williams (World
Bank) and Otto Sestak (Country Director, HHC Romania).
The team members would like to express their gratitude to their counterparts in the ANPDCA for their
constant support during the study. In addition, we would like to thank all County General Directorates
for Social Assistance and Child Protection (DGASPC) for investing their time and effort without which
this study would not have been possible.
During the data collection activities conducted with the support of the Romanian Center for Economic
Modeling (CERME) and Metro Media Transilvania company (MMT), the report benefited from the
participation of over 900 representatives of DGASPCs and several other non-governmental
organizations that provide child protection services, as well as of more than 780 case managers and
professionals in the area of social assistance, over 90 parents of children in public care, and 74
children aged between 7 and 18 years who live separated from their families. We are grateful to all of
them for sharing with us their problems, ideas, hopes, and wishes on what and how things should
change in the child protection system in order to ensure the best interests of the child.

Introduction
At the beginning of the 1990s, Romania inherited a disastrous child protection system from the
communist regime. As a result of pro-birth policies and of the economic depression in the 1980s, the
traditional models of child care in the family, especially for children in need (in particular those with
disabilities) were undermined. According to estimates, in 1989, over 100,000 children were living in
large residential institutions in extremely poor conditions, which had a strong negative impact on their
health, development, and psychological status.
The Government of Romania has made significant progress in the past 25 years in terms of reducing
the number of children in public care. 1 At the present time Romania’s rate of children placed in public
care, compared to its entire population of children is about average among the countries of Central
and Eastern Europe and those in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CEE/CIS).2 However, in
absolute numbers, the child protection system in Romania is still one of the largest in the region,
having to provide an adequate response to the needs of about 60,000 children.
Despite the large number of children placed in public care, the Government of Romania has
acknowledged the fact that the residential type of care has negative effects, especially on the
development of young children, and has managed to improve child protection services substantially
by developing family-type care alternatives. Therefore, at present, two-thirds of the children in the
protection system are placed in family-type care services (Intrograph Chart 1).
However, following the global crisis, which affected the situation of children in the entire CEE/CIS
region, the process of reducing the number of institutionalized children slowed down significantly,
both in Romania and in other countries in the region. The reasons for this are twofold. First, many
families have been leaving their children in institutions either temporarily or permanently because of
their declining living conditions and severe poverty. Second, the system’s capacity has decreased as a
result of the hiring freeze in the public sector and of the limited budget, particularly the budget for
family-type care services.
Consequently, decreasing the number of children in public care remains a priority for the foreseeable
future. In response to the recent trends, the government has committed to speeding up the
deinstitutionalization process and has acknowledged this as a priority in various strategic documents
including the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children's Rights 2014-2020, the
National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020, and the Romanian Partnership
Agreement for the 2014-2020 Programming Period.
In line with the European Commission’s Social Investment Package and Recommendation “Investing in
Children: Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage,” the National Authority for the Protection of Children’s
Rights and Adoption (ANPDCA) has set its priorities for 2014-2020 with regard to the need to
transition from institutional care to community-based services and to provide children with early and
preventive interventions that enforce their right to grow up in a family environment and help them to
achieve their full potential and exercise their rights.
In order to strategically prioritize reform measures, the ANPDCA together with the World Bank and
UNICEF embarked on a complex process of analysis of the child protection system in Romania.3 This
implies an analysis that goes beyond the numbers - interpreting new data and information on children

    See Chapter 3.3.2.

 Romania has a rate of between 1,600 and 1,700 children in public care aged between 0 and 17 years old as compared
with 1,850 children per 100,000 children, which is the average rate in CEE/CIS region, as well as in the countries of
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. TransMonEE 2015 database, Table 6.1.22.

 In this study, the child protection system refers to the entire set of services aimed at protecting and promoting
children’s rights organized at different levels (local, county, and national).

                                                                                                                   7
in public care, understanding the circumstances of those children who are cared for outside of their
birth families and receive alternative care,4 and identifying the root causes of child-family separation.
The study aims to strengthen the social services related to child protection by: (i) reorganizing existing
child special protection services to enhance the quality of care provided while reducing the duration
of stay in public care to the minimum necessary; (ii) developing and strengthening the capacity of
community-based prevention and support services; and (iii) reconsidering the ways and means of
providing family support in order to prevent child-family separations.
This book presents the results of this research on more than 52,000 children placed in public care in
Romania (in special protection5) who receive family or residential-type protection services, as shown in
Intrograph Chart 1, as well as on the children at risk of separation from their families from the source
communities.6 In order to fulfill the research objectives, various quantitative and qualitative data were
collected 7 by means of: (i) a survey of households with children in public care in rural source
communities; (ii) case studies in urban source communities; (iii) an analysis of the case files of children
in public care (in the special protection system), including adoption forms; (iv) a survey of case
managers; and (v) focus groups with specialists and with children in public care.
The whole analysis in this volume is child-centered, encompassing both children in the special
protection system and children at risk of separation from their family. We attempt to answer the
following questions. What is their profile? What families do they come from? By which routes do they
enter the system? Which are the root causes of their separation from the family? What kind of
community support have they received, if any, before entering the system? How does the transition
from family to public care occur? How are children placed in different types of services? How are
individualized plans of intervention developed? By which routes do they leave the system? What are
their chances of being reintegrated into the family? The themes addressed are organized according to
the ANPDCA’s vision in three phases: (1) before entering the system; (2) within the system; and (3)
leaving the system.
In addition to the data used in this volume, data on institutional practices were also collected, such as
transfers within the system, protection measures, case management, and the effects of special
protection services on children’s development. These results will be presented in a separate volume,
which is currently being written.
The results presented in this book have been and will be discussed with the central and local
authorities in Romania in order to identify the priority steps required to advance the reform of and
increase investments to the child protection system reform. Some of the study’s preliminary data were
presented in meetings 8 organized in 2014 and 2015 with the representatives of the General
Directorates for Social Assistance and Child Protection and of non-governmental organizations.

  Alternative care refers to care provided to children deprived of parental care. It does not refer exclusively to
alternatives to institutional care and may include placement with relatives or people outside the family, formal foster
care placement, other forms of family-based or family-type care placements, safe facilities for emergency child care,
emergency transit centers, and other short- and long-term residential care facilities including small group homes and
supervised independent living arrangements for children.
5
 In this volume, special protection refers to the set of measures, benefits, and services aimed at ensuring the care and
development of children deprived, either temporarily or permanently, of parental care and of the children who cannot
be left in their parents’ care if their best interests are to be protected.
6
 By definition, "source communities" (rural and urban) are areas at the sub-locality level from where, compared to other
communities, a significantly larger number of children enter public care. Sub-locality areas may refer to a neighborhood,
a street, or a group of houses and/or blocks in urban areas or an entire village, hamlet, or just a group of houses in rural
areas.

1 Policy Context
In the context of drafting the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights
2014-2020, the Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Protection, and the Elderly (MMFPSPV) through the
National Authority for the Protection of Children’s Rights and Adoption (ANPDCA) is committed to
reviewing and adjusting the current policies of the Government of Romania related to the wellbeing of
children and their families, with a special focus on children who are deprived of parental care or are at
risk of being separated from their families.
The MMFPSPV has requested the World Bank’s support in preparing a draft National Strategy on
Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 and an accompanying Action Plan. Also, together
with the ANPDCA, the MMFPSPV asked UNICEF for technical assistance to collect information on the
child protection system in Romania. The World Bank team has analyzed these newly collected data
with a view to improving Romania’s policies on child rights and social protection for children who are
deprived of parental care or are at risk of being separated from their families.



1.1. The Problem: Children and
        Youths at High Risk of Poverty
In Romania, there are nearly 3.8 million children under 18 living in 3.2 million households.9 From 2007,
the year when Romania joined the European Union, to 2015, children and youths consistently
registered by far the highest risk of poverty of all age groups (Table 1).

Note: The share of people with an annual disposable income (after receiving social transfers) below 60 percent of

Thus, according to Eurostat data, in 2015, over 38 percent of children aged 0 to 17 in Romania lived in
poverty, versus nearly 20 percent in the EU-15. Moreover, the poverty rate increased between 2007
and 2015 (Table 1), a trend registered mostly among children and youths (aged 18 to 24 years old)
and to a much lesser degree or not at all among the other age groups.
One in every two children living in rural areas is poor. In 2012, about 53 percent of children in rural
areas were living in poverty, while the rate for children in urban areas was only 17 percent. This large

  Most children come from nuclear families (58 percent of households with children) or multigenerational households
including grandparents and/or other relatives, with or without parents (36 percent). The other children live in single-
parent families, accounting for nearly 6 percent of all households with children (NIS data as of 1 January 2012).

disparity coupled with an approximately even distribution of children between urban and rural areas
means that over 74 percent of poor children live in rural areas. What is alarming is that income
poverty coupled with the lack of access to basic social services (including health and education) and
an inefficient labor market increases the vulnerability of these children to persistent poverty even after
they become adults.

Child poverty in Romania tends to be persistent and accompanied by severe material deprivation.
Thus, the persistent poverty rate (for three to four years long) is nearly 30 percent among children, a
percentage which, since 2010, has put Romania consistently among the worst EU countries. At the
same time, according to Eurostat 2014 data,10 29 percent of children in Romania live in households
affected by severe material deprivation. Even more worrying is the fact that, according to previous
child-focused research conducted by independent teams,11 72 to 78 percent of Romanian children
suffer from severe material deprivation even in terms of basic needs,12 which is significantly greater
than in all of the other European states (see Figure 2).
The World Bank's background study 13 for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty
Reduction 2015-2020 showed that the type of household that is most likely to be materially deprived
consists of two adults and three or more children. Basically, all people living in this type of household
(96 percent) cannot afford a one-week holiday away from home, while more than half also cannot
afford to pay for any unexpected expenses, to have a meal with meat every other day, to avoid arrears,
or to have a car. Two other types of households – single-parent households and households
composed of three adults and at least one child – also have to struggle a great deal to avoid material
deprivation.

  The indicator adopted by the Social Protection Committee (the EU advisory policy committee for the Employment and
Social Affairs Ministers in the Employment and Social Affairs Council) measures the percentage of the population that
meets at least four of the following nine criteria: (1) they cannot afford to pay their rent, mortgage, or utility bills; (2)
they cannot afford to keep their home adequately warm; (3) they face unexpected expenses; (4) they cannot afford to
eat meat or other protein regularly; (5) they cannot afford to go on holiday; (6) they cannot afford to purchase a
television set; (7) they cannot afford to purchase a washing machine; (8) they cannot afford to run a car; and (9) they do
not have a telephone. The indicator distinguishes between individuals who cannot afford a certain item or service and
those who do not have this item or service for another reason, for example, because they do not want or need it.

  This group of children lacks (because of a lack of money) to an especially great extent, indoor games, outdoor
equipment, and participation in school trips and events that cost money; to a very great extent, children’s books and a
family car; and to a great extent, fresh fruit and vegetables as well as a meat-based or fish-based meal every day,
celebrations, the possibility of inviting friends over from time to time, regular leisure activities (such as sports or
organizations for children and young people), new clothes and two good pairs of shoes, a computer and Internet access,
and a desk or adequate space to do their homework.

Households with many children are also more prone to poverty. The larger the number of children in a
family, the higher the poverty incidence, both in rural and urban areas (Table 2). Thus, out of all
children in Romania, the approximately 20 percent of children who live in households with three or
more children have a risk of poverty of 57 percent, with a high of over 65 percent for those who live in
thinly populated (rural) areas.

Young people have the second highest poverty rate and are the age group who were most affected
by the economic crisis. In 2015, youths aged between 18 and 24 years old faced an extremely high
poverty rate (about 35 percent),14 very close to the high risk-of-poverty rate for children. What is
particularly worrying is that, in the case of young people, the poverty rate has increased significantly
over time. For example, the poverty rate for those aged 18 to 24 increased by over 13 percentage
points between 2007 and 2015, while, for children, it increased by about 5 percentage points, and, for
the total population, by 1 percentage point over the same period of time (Table 1). This increase may
have been due to the growing vulnerability and risk faced by young people on the labor market,
particularly during the economic crisis.

14
     The same conclusions apply to the 16 to 26 age group.

In Romania, too many children continue to be separated from their natural families or subjected to
various forms of violence or social exclusion. By way of its 2004 legislation for the protection and
promotion of children’s rights, Romania is already part of the group of countries forbidding violence
against children, namely any physical punishment or humiliating or degrading treatment against
children. Nevertheless, the government acknowledged the fact that, unless the legislation is
implemented consistently and efficiently, its impact will be rather limited, and children (especially
those from vulnerable groups) will continue to be frequently exposed to various forms of violence,
both in their family and in school.
From the statistical point of view, it is a fact that violence against children remains to a large extent an
invisible phenomenon. The most recent statistics and empirical evidence show that reported violence
is increasing at all levels. Given the various awareness-raising campaigns conducted nationwide and
the increasing access to a growing and varied volume of information, some forms of violence are
reported more frequently, while others are overlooked or embraced as natural manifestations, though
it is well known that one form of violence can lead to other forms of violence.
In 2015, over 13,500 cases of various forms of neglect abuse, and exploitation (up from 11,232 cases in
2010) were registed by the National Authority for the Protection of Child Rights and Adoption
(ANPDCA). Out of all of the reported cases, most were cases of emotional abuse (1,740) and neglect
(9,625). The number of reported cases of physical abuse was 1,164. In cases of abuse and emotional
neglect, the victims were largely children aged 0 to 9 years old (7,698 children). Only 4,403 children
aged 10 to 17 were victims of abuse and emotional neglect. At the same time, and most importantly,
ANPDCA data showed that most cases of violence against children occurred in a family environment
(12,616 out of a total of 13,546 cases).
Substantial efforts are still needed to increase the level of awareness among the population and
decision-makers about violence and to persuade them that zero tolerance against any form of
violence must become not only a priority at the policy level but must become a way of life. There are
no data on abuse that leaves no traces or scars, yet they are still etched into a child’s heart and mind.

1.2. The Policy Response
In 2013, the European Commission (EC) recommended15 that all of its members should draft and
implement policies to reduce child poverty and social exclusion, using multidimensional strategies
aimed at ensuring child wellbeing and fostering equal opportunities so that all children can realize
their full potential. The Commission also recommended maintaining an appropriate balance between
universal policies, aimed at promoting the wellbeing of all children, and targeted approaches, aimed
at supporting the most disadvantaged of children, particularly children at high risk due to multiple
disadvantages such as those with special needs or disabilities, those in alternative care, Roma children,
and those living in low-income households. Such strategies for promoting the wellbeing of children
will require sustained investment in order to ensure policy continuity and allow for long-term planning
and will have to be designed on the basis of rigorous analyses of how they will affect the most
disadvantaged, while including actions to mitigate any adverse effects.
In line with these recommendations, the Government of Romania developed the National Strategy for
the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020,16 which aims to promote investment in
child development and wellbeing and to ensure respect for children’s rights, coverage of children’s
needs, and universal access to services. This national strategy was designed to be a catalyst for the
national implementation of the principles laid down in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.17
At the same time, it is based on an approach that allows for creating synergies and coherent links
with the National Reform Program and with other national strategic documents covering the next five
years, particularly those related to the social protection, education, and health sectors.
In accordance with the country’s national targets for reducing poverty and social exclusion developed
as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy, the Government of Romania has developed a National Strategy
on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020. 18 According to this national strategy, the
government has committed to putting in place a set of policies and programs by 2020 to: (i) raise at
least 580,000 more people out of relative income poverty by 2020 than in 2008; (ii) break the
intergenerational cycle of poverty; (iii) prevent the recurrence of poverty and social exclusion; and (iv)
ensure equal access to social assistance, cash transfers, and services to strengthen social cohesion.
Children who grow up in poor households face a higher risk of poverty in the future. To break the
intergenerational cycle of poverty, the government needs to adopt programs that can tackle both
child and adult poverty in the same household simultaneously. Particularly in the case of the persistent
poor and the Roma population, the various dimensions of exclusion tend to be mutually reinforcing
and perpetuated from generation to generation. The intergenerational cycle of exclusion is
perpetuated when the adults’ low educational achievement and poor health are passed on to their
children, eventually seriously limiting their chances to access the labor market. Breaking the
intergenerational cycle of poverty and exclusion will require targeted interventions designed to
address the multiple drivers of inequality.
As a response to the problem of the disproportionately high risk of poverty among children and
youths, both national strategies mentioned above made developing social services (increasing
coverage and access and improving quality) a major priority for the next phase. Providing cash
assistance to the most vulnerable families is necessary but not sufficient. It will also be necessary to
focus on preventing children from being separated from their families. This can be achieved only by

developing family support services and providing increased access to health, education, employment,
proper housing, and other public services. To this end, integrated social services should be developed
and properly financed in order to ensure the harmonization and alignment of all of the various
interventions and programs carried out both at the individual and the community level by empowered
and well-trained social workers and other professionals. Accomplishing such comprehensive reforms
will depend on the country’s capacity to coordinate many different actors, both public and private,
and central and local authorities and on the government’s ability to identify and willingness to allocate
the necessary funds to cover the costs of these reforms.
The National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 advances the following key
interventions in the area of social services:

         Ensure that public funds are available for the development of the social services sector in parallel with
         funding from the European Union.

         (Flagship Initiative #3)
         Strengthen and enhance social assistance at the community level by: (i) developing a minimum
         intervention package as a mandatory responsibility for each local authority; (ii) financing from the
         state budget a national program - Social Program Opportunity and Responsibility (SPOR) - to ensure
         that in each locality at least one full-time employee does social work, has consistent outreach tasks in
         their job description, and works one-to-one with people in vulnerable situations and their families, as
         well as providing the minimum intervention package; (iii) financing from the state budget a national
         program to train all employees with social assistance duties and to draft methodologies, guidelines,
         and tools to strengthen the implementation of case management at the level of the SPAS, especially
         in rural and small urban areas; and (iv) developing a strong system for monitoring and evaluating
         social assistance services at the community level.
         Develop integrated intervention community teams within SPOR to provide social services (in
         education, employment, healthcare, social protection, and other public services) and social
         intermediation and facilitation programs at the local level, especially in poor and marginalized areas,
         rural and urban areas, and Roma and non-Roma communities by: (i) developing clear methodologies,
         protocols, and work procedures for community-based workers and (ii) developing, in the larger
         marginalized areas, multi-functional community centers to provide integrated services, primarily
         though not exclusively to families in extreme poverty.
         (Flagship Initiative #5)

         Strengthen social services for child protection by: (i) developing and strengthening the capacity of
         community-based prevention and support services; (ii) reconsidering the ways and means (including
         cash benefits) of providing family support in order to prevent child-family separations; and (iii)
         revising the existing child protection services to enhance the quality of care provided, while reducing
         the duration of children’s stay in the public care system to the minimum necessary.
         Develop social services for vulnerable groups by: (i) increasing the financing of social services and
         improving the procedures for contracting out social services to non-government and private
         providers and (ii) strengthening the role played by the County Directorates of Social Assistance and
         Child Protection (DGASPC) in strategic planning and methodological coordination, in supporting SPAS
         at the community level, and in monitoring and evaluating service providers within the county.

The National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 focuses on
social services for children and their families as follows:
General Objective #1: Increase children’s access to quality services

 Specific              Increase service coverage at the local level
 Objectives:           Increase the quality of services provided to children
                       Increase beneficiaries’ capacity to access and use child and family services
                       Build the capacity of the public institutions involved in promoting child rights to monitor
                       and evaluate children’s rights and social circumstances

General Objective #2: Observe the rights and promote the social inclusion of children in the most
vulnerable circumstances

 Specific              Secure a minimum level of resources for children by way of a national anti-poverty program
 Objectives:           that places special emphasis on children
                       Reduce existing gaps between outcomes for rural and urban children
                       Remove attitude and environmental barriers to the rehabilitation and social reintegration of
                       children with disabilities
                       Reduce the opportunity gap between Roma and non-Roma children
                       Continue the transition from institutional child care to community-based care
                       Curb the street child phenomenon
                       Foster the social and family reintegration of children who are in conflict with the law and
                       prevent them from re-offending
                       Reduce the influence of risk factors and increase the influence of protective factors
                       regarding children’s use of drugs or other harmful substances
                       Offer adequate support to children whose parents work abroad and to their caregivers
                       Promote a healthy lifestyle among adolescents

General Objective #3: Prevent and combat any form of violence

 Specific              Promote non-violence and raise awareness of all forms of violence
 Objectives:           Reduce violence among children

General Objective #4: Encourage children’s participation in relevant decision-making

 Specific
                       Develop mechanisms to ensure children participate in the decisions that directly affect them
 Objectives:



Thus, two out of the four general objectives of the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion
of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 aim to strengthen social services for children:

 General Objective #1 sets out priorities for developing and strengthening the capacity of
  community-based prevention and support services – one of the main responsibilities of public
  local authorities – while also aiming to avoid separating children from their families and thus
  preventing new entries into the public care system. It also focuses on enhancing support for
  families in their role as primary caregivers and helping them to develop parenting skills in a non-
  stigmatizing way19 in order to prevent child-family separations.
 General Objective #2 includes a special focus on children deprived of parental care and protected
  in the special protection system as well as on children living in poverty, Roma children, children
  with disabilities, and other children in need.

2 Analyzing the
       Child Care System:
       The Research
The World Bank and UNICEF are providing technical assistance to support the MMFPSPV and the
ANPDCA in identifying the priority steps to be taken in order to move ahead with the reforms aimed
at the establishment of a good child care system.

                         Box 1: The Principles of a Good Child Protection System

     (1) The system should be child-centred: everyone involved in child protection should pursue child-
         centred working and recognise children and young people as individuals with rights, including their
         right to participation in decisions about them in line with their age and maturity.

     (2) The family is usually the best place for bringing up children and young people, but difficult
         judgments are sometimes needed in balancing the right of a child to be with their birth family with their
         right to protection from abuse and neglect.
     (3) Helping children and families involves working with them and therefore the quality of the
         relationship between the child and family and professionals directly impacts on the effectiveness of help
         given.

     (4) Early help is better for children: it minimises the period of adverse experiences and improves
         outcomes for children.

     (5) Children’s needs and circumstances are varied, so the system needs to offer them equal variety in
         its response.

     (6) Good professional practice is informed by knowledge of the latest theory and research.
     (7) Uncertainty and risk are features of child protection work: risk management can only reduce risks,
         not eliminate them.
     (8) The measure of the success of child protection systems, both local and national, is whether
         children are receiving effective help.

As part of this technical assistance, extensive research was carried out between November 2014 and
August 2015. The study titled Analyzing and Reorganizing the Child Protection System in Romania is
based on an in-depth analysis of quantitative and qualitative data on the wellbeing of children and
their families, with a particular focus on children deprived of parental care or at risk of being separated
from their family. This chapter presents the research methodology, developed by the World Bank and
UNICEF with feedback from the MMFPSPV and the ANPDCA.
In the present volume, the child protection system is defined as the set of services aimed at protecting
and promoting children’s rights, organized at various levels (local, county, and national). The child
special protection system (child public care) is the set of measures, benefits, and services aimed at

ensuring the care and development of children deprived, temporary or permanently, of parental care
or of children who cannot be left in their parents’ care, if the best interests of those children are to be
protected.



2.1. The Objectives and Expected
          Results
Goal: This study aims to analyze the current state of the child protection system in Romania and to
identify priorities for improving the quality and increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of public
care (special protection) services. In the context of operationalizing the National Strategy for the
Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 and the National Strategy on Social Inclusion
and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020, the study focuses on:
(a) the transition from institutional care to community-based services, and
(b) the provision of sustainable solutions for children separated from their parents.
In line with the European Expert Group on the Transition from Institutional to Community-Based Care
(EEG), in this report, the terms “community-based services” or “community-based care” refer to the
spectrum of services that enable children to grow up in a family environment as opposed to an
institution. “It encompasses mainstream services, such as housing, healthcare, education, employment,
culture, and leisure, which should be accessible to everyone regardless of the nature of their
impairment or the required level of support. It also refers to specialized services, such as personal
assistance for people with disabilities, respite care and others. In addition, the term includes family-
based and family-like care for children, including substitute family care and preventative measures for
early intervention and family support.”20
Objectives: To improve the method of information gathering and diagnosis related to the current
child protection system in Romania, with a special focus on children deprived of parental care or at
risk of being separated from their family.
Scope of research: The study is focused on children protected in public care and children at risk of
separation from their families.
Expected outputs:
 An analysis of the causes for separating children from their families and the mapping and analysis
  of the "source communities" (rural and urban) from where a disproportionate number of children
  are taken into public care (special protection services)
 An analysis of the circustances of the children who are beneficiaries of the child special protection
  services, with a particular focus on residential services (institutions) and placement with extended
  family members (family-type services)
 A list of actions to be taken in order to improve the quality and increase the effectiveness and
      efficiency of child care services to be discussed with partners within the central and local
      authorities in order to identify the priority steps needed to reform the child protection system.
Equal opportunities and equity: All project activities associated with the study were designed and
implemented for the equal benefit of girls and boys and women and men. Project staff and experts
have been treated equally, regardless of their sex, ethnicity, or other characteristics.

Thus, this study provides useful analysis to inform this new wave of reforms aimed at developing a
good child protection system, centered on children’s rights and promoting the best interest of the
child. In line with the recommendations of the 2010 UNICEF study for Central and Eastern Europe and
the Commonwealth of Independent Countries, this reform wave could aim to ensure “permanency”21
for the children in public care (special protection), which means establishing family connections and

placement options that will provide children with a lifetime of commitment, continuity of care, a sense
of belonging, and a legal and social status that goes beyond their temporary foster care placements.
According to the approach of the study, the research questions were organized in three groups
corresponding to these three phases: before entering public care, within public care, and leaving
public care.

 BEFORE ENTERING PUBLIC CARE (IN SPECIAL PROTECTION SERVICES)

 Research questions:
  What causes children to be separated from their families? To what extent are the current data
   on these causes22 recorded in a disaggregated manner in order for them to be fully understood
   and effectively addressed?
  What has been done to reduce the risk of child separation from the family at the community
   level? To what extent were these interventions specifically related to a given cause of separation
   or vulnerability?
  What authority takes the final decision to put a child in public care (special protection)? To what
   extent does this differ depending on the cause of the separation or vulnerability?
  Overall, what are the main bottlenecks encountered in trying to address the causes of child-
   family separation? The analysis includes determinants related to the enabling environment (such
   as policies, laws, the budget, and social norms), the supply and quality of services (such as the
   availability of services, the adequacy of staff, the accessibility of services, and quality standards),
   and demand (such as financial, cultural, and individual or family barriers).

 WITHIN PUBLIC CARE

 Research questions:
  What is the profile of children in public care by type of special protection service according to
   their gender, age, ethnicity, special needs and county of origin?
  What is the current practice for developing and implementing Individualized Protection Plans
   (PIP) for children in public care (special protection), as analyzed by category of children, by type
   of PIP, and by county?
  What factors (bottlenecks) prevent the implementation of the recommendations contained in
   the PIP?
  To what extent are PIPs effectively implemented?
  What is the average length of stay in public care, by category of children, by type of PIP, by type
   of service, and by county?

 LEAVING PUBLIC CARE

 Research questions:
  Overall, what are the bottlenecks to ensuring that children can safely and sustainably leave
    public care? The study analyzes determinants related to the enabling environment (such as
    policies, laws, the budget, and social norms), the supply and quality of services (such as the
    availability of services, the adequacy of staff, the accessibility of services, and quality standards),
    and demand (such as financial, cultural, and individual or family barriers).




22
  Currently, the ANPDCA collects data on these causes using a quarterly data sheet/form (fișă trimestrială), but other
instruments are also used for demonstration purposes or for testing in a particular geographic region.

                                                                                                                   27
2.3. Data and Method
This report puts data on children in public care (special protection system) in Romania under the
microscope. To provide answers to the research questions, the study team collected quantitative and
qualitative data from various different sources as presented in Figure 4.
Child Monitoring and Tracking Information System (CMTIS)
The Child Monitoring and Tracking Information System (CMTIS) is the management information
system of the child protection system in Romania.23 The CMTIS is a relational database system (in
MYSQL). The system was developed in 2003 and has not been upgraded since.24 The structural design
of the CMTIS involves hosting the database on a server in Bucharest and making it accessible to users
via web-based connections. It is presently connected via a VPN to only 30 counties. To be able to
access the CMTIS, users (the DGASPCs at the county level and for Bucharest at the sector level) need
to have a basic working knowledge of SQL.25 This has limited the number of counties who actively use
the system, although according to the current regulations: “the general/ executive director of the
DGASPC at the county/ sector level has a formal obligation to designate the people responsible for
entering into the CMTIS the data on the children registered with the DGASPC” and, for the designated
people, “it is mandatory to provide the required training” so they can perform such duties
accordingly.26
Only about 20 counties use the CMTIS in their daily activities, while the other DGASPCs have
developed alternative ICT systems (which are not interconnected and differ from one county to
another).27 According to the survey of case managers that was conducted for this study, 26 percent of
all case managers have no knowledge of the CMTIS, and only 27 percent reported having used the
system between 2010 and 2015.
Those counties that are not currently connected to the CMTIS are not able to enter in the database
the details of the children who are in their protection system records. Even for those DGASPCs that are
connected to the CMTIS, there is no structured plan to ensure the accuracy of the local data that they
upload or the consistency of that data and the reports that are uploaded to the CMTIS. As a result, the
data in the CMTIS are of rather poor quality and have limited coverage.
The list of counties included in data collection (based on CMTIS data) is presented in Annex 6 Table 1.
The territorial coverage of the quantitative data is discussed below.




23
  Within the ANPDCA, ICT-related responsibilities are assigned to two staff members (one for child protection and one
for adoption) who also have other non-ICT responsibilities. The Romanian Office for Adoptions (currently, part of the
ANPDCA) has a separate ICT system that is not connected to the CMTIS. There is no inter-connectivity between the
CMTIS and the systems of other institutions.
24
     As a result, the CMTIS has no available source code and no disaster recovery system.
25
 Structured Query Language - a specific language used in programming and designed for creating, using and
managing data held in a relational database management system.
26
  Currently, there is no structured training on SQL (or on operating the CMTIS) available to users, and there are no plans
to extend the use of the system to those counties that are not currently connected. The quotation is from Order
286/2006 for the approval of the methodological norms regarding the development of Individualized Protection Plans.
27
  The ANPDCA does not keep a register of the different software applications used by the DGASPCs at the county level.
There are no standards to guide the development of such software.

  RECOMMENDATION
  A functional child monitoring and tracking information system is vital for ensuring an efficient child
  protection system. This management information system should be child-centerd, should have national
  coverage, should include clear procedures to ensure the consistency and accuracy of data between the
  county and national levels, should be available and user friendly to enable all case managers and
  professionals working with children and their families to use it in their daily activities, and should be
  accompanied by a training plan for all types of users.
  Also, the inter-connectivity between this management information system (MIS) and other national databases
  and the databases of other institutions should be ensured.




Source Communities
In the first phase, the CMTIS (Child Monitoring and Tracking Information System) was used in order to
identify and analyze the "source communities" (rural and urban). By definition, "source communities"
(rural and urban) are areas at the sub-locality level from where a significantly larger number of
children enter public care than from other communities. Sub-locality areas may refer to a
neighborhood, or a street, or a group of houses and/or blocks in urban areas and an entire village, a
hamlet, or just a group of houses in rural areas.
The Source communities are discussed in Chapter 3.2.5.3 Neighborhood/Community Characteristics:
Source communities. At a later stage, a set of 60 rural source communities and five urban source
communities were randomly selected for in-depth case studies.
Study in the Rural Source Communities
Out of all of the identified source communities, the team selected 60 rural localities (communes)
within which they found 1,191 mothers with one or more children in public care in the CMTIS. At the
time when the fieldwork was conducted, only in 736 households was either the mother (in 455 cases)
or a caregiver (in 281 cases) of the children actually identified. The remaining 455 addresses were not
used because in 445 cases the families of children in public care no longer lived in the commune, in
eight cases the households in the commune no longer included either the biological mother or the
children’s caretaker, and in two cases the biological mother was present in the household but refused
to answer the interviewer’s questions.
However, 139 additional women who had children in public care were found and interviewed in the
same communities (137 cases), even though they had not been reported in the CMTIS. These
additional data are provided in Annex 1 (A 1.1).
In addition to the household survey, 85 social workers or people with social assistance responsibilities
at the SPAS level from the same 60 rural communes with source communities were interviewed for the
survey.
The research tools used to study these rural source communities were developed by the World Bank
in collaboration with UNICEF and are presented in Annexes A 1.2 and A 1.3. Data collection was
conducted by the Metro Media Transilvania company in July-August 2015.
Case Studies in Urban Source Communities
At the same time, five case studies were carried out in urban source communities from five cities,
namely Arad, Bacău, Bârlad, Craiova, and Piatra Neamţ. These case studies included a mapping of the
home addresses of mothers with children in public care and a total of 38 interviews with specialists
and parents of children at risk of separation from their families or parents of children protected in
public care. Data collection was carried out by the Metro Media Transilvania company during April-
June 2015. More details are available in Annex 2.

Analysis of Case Files of Children in Public Care
This study considers the following types of special protection services:
       (1) Family-type services: (1a) Placement with a relative up to the 4th degree; (1a) Placement with
           other families/people and (1c) Placement with foster parents.
       (2) Residential services: (2a) Apartments; (2b) Small group homes28 for children with disabilities,
           and for children without disabilities, respectively; (2c) Placement centers grouped into:29 (2c-
           1) Placement centers taken over from MEN (Ministry of National Education) (former
           dormitories of special schools), which can be the old/classical type 30 or
           restructured/modulated31; (2c-2) Classical placement centers (other than MEN centers), which
           can be for children with disabilities and for children without disabilities, respectively; (2c-3)
           Modulated placement centers (other than MEN centers), which can be for children with
           disabilities, and for children without disabilities, respectively.
       (3) Other services, such as maternal centers, emergency reception centers, guardianship,
           specialized supervision, day and night shelters are, by convention, outside the scope of the
           research.32
The team extracted from the CMTIS a random sample of 9,110 children in public care. In order to
enable an analysis by the type of child special protection service provided, the sample was designed
to consist of sub-samples of about 1,000 children randomly selected for each type of the services
listed above. Another sub-sample of about 1,000 children in public care was also randomly selected
from the rural source communities. In addition, three other sub-samples of over 500 cases each were
selected consisting of children aged 0 to 2 years, children with disabilities, and children whose
Individualized Protection Plan (PIP) goal was adoption.
Based on the data collected from the children’s case files, a data sheet/form for each child was filled in
(Annex A 3.2.). The data were collected by more than 900 representatives of all DGASPCs across the
country (Annex A 3.1. Table 1), most of whom were inspectors, social workers, or counselors (Annex A
3.1. Figure 1). A World Bank team comprising Bogdan Corad, Cătălina Iamandi-Cioinaru, and Andreea
Trocea provided them with training and constant support.
This data collection exercise took place in November and December of 2014. After the research team
cleaned and validated the data, only 6,493 forms were included in the analysis (Table 3). The other
questionnaires were excluded because the children were not eligible for the study, because the
children's case files were not available, or because of partial non-responses on different variables
relevant for weighting.
Table 3 shows that out of all 9,110 selected cases, only 71.3 percent (or 6,493) had a corresponding
valid form. Sampling errors represented less than 1 percent.
Although the sample was extracted from the CMTIS in November 2014, about 16 percent of the cases
were out of scope (not eligible for the study), either because they were using special protection
services that were not being analyzed by the study (such as emergency reception centers, shelters for
homeless children, or maternal centers), or because they had left the system. In addition, about 2
percent of the sampled children's case files were not available. Therefore, one in every five or six active

  According to HHC (2012), a small group home is a residential unit organized based on a family model, with living
room, kitchen and bathroom.
29
     The classification of each placement center by type was made by the ANPDCA together with the DGASPCs.
30
  According to HHC (2012), an “old-type,” “traditional,” or “classical” institution refers to a residential center with over 12
children/young people, with at least four children/young people in a bedroom, and with shared bathrooms for the
residents living on the same floor.
31
  According to HHC (2012), a “refurbished,” “restructured,” or “modulated” institution refers to a residential center with
over 12 children/young people, organized in units, with each unit typically consisting of a bedroom, a living room and a
bathroom.
32
  In other words, children in the study sample who received only these services were not included in the analysis so they
are, by convention, “cases outside the scope” of the research (see Annex 6 Table 1).

residential or family-type). Thus, the quality of data from CMTIS used as sampling framework was
rather limited.

In addition, the share of forms excluded due to partial non-responses was as high as 11 percent of the
sample. Given the training and continuous assistance available to the staff of the DGASPCs who
completed the forms, this high share of incomplete forms seems to have been due mainly to the fact
that the information contained in the children's case files is focused on administrative requirements
rather than on the children's situation, circumstances, opinions, experiences, or history.
In fact, the survey of case managers showed that they regard children's case files as an administrative
task rather than a working tool. In 73 percent of cases, the case files were not even available at the
DGASPC premises. Children’s case files are dispersed in various buildings and kept by different people,
in different offices. There is no uniform procedure for organizing, keeping, or archiving these files. As a
result, case managers generally stated that finding the case file for a child in the sample required, on
average, a full working day. However, while 70 percent of case managers declared that they had
participated in the data collection activities, our data show that only about 10 percent of all forms
were filled in by a case manager or a case responsible officer (see Annex 3, A 3.1. Figure 1 and A 3.1.
Table 1).33
Adoption Forms
For all children in public care whose Individualized Protection Plan (PIP) goal was adoption at the time
of the research (November-December 2014), the DGASPC staff were supposed to fill in an adoption
form (see Annex A 3.3). The separation between the child protection and adoption departments within
the DGASPCs led to a 90 percent rate of completion of the adoption forms (see Chapter 3.4.2 on

33
  Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that the job title of the DGASPC specialists who filled in the forms was identified
based on an open question. Hence, in some counties, the specialists who declared themselves to be social workers or
inspectors or counselors may also have been undeclared case managers or case responsible officers.

32
adoption). The problem was mainly caused by the fact that, once the adoption procedure is initiated,
the child's case file is transferred from the child protection department to the adoption department.
As a result, the staff of the child protection department have limited access to the file, and only some
staff within the adoption departments agreed to participate in the study.
In total, 914 adoption forms were filled in for 913 children (see Annex A.3.1 Table 2).34 While some
DGASPC staff completed adoption forms only for the children who were in the system at the time
when the study was carried out (November-December 2014), others also filled in forms for those who
had left the system. Thus, the analysis covers 685 valid forms (75 percent), completed for children who
were still in public care and had a PIP whose goal was adoption. A share of 17 percent of the forms
were excluded from the analysis due to the partial non-responses on the general questionnaire (the
child form) for a set of variables relevant for weighting. The other 83 forms (9 percent) were excluded
from the analysis because they were filled in for children who had left the system.
Two hundred and fifty two DGASPC specialists took part in filling in the adoption forms, most of them
as inspectors or counselors (or “referent” which is another Romanian job title for a specialist or
counselor) (Annex A 3.1 Figure 2). The data analysis and the key findings are presented in Chapter
3.4.2. Too Few Adoptions.
Territorial Coverage of the Quantitative Data
Given the characteristics of the CMTIS discussed above, most of the data used in the case file survey
were derived from 24 counties. Thus, 82 percent of the entire sample (9,110 cases) and 97 percent of
the valid forms (6,493 cases) were from those counties, as shown in Annex 6 Table 1. In addition, the
quality of data varied widely across counties, with only eight counties having at least 90 percent valid
forms, namely Constanţa, Hunedoara, Mehedinţi, Olt, Satu Mare, Suceava, Vâlcea, and Vrancea.
As expected, the counties that use the CMTIS only occasionally or not at all had very low rates of valid
forms, since in their cases, the children selected in the sample were more likely to not be in the system
or to have files that lacked the relevant data.
Weighting and Extending Data from Children’s Case Files
The data from children’s case files analyzed in this report, including those in the adoption forms, were
weighted. As already mentioned, the data were previously cleaned and validated. Imputation was not
used on the non-responses, as these were considered relevant for the quality of the information in
children’s case files, on which decisions regarding the prevention services plan and the Individualized
Protection Plan (PIP) for each child are based. The data were weighted based on the national
distribution of children in the special protection system, by: county, type of special protection service
(according to the categories presented above), children’s age groups, and children with and without
disabilities. Based on this weighting, coefficients for extending the sample data were established.
Therefore, the data presented in this report are representative of the entire population of children in
public care (special protection system) in Romania.
Because of the rounding of the last decimal part of the extension coefficients to four decimals, there
are sometimes small differences (about 1 percent) between some of the total sums estimated in the
different tables and figures and the corresponding sums resulting from the computation.
Focus Groups with Professionals and Children in Public Care
A total of 16 regional focus group discussions were held by the Metro Media Transilvania company
between April and June 2015 (see Annex 4). Eight focus groups were conducted with professionals
working in the child protection system and an additional eight focus groups involved children in
public care, including children with disabilities.

  For one child, two forms were completed because the adoption procedure was renewed following a revoking of the
decision to entrust the child for adoption.

Survey of Case Managers
The ANPDCA provided the study team with a database of all case managers working in child
protection services in Romania,35 namely 1,030 people. A random sample of 800 case managers was
selected, 793 of whom participated in a survey carried out by the Metro Media Transilvania company
in April-June 2015. The questionnaire used in the survey was developed by the UNICEF and World
Bank team (see Annex 5).
Data Processing
A substantial effort was needed to clean, validate, and analyze all of the quantitative and qualitative
data of to ensure the highest quality standards. The process of data cleaning involved six researchers
working for three months. This cleaning process was difficult because of the non-standardized
working practices at the DGASPC level as well as the different understanding and interpretation of the
legislation among DGASPCs.
In total, the following data were analyzed: (i) almost 2,000 variables from the database of children’s
case files (830 initial variables and over 1,000 newly created variables); (ii) over 1,000 variables from
the database of adoption forms (450 initial variables and over 600 newly created variables); and (iii)
almost 2,000 pages of transcripts (805 pages of focus group information and 1,120 pages of interview
information).

         The Findings
Executive Summary
The current study examines the situation of children in public care in Romania and of their families
and focuses on three phases: before entering the protection system, the period within the system and
leaving the system.


3.1 Children in Public Care and their Families
This discussion of the main characteristics of the children in public care and of their families is drawn
mainly from the information on the representative sample of children extracted from the CMTIS in
November 2014. In the case of these children’s mothers, additional information was gathered from the
Household Survey in Rural Source Communities.
Profile of Children in Public Care
The children in public care in Romania (either in institutions or in alternative family-based care) are
girls and boys of all ages between 0 and 26 years old (and over). Boys constitute a slightly higher
share of children in care than girls (53 percent versus 47 percent). Out of all children placed in public
care, more than half (56 percent) are aged between 10 and 17 years. Young people aged 18 years or
older who are full-time students (or in other special circumstances) are entitled to protection in a
foster home or in residential care until they turn 26 years old. This group accounts for a consistent 12
percent share.
Children in public care come from all counties in Romania, 43 percent from rural areas and 56 percent
from urban areas. Children from all ethnic groups are found in the child protection system, but their
distribution by ethnicity differs considerably from that of the general young population. The share of
children with undeclared ethnicity is more than three times higher in the child protection system than
among the general population aged 0 to 29 years (31.3 percent versus 9 percent, according to the
2011 census data). The proportion of Roma children is double the general rate (10.3 percent versus 5.3
percent), while that of Romanians is substantially lower (54 percent versus 79.1 percent).
Children with disabilities represent a significant proportion (almost 29 percent) of all children in public
care. The proportion of children with disabilities increases incrementally from about 6 percent of
infants under the age of 1 year to over 43 percent of young people aged 18 to 26 years (and over).
The Children’s Families
Contrary to common belief, most children placed in public care are not orphans. Over 90 percent of all
children in public care have a mother who is alive and known. Therefore, most children in the special

36
protection system are social rather than biological orphans. Their mothers tend to be young, with an
average age of 36.3 years compared to the average age of 42.1 years for the national female
population. They gave birth at an earlier age than the general population, at an average 23.4 years old
versus 27.8 for all Romania mothers. This average is even lower for mothers from rural areas and for
Roma mothers.
The circumstances of these mothers are poorly documented in their children's files, with only sparse
information about their marital, health, education, and employment status. However, the available
data indicate that many of these mothers have little if any education, are disconnected from the labor
market, have undeclared marital status, and suffer from mental health problems and/or from a
physical disability. Therefore, any plan to reunite these children with their mothers will require
substantial efforts and consistent support not only from child protection professionals but also from
other sectors to ensure that the family environment is stable and fosters the child’s development.
There was even less information in the children's files on their fathers’ circumstances than on those of
their mothers, but only 48 percent of children in public care appear to have fathers who are alive and
known. Only for very few children does the father seem to be in a position to provide them with a
decent life, though not necessarily a stable family environment.
About one-third of the children (32 percent) come from single-mother families where no information
is available about the father. Another third (31 percent) come from typical nuclear families, including a
mother and a father and possibly other children. The last third (37 percent) come from a variety of
atypical families, the most common of which are: (i) a single-mother living with another adult (usually
the grandmother) who takes care of the child (9 percent) and (ii) a couple living together with the
child in a multigenerational household, in which an adult (usually a grandparent) takes care of the
child (8 percent). The pattern of unstable relationships, divorce, and separation means that, before
entering the system, 28 percent of the children depended on a caregiver other than their parents.
Routes Followed by Children before Entering Public Care
There are three routes by which most children in public care enter the system. The first category
relates to the occurrence of some disruptive event that results in the child being placed in the child
special protection system. This is the case for about 65 percent of children in public care. In the
second category, children come into care via other institutions, usually when they are relinquished in a
hospital maternity ward at birth. This applies to more than 31 percent of children in public care.
Children in the third category enter care because their family is homeless or because the children have
been relinquished. This route is rare, comprising just over 3 percent of all children in public care. This
highlights the need for a national program of social housing for the most vulnerable, especially single-
mothers with children, as well as community-based preventive and support services for children and
their families.
Young Age of Most Children in Public Care
More than one-third (35 percent) of children in public care went into the system before they reached
their first birthday. An additional 17 percent were only between 1 and 2 years old when they entered
the system. Therefore, reducing new entries into the system will be strongly dependent on reducing
the number of children relinquished in medical institutions, especially just after birth.
Children’s Development Status before Entering the Child Protection System
When children first enter the child special protection system, many face serious health problems, have
little education, either have no memories of their family or have only distressing memories, and
display risky behaviors. All of these factors are critical for understanding the child's history,
development status, and specific needs.
Health. There is no procedure for documenting children's development status at the point when they
enter the child protection system so their files often lack information on their height, weight,
vaccinations, level of nourishment, and baseline psychological state. However, the available data
indicate that many children in care are characterized by the so-called “double burden of disease,”
which is the coexistence of over-nutrition and obesity with under-nutrition, as well as disabilities and

                                                                                                       37
various other chronic diseases. The study found that one in every ten children had signs of
malnourishment or undernourishment, which is associated with low resistance to infections and
stunted growth. About 11 percent of children in public care have had a disability since their arrival in
the protection system. Fewer than half of the children had been given a baseline psychological
evaluation, but for those who had, the evaluations showed that many of them had various emotional,
cognitive, behavioral, psycho-physiological, personality and interpersonal relationship issues. In
addition, many children had not had the appropriate vaccines for their age.
Identity documents. Over 15 percent of children in public care either had no identity papers upon entry
(8 percent) or their case files did not contain any information in this regard. This is an issue because
children who lack identity papers are not eligible for social benefits and services.
Education. Of all children in care, only about half (46 to 64 percent) of each age cohort were attending
school without being at risk of dropping out. The others were either out of school (had never been in
school or were dropouts) or were at risk of dropping out. Of all of the children who had ever attended
school, about 3 to 5 percent in each age cohort were in a special school, while the large majority of
them were in a mainstream school. The school dropout rate was around 9 percent among children
who were aged 11 to 17 years when they entered the system, and the rate was higher for children
with disabilities (15 percent) and Roma children (19 percent). Also, among the same cohort, the
proportion of children who had never attended school before entering the child protection system
was higher among Roma children (12 percent) and reached over 23 percent of children with
disabilities (versus the average of 7 percent).
Relationship with family of origin. Almost 40 percent of all children in public care either have no
memories of their family or have only distressing memories. Although nearly all children knew their
main caretaker, only 39 percent of them had a “good” relationship with that person, whereas for 33
percent of them, the relationship was “problematic.” The relationship with the parents or caretaker
does not vary according to child's age, gender, ethnicity, or health status, but it does vary depending
on the type of the family of origin and the route via which the child arrived in the protection system.
Children with one or more siblings who either live together or are placed in public care are
considerably more likely than average to have a problematic relationship with their parents or
caretaker. The proportion of children with problematic relationships increases from 25 percent of
children with no siblings to 40 percent of children living together with siblings or with two or more
siblings in public care. The best relationships seem to have been where children came from extended
families or where their main caretaker was a relative, usually a grandparent.
Children’s Risky Behavior. Of children who were between 7 and 17 years old when they joined the
protection system, 14 percent had already been exposed to one or more type of risky behavior before
entering the system. Running away from home was the most common, with some children running
away repeatedly before entering the system. Risky behavior is more frequent among adolescents,
boys, and children from urban areas, particularly those from families with no support from a kinship
network, as well as those with older mothers or parents (those aged over 40 years at the time of the
child's entry). Children who had a problematic relationship with their parents were five times more
likely to have been exposed to risky behavior than children with good relationships with their family of
origin (29 percent versus 6 percent). The majority of children who had been exposed to risky behavior
arrived in the system either through the street routes or, in the case of older parents, directly from
their families.
3.2 Entering Public Care in Romania: the Causes of Separation
The study found that there are many different reasons why children enter the child special protection
system. The children’s case files often gave “poverty” as the sole reason when in fact the separation
from their families was due to a much more complex mixture of vulnerabilities within the family, as
revealed by the study’s other data collection activities. These vulnerabilities included extreme poverty,
parental unemployment, poor quality housing or homelessness, poor school attendance or dropout,
poor parenting, domestic violence, a high risk of child neglect and abuse (sometimes associated with
parental alcohol abuse), young or single parenthood, unstable marriages, low expectations and/or
self-esteem, and learned helplessness. In addition, significant life events may happen, such as the

38
death of a parent, a serious accident, the imprisonment of a parent, or the destruction of a home by
fire, which affect children both directly and indirectly, while presenting parents with practical and
emotional problems that diminish further their capacity to meet their children's needs.
Broadly, the analysis revealed three main categories of reasons why children are separated from their
families and taken into the protection system: (i) unfortunate life events such as the death or
institutionalization of their parent(s); (ii) the parents’ behavior or attitudes that are directly or indirectly
harmful to their child; and (iii) structural causes such as poverty, lack of services, and unstable housing.
The three categories are not mutually exclusive as some causes may fall under two categories, but
generally they each require specific responses. The unfortunate life events usually require long-term
mitigation measures, while the harmful behavior and attitudes of parents require targeted information,
education, and counseling programs, intensive support and monitoring, and, when needed, the
enforcement of existing regulations. The structural causes require the improvement or development of
policies and awareness campaigns aimed at the entire population and not just the at-risk population.
Unfortunate Life Events
The death of one or both parents is the main cause of separation for 6 percent of children in public
care. Another 6 percent of children in public care have one or both parents in detention, and affected
families confirmed in the study that the imprisonment either of the main income earner or caretaker
led to severe hardship and finally to the decision of the child's institutionalization.
Children with parents who are in social or medical institutions represent 0.5 percent of all children in
public care. Most of these children were younger than 3 years old when they entered the system and a
disproportionately high percentage were underweight, had disabilities, and/or were the children of
teenage or young mothers with no support from their kinship network.
The intergenerational cycle of institutionalization of children is a major concern. Although this
phenomenon may seem insignificant in statistical terms, it is much more significant when defined as
the proportion of affected children in public care. Some specialists believe that at least 50 percent of
the young people who leave the system send their own children back into the system.
Child Neglect, Abuse, and Exploitation
Thirty-two percent of children in public care were separated from their family due to neglect, abuse,
exploitation, and other forms of violence, or a combination thereof. Overall, the case files of 51
percent of children in public care record some evidence of neglect, abuse, or exploitation. This
proportion rises to 60 percent if those babies relinquished immediately after birth in maternity
hospitals are not considered, of whom 54 percent faced various forms of neglect, 15 percent were
abused, and 4 percent experienced exploitation. Thus, one in every seven children in care was
maltreated in various ways before entering the child protection system.
The adverse effects of neglect and abuse on the child are similar irrespective of the causes and involve
feelings of betrayal, guilt, loneliness, and a lack of self-esteem. Nonetheless, each child’s long-term
care plan should be customized according to their specific experiences, circumstances, and personality.
There is also a need to improve the way in which child neglect, abuse, and exploitation is understood,
categorized, and recorded in children's case files.
Individual (Parental) Risk Factors
A large body of literature has shown that risk factors associated with abuse and neglect in families
involved with child protection services include certain characteristics and types of behavior by parents.
These include alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, disability, mental health problems,
behavioral problems, early childbearing, and promiscuous and/or criminal behavior. These are all
individual-level risk factors that can be targeted by both population-based policies and targeted
interventions.
Many children in care have come from dysfunctional families, which in this study are defined as
families in which one or more of the following events have occurred: divorce, separation, infidelity,
parental disinterest, desertion of family, unacknowledged paternity, and birth out of wedlock.


                                                                                                            39
Seventeen percent of children in public care were part of such a dysfunctional family when they
entered the child special protection system.
Disability
Out of all children in public care, 11 percent have had a disability (physical and/or mental health
problems) since before entering the system. This includes children with physical disabilities,
developmental delays, special educational needs, and behavioral problems, as well as premature
and/or underweight infants. Almost one-third of those aged over 3 years old have a disability so
severe that they are not self-sufficient.
Children with disabilities seem to be placed in the protection service not on the grounds of neglect,
abuse, or unfortunate events but because the tradition of placing children with disabilities in
institutions continues in Romania. However, the qualitative study showed the lack of medical,
rehabilitation and support services for people with disabilities (both children and adults) also played a
big role in parents’ decision to let their children go into the protection service, particularly in the case
of children with severe disabilities.
The link between childhood disorders and child abuse and neglect is not only controversial but also
difficult to assess based on a rigorous methodology. Nevertheless, some research has suggested that
children with a physical and/or mental disability can be at a higher risk of abuse and neglect than
healthy children. The qualitative study showed that some parents neglected their children with
disabilities because they were not able to understand and meet their children's needs, mainly because
of prejudice and lack of education. In the absence of professional support and guidance, poorly
educated parents often find it very difficult to cope with a child with disabilities, especially if they have
other children as well.
Structural Risk Factors
There are several kinds of structural factors that increase the risk of children being taken from their
families into the special protection system. The first type encompasses cultural values and traditions,
social inertia related to the pre-1989 situation, economic poverty, and weak governance, including
corruption. Thus, the social context within which the family lives influences the likelihood of child
abuse or neglect and the associated individual-level risk factors.
The second type of structural risk is the absence of adequate preventive or early intervention services
at the community level to avoid abuse, and family break-down. These services could also act as
referral systems for cases of neglect, abuse, or domestic violence.
The third structural risk is poverty. While poverty is overused in the children's case files as an
explanation for the separation of children from their families, it is also rarely documented in the files
because it is taken for granted. The available data indicate that only 4 percent of children in care come
from non-poor households (with a monthly income per capita higher than 400 lei), and an additional 6
percent are at risk of poverty (relative poverty), while the other 90 percent are poor or extremely poor.
This is a very strong result, albeit based on very weak data.
Another key structural risk factor is unstable family accommodation, home evictions and
homelessness. Most children in the special protection system come from households living in only one
or two rooms in very poor and overcrowded conditions. The eligibility criteria for social housing are
rather lax and are not applied consistently across localities. Out of all social housing units in urban
areas, only 57 percent are rented to low-income families.
A final structural risk factor is being located in a community that has a disproportionate number of
children in the child special protection system – the "source communities" of this study’s analysis.
Fourteen percent of children in public care come from these source communities. Based on the CMTIS
data, the majority of them are from rural areas (60 percent), from all counties but with a massive over-
representation of Brașov, Constanța, Covasna, Sibiu, Vâlcea, and Vaslui. Child protection professionals
in the DGASPCs described the source communities as marginalized, consisting of improvised houses
or former dormitories, often not connected to utilities, with very poor roads, and deficient in basic
social services.

3.3. In Public Care
This section discusses the key issues related to life within the child special protection system.
Moving from Family to Public Care
There are three main ways in which the DGASPC can be informed about a child who may need to be
taken into the protection system: (i) the SPAS (responsible for 24 percent of total entries); (ii) other
institutions, mostly maternity wards or neonatal units (30 percent); and (iii) the child’s family (28
percent of total entries). In addition, the DGASPC can take its own initiatives, and notifications can be
made by other people and also by the children themselves.
When it comes to removing the child from the family, there are clear methodological norms. The
decision to separate a child from the family may be taken: (i) by the DGASPC director; (ii) by a court;
(iii) by the Child Protection Commission (CPC); or (iv) based on a Presidential Ordinance if there is an
emergency intervention. Based on the initial assessment, the DGASPC multidisciplinary team will
suggest a solution for the child’s care. If there is an imminent risk, especially in cases of child abuse,
the team will suggest an immediate placement, and the DGASPC director will issue a decision in this
respect. If the parents or caretakers object to this, the file is sent to court in an expedited manner in
order to get a Presidential Ordinance based on which DGASPC representatives can remove the child
from the family and place him or her in public care.
Out of all entries into the child protection system (as of November-December 2014), most had no
imminent risk and entered the system with a CPC decision or a court ruling (52 percent), while about
42 percent were high-risk cases with an emergency placement ruled by the DGASPC director and, very
seldom, through a Presidential Ordinance. However, a different pattern prevailed between 2010 and
2014 when most entries (54 percent) were emergency placements, usually through a decision of the
DGASPC director, and in only 42 percent of the cases was there a CPC decision or a court ruling.
Entries with parental consent (decided by the CPC) increased, whereas those without the parents’
consent (ruled by the Courts) decreased.
The main problem highlighted by the DGASPC specialists is not being able to provide support fast
enough to children once they have been identified. Even in emergency cases (such as those involving
abuse or abandonment), the “emergency” might take more than two months during which the child is
left with the abusing parent or adult and with no external support.
All Types of Children in All Categories of Care
The child protection system cares for children within residential institutions as well as in family-type
services. The residential centers include placement centers, whether the old-type or the restructured
type, small group homes, or apartments. The family-type services include placements with the child’s
relatives, with other families, or with foster parents.
Referring to their most recent admission to the system (as some children are admitted and leave
several times during their childhood), 52 percent of children in the system were placed in family-type
services, 46 percent in residential-type services, and 1 percent received other types of services, such as
counseling or recovery day care centers. The children in the protection service as of November-
December 2014 may have been admitted into the system at any time between 1989 and 2014. Since
the structure of the service recently underwent major changes, the manner in which the children were
placed was also altered. As a result, the children who were admitted to the system during 2013 and
2014 were more likely than their predecessors to be placed, at least initially, in family-type services (65
percent) than in residential institutions (34 percent).
Closing down the old-style/classical institutions is a priority for the government as part of the
deinstitutionalization process targeted by the new wave of reform in the child protection sector. In
November 2014, there were 111 such old placement centers all over the country. Speeding up the
process by which all classical residential institutions for children will be closed down is a priority
objective in both the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020
and the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020.


                                                                                                        41
The First Individualized Protection Plan (PIP)
According to Romanian law, as soon as a child has been referred to the child protection system, the
case manager must develop an Individualized Protection Plan (PIP) for the child. Depending on the
case in question, the PIP may have one of the following goals: (i) reintegrating the child within their
family of origin; (ii) facilitating and supporting the socio-professional integration of young adults over
18 years old who are about to leave the child protection system; or (iii) pursuing a domestic adoption.
Reintegration within the family is the main goal chosen for all categories of children. The proportion
of children for whom the goal was reintegration with their families increased from 69 percent in 2005
to 92 percent in 2014 (among those who entered the protection system between 2005 and 2014).
Adoption was the goal for 9 to 10 percent of the children, but this suddenly dropped to 3 percent
after Law 273/2004 on adoption was updated in 2014.
Adoption is most likely to be chosen as the goal for children who were under 1 year old when they
entered the system, children with no extended family support, children with teenage mothers, and
those who were relinquished in health units. Children who are less likely to be given the goal of
adoption are those with disabilities, those aged between 7 and 17 with behavioral disorders, and
those with siblings in the system.
According to the DGASPC experts, the goal chosen in the initial PIP is adequate and relevant for
almost three-quarters of the children in the protection system. However, this is not usually the case for
children with behavioral disorders and children with disabilities. The system does not provide children
with behavioral disorders with the most appropriate services to prepare them for independent life or
to be reintegrated within their families. For children with disabilities, especially for those with severe
disabilities, the experts acknowledge that long-term solutions are needed. If no other permanent
solution is possible, then these children should be allowed to go on living in their small group homes
after they come of age (18 years old).
Too Much Time Spent in the System
According to the UN guidelines regarding child alternative care: “Removal of a child from the care of
the family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should, whenever possible, be temporary
and for the shortest possible duration.” On average, a child spends 7.5 years in the Romanian
protection system. Children with extended families (especially grandparents) have the shortest stays
(6.2 years), while children from single-parent families, especially single-mothers, have the longest (8.35
years). Children with disabilities, especially severe disabilities, and children with parents who have
disabilities and/or mental health problems spend longer in the system than the average.
The study analyzed the length of time that children spent in the system by age of entry into the
system and by current age (as of November-December 2014). This analysis showed that: (i) in all age
groups, there was a significant percentage of children who had entered the system when they were
less than 1 year old (usually after they were relinquished in the maternity ward) and (ii) in all age
groups, the average length of stay dropped to half or even one-third for children who had entered the
system at the age of 3 or older.
As a result, the study found that one in every five children aged between 15 and 26 who were in the
system as of November-December 2014 had spent their entire lives in the system, and almost one in
every three had spent 90 percent of their lives. Therefore, the “system” is the only family they know.
This shows that there is an urgent need to ensure that they are taught independent life skills and
given solid support as they transition into society.
Children’s Opinions about the Protection System
Two out of every three children in the special protection system are not consulted about their
opinions and preferences. The one-third who were consulted were satisfied with the material and
housing conditions in the protection system, which were even better than at home in most cases. The
children confessed that, although they want to keep in touch with their natural family, they would only
wish to go back to them if the violence and alcohol and drug consumption would stop and if the
family’s living conditions were good.

42
At the same time, the children taking part in the focus group discussions organized for the present
study, spoke of their need for affection, understanding, and communication from the main carers and
staff. Their primary need is to have their voice heard, to have somebody they can talk to, a person to
whom they can tell anything and whom they can trust. Therefore, the staff working directly with
children in the protection system should spend time with children on a daily basis, listening to their
stories, dissatisfactions, joys, opinions, needs, and desires. The children should also be consulted and
actively involved in deciding on their daily activities and in preparing their own intervention plans in
order to develop the decision-making and planning skills needed to live an independent life.
3.4 Leaving the Child Protection System
Other than reaching the age when they are no longer entitled to support, there are several ways in
which a child can leave the protection system: they can be reintegrated into their families, they can be
adopted, or they can be transferred to an institution for adult care. The PIP goal for the vast majority
of children in care is to reintegrate them in their families. However, it can be difficult for specialists to
determine whether this is the most appropriate solution and whether the family’s circumstances reach
the necessary standards to warrant returning the child to his or her home.
The System’s Children
Many children arrive in the child protection system when they are under the age of 3. These are the
children, particularly those who entered before the age of 1, who face a serious risk of becoming the
“system's children.” Of those who are currently in care, more than 18,000 children entered when they
were less than 12 months old and over 9,100 children entered when they were between 1 and 2 years
old. About one-third of them are children with mild, medium, or severe disabilities.
The very short time that these children spent with their parents was not enough to build a relationship
strong enough to motivate the parent to wish to reclaim the child. This is usually exacerbated by the
lack of any support or counseling for these parents, many of whom stop communicating with the child.
With every passing day, the child's chances of being reintegrated into his or her family decrease. After
three years of separation, their chances of leaving the system drop dramatically. After six or seven
years of separation, if no adoption takes place, their chances of exiting the system diminish even
further, while the likelihood of being reintegrated into their own family is reduced to virtually zero.
Just setting reintegration in the family as an objective is not enough if it is not based on an analysis of
the real chances of reintegration for each and every child and if it does not trigger a specific sequence
of actions related to children and their families. For this reason, this group of potential “system's
children” needs to be acknowledged as such and treated accordingly. Efforts for their adoption should
be intensified, and the regulations governing adoption should be revised to increase the chances of
finding them a permanent solution. If a safe, stable, and secure parenting relationship has not been
found by the time they reach the age of 10, the potential “system's children” should be able to enter
an “institutional pathway” to independent living to help them to integrate into the community when
they reach the age of 18. This would include life skills education and would involve growing up in a
family-type setting or in a small group home in a small community in which they can build friendships
and a social network where they can meet people and be known. This pathway should also include the
provision of either social housing or a sheltered house (supervised independent living arrangements)
once the young adult leaves the system. In the absence of this pathway, these young people will have
no real chance of building a sustainable life.
Too Few Adoptions
Adoption is considered by specialists to be the best solution for children who can no longer be
reintegrated within their birth families. This may mean adoption by a family within Romania or a family
from another country.
Since 2004, the numbers and rates of adoptions within Romania have either maintained their level or
decreased. According to UNICEF, the main reason for this is that so many families have been affected
by poverty. In other cases, extended families members have chosen to take the children into their care,
either formally or informally, rather than letting them be adopted. Moreover, in Romania there is still a

                                                                                                          43
stigma associated with raising children from outside families, which is why adoptive parents often
prefer to adopt very young children, under the age of 1 year old, if possible, and to keep the adoption
secret from both the child and the community.
On average, it takes five and a half years for a child in the protection system to obtain an adoption
objective in their Individualized Protection Plans. This is because of the many steps that need to be
followed to comply with the law. During the first step, the case worker tries to reintegrate the child
within his or her birth family since this is usually considered to be the best long-term solution for the
child. Only if this cannot be accomplished (because the family is unknown or because even relatives
up to the fourth degree are not willing or able to take the child) does the adoption procedure go
ahead. The legal requirement to obtain the consent of the parents can present another obstacle to the
adoption process, but the legislation in force since 2012 makes it legal to disregard the refusal of one
or both parents to consent to the adoption of their child if there is proof that the refusal is abusive.
Most children whose PIP goal is adoption are those who entered the system when they were under 1
year old because they were relinquished in the maternity hospital (61 percent), are biological orphans
with no extended family (12 percent), come from single-mother families (62 percent), were born to
adolescent mothers (6 percent), or have mothers with disabilities and/or mental health problems and
with little education (21 percent). Generally, these adoptable children come from small, poor families
with fewer children than the average family with children in the protection system (40 percent).
The children of families with parental risk factors (such as parents who have gone abroad to work,
dysfunctional families, and those with abusive alcohol consumption, promiscuous behavior, problems
with the law, and/or criminal history) are much less likely than other children in the system to enter
the adoption process. Consequently, few children with avoidable entries in the system – children
entering the system for social reasons – receive adoption as a PIP goal.
Family Reintegration for Children from Source Communities
Although the stated objective for most children in the protection system is to reunite them with their
parents, the study’s analysis of their families did not reveal a very optimistic picture. More than half of
the separated children never contacted their parents or other former caregivers again after the
separation, and the percentage was closer to 70 percent when the analysis focused on the previous
year. Children who were separated when they were less than 2 years old are more than four times
more likely not to have interacted at all with their parents or caregivers in the previous year than
children separated at the age of 6 or older.
The frequency of the children’s interactions with their family also decreases significantly if there is no
stable relationship with the mother, the mother has little education, or if the household is located in a
marginalized community. The more of these factors that apply, the lower the chances of the separated
child to reunite with his or her family of origin.
The interviews conducted in source communities showed that, for 64 percent of children in care, their
parents or caregivers declared that they were not at all willing to take them back, the most important
predictor being the amount of interaction they had had with the children in the previous year.
Moreover, interviews with the mothers of children in care showed that only 8 percent rated the
chances of family reintegration as “high” or “very high.” The vast majority of the mothers (80 percent)
either could not predict when the family reintegration would take place or said that the reintegration
would happen in three years or more.
It is also important to understand the conditions that prevail in these households to be able to judge
whether they are likely to be favorable to a child’s development and wellbeing. Many of the
households with children in public care live in extremely bad housing conditions, which make the
children’s reintegration improbable in the absence of any immediate measures. What is worrying is
that other children (siblings of the children in public care) still live in the vast majority of these
households where the living conditions are unacceptable. Overcrowding is also a problem, while many
households are not connected to any kind of utilities.



44
As for consumption, half of the surveyed households stated that their income was not enough to
cover even the minimum necessities. Yet these families were receiving very little if any social benefits
or other support to enable them to improve their living situation. A quarter of the households with
very low incomes told the interviewers that they had not received any means-tested benefits (which
are specifically targeted at the poor, by law) during the year of the survey. The percentage of those
who did not get any aid was even lower for households with children than for all households. Nor
were they receiving regular visits from a social assistant.
The reintegration of most children into families will require not only financial support, where needed,
but also continuous monitoring by a social worker or a person with social assistance responsibilities to
provide constant guidance and support to these families to help them cope with their multiple
challenges and to facilitate the reintegration of their separated children.
4. Recommendations
The study has revealed the many efforts being made to improve Romania’s child protection system
both at the legislative level and in terms of working practices. Nevertheless, many challenges must still
be addressed in order to ensure that the system is truly focused on supporting children and families.
The current system faces numerous internal issues that require in many cases both a short-term and a
medium-term resolution. Yet many solutions are dependent on coordination with other systems, such
as the social assistance system, the social benefit system, the education system, the health system, and
the labor market. Therefore, the recommendations in this section are intended not only for
professionals within the child protection system at all levels but also for those in the other social
sectors.
The conclusions and recommendations below are based on several themes that represent the guiding
principles for a good child protection system.
Theme 1: Coordinating all interventions at the local level including health, education, social
work, and social benefits to ensure prevention, early identification and intervention
Preventing children from going into protective care should be deemed a priority and should be
properly funded. As the child protection system cannot and should not have to solve the inefficiencies
of the social benefits system, the gaps in the education and healthcare systems, the absence of
services for people with disabilities or other vulnerabilities, or the lack of policies and investments in
social housing, what is needed is for the Government of Romania to develop, at the highest level, a
multi-sectoral strategy for prevention services.
The system needs to be changed from being geared towards emergency responses to focusing on
preventing the child-parent separation. A good protection system is one that focuses on reducing the
number of entries into the system, while continuing the deinstitutionalization process and finding
suitable permanent family care alternatives for those children who are already in the system or who
may enter the system in the future.
Prevention can best be done by providing a wide range of community-based services that serve as a
filter to reduce entries into the system and to increase the opportunities to reintegrate children within
their families (thus increasing the number of exits). There is a need to conduct a national assessment
to identify what services are a priority so that the available resources are invested in the most efficient
and equitable way to have the maximum positive impact on the children.
This type of national plan for developing community-based prevention services should be designed
by the ANPDCA in close coordination with all stakeholders and professionals, including NGOs and
local authorities who are major service providers for children and families. Given that preventing
children from being separated from their families is a cross-cutting issue, the plan should be funded
from the budgets of several relevant ministries and agreed on with the Ministry of Finance.
Theme 2: Supporting families and children involves working directly with them
Most of the children placed in institutions are not orphans but still have one or even both of their
parents. Over 90 percent of the mothers of the children in the child protection system are alive and


                                                                                                        45
known. The results of the study make it clear that, given the dominant profile of parents with children
in the protection system, these parents will need parental education and intensive support to be able
to fulfill their parental obligations in a responsible manner. Therefore, any plan to reintegrate these
children in their family will require professionals to provide the mothers/parents with significant and
consistent support in order to ensure that the family environment is one in which the child will thrive.
This reintegration should be done based on a medium-term plan, which should be prepared with the
input of both the mother and the child.
At present, very few households who relinquished their children receive regular visits from a social
worker. Taking into account the wide geographical dispersal of families and the amount of effort
required to support them and keep records, it is obvious that case managers need to share this
burden with the social workers who are close to these families and are in a good position to monitor
their development.
In line with the current legislation, the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s
Rights 2014-2020 includes the following objectives: (i) providing a minimum package of social services
for children and their families and (ii) developing integrated community-based services. The National
Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 also proposes introducing a minimum
intervention package whose implementation should be a mandatory responsibility in each rural and
urban community and should contain the following: (i) fieldwork, which is essential for identifying
potential beneficiaries and for providing early intervention services; (ii) assessment of the needs of
communities, households, and individuals who are vulnerable or exposed to social risks, as well as
planning of the necessary services based on an approach focused on families and individuals; (iii)
information and counseling services for people who are vulnerable or exposed to social risks, people
experiencing domestic violence or neglect, drug users and problem former convicts, single-parent
families with low incomes, and young people at risk (delinquents, school dropouts, and children from
low-income families); (iv) administrative support (such as helping people to fill in application forms for
any type of benefits) and social, medical, and legal assistance; (v) referral to specialized services; and
(vi) monitoring and home visitation of all people in vulnerable situations within the community.
Theme 3: Youths and children have rights, including the right to participate in decisions that
affect them
Two out of three children in the child protection system are not consulted about their opinions and
preferences. Children need to have their voices heard and to have somebody they can talk to, a
person to whom they can tell anything, and whom they can trust. Staff in the special protection
system who work with children should spend time with them on a daily basis, listening to their stories,
dissatisfactions, joys, opinions, needs, and desires. The children should be consulted and actively
involved in planning daily activities, in the preparation of their intervention plans, and in all aspects of
their lives, such as education, health, and leisure. In order to develop independent life skills, it is very
important that they learn to make decisions (including about issues that seem of little importance to
children living in a family) and to manage their life.
Theme 4: The system needs to provide solutions which are tailored to children’s different needs
and situations
The diversity of children’s needs was reflected in the case files both in terms of their circumstances at
the time of their entry into the system and of the causes for separating them from their families.
Therefore, it is vital to carry out a thorough analysis of each child’s situation because the needs of
children vary significantly depending on their age, gender, area of residence, and health. This means
that the child protection system needs to offer an equally wide range of services in response to such
needs, as do the social assistance, education, and health systems.
Not only do children in public care vary among themselves, but many of them also suffer from a range
of different concurrent issues. Over two-thirds (65 percent) of the case files record a multitude of
vulnerabilities that the children and their families faced prior to the children entering the protection
system, particularly the disabled children, children with developmental delays, children with special



46
educational needs, children with behavioral disorders, and infants born prematurely and/or
underweight.
Also, the case files indicated that for 76 percent of the children in the protection system, there was
more than one reason for the separation, including unfortunate events (parents’ death or
institutionalization), neglect, abuse or exploitation, child relinquishment, and/or the parents were
deprived of their parental rights. The other 24 percent of children were defined as avoidable entries,
whose causes for separation are related to parental risk factors (parents who work abroad,
dysfunctional families, teen mothers, parents’ excessive alcohol and/or drug consumption, domestic
violence, or parents with disabilities and/or with mental health problems) or structural risk factors
(poverty/ low socioeconomic status, dependence on social benefits, insecure or inadequate housing,
or evictions). Since the community-based services recommended by this study would address many of
these issues, a decrease in the avoidable entries into the child protection system would be an
encouraging indicator of the effectiveness of those prevention measures.
The study has revealed that adoption is currently a solution that is open to only a very few children.
There are not enough parents willing to adopt and of those who are willing, many have a particular
child in mind, often the child who has already been placed with them. Therefore, it will be vital to
increase the number of adopting parents by initiating education and communication campaigns at the
community level to promote adoption and foster inclusive attitudes towards all children, irrespective
of their gender, age, ethnic origin, health condition, or parents. It will also be necessary to improve the
training provided to individuals or families willing to adopt a child, as well as the professional training
of the DGASPC staff on how to communicate with potential adopting parents, particularly with regard
to the needs of children with disabilities.
Theme 5: The success of a child protection system is determined by the effectiveness of the
actual support children receive
Services for independent living represent a distinctive and important category that must be developed,
especially for the post-institutionalization integration of young people with disabilities, as well as for
the transition from residential care to community-based services.
Many children end up in the protection system before they are three years old and live in the system
until they reach the legal age to leave. Although the aim of the system is to reunite children with their
parents, the chances of this happening are not great. More than half of all separated children have
never had any contact with their parents since the separation, and the percentage is closer to 70
percent for those who have had no contact in the year prior to separation. In the case of 64 percent of
the separated children, their parents say they do not wish to take them home.
A child spends, on average, 7.5 years in the Romanian child protection system. However, one in every
five children aged 15 to 26 years who are now in the system has spent all his or her life in the system,
and almost one in every three children has spent 90 percent of his or her life. This shows that there is
a pressing need to develop mechanisms to help children as they grow old enough to exit the system,
which is the only family they have known. The social and professional integration of these children
into society will be very difficult if the system simply disappears once they reach a certain age, leaving
them without the skills that they need to live an independent life, without enough education to earn a
living, and without any prospect of housing.
There are two main solutions to this transition from childhood to adulthood for children in care. The
first is to provide options for those capable of living independently, not only alternative familial care
but also social houses and sheltered houses. The second solution focuses on young adults with severe
disabilities, who cannot manage on their own and have no support from their families. These options
would address a wide range of needs specific to young people: (i) the need to obtain and keep an
affordable dwelling, to live independently, and, in some cases, to manage financial and personal
goods; (ii) the need for habilitation and rehabilitation adapted to the specific needs of adults with
disabilities and provided in the context of an independent life; (iii) the need for professional training,
education, professional mentoring, and support to find employment; (iv) the need to access other
community services (such as medical assistance, legal services, outdoor activities, cultural activities,

                                                                                                        47
and leisure centers); and (v) the need for a balanced family life (including, for instance, family
counseling and sexual education).
Theme 6: Improving and systematizing working practices
Working practices need to be improved and systematized at all stages of the child protection system.
The study has highlighted certain specific issues that need to be addressed.
First, there is a need for child protection workers to be more accurate in identifying the reasons for
separating a child from his or her family. The study found that “poverty” is often given as a cause in
the records when in fact the separation was also due to child neglect or abuse or to the death of his or
her parents. This distorts the data and makes it difficult for the child’s case worker to draw up an
effective and relevant Individualized Protection Plan for the child.
A second issue is the need to develop a consistent process to follow in cases where children enter care
at their family’s request or as a result of a decision of the Child Protection Commission. This process
should start with a thorough initial assessment of the child’s case based on comprehensive
documentation and end with the fulfillment of all steps prior to the placement of a child in the
protection system. Such procedures should be applied consistently throughout the country.
The study revealed that it is crucial for all communes to have at least one SPAS staff member with
social assistance duties who has a higher education. Universities, service providers, and the National
College of Social Assistants in Romania should draw up child- and family-centered methodologies for
the adoption, assessment, planning, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of social
services, and a continuous training program should be developed to teach these methodologies to all
social assistance staff at the local level.
Theme 7: Developing a high performance management information system
There is an urgent need to develop an effective, nationwide, computerized management information
system (MIS) for the child protection system. If used daily in the work of all case managers and
specialists within the system, this MIS would significantly increase the accuracy and consistency of
data at both the local and national levels. The data entered into this MIS should reflect each child’s full
history and should contain enough information to enable child protection professionals to provide
efficient support to children and their families. This theme is fundamental and is connected to all the
other themes because in the absence of reliable and comprehensive data about the child and their
family, all child protection system interventions meant to serve the child’s best interest will fail.
Developing a computerized management information system would reduce bureaucracy, increase
transparency and accountability, ensure a harmonized approach at the national level, facilitate real-
time coordination of the SPAS and DGASPC specialists, enable monitoring of the activities carried out
by all relevant stakeholders, and provide the ANPDCA with sufficient information to be able to change
or adjust the legislation, programs, and support or corrective measures on the basis of relevant
evidence.

This section discusses the main characteristics of children in public care in Romania and of their
families, mainly on the basis of the representative sample of children extracted from the CMTIS in
November 2014.36 Regarding the mothers of these children, additional information was drawn from
the Household Survey in Rural Source Communities.



3.1.1                     Profile of Children in Public Care
The children in public care (whether in institutions or in alternative family-type care) are girls and boys
of all ages, between 0 and 26 years old (though there are also some young people aged over 26 still in
the system). There are slightly more boys than girls (53 percent versus 47 percent). Out of all of the
children in public care services, most are aged between 10 and 17 years old. This age group accounts
for more than half of the children in protection (56 percent), and its total number and proportion have
been constantly increasing over the last four years.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=52,344).

Young people aged 18 years or older who are full-time students (or in other special conditions) are
eligible for protection within any type of public care service, until they turn 26 years old.37 This group
represents a consistent share of 12 percent.
Children in public care come from all counties in the country, 43 percent from rural localities and 56
percent from urban settlements. The predominance of children from cities is due to the large share of
children relinquished in maternity homes among those aged 0 to 2 years old.
There are children from all ethnic groups in the child special protection system (Annex 6 Table 2).
According to the data available in the children’s case files, the distribution by ethnicity of children in
public care differs considerably from that in the general young population. The share of children with
undeclared ethnicity in the child protection system is three times higher than in the young population
aged 0 to 29 years (31.3 percent versus 9 percent, according to the 2011 census). At the same time,
the proportion of Roma children is double the proportion in the general youth population (10.3
percent versus 5.3 percent), while that of Romanians is substantially lower (54 percent versus 79.1
percent).38

Children with disabilities represent a significant share (almost 29 percent) of all children in public care
(see Annex 6 Table 3), while the files for over 9 percent of children in protection contain no relevant
data on disability. Fewer than two-thirds (62 percent) of children in public care have no disability at all,
according to the information in their files. The proportion of children with disabilities increases
incrementally from about 6 percent of infants under 1 year old to over 43 percent of young people
aged between 18 and 26 years.39 At the same time, the probability of a child in public care having had
a disability is higher among boys than among girls, higher among Roma and other ethnic groups than
among Romanians and Hungarians, and higher among children from cities than among those from
rural areas.
In conclusion, the needs of children in the protection system vary considerably according to their age,
gender, residence of origin, and health condition, which means that the child protection system has to
offer a wide variety of services to meet those needs.



3.1.2                 The Large Majority of Children in Public
        Care in Romania Have a Family
As highlighted in the book Deinstitutionalization Myth Buster:40 “Contrary to common belief, the large
majority of children placed in institutions are not orphans, but have one or even both parents.” This is
also the case in Romania, for all children in public care, whether placed in institutions or family-type
care. This section focuses on the analysis of data from the children's files regarding their parents and
the families who took care of them before they entered the protection system.



3.1.2.1               The Moms
In the Romanian child protection system, only for about 9 percent of all children is the mother not
known or not alive.

Most children in public care are social rather than biological orphans. The mothers of over 90 percent
of all children in public care are alive and known. In most cases, information about the mother’s
current marital status, occupation, education, health status, or address is available in the files, but in a
few cases (fewer than 3 percent) there is no such information in the child's file. The proportion of
children whose mothers are well-documented in their files decreases considerably from over 95

percent among young children to less than 77 percent among young people aged 18 to 26. This is
probably because, for this age group who by law should have left the child protection system, child
protection professionals have shifted their focus from reintegration in the family to “integration in
society.”

Much like their children, the proportion of mothers with an undeclared ethnicity is more than five
times higher than the proportion in the general female population. At the same time, Roma mothers
are almost four times more numerous than in the general female population, while the proportion of
Romanian mothers is much lower (Table 6).
Overall, the children's files contain information on 32,100 mothers aged between 14 and 68 (as of
November-December 2014). The population of mothers is young, with an average age of 36.3 years41
versus an average age of 42.1 years for the national female population, according to the 2011 census.
Most of these mothers gave birth to the child in public care before the age of 25, with 19 percent
giving birth between 12 and 18 years old and 39 percent between the ages of 19 and 24. Forty-nine
percent were 19 to 29 years old when the child entered the system, and as of November-December
2014, they were over 35 years old (48 percent were between 30 and 40 years old and 30 percent were
40 to 68 years old.

Hence, they gave birth at an early age, on average 23.4 years old versus 27.8 years for all Romanian
women. The average age of the mother at the time of the child's birth is lower for mothers from rural
areas (on average, 22.9 years versus 23.8 years for mothers from urban areas) and for Roma women
(on average, 22.9 years old).
The mothers of children in public care have an atypical demographic profile. In addition to the early
average age at child birth, Figure 7 shows that, unlike the general female population, they follow a
consistent pattern of consensual unions and undeclared marital status, which is usually associated
with unstable relationships.

There is little information in the children’s files about the state of their mothers’ health either at the
time when the child entered the system or at the time of the research (Annex 6 Table 4). Based on the
available valid data, it appears that around 20 to 23 percent of mothers suffered from mental health
problems and/or from a physical disability. Risky health behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse
were also reported in the files for 9 percent and 2 percent of mothers respectively.

The level of education achieved by mothers is poorly documented in children's files. There is no
information at all for almost half (47 percent) of all mothers. However, the existing valid data indicate
that their level of education is very low. Almost one in every four mothers of children in public care is
illiterate. Overall, more than three-quarters of them have completed gymnasium at most.
The employment of mothers is also poorly documented in children's files (Annex 6 Table 5).42 The
existing valid data show that they are disconnected from the labor market, particularly the formal
labor market. The proportions of female employees, employers, and consequently of pensioners43 are
extremely low. Their links to the informal or black labor market are also rather low. Only around 23 to
28 percent of mothers do casual work within the country or abroad, are self-employed in agriculture
or in non-agricultural activities such as peddling or selling bottles or scrap metal, or make a living
from begging, vagrancy, prostitution, or petty theft. Several of the mothers have had occasional
episodes of prostitution (2 percent). Associated with this spectrum of activities, over 3 percent of
mothers have a criminal record.
However, the majority of mothers are dependants, classified as housepersons, people unable to work,
or jobless (around 60 percent). Some of them (2 to 3 percent of all mothers) are institutionalized
either in prisons or in various health or social institutions. Under these conditions, especially if no
supportive extended family exists, these mothers would only be able to provide their child with a
stable and decent living only with consistent support from the state in terms of benefits and varied
social services or by finding a partner able to provide for both the mother and her children.


 CONCLUSION
 More than 90 percent of children in public care have mothers who are known and alive. Nevertheless, the
 circumstances of these mothers are too poorly documented in the children's files to be very useful for
 developing a proper plan for reintegrating the child with the mother. Information on the mothers' marital,
 health, education and employment status is sparse and mostly out of date. The available data indicate that
 reintegration requires substantial efforts and the provision of consistent support to mothers by both the
 professionals in the child protection system and other institutions in order to ensure a family environment that
 can offer the child real chances at developing properly. Otherwise, reintegration will only mean sending the
 child into a highly unstable and unsuitable environment.
 Drafting and implementing a policy targeting young mothers without education and in vulnerable situations
 (in other words, alone or living in a consensual union, economically dependent, lacking stable accommodation
 in which to live with the child, and in poor health) is very necessary. If such a policy would exist, the placement
 measure for children from these families might be reconsidered, as they could return into their families.

  Among the mothers of children in public care, most pensioners receive sickness or disability pensions rather than
social insurance pensions.

FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
In general, the mothers of children in public care from rural source communities spent most of their
childhood with a mother and father who were most often legally married (about 60 percent). Less
frequently, they grew up with a mother and father in a consensual union or with a single-parent
(usually the mother) or in an extended family. Their families of origin were large, with a number of
children that varied between 1 and 22 and an average number of five children. In addition, about 14
percent of their parents had children from other relationships as well.
One in every three mothers spent some time in public care herself during her childhood. Three
percent spent more time in the child protection system than with their family of origin up to the age
of 18 years old. Four percent of these mothers had siblings who were also in public care.
Their parents (the grandparents of the children in public care) were poorly educated, with
approximately 20 percent never having attended school, while another 73 percent of grandmothers
and 70 percent of grandfathers had completed gymnasium at most. With many children and poorly
educated parents, the families were very poor (34 percent) or poor (40 percent).
Like their parents, 22 percent of the current mothers of children in care have never attended school,
while 59 percent have completed only primary or gymnasium education. Fewer than 19 percent of the
mothers achieved a higher level of education than their parents.
By the age of 18, more than half of them had already left their family of origin, 34 percent had already
had a first job (while 51 percent of the mothers never had an income-earning activity), 78 percent
were sexually active, and about 48 percent had given birth to their first child (see figure below).

Consequently, by and large, mothers of children in public care:
- Become sexually active before the age of 17 years old
- Have their first child at an early age - 19.6 years as compared with the average age at the first birth
of 26.2 years at the national level (NIS, 2013)
- Tend to have more partners and more children during their lifetime than the general female
population. According to the valid data,44 during their lifetimes, they had an average of 3.8 children (a
maximum of 18) with 1 to 10 partners (on average, 1.5), and an average of 1.6 abortions (a maximum
of 30). For comparison, the average number of children per woman is 1.5 for the national female
population (NIS, 2013).



3.1.2.2              The Dads
Unlike the mothers, the fathers of 52 percent of children in public care are either unknown or dead.
The proportion of fatherless children declines from 72 percent among infants under 1 year old to
approximately 43 percent of young people of 18 to 26 years old. Conversely, for the same age groups,
the share of children with sufficient information about their fathers in their files increases from only 28
percent to almost 52 percent.

At the same time, for both girls and boys, the proportion of fatherless children is significantly higher
for children from urban areas than from rural areas (59 percent versus 44 percent). It is also higher for
Roma children and from other ethnic groups (63 percent) than for Romanian children (48 percent) and
Hungarian children (57 percent). Thus, in the children's files, the most information on fathers exists for
Romanian children aged over 11 years who come from rural areas.

Figure 9 shows that there are considerable age differences between the mothers and fathers of
children in public care.45 Thus, it would seem that many of these couples were atypical, mostly in
terms of being formed of a young woman and a much older man. For 46 percent of these couples, the
age difference is more than five years, while for 19 percent of them, the father is between 10 and 41
years older than the mother. In over 1 percent of cases, the father is more than five to twelve years
younger than the mother. Only about half of the couples (53 percent) have an age difference within
the range of five years, and only about a quarter have no more than two years between partners,
which is the standard age difference. As with the children and their mothers, the Roma and those with
undeclared ethnicity are over-represented among fathers, while Romanians are heavily
underepresented compared to the general male population. Also, one in every five couples (mother-
father) in which at least one partner declares an ethnic affiliation is ethnically mixed.

The demographic pattern of the fathers deviates from that of the general male population by being
characterized by undeclared marital status (usually associated with unstable relationships), divorce,
separation, and consensual unions, even more than was the case for the mothers (Annex 6 Table 6).
When it comes to health, the status of the fathers is similar to that of the mothers (Annex 6 Table 4).
Their health status is very poorly documented in the children's files. Based on the available valid data,
about 11 to 16 percent of the fathers suffer from mental health problems and/or from a physical
disability, while risky behavior is quite frequent with 26 percent reported with alcohol abuse and
around 4 percent with drug abuse.

45
  The average age difference between mothers and fathers of the children in public care is for the father to be six years
older than the mother, with a standard deviation of 6 years.

                                                                                                                           57
The fathers of children in public care have somewhat higher levels of education than the mothers but
are clear underachievers when compared to the general male population (Annex 6 Table 7). The
children's files contain information about education for only about half of the fathers who are known
and alive. The available valid data show that 10 percent of the fathers are illiterate (versus 23 percent
of the mothers), while approximately 52 percent of the fathers completed gymnasium (versus 25
percent of the general male population). Most of the other fathers underwent vocational training,
which offers them certain chances of entering the labor market, mainly as manual workers.
As a consequence, the fathers have more links to the labor market than the mothers (Annex 6 Table
5).46 Nevertheless, only about 11 percent of the fathers are workers with a labor contract,47 while 45 to
51 percent of them are employed in the informal or “black” labor market. Specifically for this reason,
10 percent of them are reported to have a criminal record and 6 to 8 percent are in prison, either in
Romania or abroad. The share of dependent people among fathers (housepersons, unable to work, or
jobless) is lower than for mothers but is much higher than in the general male population (25 to 29
percent). As a result, most of the fathers of children in public care hold insecure, low paid, and/or risky
jobs, which cannot provide a stable and decent life for a family.

 CONCLUSION
 Only 48 percent of children in public care have fathers who are known and alive. In the children's files, the
 fathers’ circumstances are even less well-documented than those of the mothers. Only in the case of very few
 children does the father seem to be able to provide a decent life, though not necessarily a stable family
 environment as well.


3.1.2.3              The Families
This section turns from parents to the families who cared for the children before they entered the
child protection system. Based on the children’s file information on their caretakers, the children in
public care can be grouped in three categories according to their family of origin:
 About one-third of children (32 percent) come from single-mother families and there is no
  information available about the father.
 Another third (31 percent) come from typical nuclear families, including a mother and a father and
  possibly other children as well.
 The final third of children (37 percent) are from a variety of atypical families among which two
  types are most common: (i) a single-mother living with another person (usually the grandmother)
  who takes care of the child (9 percent) and (ii) a couple living together with the child in a
  multigenerational household, in which a person (usually a grandparent) takes care of the child (8
  percent). The other atypical types of families constitute less than 3 percent each and consist of, for
  example, single-fathers who went to jail, single-mothers who left to work abroad, children
  relinquished by their parents and taken in by a relative or other person, or children left alone at
  home after both parents went abroad or after other unfortunate events occurred in the family.
  These types of families are shown in Infograph Chart 1.
Both for girls and boys in public care, the proportion of children from single-mother families
decreases sharply with the child's age at the time of the survey, from 64 percent among children
under 1 year old to 52 percent of toddlers aged 1 to 2 years and to a low of 21 percent among young
people aged 18 to 26. By contrast, the proportion of children from nuclear families is only 24 percent
among babies (younger than 1 year old) and reaches 40 percent of young people between the ages of
18 and 26.




46
     Data on employment status are missing for 50 percent of living fathers.
47
 Correspondingly, among the fathers of children in public care, most pensioners have sickness or disability pensions,
while very few have social insurance pensions.

Note: *No data about the father. The mother was the child's caretaker. **Mother is known and alive, but she lives
in the same dwelling with another person (usually the grandmother) who takes care of the child. ***Usually,
multigenerational households in which grandparents or other relatives take care of the child although the parents
are present as well.

The changes in time within the structure of the family of origin (Figure 10) feature a pattern of
unstable relations, divorce, and separation. Between the time when the children entered the system
and the time of the study (November-December 2014), the share of children from nuclear families
dropped from 31 percent to 28 percent, whereas the share of those with single-mothers slightly
increased from 32 percent to 35 percent.
The atypical structure of the families of origin resulted in 28 percent of children who depended on a
caretaker other than their parents before they entered the system. Children’s file information on
caretakers is rather vague. Nonetheless, it shows that the large majority of these caretakers (88
percent) were relatives, of whom more than three-quarters were grandparents (particularly
grandmothers on the mother’s side). Thus, about 80 percent of these caretakers were women with an
average age of 57, legally married (42 percent), poorly educated, and employees, pensioners, or
housepersons.
Overall, 34 percent of the children lived with one to fourteen siblings (with an average of two siblings)
before entering the system (Annex 6 Figure 1). However, this proportion strongly varies by the
structure of the family of origin. Thus, children who lived with siblings prior to entering the system
account for a minimum of 12 to 14 percent of the children from families of single mothers who left
home or of children with caretakers other than their parents (whether these were relatives or not) and
a maximum of 77 percent of children coming from single-father families.
At the time of the data collection (November-December 2014), half of the children had between one
and ten siblings (with an average of two siblings) in public care (Annex 6 Figure 1).48 Generally, the
proportion of children with siblings in public care at the time of the study was higher than the
proportion of children living with siblings before entering the child protection system. Therefore, one
child in public care seems to be a good predictor for new (or other) entries into the protection system
from that child's family.

  There is no information on whether the siblings entered the child protection system before or after the child under
study.

FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The survey of rural source communities yielded additional information about the “power of the
antecedent” - the families of origin of the children in public care. All of the mothers in the sample of
households from rural source communities had at least one of their children in public care. Twenty-
one percent of them had only one liveborn baby during their lifetime and relinquished that baby to
the system. The majority of them were adolescents or younger than 20 years old. The other 79 percent
of mothers gave birth to two to eighteen children for a total of almost 3,000 children from about 700
mothers. Of these mothers, 51 percent relinquished only one child to the system during their lifetime,
while the other 28 percent of mothers each gave two to ten of their children up to various caretakers.
Two-thirds of children were relinquished in maternity wards or were left directly to the child
protection services, and one-third were sent to relatives, particularly grandmothers. Overall, more than
one in every three children born to mothers from the rural source communities did not grow up with
their mother or parents but in the child protection system and, less frequently, with their
grandparents.

mothers with children in public care).


Given this information about the current structure of the children's families, it is clear that
reintegration has different implications for various categories of children. Thus, only for about 28
percent of children in public care would reintegration into the family mean returning to a nuclear
family. For other 37 percent, reintegration into the family would mean returning to a single-mother
living in a highly vulnerable situation, as shown in section 3.1.2.1. For the 24 percent who used to be
taken care of by their relatives (particularly grandparents), reintegration into the extended family
would be the only workable option. Finally, the last 8 percent of children have no parents or relatives
to rely on, while 3 percent have only a single-father. In their case, reintegration into their family is very
likely to fail.
Boys and girls have an equal chance of falling into any of the categories shown in Figure 11. However,
there are significant differences among the children according to their age, residence of origin,
ethnicity, and health status. These differences are presented in Annex 6 Table 8. As already mentioned,
children under the age of 3 are more likely to belong to a single-mother family, while children over
the age of 15 are more likely to have been taken care of by their nuclear and/or extended family.
However, the chances for reintegration are not necessarily higher for youths and adolescents from
nuclear and/or extended families because it all depends on how long they were separated from their
family as the child-parent relationship is often more difficult during adolescence and early youth than
in childhood.
Roma children and those with undeclared ethnicity are more likely to belong to a single-mother family.
The same is true for children from urban areas, as opposed to those from rural settlements who are
more likely to come from a nuclear and/or an extended family. Children with disabilities are more
likely than those without a disability to belong to a family, whether a single-mother family or a nuclear
family.

 RECOMMENDATIONS
 More than 4,300 children (8 percent) in public care do not have any family (whether nuclear or extended) to
 return to. They are boys and girls of all ages, all ethnic groups, with or without disabilities. For them, a new
 long-term plan should be developed, either one targeting adoption or an Individualized Protection Plan until
 they reach 18 years of age so as to make sure that, by the time they leave the system, they have the same
 chances in life as do children with a family. They certainly should no longer spend time in large residential
 institutions without a plan that takes into account the best interests of the child and that aims for an urgent
 move to a family-type protection measure.

 Over 18,800 children (37 percent) belong to single-mother families. Their reintegration into their families will
 not succeed unless effective support is offered to their mothers. As we have shown, most of these mothers do
 not have the resources required to overcome the complex hardships with which they have to deal. Drafting a
 family policy that targets support to single mothers would improve the chances of a successful child
 reintegration based on a medium-term plan that should be worked out in cooperation with the mother and
 the child in order to be effective, rather than devised for them. This plan should be accompanied by the
 necessary implementation resources targeted to the child’s location as well as the necessary monitoring and
 support structures to be applied once the child returns in the family and continued for as long as necessary.
 More generally, in order to draft a realistic Individualized Protection Plan that would genuinely increase the
 child’s chances of living in a family, it is essential that the situation of both parents is documented in detail and
 in depth, is constantly updated, and is complemented by information on the extended family, if there is one, as
 well as on the communities in which these parents live. The fact that, generally, there is less information on the
 fathers reflects (and reinforces) the social norms according to which the woman (usually the mother) is the
 child’s main caretaker. In any case, the lack of information on parents and the absence of a system for tracking
 and recording any developments in the status of those parents from whom the child was separated makes the
 child’s reintegration into his or her family a difficult and sometimes impossible mission.

 3.1.3           The Routes Followed by Children Before
                 Entering Public Care
Most children in Romania are born in a maternity ward. From there they leave with their mother to
join a nuclear family that owns a dwelling and is well integrated in a complex kinship network
comprising many relatives with whom, as they grow up, they spend various periods of time, with or
without their parents. This may be considered the standard route followed by children in Romania.
The children in public care in Romania followed a variety of different routes before entering the
system. These routes are visually presented in Infograph Chart 2.
There are broadly three categories of routes that children take before entering the public care system.
The first category relates to family and kinship networks: in these cases, children are on the standard
route until some disruptive event happens and they end up in the child protection system. This is the
case for about 65 percent of children in public care. The second category of routes relates to
situations when children are relinquished in institutions, usually medical facilities, which is the route
for more than 31 percent of children in public care. The last category is that of street routes and is the
least common. The case files contain no information in this respect for fewer than 1 percent of the
children in care. The three categories of routes are explored in the next sections.

3.1.3.1          Routes Related to the Family and Kinship Network
The route Maternity ward --> Family with stable dwelling --> SPS (Special Protection System,
Romanian for public care) was followed by girls and boys of all ages but was more typical of children
who entered the system when they were over the age of 3, who therefore were 11 years old or more
at the time of the study. They tend to be Romanian or Hungarian children in good health who come
from rural areas (Annex 6 Table 9).
Three kinds of family histories are typically associated with this route, namely:
 About half of these children come from a nuclear family and, at the time of the study, still had a
  nuclear family to return to (sometimes living in a multigenerational household). In most cases, their
  parents were young adults of 25 to 39 years old when their children entered the system.
  Nevertheless, about one-third of the children who followed this route have mothers who, at the
  time of the study, were over 40 and fathers who were over 50 years old.
 Nearly one-third of these children grew up in a single-mother family with an unknown father. In
  most cases, the mother was young (under 25 years old) and had no support from her kinship
  network.
 The other children ended up in the system after their mother or father died. In most cases, after
  the mother's death, they lived for a while with their father who was not able to both provide and
  care for his children. Thus, the father asked the DGASPC for help and placed his children in public
  care.

The route Maternity ward --> Family --> Relatives --> SPS is common when one or both parents die,
leave home (to go to prison, to work abroad, or to a “new” family), or are deprived of their parental
rights. In some cases, the child's family lived together with other relatives (such as grandparents) in
the same dwelling. In other cases, the relatives had different dwellings, but the family ties were strong
enough that the relatives were willing to take care of the child for a while. When relatives became
unavailable or unwilling to care for the child, either a non-relative person offered temporary support
(Maternity ward --> Family --> Non-Relatives --> SPS) or the child remained home alone before
being taken into the custody of the child protection services (Maternity ward --> Family --> Children
left home alone --> SPS).
          “Do you remember why you had to go to a center?

          - Because my folks moved to another country. And my siblings and I were left all alone... and we
          ended up at the center.

          - Actually, being home alone is kind of cool. I was left home alone. Yes. (laughing)” (Focus group
          with children, Cluj-Napoca)

These three routes (3, 5, and 7 in the Infograp Chart 2) are not associated with any specific
characteristics of the children, but being taken in by relatives or other people is more frequent in rural
areas where the kinship and social networks are closer and more supportive.
In addition, a small number of children (0.1 percent) (i) arrived in the child public care system after
their mothers were institutionalized (most often in a psychiatric hospital); (ii) remained in the system
after mother and child had been in a maternal center; or (iii) were born while the mother was in an
institution (so, for them going home meant going into an institution).
          ”[...] Where I work, there is also a mothers’ center... many, about half of the cases are referred to
          us by this center; they are underage mothers who are not accepted by their family, their
          pregnancy is not accepted by the family and they want to stay with the child’s father during their
          pregnancy, but they are underage and their family doesn’t agree with them getting married, I
          don’t know. Many times, I help the young mother and [she and the child’s father] they manage to
          get married and she goes with the child’s father and the child. But, most often, they leave the
          child and just go away ...” (Focus group with professionals, Timişoara)

Risk is a feature of child protection work that can only be reduced, not eliminated. Although some
children arrive in the system via maternal centers,49 efforts are being made by DGASPCs and NGOs
(sometimes in cooperation) to improve the existing services of maternal centers as a way of
preventing the separation of children from their mothers and families and ensuring that these centers
are not just a mere phase that precedes the separation.
          “- There are mothers’ centers under the directorate (DGASPC) acting as residential services and
          providing mothers with accommodation and specialized interventions from instructors and
          psychologists to prevent the separation. For the mother and the child or, well, the children, the
          condition is that one of the children should be under 3, and then they have everything they need
          for six months, free of charge, in order to keep the child with the mother. So we don’t send her to
          a mothers’ center only to later separate the children from the mother and place them in child
          care. This is an alternative way of preventing child separation.

          What happens after six months?

          - Then, during that time, of course we work with the mother; normally we don’t take mothers off
          the street because we know that it is difficult to reintegrate them. However, if we are asked, of
          course we try to see if there is a father, we try to make him accountable and have him
          acknowledge the child. We also work with the mayoralties, we have a service plan, an aftercare
          plan, to ensure that a mother never leaves the mothers’ center and ends up on the street with her
          child. The foundation HHC Romania runs a three to six-month financial support scheme that

   The case files indicate that fewer than 0.2 percent of children in public care received the services of a maternal center
before entering the child special protection system. Another 1 percent of children in public care were initially placed in
public maternal centers together with their mothers, but later on they were relinquished by their mothers and
transferred to other child care services. This topic is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.3.2.4 (on the first protection service).

                                                                                                                             65
            allows us to pay the rent, for example, for a mother who was accommodated in a mothers’ center
            provided that she finds a job.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

The routes related to family and kinship networks are by far the most common (more than 75 percent)
among the children in public care from five counties: Gorj, Suceava, Galați, Hunedoara, and Vrancea.
By contrast, in counties like Bihor and Harghita, fewer than half of all children in public care have
entered the system via these routes (see Annex 6 Table 10).



3.1.3.2               Routes Related to Relinquishment in Health Facilities
Almost 24 percent of children in public care were relinquished after birth in a maternity ward. An
additional 7 percent were taken at home for a few months and subsequently deserted in a pediatric
hospital or other health unit. These two routes are not associated with specific characteristics of the
children and families (Annex 6 Table 11), except for the child's age at entrance in the system.
Relinquishment in health institutions is specific to children under 3 years old (as opposed to older
children who are rarely left in a medical institution), girls and boys alike, mostly from urban areas.
Children from urban areas are more than seven times more likely than children from rural areas to be
relinquished at birth and three times more likely to be left in a health unit.50 Roma children have a
considerably higher probability of being relinquished in these institutions (Annex 6 Table 11).
Nevertheless, they represent only 14 to 17 percent of all children who entered the protection system
after being relinquished in a maternity ward or medical facility.51
Children with disabilities have a high probability of entering the care system after having been
relinquished in medical facilities (Annex 6 Table 11). They represent 36 percent of children
relinquished straight after birth52 and over half (51 percent) of those left in a health unit.53 Premature
babies and children with low birth weight (especially those with very low birth weight)54 have higher
odds of being relinquished in a maternity or health facility than children with a normal birth weight.55
The majority of these children come from single-mother families (young mothers), an unknown father,
and no support from the extended family (approximately 75 percent of children relinquished straight
after birth and 50 percent of those relinquished in health units). The others belong to a nuclear family,
most often young couples with little or no support from their extended family.
Children of mothers with mental health problems run 1.8 times more risk of being relinquished
straight after birth than the average. For children with mothers with both physical disabilities and
mental health problems, the odds are 1.5 times higher than average. For children of mothers with
physical disabilities and/or with chronic diseases (such as tuberculosis), the risk of relinquishment in
the maternity ward is average.
Children of teenage mothers are twice as likely to be relinquished at birth as other children. The odds
of being relinquished straight after birth incrementally decrease from 52 percent of all children with
adolescent mothers to 35 percent of children with mothers aged 18 to 24 years, to 20 percent of
children with mothers between 25 and 39 years old, and to a low of 10 percent for children born to
mothers aged 40 or over (Annex 6 Table 11). The probability is even higher if the father is unknown

50
  This result may also be affected by the fact that many children relinquished straight after birth have unknown mothers
and fathers. So regardless of where those parents might live, the babies are registered in an urban area because most
hospitals are located in urban areas.
51
  The majority of children relinquished in maternity or other health facilities are either Romanians (42 to 44 percent) or
have undeclared ethnicity (36 to 37 percent).
52
  In addition, information on health status is not available for about 9 percent of these children. The remaining 55
percent have no disabilities.
53
 Moreover, 12 percent of children left in a medical facility have no information about their health status in their files,
while 37 percent have no disability.
54
     Low birth weight for a liveborn infant is less than 2,500 grams. Very low birth weight refers to less than 1,500 grams.
55
  Only 22 percent of all children in public care have any data about their birth weight in their files. Most of those are
children who arrived in the system after being relinquished in health facilities.

66
(and thus does not acknowledge paternity) and/or the teenage mother has no support from her
parents or extended family. It is worth noting that the children of adolescent mothers represent only 9
percent of all children that followed the route: Relinquished in a maternity ward --> SPS, and a mere 3
percent of those who followed the route: Maternity ward --> Family --> Children left by parents in a
pediatric unit/ other institution --> SPS. For more relevant details, see Chapter 3.2.3.3 on early
pregnancies.
        “Normally, the family doesn’t accept a child born 'out of wedlock,' as they say; this is a problem
        for university and high school students who place their children in public care. They secretly give
        birth to their child, they come from a different county, they get accommodated in a student
        residence, they happen to get [pregnant] without the family finding out about it … They do this,
        they travel from one county to another to give birth, to hide their pregnancy and they relinquish
        their child.” (Focus group with professionals, Braşov)

The rates of these two routes vary substantially across counties. Out of the 24 counties with solid data
in the CMTIS (see Annex 6 Table 1), six counties have particularly large numbers of children who
arrived in public care after being relinquished in health institutions (Figure 15 and Annex 6 Table 12).
The counties with an above average incidence of relinquishment in health facilities are Bihor, Dolj,
Harghita, Neamț, Sibiu, Vaslui, and Vâlcea. However, there are other counties, such as Gorj or Suceava,
in which both routes are quite rare, while in others both routes are common, such as Bihor and
Harghita. At the same time, there are counties such as Caraș-Severin with a high rate of
relinquishment in maternity wards but a very low rate of relinquishment in pediatric or other health
units.
The mothers of 90 percent of children relinquished straight after birth and 88 percent of those
relinquished in health units are alive and known to the child protection professionals (data on the
father is available in only 23 percent and 37 percent of the cases respectively). Therefore, when
drafting an Individualized Protection Plan for reintegrating the family, data are available on the
parents, but, as many of them have been separated from the child for more than 10 years, the chances
of reintegration are in reality very low for over half of these children.
However, a large proportion of these parents were aged over 40 at the time when the study data were
collected (as of November 2014). Also, little or no information is available about their relatives or
extended family as these parents had no support from their kinship networks.
The qualitative study showed that:
 Often, families do not formally relinquish their child but instead leave them temporarily in public
  care during difficult times (such as winter). Then, as the separation period gets longer, the chances
  that the family will come to take the child out of the public care system are weaker.
        “[In a project implemented by UNICEF in the County of Bihor, they identified...] Places where
        parents were convinced that it was a good thing for the child, to keep them warm during winter.
        And they would use the hospital as a boarding house, as a place to keep them warm. And after a
        couple of months they would go and take them back home. And some of them would forget
        about them [the children]. [...] Yes. They’d get used to being without them. They would say: I did
        the child a favor, it is warm there, s/he has food every day, s/he won’t get bitten by rats, s/he is
        not shoeless in the cold and mud and so s/he will be better off there. And in the meantime they
        would have another baby.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

 For some parents, relinquishment in health units “has become a habit.”
        “And here, in the city of Bacău and in other cities with maternity hospitals, most children in public
        care come from the maternity hospitals, pediatric wards, or other medical facilities. I mean, from
        the places where children are relinquished, where the mothers known for having a baby every
        year go to. And the medical staff know that the other children are already in child care. So we do
        have such cases. We have a mother who already has seven children in public care. Each year, we
        know that, at some point, we’ll get a call to pick up another child from the maternity hospital.”

 In some communities, the relinquishment of children in health units is socially acceptable as long
  as it happens because the mother or the family does not have the means to care for that child. This
  belief is reinforced by the fact that most health units receive the child without any questions and in
  the absence of any counselling or other preventive measures, as well as with no referral to child
  protection professionals.
         ”As I’ve told you, they leave their children in the pediatric ward; they learn this bad practice from
         one another. I mean, for example they come and tell you ‘I can’t feed my kids anymore’ or things
         like that and they come and bring them here. ‘Take them from me, you take them!’ It’s left to us
         to handle them, the children, their child.” (Interview with a specialist, Bacău).
         “I wanted to ask you who suggested the separation? Did you contact the social services yourself
         or did someone come to you?
         - I contacted them, I went to the maternity ward and I told them that I had no means; I told them
         I had no means when I gave birth. [...] They asked: ‘Do you have a place where you can take him,
         what will you do with him?’ And I said that I had no means and that I couldn’t leave him but I
         couldn’t take him home either because I had nowhere to take him. And they understood. So, they
         understood.” (Interview with a parent of institutionalized children, Arad)

 Ocasionally, hospital and maternity ward staff as well as some of the child protection specialists
  encourage or even direct the parents to relinquish their children straight after delivery. This is
  particularly the case for children with disabilities or homeless mothers.56
         “- No, they came to the maternity ward. [...] So I gave birth and just three days later Child
         Protection came, the maternity staff called them, they were supposed to discharge me with the
         girl and I said: where am I to go? So Child Protection came at 8 in the morning, they talked to
         me, I talked to them, they had me sign a piece of paper, it was a statement, I don’t remember
         exactly. And I knew they were supposed to come and take her from me and they took her but I
         wasn’t present. No. I’m telling you the truth. I went out to buy her clothes, she needed clothes
         and on my way back to the maternity ward I ran into the Child Protection people and I told them
         'I hope you’ll let me know when you come to take her from me.' I knew I had to give her up, I did
         sign everything after all, I was aware of it, but I knew that they could only take her in my
         presence. That’s what I knew. Yes, and that’s when they dropped the bomb that they had already
         taken her, otherwise I would have gone there only to find her gone. And the next day I went
         straight to Child Protection to see her, they told me where to go, I cried, that was that. Now I
         thank God because, in a way, they wanted to help me but right then I didn’t...

         And what was the reason? Did the girl have health problems?
         - No, the girl wasn’t sick, but I didn’t have a place to live.” (Interview with a parent of
         institutionalized children, Bacău)

 In other cases, the request and decision to place the child in public care is based on incomplete
  information or on the prejudices of the hospital and maternity ward staff or even of the child
  protection specialists, particularly in relation to Roma mothers and children.
         ”Look, talking about children from maternity wards, I know a few cases and situations like that,
         mothers from Pata Rât [source community from Cluj-Napoca] who left their newborn child at the
         maternity ward and a protection measure was needed. We got things straight when everybody
         realized that actually the mother had another child at home and she had gone home to take care
         of him or her because, well, that’s what she thought she should do. For other mothers, the
         ending is not so happy.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

 In addition, to ensure the accuracy of the official data and a correct understanding of the
  phenomenon of child-family separation, the interviewed professionals considered it important to
  distinguish between causes and effect. They stressed that child relinquishment in health
  institutions is an effect and should not be reported as the cause of separation. One should look
  into the causes associated with mothers’ or parents’ specific circumstances, with labeling or


56
  There are no recent studies in this respect, but it would seem this particular practice now takes place to a lesser extent
than it used to at the beginning of the 1990s, as described in the first study on the causes of child institutionalization in
Romania (MS, IOMC and UNICEF, 1991)

                                                                                                                         69
       prejudice such as “underage mothers, mentally retarded mothers, [and] mothers who use drugs
       and alcohol.” (Focus group with professionals, Ploieşti).
Given the large numbers of children who entered the system as a result of being relinquished in
maternity wards or health facilities, it is essential to limit these two routes in order to reduce the total
number of children in public care in the future. To this end, many measures have been established.
The government adopted an action plan in March 2007. However, at the time of the research
(November-December 2014), several of its measures had not been developed or implemented
nationwide or their implementation had been uneven. These measures included: (i) setting up a
coherent system for reporting and monitoring data on child relinquishment and the risk of
relinquishment; (ii) standardizing the written forms and the procedures for registering women
admitted into maternity wards to give birth; (iii) hiring social workers in all health units proportional to
the number of doctors in the unit; and (iv) developing procedures for keeping records of mothers and
children with no identity papers and creating a database of these records. In 2014, the government
adopted Government Decision 1103/2014 approving the methodology for implementing the
responsibilities assigned to the local public authorities, institutions, and professionals involved in
preventing and responding in cases of children at risk of relinquishment or relinquished in medical
units, a decision that came into force in March 2015, after our research data had been collected.
In the present context, cross-sectoral mechanisms are needed on the frontline that combine health
care and social services. Improved monitoring of the health status of all pregnant women is clearly
needed, particularly for single mothers and teenage mothers who are the most likely to relinquish
their children straight after birth. This falls under the responsibility of the health services, both primary
care and community-based ones, but should be combined with a clear mechanism and protocols for
the early identification of pregnant women who are highly likely to relinquish their newborns and for a
timely referral of these women to the social services. This would enable the social services to provide
pregnant women with counseling and support services as early as possible and to develop a
permanency plan, if necessary, by the time the child is born.
Since “nowadays, it is too easy to leave a child in a hospital,”57 coordination and referral between
health units (especially maternity and pediatric units) and social services at the local level (especially
the community health nurse and SPAS social worker) need to be improved. The professionals
interviewed for the study (both from the child protection system and from NGOs) insisted that on the
preventive side:
 Social workers should be available in all health units that have maternity and/or pediatric wards in
  accordance with the legislative provisions on protecting and promoting children’s rights.58
 When mothers (parents) show up at a health unit with no identity papers, this should be
  considered without exception as a high-risk situation for child relinquishment and should be
  treated accordingly.59 This will require the development of reporting and response mechanisms
  involving the social services (child protection services) and the police (for identification purposes)
  in conjunction with the medical units. Otherwise, for the relinquished children, “the father is a
  fiction and the mother is only probable.”
            “Yes, the mother doesn’t give us her [identity] papers and then ... Then, we are flick-flaking
            around to find the identity documents that are nowhere to be found. The father is just a story
            and the mother is only probable. And so the child is placed in public care where they stay for a
            year until you find the papers. Yes, this is the problem, the fact that they have to stay in child care
            for a year until you find their parent. Anyway, the parent has forgotten, the mother has forgotten,
            I suppose she’s forgotten, it’s all in the past and she actually doesn’t want the child anymore. But,
            if right when it happens the people at the hospital said: 'come and see, there is a mother who
            was over there and now she has one foot out the door, come and see quickly, let’s do something.

 Work procedures in hospitals and maternity wards preventing the possibility of a mother leaving
  her child alone in the hospital for several days should be rigorously applied.
         “In my opinion, the collaboration with the hospitals is very deficient because we are talking about
         very young children whom we place in public care and if you don’t reintegrate them within a year
         they will never reintegrate again, that’s common knowledge. Hospitals should be more
         responsible for these children and not let the mother leave the child and wait for her to come
         back maybe a week later. So I find it unthinkable to let a mother leave the child for a week
         hoping she will come back. There’s no such thing, you need to take action, have staff there
         working on this...” (Focus group with professionals, Timişoara)



FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The survey of rural source communities confirms the concern of child protection professionals about
children who are left alone in hospital by their mothers for seven days or more. These children have an
81 percent likelihood of ending up in public care compared to only 28 percent for children who stay
together with their mothers in maternity wards for more than seven days (for instance, because of low
birth weight) and to only 14 percent for those who spend less than seven days in the maternity ward
after birth. Consequently, a consistent and uniform use of the relevant work procedures in hospitals
would have the potential to prevent at least part of the high rates of child relinquishment in maternity
wards.

are not weighted (N=1,140 children).

At the community level, it is necessary to improve social assistance work, particularly with regard to
providing all potential beneficiaries with information and counseling services, support in obtaining
identity papers, and equal access to proper benefits and services. Also of use would be sexual
education and family planning programs targeted to at-risk groups such as single-mothers and
adolescent or teenage parents, though these would not immediately or directly reduce the number of
children relinquished in health facilities.
          “In general, some Roma women have six, seven, eight children and maybe two or three in public
         care, they may have a disabled child at home, they have young daughters of fifteen, sixteen who
         also end up having children and just don’t use contraception, either because of ethnic beliefs,
         that the man is there for her and the man refuses contraception, or .... if we manage to empower
         them, as current laws don’t stipulate contraception for uninsured social cases [without health
         insurance].60 We have doctors who help us out of their kindness and they actually volunteer to
         insert the IUD for free. We get the IUDs from the Sera foundation in Bucharest. But, unfortunately,
         we cannot push things. And there are women – they’re famous at the directorate – who give birth
         to a child every year or every year and a half.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca).

   In accordance with Order 386 of March 31, 2015 on approving the Technical Norms for implementing national public
health programs for 2015 and 2016 (page 214), the population groups who have access to free contraception include:
pupils, students, unemployed, people living on the Guaranteed Minimum Income, individuals from rural areas, any
person self-declaring before the family doctor that he or she does not have the necessary income to buy contraceptives,
and women who have had an abortion for one year after the intervention. At the same time, the framework contract
from 2015 and 2016 states that the minimum package of primary health care services includes family planning
consultations, therefore these are delivered also to the un-insured population (page 1, Annex 1).

                                                                                                                    71
                           Box 3: Example of Good Practice - First Step in Life

The “First Step in Life” Program is being jointly implemented in the town of Bârlad (County of Vaslui) by the
local Directorate for Social Assistance (DAS), the local hospital, and the DGASPC. The program is funded by
private donors from the Netherlands.
As part of the program, a baby starter set is given to each newborn irrespective of their mother’s and parents’
financial means. The set consists of at least seven items, including between five and seven pieces of newborn
clothing, hygiene products for the mother, and hygiene products for the baby.

       “- This contributes greatly to preventing child abandonment, the part that you are interested in.
         Please explain.

         - The hospital-based social worker is responsible for social assistance activities. We drafted a
         questionnaire for social inquiry purposes that actually identifies any problem and any risk of
         child abandonment in that environment. Indeed, we have children who are exposed to a great
         risk of being abandoned. When that happens, the hospital-based social worker contacts the
         social worker from the Directorate [DAS] and then the Directorate comes ... and takes over the
         case saying ‘this could be a problem because these people don’t have a home, I don’t know,
         the financial situation, the family situation could pose a risk’. So they take over and, how
         should I say, they follow up on the case from that time on. And prevention is done from then
         on...
         So the program has a real impact as regards the prevention of child-family separation?

         - Absolutely because, when the mother and the family were encouraged and effectively
         supported with shelter, food, and everything they needed for their daily life, with information
         to make her [the mother] more balanced as a person, child abandonment was prevented by
         default.

         Moreover, also with Chance Life Association we run another project related to this, which
         carries forward the Directorate’s initiative of providing all new mothers with a sort of starter
         set for the child and even for the mother. The set includes about eight or nine good quality
         clothing items. I mean, if she is a mother with no sources of income, she gets everything she
         needs to be discharged from the hospital with the baby, to be able to take care of the baby
         for up to three months, since the clothing sizes are for ages 0 to 3 months. And they get
         bodysuits, one-pieces, jumpsuits, and so on, even a blanket or some sort of a cover; hygiene
         products, shampoo, and good soap for the baby in enough quantities to last for up to one
         year. There, the project is implemented in partnership with the Directorate, the local council,
         and the hospital. The hospital has made its social worker available for this and ….upon
         discharge all the mothers are informed that they can go and get that starter set. When they
         do that, a social inquiry is carried out and at-risk mothers are identified, but practically all the
         mothers are given the package without exception. All the mothers who show up there get it,
         provided that they agree to that social inquiry and to having their photo taken with the
         products, which we send to the donors as proof that they received them. The social worker
         informs the mother about the use of the products because we had mothers who didn’t know
         how to use them. We have, for example, mosquito or insect repellents, some even with
         sunscreen, which we normally offer in the spring, summer and autumn when there is a high
         risk of mosquitoes, fleas, and other such things and the mother is informed about how to use
         the products, how to keep the child safe.
         And if they identify at-risk cases, they refer them to the mothers’ center where we also provide
         support in the so-called ‘next step’ where the mother can come regularly and take clothing
         and hygiene products as the child grows up and even for the other children in the family so
         that she doesn’t feel all alone or say that she doesn’t have the means and eventually choose
         to abandon the child. When she sees that she gets material support and information, this
         impacts her as a mother and she is no longer likely to give her child up.”

Besides preventing child relinquishment in medical units, it is also important to consider ways of
improving the outcomes for those children who experience this relinquishment. The key to improving
those outcomes is to minimize the time spent by the relinquished child in the medical facility. This
situation has improved since 2007. Figure 13 shows the number of children at the national level who
arrived in public care via the route: Relinquished in a maternity ward --> SPS, as well as the average
length of stay in a maternity ward by year. The data from the children's files indicate that the national
average length of stay in health units during the 1990s abruptly increased and then decreased,
reaching about 100 days just before the year 2000. Subsequently, it fluctuated between 90 to 100 days
during 1999 to 2008 and declined to around 63 to 81 days since 2008.
The number of children who entered the public care system due to relinquishment straight after birth
and who still were in the system by November-December 2014 followed a different trend. It sharply
increased during the 1990s, reaching a peak of over 1,200 children in 2001. Thereafter, it declined to a
minimum of around 350 children during the time of the global crisis in 2009, after which it increased
again to over 850 children in 2013.

            Number of children arrived in public care after being relinquished at birth in a maternity ward
            Average duration of stay in maternity before being placed in the special protection system (number of days)

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=12,501).

The most recent data, for 2014, shed some light on how to interpret these statistics. Thus, in 2014, the
children who arrived in the system after being relinquished in maternity wards formed two distinct
groups: (i) a majority (80 percent) of babies transferred and placed by the DGASPC in about 46 days
and (ii) a small group (20 percent) of babies born in 2013 who had spent an average of nearly 200
days (6 to 7 months) in maternity units before being taken by the DGASPC. Consequently, the
statistics for a given year may be affected by a particular policy decision or regulation or by the
resources available to the DGASPC in the previous year(s). For example, hypothetically in one year, a
lower number of children entering the system than in the previous year may mean that fewer children
were relinquished in medical units, but it might also be the result of the fact that only some of the
relinquished children were taken in by the DGASPC, while many other children remained behind in the
maternity ward without being transferred to a child protection service. In the hypothetical following
year, the enforcement of a new regulation requiring shorter deadlines for transferring children from
maternity wards to the child protection system and/or an increase in the number of available foster
parents may lead to an increase in the average length of stay in maternity because the children who
remained behind in the previous year (who thus spent a long time in the hospital) would be also
transferred into the system.




                                                                                                                                   73
The official reports on children relinquished in maternity wards and other medical units during 2008 to
2014 reinforce this. As Figure 14 shows, every year, out of all relinquished children, about one-third
are returned to their families, around half are placed in the protection service in the same year, while
the other 15 to 20 percent remain in the hospital and are not transferred to the protection service
until the following year or even later.
Girls and boys have similar average lengths of stay in maternity wards after being relinquished and
before being taken into the protection service. However, the following categories of children tend to
have longer stays in maternity wards:
    Children with disabilities
    Children with very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams)
    Roma children
    Children of mothers who died in hospital
    Children of mothers who ran away from hospital.
This is most likely because these children have no identification papers, but it may also be a result of
the lack of readily available response services (such as dedicated foster care families, including for
emergency situations) for children aged 0 to 2 years old.61

Note: Official reports before 2008 are not available. Also, the available reports do not distinguish between the
placement of children relinquished in maternity wards and those relinquished in pediatric or other health units.
For this reason, the figure refers to both kinds of relinquishment in institutions and does not limit its coverage to
children relinquished straight after birth.

The average length of stay in maternity wards varies widely across counties, irrespective of the year or
period considered. It also varies widely within any given county from one year to another (Annex 6
Table 13). For the entire period 1989 to 2014, it ranges from a minimum of 24 days in Gorj to a
maximum of 169 days in Constanța (with a national average of 94 days), as shown in Figure 15. This
sizable disparity, both in terms of territory and between different years, might be determined by
specific characteristics of the child population or by the way in which the county institutions -
DGASPCs and medical units - are organized and cooperate with each other with regard to children
relinquished in maternity wards.

  The institutionalization of children 0 to 2 years old was legally banned starting 2005. In 2014, it was extended to
children under 3 years old (with the exception of severely disabled children who may be placed in residential services).

In order to test the significance of the above mentioned determinants of the average length of stay in
maternity wards before being placed in the child protection service, we used a regression model. This
is presented in Annex 6 Table 14. This exercise shows that:
 All other things being equal or held constant, the most powerful determinant is the year in which
  the child joined the protection system. The longer ago that was, the longer the time the child spent
  in the maternity ward before being placed in the system.
 The characteristics of the child are also significant determinants. Having a disability, being left
  behind by a mother who died or ran away from the hospital, and, especially, having a very low
  birth weight (under 1,500 grams) are individual circumstances that increase a child’s length of stay
  in the maternity ward before being taken by the DGASPC.
 However, only one individual characteristic is not significant, all other things being equal or held
  constant, namely ethnicity. This means that the fact that Roma children have longer average stays
  in maternity wards is not because of their ethnicity, but because of the other factors such as the
  child’s disability, low birth weight or mother’s disappearance (deceased or left62).
 The institutional factors - how well the DGASPCs and the medical units at the county level are
  organized and cooperate - are also significant. The county effect shows that, ceteris paribus,
  compared to Constanța (the reference county), the other counties perform better in this area, with
  a few exceptions, namely Botoșani, Galați, Neamț, and, to a lesser extent, Covasna and Bistrița-
  Năsăud.

 It may be that, at least in some cases, the mother’s departure from the maternity ward is reported differently for Roma
women than for women of other ethnicity, but this research found no data to support this theory.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
Of the children in public care in November-December 2014, over 9,500 children were placed in public care
straight after their birth. An additional 6,700 children were taken home with their mothers but a few months
later were relinquished in a health unit. These two categories of children differ only regarding the age at which
they entered the system.
Children with disabilities and those with low birth weight have a significant higher likelihood of being
relinquished in medical units and of spending a longer period of time in maternity wards before being taken
into the child special protection system. Children from urban areas and Roma children are statistically over-
represented among children relinquished in a health unit and in particular among those relinquished in
maternity wards (14 percent of children relinquished in a maternity ward and 17 percent of those relinquished
in another medical unit respectively) The likelihood that the mothers of children relinquished straight after birth
are teenagers is of 52 percent. Data are available on the mothers of most of these children.

The efforts to prevent child relinquishment in health units should be substantially strengthened and monitored,
as follows:

    Although children are most often relinquished in health units, efforts and services for preventing this
     phenomenon should be intensified firstly in the community. Social workers or people with social assistance
     duties together with community health workers and family doctors should be more active and better
     prepared to early identify and monitor the at-risk situations for child and mother.
    The health monitoring of all pregnancies by community workers (especially by community health workers)
     is strongly needed along with clear mechanisms and protocols to enable the early identification of
     pregnant mothers who are highly likely to relinquish their newborns and their immediate referral to the
     local social services.
    Sexual education and family planning programs for at-risk groups such as single-mothers and teenage
     parents should be developed or resumed, particularly in source communities. Free contraceptives should
     be made available to vulnerable groups, whether these groups are covered by health insurance or not.
     Information, education, and communication campaigns on family planning and its benefits are also needed.
     In addition, support should be provided to vulnerable groups to reduce the cost of transportation to reach
     the family planning centers.
    In order to prevent the consequences of teenage pregancies, we also recommend prevention programs
     that can include: (i) classes on health, sexual education, and contraceptive education initiated as early as
     possible and implemented on a permanent basis in both schools and communities (available to those who
     do not attend school) and (ii) awareness and social norm changing campaigns on the relations between
     parents/adults and children, decision-making autonomy for youths, and youth participation in decisions
     that affect their life.
    The coordination and referral system between health units (especially maternity and pediatric wards) and
     social services should be improved in accordance with the legislative provisions that are currently in force.
    Social workers should be available in all health units with maternity and/or pediatric wards according to the
     legal provisions that are currently in force. Other specialists should also be available, for instance,
     psychologists working with mothers in special situations (for example, with post-partum depression).

    According to the methodology on prevention and response in cases of children at risk of relinquishment or
     relinquished in health units (Government Decision 1103/2014), cases when mothers (or parents) show up at
     medical units with no identity papers should be considered without exception as a high-risk situation for
     relinquishment and therefore should be addressed urgently, with speedy resolution for both mother
     (parents) and child.
    All hospital and maternity ward work procedures aimed at preventing mothers from leaving their children
     alone in the hospital for several days should be strictly implemented.
    Adequate special protection response services for 0 to 3-year-old children should be developed and
     strenghtened in all counties of the country (for instance, to increase the availability of foster parents to
     urgently take these children in), particularly for children with disabilities and/or with very low birth weight.

    All measures should be correlated and integrated with the pregnancy identification and monitoring efforts
     that should be carried out before birth (as part of the prenatal services) and with the community-based
     support services for the mother/parents and the newborn child (as part of postnatal services).

3.1.3.3            Street Routes
Street routes are less common, but were followed by 3.3 percent of all children in public care in
November-December 2014 (Infograph Chart 2). In most cases, these were the children of single
mothers or young families who either had unstable accommodation or were homeless (1.9 percent of
children) or who left their children on the street or in a public space such as in a taxi, in a field, or at a
post office, department store, railway station, or public lavatory (0.9 percent of children). The others,
about 0.5 percent of all children in the child public care system, represent street children or children
who ran away from home. These routes are not associated with any other specific characteristics of
the child, mother, or family.
However, the proportion of children who followed the street routes is much higher in certain counties.
In seven counties (Arad, Bihor, Constanța, Dâmbovița, Dolj, Harghita, and Satu Mare), 5 to 8 percent of
children in public care come from the streets, whereas in others (such as Bistrița-Năsăud, Galați or
Hunedoara) the proportion is less than 1 percent.
The lack of effective preventive measures and support services for children and families at the
community level is a strong explanatory factor for these cases in the opinion of the professionals who
were interviewed for the study. Mothers or parents in need often ask the various local institutions for
help, but when they get no actual support, the only solution they can think of is to leave their child in
public care.
Alternatively, adolescents from families in need decide to strike out on their own and “they start
running away from home at the age of 12 and continue until they turn 14 when they end up in the
system ...”
         “... the eldest [child] would repeatedly run away from home, he would be found by the police and
         brought back home ... No other services. This went on for about two years, then she took the
         child to the Directorate for Social Assistance and then there was nothing she could do because
         he would teach the other two kids at home bad things: ’I can’t take care of him anymore, I don’t
         know what to do anymore.’ And then the family felt overwhelmed and the child ended up in child
         care.” (Interview with a professional, Bacău)



 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
 Street routes into the child protection system are not common but are the case for an average of over 3
 percent of all children in public care, with this share reaching as high as 8 percent of all children in public care
 in some counties.

 Most of these children come from single mother families with no stable accommodation or homeless who stay
 wherever they can. And precisely because they are not able to find any support from their extended families
 and because the relationships they have without being married provide them with accommodation but are not
 stable, they eventually end up on the street with their children for shorter or longer periods. Therefore, this
 route shows the fact that some children are separated from their family because of the lack of a national
 program of social housing services for the most vulnerable population, especially single mothers with children
 and because of the lack of preventive and support services for children and families at the community level.
 This shows once again the need to draft and implement a policy targeting young mothers with no education
 and in vulnerable situations (in other words, living alone or within a consensual union, being economically
 dependent, lacking a stable dwelling in which to live with their child, and in poor health).

 The second category of children following this route – street children and/or children who ran away from
 home – represent only 0.5 percent of all children in the child protection system (about 300 children).
 Nevertheless, special attention needs to be paid to them as there are likely to be other children in this
 situation who are not yet in the system. Little is known about the number and the real situation of street
 children and youths as the available data are few and of poor quality.63 However, previous studies show that


63
   In 2009, Save the Children estimated these numbers for three large cities – Bucharest, Brașov, and Constanța. The
number of children identified varied between 800 and 1,700. Most of them live in the capital city (approximately 1,150).
In the seaside town of Constanța, their number varies by season. Over half of them are children (0 to 17 years old), while
the rest of them are youths aged between 18 and 35. Children living on the streets generally have little education (most

                                                                                                                       77
 street children and youths are denied most of their rights and are excluded from society. 64 Consequently, the
 development of a system for monitoring street children and the services available to meet their needs should
 be a priority in order to ensure their integration in society and to prevent them from ending up on the street
 in the future.65
 In order to prevent street routes, as described above, early identification and early intervention are essential. In
 the absence of any proactive actions to prevent separation, interventions after the child has entered the
 system are likely to be detrimental not only to the child but also to the family, community, and the child
 protection system.




3.1.4                   The Age of Entry into the System
The current population of children in public care consists of children aged 0 to 2666 who entered the
child protection system between 1989 and 2014. However, more than one-third (35 percent) of them
came into the system when they were less than 1 year old (Figure 16). An additional 17 percent were 1
to 2 years old when they entered the system. Much lower proportions of children in public care
entered the system at other ages.

However, this is a snapshot of the population of children in public care at one moment in time. Child
protection is a dynamic system, with entries and exits on a daily basis, and children who enter or leave
the system may belong to any age group. Annex 6 Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of children in
public care by age groups and age at entry.



of them finished primary school at most), with begging being their main source of income, followed by daily casual work
and car or windscreen washing. Generally, they have little or no access to services. Although in Bucharest the situation is
better, with over half of the respondents (56 percent) receiving services at one time or another, in Brașov and Constanța
very few received these services (Lazăr and Grigoraș, 2009).
64
   For instance, Alexandrescu (2002) or Lazăr and Grigoraș (2009). Living on the streets is accompanied by severe health
problems, chronic malnutrition, school dropout and illiteracy (approximately 50 percent), physical abuse (sometimes
from the police), sexual abuse (usually started within the family and continued on the streets), stigmatization and
discrimination, limited access to social services (education, health services, and social assistance), drug, diluent, or
solvent consumption, and even prostitution.
65
   Even though there are national policies meant to reduce the numbers of homeless children (and adults), the current
initiatives are limited to providing social support, access to emergency and temporary housing and health services.
NGOs, on the other hand, offer health assistance, education, psychosocial support and, sometimes houses, using street
techniques and implementing campaigns to increase public awareness of this phenomenon. Nevertheless, their actions
have only limited coverage and they are highly dependent on availability of funding, especially from international
donors.

     It also includes young people over the age of 26 years old who are still in the system.

If we confine the analysis to the “complete” age groups, Table 9 shows that children aged 15 to 19
who entered the system some time between 1989 and 2014 and were still in the system in 2014 have
a fairly balanced distribution by age of entry into the system. Nevertheless, children who entered the
child protection system when they were under 3 years old still account for about one-third of those
entries.


 CONCLUSION

 Early childhood, the period between 0 and 3 years of age, is the most important development phase for a
 child. Therefore, being separated from their parents, particularly during this phase, can have devastating and
 long-term effects on the child.
 Over half of the children placed in public care entered the system at early ages (0 to 3 years old), mostly under
 12 months old. As a consequence, most of them spent their early childhood within the system. Since a large
 share entered the system through the two routes related to relinquishment in health facilities, preventing and
 narrowing these two routes is essential (see the conclusions and recommendations in section 3.1.3.2).




3.1.5               Child Development Status Before Entering
                    the Child Protection System
This final section on the period before entering child protection system focuses on children’s
development status along four dimensions: health, education, family relationships, and risky behavior.
The socioeconomic status of these children is analyzed in section 3.2.5.1.



3.1.5.1              Children's Identity Documents
Without identity papers, a child cannot benefit from any available social benefits or services, including
some rights such as the placement allocation. Therefore, it is relevant whether a child has a personal
identification number (CNP) before entering the system or not. The vast majority (84 percent) had a
CNP when they joined the system. However, over 15 percent of children in public care either had no
identity papers at entry (8 percent) or their case files did not contain any information in this regard
(more than 7 percent).

Most children with no identification number at entry entered the system either after being
relinquished in health units or via one of the street routes.



3.1.5.2              Children's Health
There is no procedure for documenting the development status of children when they first enter the
child protection system. As a result, most children's case files contain no relevant data on their health
status at the time of entry, with 84 percent missing data on weight and height for age, 56 percent
having no information on vaccinations, 43 percent making no mention of nourishment, and 54
percent having no baseline psychological assessment (see Table 11).
However, the available data indicate that child protection professionals have to manage a population
of children characterized by the so-called “double burden of disease,”67 that is the coexistence of
over-nutrition and obesity with under-nutrition as well as disabilities and various other chronic
diseases. Although only 57 percent of the children's files contain information on nutrition, the study
team found that one in every ten children showed signs of malnourishment or undernourishment at
the time of entry. Accordingly, some children were underweight,68 while others were overweight or
obese.69

  Having a low body mass that is below minus two standard deviations from the median for the age or gender of
standard population. According to a UNICEF study, in Romania, all other things being equal or held constant, belonging
to a severely poor household significantly increases the probability of a child having a low body mass and, thus, of being
underweight. On the other hand, the older the child and the longer she or he is exclusively breastfed, the less likely she
or he is to be underweight regardless of where they live, of whether the child is a boy or a girl, of how much she or he
weighed at birth, of how good or bad the health of the mother is, of how many children there are in the household, and
how much food comes from the household’s production in their own garden or on their own land. (Stănculescu et al.,
2012:40)

  A national study of the population aged 0 to 2 showed that the prevalence of overweight (including obese) children
had increased to 5.4 percent in 2010 versus 4.2 percent in 2004 (Nanu et al., 2011:22). The corresponding proportion of
children in care who were overweight when they entered the system was about 17 percent when taking into account
only valid data.

Specifically due to poor nutrition, many children arrive in the protection system with a legacy of low
resistance to infections and prone to “the vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth,
often with irreversible damage to their cognitive and social development.”70 Furthermore, for children
in public care, malnourishment is highly correlated with illnesses related to poor hygiene (such as
scabies or lice). The children most exposed to these risks are premature babies relinquished in
maternity wards, children from rural areas with a single-father and less frequently from a nuclear
family, and children who arrived in the system via street routes.
About 11 percent of children in public care had a disability before their arrival in the protection system.
Almost one-third of those over the age of 3 at the time of entry had a disability that was severe
enough that they could not be self-sufficient in their basic daily activities and another third needed
support. However, evaluations conducted on children after they entered the system showed that many
other children had serious health problems, so that the share of children with disabilities (upon entry
into the system or identified afterwards) increases to 29 percent of all children in the system.
Fewer than half of the children received a baseline psychological evaluation. For those who did receive
such an evaluation, many were judged to have various delays or disorders in one or more of the
following dimensions: emotional, cognitive, behavioral, psychophysiological, or personality, as well as
a lack of interpersonal relationship skills. In addition, many children in public care had to be registered
with a family doctor in order to receive the appropriate vaccinations for their age.



3.1.5.3               Children's Education
There is more information in the case files on children’s education before they entered the system
than on their health, but there are no comprehensive assessments of their education-related
challenges or performance (Figure 17). Only about half (46 to 64 percent) of children in each age
group were attending school with no risk of dropping out. The others were either out of school (never
in school or school dropouts) or were at risk of dropping out.71 Out of all children who had ever
attended school, about 3 to 5 percent in each age group were in a special school, while the vast
majority of them were in a mainstream school. For about 20 percent of children in each age group, the
files contain little or no information on education.

     Comprehensive information on school dropouts or the risk of dropping out is very rare in the files.

82
Around 9 percent of children who were 11 to 17 years old at entry were dropouts, and this figure is
even higher for children with disabilities (15 percent) and for Roma children (19 percent). Dropouts are
divided more or less equally between girls and boys and those from urban and rural areas. Also,
among children aged between 11 and 17 at entry, the proportion of children who had never attended
school before entering the child protection system was higher than average (7 percent) among Roma
children (12 percent) and children with disabilities (over 23 percent). The probability of being out of
school (never in school or a school dropout) was considerably higher for children who arrived in the
system via the following routes: Maternity ward --> Family --> Children left home alone --> SPS,
Maternity ward --> Family --> Non-Relatives --> SPS, and the three street routes.
The risk of school dropout is mentioned most often in the files for children aged 11 to 17 years old,
particularly boys from rural areas who belong to a family with a stable dwelling (either with a single-
mother or a nuclear family).
At the time of entering the protection system, children with special educational needs (SEN)
represented 9 percent of all those of school age (6 to 17 years old). However, this share may be even
higher (Annex 6 Table 15) because children are not given a baseline assessment when they enter the
system. The proportion of children with SEN is considerably higher among adolescents (aged 15 to 17
at entry) and among children with disabilities (38 percent). Almost half of all children with SEN (aged 6
to 17 at entry) were not in school before they entered the protection system (23 percent had never
attended school and 8 percent had dropped out of school) or were at risk of dropping out of school
(18 percent). Thus, fewer children with SEN had been in school than children without SEN, and this
applied to kindergarten as well. Furthermore, a significantly large proportion of children with SEN (25
percent) had gone to special schools rather than mainstream schools, and more than 10 percent had
repeated grades. A comparison between children with SEN and the other children is presented in
Annex 6 Table 16.



3.1.5.4                Children's Relationship with their Family of Origin
Although the main caretaker of nearly all the children in care is known, only some of the children had
spent enough time at home to build a relationship with their parents or caretaker. This relationship
was “good” for only 39 percent of children in care aged 4 to 17 years old at entry, while it was
“problematic” for 33 percent of them. As for the other 28 percent, there was no information in their
files regarding their relationship with their parents or caretaker.
The relationship with the parents or caretaker does not vary according to a child's age, gender,
ethnicity, or health status. Instead, it varies depending on the type of family of origin72 and the route73
by which the child arrived in the protection system (see Annex 6 Figures 3 and 4). Children with one or
more siblings who either live together or are also in public care are considerably more likely to have a
problematic relationship with their parents or caretaker. Thus, the proportion of children with
problematic relationships increases from 25 percent of children without siblings to 40 percent of
children living together with siblings or with two or more siblings in public care.
Children left home alone and children relinquished in health units, public spaces, or on the street are
the most likely to have a “problematic” relationship with their parents or caretaker. The children who
have the best relationships are those who come from extended families or those whose main
caretaker was a relative, usually their grandmother or grandparents.
In conclusion, almost 40 percent of all children in public care74 had sad or no memories of the time
spent with their families prior to entering the system.

3.1.5.5         Children's Risky Behavior
Fourteen percent of children who were 7 to 17 years old when they entered the protection system had
already been exposed to one or more kinds of risky behaviors before entering the system.
Running away from home is the most common risky behavior (Table 12). Some children ran away from
home repeatedly before entering the system.

Risky behavior is more frequent among adolescents, boys, and children from urban areas, particularly
those from families with no support from their kinship network as well as those with a mother or
parents who were more than 40 years old at the time of the child's entry. Children with a problematic
relationship with their parents are five times more likely to have been exposed to risky behavior than
children with good relationships with their parents (29 percent versus 6 percent). The majority of
children exposed to risky behavior arrive in the system either from the street or, for those with older
parents, directly from their family.

RECOMMENDATIONS
When they first enter the child protection system, many children have serious health problems, little
education, have either no memories or distressing memories of their families, and have experienced various
kinds of risky behavior. All of these factors are critical for understanding the child's history, development
status, and specific needs.
Therefore, when entering the system:

        10 percent of children in public care showed signs of malnutrition or undernutrition, but only 57
          percent of children’s files include information on nutrition. In addition, malnutrition is strongly
          associated with diseases caused by poor hygiene (such as scabies or lice).
        11 percent had a disability, and among those over 3 years old, only one-third were self-sufficient in
          their daily basic activities. The evaluations conducted after entering the system show that children
          with disabilities represent almost 29 percent of all children in the system.

        17 percent were facing various disorders or delays, but less than half of them received an initial
          psychological assessment.

        17 percent of them were not registered with a family doctor, and 31 percent of the children’s files do
          not include information on this.

        30 percent had received all of the vaccines for their age, but 56 percent of the children’s files contain
          no information on vaccinations.

        Only approximately half (46 to 64 percent) of the children within each age group aged from 6 to 17
          years old went to school and did not present any risk of school dropout. The others were either out
          of school (never went to school or had dropped out of school) or were at risk of school dropout.
        A school dropout rate of approximately 9 percent was registered among children aged 11 to 17 years
          when entering the system, up to 15 percent among children with disabilities, and 19 percent for
          Roma children, both for boys and girls in both urban and rural areas.

        14 percent of children aged 7 to 17 years old when entering the system had been exposed to risky
          behaviors before their entry into the system. Having a problematic relationship with their parents
          increases fivefold the likelihood of a child being exposed to risky behaviors (29 percent versus 6
          percent of children in good relationships).
        28 percent of the files for children aged 4 to 17 do not include any information on the relationship
          with the parents or caretaker, which influences plans for maintaining a relationship with the family,
        39 percent of children aged 4 to 17 years old in public care are separated from their parents or family
          despite having a “good” relationship with them.
Consequently, upon entering the protection system, all children should receive a comprehensive baseline
assessment of their health (including medical tests, birth weight, weight at time of assessment, height, body
mass, breastfeeding, and any other relevant indicators), education, family relations, and risky behavior. All of
these data should be thoroughly recorded in the children's files and made available to all professionals who
will work with them. In the absence of such data, it will not be possible to base the child’s individualized
protection plan (PIP) on evidence or to establish a connection between the protection services and the specific
history, development stage, and needs of each child. Neither it will be possible to measure outcomes with the
aim of developing and improving protection services from a child-centered perspective.

“Why is it that some of the children are living with you while
others are in public care?
- I didn’t have the means for them [the children in public care],
I didn’t have a place to stay, I didn’t have this house, which
belonged to some Christian brothers. And they built it in the
name of the Lord for children. We lived in a log store, there used to be a log store over here
and we moved it for them to build me a house. But I had no means for them [the children in
public care] and that’s why I took them to the placement center.
So the reason was lack of space?
- I didn’t have enough space, yes.
And was this also the reason why you relinquished the child in the maternity ward?
- I didn’t have a place to bring them to. And I needed … a father; if he were there, but he
wasn’t there either.
I see, the reason was lack of space and of a father?
- Yes, these ones [the children at home] have a father, the others [the children in public care]
didn’t. That’s why they got there because I had no one to raise them with. I couldn’t do it
alone and I also didn’t have a place to bring them to. But these ones have a father, he’s done
things for his children.
Would you like it if these children came back to you?
- If they want to come, I will take them back any time... So, I won’t say ‘No’ to them because I
can’t.”

This section analyzes the process by which children transition from their family to protection services.
It focuses on the main causes of the separation of children from their families and the main
bottlenecks to the effective prevention of such separations.
According to official data collected by the National Agency for the Protection of Child Rights and
Adoption (ANPDCA), the three main causes of children being separated from their families and
entering public care have consistently been poverty (42 percent), abuse and neglect (25 percent), and
disability (10 percent).

With poverty officially stated as being the most frequent cause of separation, Romania is like the other
CEE/CIS countries where “social reasons” prevail as opposed to developed countries in which neglect
and various forms of abuse in the family of origin represent the main cause of children being
separated from their parents (Figure 18).75 Across the CEE/CIS region, the “social reasons” albeit
described in different terms (for example “poverty” in Romania and ”parents’ temporary inability to
take care of the child” in Hungary), are often recorded with no further specific information about the
child's circumstances. In some CEE/CIS countries (Montenegro and Kazakhstan), the main cause is
registered as “abandonment” while other countries (such as Ukraine, Moldova, and Belarus) use the
term “orphan” for children in public care even if 90 percent of them have living parents. Thus, not only
do the countries have different causes for children being taken into care but also use widely different
practices for registering those causes.76

     In developed countries, parental rights are often terminated by the judicial system (Groza and Bunkers, 2014: 167).

   Currently, in Romania, the ANPDCA collects data on causes using a quarterly data sheet (fișă trimestrială), but other
pilot instruments are also used in related fields of expertise.

                                                                                                                                 87
Research has shown, however, that most cases of separation cannot be reduced to one sole cause. In
fact, evidence suggests that separation is determined by multiple and complex vulnerabilities.77 In
most cases, these complex vulnerabilities consist of a varying mixture of extreme poverty, parental
unemployment, poor quality housing or homelessness, poor school attendance or dropout, poor
parenting, domestic violence, a high risk of child neglect and abuse (associated with parents’ alcohol
abuse), young or single parenthood, unstable marriages, low expectations and/or self-esteem, and
learned helplessness. In addition, significant life events may happen, such as the death of a parent, a
serious accident, the imprisonment of a parent, or a house fire, affecting children both directly and
indirectly, while posing both practical and emotional problems for the parents or caretaker that make
it harder for them to respond to their children's needs.
The case files of children in care in Romania provide between one and four causes of separation
(Figure 19). According to these data, two causes – "poverty" on the one hand and "neglect, abuse,
exploitation, or any form of violence," on the other – are mentioned most frequently, both accounting
for the same proportion of 32 percent. In other words, there are differences between the causes of
separation recorded in the children’s case files and those in the ANPDCA official records.
The biggest disparities appear in relation to the following causes: "disappearance of parents",
"poverty" and "other causes." The case files also offer more comprehensive information than the
ANPDCA report with regard to the types of situations that the DGASPCs include in each of these three
categories of causes of separation. "Disappearance of parents" includes parents who left to work
abroad, parents who deserted their homes, parents who are imprisoned, parents who do not
acknowledge their paternity, and unknown parents. "Poverty" includes not only the family’s income
but also their housing conditions. "Other causes" include various situations such as substance abuse,
divorce, separation, unstable relationships, infidelity, teenage mothers/parents, (extended) family not
accepting the newborn, child being relinquished, unwanted pregnancies, low birth weight, children
with behavioral disorders, and prostitution, begging, vagrancy, and other criminal behavior by the
parents and/or the children.

Besides answers to the specific questions on the causes of separation, the current study78 has yielded
a rich set of data that can help analysts to understand the context and determinants of separation,
including factual information and observations from the social inquiries completed by social workers
before the children enter public care, information from the children's case files, the results of a survey
of mothers and caretakers from rural source communities, and the professional opinions of SPAS staff
who work in the rural source communities. Also, the qualitative study (interviews and focus groups)
has brought to light some causes that were not mentioned in the surveys (either the household survey
or the social worker survey).



3.2.1                   Unfortunate Life Events
In this study, unfortunate events refer to the parents’ death or institutionalization. Thus, this section
focuses on true orphans, the children of inmates, and the children of mothers institutionalized in
social institutions or psychiatric hospitals.



 3.2.1.1                Death of Parents: True Orphans
The DGASPC specialists recorded the death of parents as the main cause of separation for 6 percent
of children in public care (Figure 19). According to the factual data presented in Table 14, orphans of
both parents represent about 3 percent of all children in the special protection system (1.4 percent
since their entry into the system and 1.6 percent became orphans of both parents while they were in
the system). Furthermore, 6 percent of children in public care are motherless (4.4 percent since they
entered the system) and 49 percent are fatherless (45 percent had no father since they entered the
system). The figure next to Table 14 shows that the DGASPC specialists recorded the death of a
parent(s) as the main cause of separation not only for true orphans but also for children who have one
parent still living. However, there are cases of orphans of both parents for which the main cause of
separation registered was not the death of their parents. At the same time, the death of the mother,
who is the main caretaker, is often registered as the main cause of separation, whereas the death of
the father is less frequently considered as such, specifically because he is unknown or undeclared in
many cases.

A similar practice of recording the causes of separation can be observed in the social inquiries
completed by SPAS social workers before the children enter into public care. However, social workers
rarely mention this cause of separation (just for 1.1 percent of children), with the death of the parents
being recorded in the social inquiries of fewer than one-third of the children who were true orphans at
the time of their entry into the system.



 3.2.1.2              Imprisoned Parents
About 6 percent of children in public care have one or both of their parents in detention, most of
them since their entry into the protection system (Table 15). As a general practice, the detention of the
parents is only declared the main cause of separation when it refers to the mother. The father's
imprisonment is often seen rather as “a fact of life... he should provide a life for his family.”
            “Normally, all these problems are due to broken families, for example when both parents are in
            detention, when there is drug use or the father has killed the mother, or the other way around,
            the mother in prison for prostitution, the father for theft and so on... So, in general, well, the
            father goes to prison and the mother thus becomes the main provider for the family; and then
            she finds it impossible to support her children within the family and this leads either to the
            children’s institutionalization or to their placement with another family.” (Focus group with
            professionals, Ploieşti)

Specialists tend to record parents' detention under various categories of causes, namely
“disappearance of parents,” “deprivation of parental rights,” or "other causes."

Social inquiries completed by SPAS social workers before children enter the protection system rarely
mention inmate parents in the family's needs assessment (included in the case file). They do so only in
one in every ten cases. Social workers tend to focus on the disappearance of the income earner and
on criminal cases that involve both the mother and the father. Nonetheless, study data from the rural
source communities indicate that social workers consider the detention of a parent as a main cause of
separation, particularly as there is no social program targeted to the children and families of inmates.
Affected families confirm that the imprisonment either of the main income earner or of the main
caretaker has led to severe hardship and thus to the decision to separate the children from the family.
Most of the children with inmate parents arrived in the system at the ages of 1 to 6 years old.79 They
are both boys and girls, and the majority are of a normal development standard, with no disabilities or

special educational needs. They tend to belong to families with many children and to have “good”
relationships with their mother or parents. Before entering the system, they spent some time alone at
home or lived with relatives in various families with an atypical structure, from where they entered the
system together with their siblings. Roma children and those with undeclared ethnicity are over-
represented in this category. Considerably higher than average proportions of children with inmate
parents (8 to 12 percent) are registered in Olt, Gorj, Galați, Hunedoara, and Bucharest (Annex 6 Table
21).

 3.2.1.3             Institutionalized Mother or Parents
Children with mothers or parents institutionalized in social or health institutions (especially psychiatric
hospitals) represent 0.5 percent of all children in public care (Table 16). These children were separated
from the family when they were under 3 years of age, and most of them are boys of Romanian
ethnicity from urban areas. Disproportionately high shares were underweight and had disabilities, as
well as having teenage or young mothers with no support from their kinship network. A larger than
average number of such cases is recorded in Bacău, Botoșani, Buzău, Dâmbovița, Harghita, Neamț,
Vrancea, and Sibiu.

Section 3.1.3.1 has already addressed the route: Maternity ward --> Family: institutionalized single-
mother --> SPS. However, only about a quarter of children with institutionalized parents arrived in the
system via this route. The majority were separated from their mother straight after birth in a maternity
ward or were relinquished by her a few months later in a health unit.
Also, section 3.1.2.1 (Box 2) and section 3.1.2.3 have highlighted the significance of institutionalization
in the mother's life history. One in every ten mothers from the rural source communities spent some
time in public care during their childhood, and once they became mothers themselves, they followed
the same pattern as they had experienced during their own childhood by relinquishing their children
to be brought up in institutions or by other people (usually the grandparents).
The vicious intergenerational cycle of the institutionalization of children is a major concern for
DGASPC professionals. Although this phenomenon may seem insignificant in statistical terms, if
defined as the proportion of affected children in public care, it is much more prominent. According to
the estimates of some specialists, “at least 50 percent of the young people who leave the system send
their own children back in the system.”80

        "From your experience, could you estimate how many young people who leave child care later
        place their own children in public care?
        - At least 50 percent, I think. Considering how many young girls are pregnant...

        - I couldn’t guess. I mean I have seen many young people from child care who are not necessarily
        married but they live together and have children of their own… I know a few cases where they
        keep the children and don’t place them in child care, but…
        - In 50 percent of the cases the children stay with them, and in 50 percent they are placed in
        public care...
        - What I can tell you is that, over time, I have noticed that if someone in the family was
        institutionalized as a child 40 years ago, they turn more willingly to that solution as a last resort
        than those who have never come into contact [with the system] and have never lived that
        experience, not even indirectly. So those who had a personal or…indirect contact with it are more
        prone to it.

        - Yes, they give the child up more easily... It’s hard for me to tell you a number, but from my
        experience, they get this idea, especially if the mother suffers from mental retardation and maybe
        associated behavioral disorders, they do it more easily, at least for a certain period of time until
        the child grows up and is independent. At least for two, three years. This is what I think.

        - I currently have a case of parents from the child care system who have certain limitations, let’s
        call them personal functional limitations. They say that they want ‘my child not to experience
        what I experienced,’ but, you know, these are actually exceptions.” (Focus group with
        professionals, Cluj-Napoca)
        “Children leaving child care have children of their own, and they come and ask for them to be
        institutionalized. During their stay, they kept complaining about the services provided, but they
        perpetuate the very same pattern, doing what their parents did to them.” (Focus group with
        professionals, Braşov)

        “But we also have cases of former child care beneficiaries, women and men, as you’ve already
        been told, who grew up in children’s homes; the girls come and give birth, they leave the child in
        public care and move on. A year or two later, they come back to me with other children or
        pregnant and they leave the child again and so on. There are many such cases.” (Focus group
        with professionals, Timișoara)

Breaking the vicious intergenerational cycle of children's institutionalization will require the child
protection system to tackle the factors that mutually reinforce and perpetuate the relinquishment of
children from generation to generation. For example, much more emphasis must be put on how to
demonstrate to these parents a model of appropriate family identity and behavior and show them
how to develop good parental skills, especially under conditions of poverty and severe material
deprivation.
        ”The lack of a parenting model and attachment disorders... Many of the mothers who abandon,
        parents who abandon their children are people who grew up in institutions or they are people
        who grew up in broken or problematic families and without a family model… the tendency is to…
        avoid taking on the parenting role, [which is another issue] besides poverty.” (Focus group with
        professionals, Cluj-Napoca)



 RECOMMENDATION
 Some of the children in public care are children of parents who in turn, as children, were brought up and
 received care in the special protection system. The present system provides care for the children of children
 brought up in the past system. Many of these parents grew up in the unreformed protection system of late
 1980s-early 1990s, which placed children still in their early childhood in large, depersonalized, rigid
 institutions. The old system characterized by inadequate care in large institutions has created the current
 generation of parents. Today’s system creates a new generation of children who will become parents in the
 next 20 years. The vicious cycle of institutionalization cannot be broken as long as the system does not provide
 parenting skills for children and does not promote a family model and an appropriate model of care and
 upbringing.

3.2.2                     Child Neglect, Abuse, and Exploitation
This section focuses on neglect, abuse, exploitation, and other forms of violence.
In Romania, violence against children, although outlawed since 2004, is still prevalent. Several recent
studies show that in everyday practice, corporal punishment is often used81 and is considered a
“necessary evil.”82 Many parents consider beating their child as a child rearing method,83 because they
have no knowledge of parenting strategies based on positive methods.84
Children are subject to various forms of violence exercised by their adult caretakers - neglect, physical,
verbal, and/or psychological abuse, both in the family and at school.85 According to the ANPDCA’s
official statistics, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases of
violence against children. In 2015, the number of reported cases featuring various forms of neglect,
abuse, and exploitation exceeded the number recorded in 2010 by 11,232 cases. Thus, over 13,500
cases were recorded in December 2015. The most frequently reported cases are of neglect (9,625),
emotional abuse (1,740), and physical abuse (1,164). In these cases, the victims are mostly children
aged 0 to 9 years old and, more rarely, children aged 10 to 17. The phenomenon is reported both in
urban and in rural areas. If neglect, sexual abuse, and exploitation for the purpose of perpetrating
crime are often reported for rural children, cases of sexual exploitation, child labor, and emotional
abuse have a higher incidence in urban areas. Reported cases of physical abuse are distributed equally
between rural and urban areas.

Let's now turn our attention to the children in the special protection system. As Figure 19 shows, 32
percent of children in public care were separated from their families as a result of one or more causes
included in this category (neglect, abuse and exploitation). However, evidence of neglect, abuse, and
exploitation prior to entry into the system is recorded in the case files of 51 percent of the children in
public care. Figure 20 indicates that the way in which the cause of separation is stated in the children’s

     20 percent of parents, according to Grădinaru and Stănculeanu (2013).

  For example, 11 percent of the parents immediately slap their children or pull them by the hair if they do something
wrong (UNICEF, 2014). According to the children, 18 percent say they were beaten with a stick, 13 percent with the belt,
and 8 percent with a wooden spoon during the previous year (Grădinaru and Stănculeanu, 2013).

  Eighty three percent of children are scolded by teachers when they are mistaken, 33 percent of children are insulted or

case files varies among professionals and is not always related to the rest of the data contained in the
case files.
On the one hand, if we consider all children in the special protection system, we see that a small
percentage of children (2 percent) were separated from their families for reasons related to neglect,
abuse, or exploitation (according to the DGASPC experts) without any further evidence on this in the
child’s file (Figure 20). On the other hand, for 22 percent of children in public care, the case files
provide evidence of neglect, abuse, or exploitation prior to their entry into the system, but the cause
for separation stated by the DGASPC specialists refers to associated risk factors (especially poverty)
and not to neglect, abuse, and exploitation per se.
A large share of the case files (28 percent) do not include any information on child neglect, abuse, or
exploitation, which shows that it is not known whether or not these children had gone through such
experience before entering the system (Figure 20). The share goes down to 16 percent if children
relinquished in maternity wards straight after birth are not considered. However, this information is
not available for more than 71 percent of children relinquished in maternity wards.86 To obtain a
comprehensive picture of the extent of neglect, abuse, and exploitation, we exclude the children
relinquished in maternity wards from the analyses presented in the following sections as they were
transferred directly from hospital to a protection service without ever reaching their families of origin.
Also, the relinquishment of children in health units was extensively discussed in Section 3.1.3.2.
Overall, the case files of 51 percent of children in special protection show evidence of neglect, abuse,
or exploitation. The incidence of neglect, abuse, and exploitation increases to 60 percent of children in
public care if those relinquished in maternity wards straight after birth are not considered. Of those 60
percent, 54 percent were subject to various forms of neglect, 15 percent were abused, and 4 percent
experienced exploitation in various forms. Over 14 percent of children (one in every seven) were
subject to various forms of violence (neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation) before entering the child
protection system.
The adverse effects of neglect and abuse upon the child are similar irrespective of the causes,
including feelings of betrayal, guilt, loneliness and a lack of self-esteem. Nonetheless, the children’s
post-separation individualized protection plan (PIP) developed in response to the neglect and abuse
that they experienced should distinguish between these two and should provide solutions case by
case. The underlying causes of child separation, any risk factors, the child’s age, any disabilities of the
child or the parents, and the nature of their prior relationship should all be taken into account by the
case workers when deciding on the most appropriate protection measure for the child (adoption,
special guardianship, placement with a kinship or foster family, or placement in a residential unit). For
this reason, the next sections present the underlying causes and the risk factors associated with
neglect and abuse.



 3.2.2.1           Various Forms of Neglect
The case files of 55 percent of children in public care87 contain evidence of child neglect (Figure 21).
Children from rural areas (not necessarily from the source communities) are more exposed to child
neglect than those from urban areas (60 percent versus 50 percent). The experience of neglect is more
frequent than average among children over the age of 3 years, particularly from families with many
children and/or from families in which the father (or the mother's partner) is present while the




86
   The other 29 percent of children relinquished in a maternity ward have information on child neglect, abuse, or
expoitation in their files. With respect to the relation between the evidence in case file and how the DGASPC specialists
register the main cause of separation, these children fall into all of the categories featured in Figure 20 (other than no
information), with about 5 percent of them being in each category.

grandmother or grandparents are not.88 Hence, at the time of our research, many of these children
were 7 to 14 years old, with siblings also in the system (62 percent).
A lower than average incidence of neglect is found among children with disabilities,89 those with
special educational needs,90 and those with low birth weight.91
For the majority of neglected children, both parents are alive and known, as are their extended family.
Nonetheless, child neglect is strongly associated with bad prior relationships with the family and with
risky behavior, especially running away from home. At the same time, children subject to neglect are
at a higher than average risk of developing problems such as delays in their psychological
development, with 22 percent of the neglected children having such problems versus 13 percent of
the other children in public care.
Child neglect is poorly documented in the children's case files. The case files of 21 percent of the
children in public care do not contain any information in this regard (Figure 22). This proportion is
significantly higher for children who entered the system before 2005. There are also large differences
across counties. The differences between counties are not due to the different proportions of children
who arrived in the system more than ten years before. Therefore, there is a need to improve the way
in which child neglect is understood and recorded in children's case files, especially in some counties,
in order to develop well-documented long-term protection plans that adequately respond to the
neglect issue.

Neglect can be both physical and emotional. In the family's needs assessment prepared by SPAS
social workers (and included in the children’s case files), neglect was associated with a wide range of
child's needs (Figure 21). For example, among the neglected children, the proportion of those
recorded, when entering the system, as having illnesses related to poor hygiene (such as scabies or
lice) is almost double the average for all children in care (13 percent versus 7 percent). As was shown
in the previous section 3.1.5, such illnesses are also highly correlated with malnourishment and are
found more frequently in children from rural areas with a single-father and less frequently among
those who came from a nuclear family or those who arrived in the system via street routes.

In interviews and group discussions, the DGASPC professionals tended to describe and emphasize the
extreme cases related to malnourishment in particular and, more generally, to issues that pose a
threat to the child’s health. Most discussions were focused on the problem and the efforts to correct
the harm done by parents but did not mention any work (activity, service, or intervention) to be done
with the parents themselves. Such support measures and services are rarely available at the
community level. Given the prevailing profile of the parents and families of children in public care
(section 3.1.2), it is obvious that they need intensive parental education and substantial support to
fulfil their parental duties in a responsible manner.
            “But we also have cases, like I’ve told you, the 8-month-old little girl that they brought to us
            weighing 3 kg because they hadn’t fed her. Taking the child back to that family poses a risk
            because you might later find them the same way. The mother was not even aware of the
            abandonment, so the child could have died. She said that she had already given her a corn puff
            and she didn’t see why she should give her food as well. I mean, you take action; clearly that little
            girl needs to be sent to another family, I mean once she recovers we should take her to an actual
            family, but not to her biological family which hasn’t improved and has taken no action to prove
            to us that they can look after her.” (Interview with a professional, Bârlad)

            “We even had a case where they brought us the children – a father did – because they couldn’t
            wash them as they had been disconnected from the water supply for a very long time.” (Interview
            with a professional, Piatra Neamţ)
            “Home hygiene is very poor and this affects the child’s health; when they are admitted to the
            hospital’s pediatric ward, social workers inform us about the case.” (Interview with a professional,
            Arad)

Most specialists emphasized that the parents’ lack of or deficient parenting skills was a result of their
low general level of education but also of their own life history of childhood abuse and neglect. The
lack of parenting skills is even more apparent with regard to children with special needs, such as
infants in their first months of life, children with disabilities (especially with severe ones), and
adolescents with behavioral issues.
            “Regarding the causes, there is also a small number of children with health issues whose parents
            cannot cope anymore. In general, they stay with their family, [...] but we’re talking about severe
            physical or associated disabilities, which require more specialized care and this is also paired with
            the fact that, in the family, parents lack the needed skills and sometimes even the means to do
            that. And another cause could also be – for healthy children, so to speak – parents’ lack of skills
            to raise and educate them because this poses a risk which, in time, leads to behavioral changes in
            the child and, when they reach puberty, the parent might come to us and say ’I want to send him
            to a center because I can’t... I don’t know what to do with him anymore,’ so...” (Focus group with
            professionals, Ploieşti)

            “Other child separation issues emerge, you know, at the age of 12 or 13 years old when they run
            away from home. They leave home, they run away with their stuff, they become vagrants and
            then the family can’t cope with it anymore and of course they turn to the authorities.” (Interview
            with a professional, Bacău)

An extreme form of child neglect is the relinquishment of children,92 which may stem from a wide
range of causes, including parents leaving to go abroad, family dissolution, parents’ unstable
relationships, infidelity, and birth out of wedlock as well as parental disinterest.93 Accordingly, in these
cases of child neglect,94 the DGASPC specialists record as the main cause of separation either the
abuse and neglect category (58 percent), poverty95 (24 percent), or one or more of the above-
mentioned underlying causes of neglect (21 percent). In about 10 percent of cases, they also add risk
factors associated with neglect, such as alcohol abuse, childhood disability, behavioral problems,

92
     For relinquishment in medical units, see section 3.1.3.2.
93
  Currently, all of these causes of separation are often recorded in the official reports under the category of
"disappearance of parents" or "others."
94
  Excluding children abandoned in maternity wards. If all children in public care are considered, the proportion declines
to 12 percent.

     Poverty is addressed in section 3.2.5.1 on structural causes.

mental health problems of the parents, or promiscuous and/or criminal behavior by the parents (see
the analysis in Chapter 3.2.3).


 RECOMMENDATIONS

 There is a need to improve the way in which child neglect is recorded in children's case files, especially in some
 counties. Also, it is necessary to understand the underlying causes of neglect so as to ensure well-documented
 individualized protection plans that address these causes. These individualized protection plans should focus
 on the child and the family together, not separately, so that the child’s return to the family can be a real,
 feasible option.
 Intervention and the provision of services for parents/families and children in the community prior to their
 separation on grounds of neglect or abuse is vital. In this regard, early identification and early intervention,
 before risk situations become critical, are key to preventing child-family separations.

 It is necessary to raise awareness of the harmful effects of child neglect, especially in source communities.




 3.2.2.2              Various Forms of Abuse
The case files of 15 percent of children in public care96 show evidence of child abuse (Figure 23).
Emotional abuse is the most frequent form of abuse recorded in the files (12 percent), followed by
physical and sexual abuse (9 percent and 1 percent respectively). Six percent of all children in public
care had been subject to two or all three forms of abuse before entering the system.


FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The household survey in the rural source communities yielded additional evidence of the
intergenerational transmission of abusive parenting behavior. The data show that about 8 percent of
mothers were emotionally and/or psychologically abused during their own childhood, while 8 percent
of them faced physical abuse, and about 1 percent were victims of sexual abuse. Five percent of
mothers were subject to at least two or all three forms of abuse in their families of origin.
Source: Survey of Households with Children in Public Care in Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data
are not weighted (N=754 mothers who were brought up in a family).

Boys and girls are equally exposed to the risk of emotional abuse before entering the system. Children
from rural areas, particularly from source communities, have a higher than average risk of emotional
abuse than those from urban areas (14 percent versus 9 percent). Children aged over 3 years old at
the time of entry experience emotional abuse more frequently than average, particularly if they are
from families with many children and/or from families in which the father (or the mother's partner) is
present while the grandmother or grandparents are not.97 At the time of the research, many of these
children were 11 years old, with siblings in the system (71 percent versus the average of 53 percent).

The risk of physical abuse is also evenly distributed among girls and boys, between urban and rural
areas, and between source and non-source communities. Thus, children all over the country have a
comparable risk of physical abuse regardless of their location. Children over 7 years old at the time of
their entry into the system experience physical abuse more frequently than average. The odds of
physical abuse are the highest for children from nuclear families (with both parents at home),98
especially those that include three or more children99 with no help from their kinship network. These
children are at risk of becoming abusers themselves as the majority of them have not had a positive
relationship with their grandmother, for instance, which might have countered the influence of the risk
factors and thus might have reduced the odds of the child victim becoming a perpetrator.100
Emotional and/or physical abuse was reported less than average for children with disabilities,101 those
with special educational needs,102 and those with low birth weight.103
Like child neglect, emotional and/or physical abuse is strongly associated with bad prior relationships
with family and with risky behavior, especially running away from home. Researchers who study abuse
victims agree that the impact of abuse can last a lifetime. Abuse causes a feeling of shame, and many
victims may suffer from countless mental health problems including addictions, depression, and
dissociative disorders. According to the children's case files, the baseline psychological evaluations
showed that one in every three104 children in public care who suffered emotional and/or physical
abuse was assessed with developmental delays in one or more of the emotional, cognitive, behavioral,
psychophysiological, or personality areas and with difficulties in conducting interpersonal relationships.
The risk of sexual abuse is three times higher for girls than for boys, particularly among children aged
11 years old or more when entering the system. 105 Among children in public care who had
experienced sexual abuse, the proportion with delays in development is very high, namely about 60
percent.106
The causes of sexual abuse are of great concern to the DGASPC specialists. It is very difficult to
provide effective help to a child victim of sexual abuse given how these cases are prosecuted in penal
courts. For example, the experts’ reports take a log time to be delivered, the mother can visit the child
in special protection during the trial and thus can put pressure on the victim to agree to return home,
and the judge can decide to reintegrate the victim within the family (including the abusive father)
during the trial regardless of the DGASPC professionals' recommendation. As a result, the child can be
forced to relive the trauma for a long period until the trial proceedings are finished. Also, SPAS
services at the community level do not have enough capacity to properly monitor the family during
this time, meaning that the child victim is left without proper support and protection.

     The incidence of physical abuse is 16 percent versus the average of 9 percent.
99
  The rate of physical abuse increases from 6 percent of children from one-child families to 11 percent of those from
two-child families and to over 14 percent of children who belong to families with three or more children.
100

101
   The rate of emotional abuse is 8 percent versus 13 percent for children with no disabilities. For physical abuse, the
rates are 7 percent for children with disabilities and 10 percent for those with no disabilities.
102
   An incidence of emotional abuse of 9 percent versus 18 percent of children without SEN. For physical abuse, the
corresponding rates are 8 percent and 14 percent.
103
   An incidence of emotional abuse of 6 percent of children with very low birth weight (less than 1,500 grams) versus 10
percent among children with low birth weight (more than 1,500 grams and less than 2,500 grams) and 14 percent of
children with normal birth weight. The corresponding rates of physical abuse are 4 percent, 8 percent, and 10 percent
respectively.
104
      Versus 15 percent of children in public care with no experience of emotional and/or physical abuse.
105
  Compared to the average of 1 percent of children in public care (minus those abandoned in maternity wards), sexual
abuse is documented in the case files of 0.4 percent of boys, 1.4 percent of girls, and 3.6 percent of girls with an entry
age over 11.
106
   Twenty-three percent of children who experinceed sexual abuse did not receive a psychological examination when
they entered the system. Only 17 percent of them were found to meet the normal standards of development.

        In the case of sexual abuse, part of Story Bag 3a:

        “[...] the girl reported the abuse. It was very difficult to prove the sexual abuse, because this was
        indirect evidence. It took a while for the samples to be analyzed […] it is very difficult to have a
        criminal case only based on the child’s request with no evidence. Meanwhile, because of the
        mother’s pressure, the child stays in contact with the family, while she was subject to a protection
        measure, so mother and daughter meet and maybe the mother expressed her fears and
        discontent, and the child asked to go back home. And she did it before the judge, so it was
        agreed to have a family reintegration, with surveillance. The surveillance was done by the
        authorities, the social protection service, but the period wasn`t that long. […] Now, [the girl] is
        subject to a protection measure and the father is in jail. Eventually we got the test results as well,
        and they confirmed everything, because the result was on the underwear.” (Focus group with
        professionals, Focșani)

Child abuse is even more poorly documented in children's case files than child neglect. For 34 percent
of children in public care, the case files do not contain any information of this kind (Figure 23). The
proportion is significantly higher for children who entered the system before 2005. There are also
major differences among counties, which are only partly due to variations in the proportions of
children who entered the system longer time ago (Figure 23).


 RECOMMENDATIONS

 Intervention and the provision of services for parents/ family and children in the community prior to
 separation on grounds of abuse is vital. In this regard, early identification and early intervention, before risk
 situations become critical, are key to preventing child-family separation.
 It is necessary to continue awareness-raising campaigns on the harmful effects of child abuse, especially in
 source communities.
 Child abuse is not properly documented in the children’s case files, and the situation is even more deficient
 than in the case of neglect. Therefore, there is a need to improve the way in which child abuse is recorded in
 children's case files, especially in some counties. Also, it is necessary to understand the underlying causes of
 abuse in order to ensure well-documented individualized protection plans that address these causes.
 It is necessary to develop psychological assessment and counseling services, and also specialized services for
 victims of violence, given that one-third of children in public care who experienced emotional and/or physical
 abuse had developmental delays. Also, only 17 percent of the sexually abused children were normally
 developed when they entered the system. As such, 40 percent of the emotionally and/or physically abused
 children and 23 percent of victims of sexual abuse did not receive a psychological evaluation when they
 entered the system.
 Cases of child victims of sexual abuse should be defined as high priority for all institutions involved. It is
 necessary to prioritize the introduction of institutional procedures that wil make it possible to take rapid and
 consistent measures to protect children against the offender. The court decision should take into account the
 recommendations of the child protection experts as part of the inter-institutional child protection proceedings
 to prevent the victim from being returned to the abusive environment.

 The investigation of child abuse cases must take into account the child's opinion and establish measures to
 ensure child protection.

3.2.2.3               Various Forms of Exploitation
The case files of about 3.2 percent of children in public care107 show evidence of child exploitation.108
It is not very clear how child exploitation cases get recorded by DGASPC specialists since only about
half of the child cases that involve street work and beggary and only 41 percent of cases of child
trafficking, prior to the children’s entering public care, are stated as cases of exploitation. According to
the data in the children’s case files, the share of children in public care with prior experience of street
work and/or beggary is 1.5 percent.109 Children who were victims of human trafficking prior to their
entering public care represent 0.1 percent of all children in public care. Thus, by adding together the
acknowledged cases of street work and/or beggary and/or human trafficking, the proportion of
children who experienced exploitation before entering the system rises to 4.3 percent,110 although 42
percent of children have no information in their files in this regard (in other words, it is unknown
whether they had been subject to exploitation before entering the system).111
            “There have been cases when parents used their kids to beg, and they were taken to the center.
            Yes, there are such cases, of course.” (Interview with a professional, Bacău)

            “The cases we come across in Cireșarii Center are related to sexual exploitation. There are
            teenage girls who end up with the wrong crowd and are recruited or coerced by some guys into
            prostitution. And this is a major problem.” (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)
            “- We see cases where they abandon their kids even when they are very young, at a very tender
            age, because they run several risks. They end up in the system because of being neglected by the
            family, seriously neglected, with repeated admissions, the child’s life is really in danger and that’s
            when they are temporarily taken out of their family. They don’t have the resources, neither
            material nor emotional, to support the baby during its first two years of life, so they give it to the
            system.
            And after?

            - They end up back with the family, because this is the goal, a family which, however, in most
            cases hasn’t done anything in the meantime to change the conditions; and here the child will
            serve their interest, that is, be a source of revenue. After, it’s easier. The child no longer runs the
            risk of premature or infant death so he/she can be sent on the streets to beg; that is, he/she can
            be used. They are deemed as suitable to beg if they are over two years of age.” (Interview with a
            professional, Brașov)

FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The Household Survey in Rural Source Communities shows that mothers themselves reported
experiencing child exploitation (3 percent), street work and/or beggary (2 percent) in their families of
origin during their childhood.
Source: Survey of Households with Children in Public Care in Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data
are not weighted (N=754 mothers who were brought up in a family).




107
      Excluding children relinquished in maternity wards.
108
   According to a study conducted by Salvați Copiii and the MMFPSPV, 2 percent of children from the entire child
population in Romania say they have been sent to beg, 5 percent say that they go to work instead of going to school,
and 8 percent say that they stay at home to look after their younger siblings instead of going to school (Grădinaru and
Stănculeanu, 2013).
109
   Table 12 shows that the proportion is four times higher among children aged 7 to 17 years old (6 percent). The
highest incidence of street work and/or beggary is recorded for children of 11 to 14 years of age (9 percent).
110
  Excluding children abandoned in maternity wards. If all children in public care are considered, the proportion
becomes 3.3 percent.
111
   There are large discrepancies between counties, which are not necessarily related to the proportion of children who
entered the system a long time ago. The rates of missing data on child exploitation vary between a minimum of 24
percent in Bistrița-Năsăud, and a maximum of 63 percent in Constanța (see Annex 6 Table 17).

“Together we worked on a case: a girl who, from the age of 11 until 16,
was raped by her father. And the girl eventually reported the abuse. It                   3a
was very difficult to prove the sexual abuse, because this was indirect
evidence. It took a while for the samples to be analyzed. And, before the
test results got back from Bucharest and things were cleared, the
reintegration was made without us [the DGASPC] suggesting it. The
judge ruled for the reintegration.
I was sure he would do it again, so I gave the girl my phone number. The father was the
perfect abuser. He would disconnect her from everyone, there was a single phone available,
so that he could control everyone: mother, daughter, who she talked to, so she wouldn`t
interact with people in the community. He would keep a close eye on her schedule: when she
left for school, when she came back, he would control the child and even the other family
members. The mother was basically terrorized, she grew dependent on him, although she
was not aware of the fact that she was the one holding the place together, she worked, had
an income, whereas he was just a parasite in that family. But he managed to make the
mother believe that she couldn`t live without him. And despite all this, he did it again. The
girl also felt some pressure from her mother, who didn’t believe her and thought that what
she was doing would leave her without a father for her children and without a family support.
But he did it again; that is, he walked in on her when she was taking a bath, when he knew
she was naked and that’s when she called; it was on a Sunday when I got the phone call, and
with the police from there, we intervened and took her to the center. Now, [the girl] is
subject to a protection measure and the father is in jail. Eventually we got the test results as
well, and they confirmed everything, because the result was on the underwear.“

“I had a girl who was sent back to her family. The mother was not
there, because she had been deprived of parental rights, but she was                      3c
reintegrated at her grandmother’s. They created a living environment,
the grandmother was supported with goods or money, I’m not sure
what the case file stated. The idea was great. She gathered all siblings,
including the girl that had been here. The girl had ended up with us
because her mother scalded her face with hot water. I don’t know if this was intentional or by
mistake, but she even went to jail because of this, especially since she also used the girl to
beg.
Together with a plastic surgeon from Brașov, Dr. Ardean, who supported us a lot, and with a
team of UK doctors, we managed to do many surgical interventions on the girl to reshape
her face, to save her ears, because she risked losing her hearing. I think that, overall, she was
subject to over 10 surgeries. And after this, there was this project idea; the girl was placed
with her grandmother, and she was very happy. She was enrolled in school, we paid for her
afterschool. The colleagues would help her do her homework, because here she was with the
kids, and couldn’t have followed the normal educational path. And she was very happy that
she was with the family, with her siblings and grandmother. But despite all this, after half a
year, when we had scheduled another surgery, we couldn’t find her because her mother had
been released from jail and had taken her away, and she was last seen in Suceava or some
place, begging again. Now how do you explain to a group of people who came from the UK
to do a surgery on the child that she’s not to be found?”

started singing. I took up singing with my uncle at various events. My
father, when seeing that I was doing ok, stopped working and started
taking all my money. In high school he suspended my year, so I
decided it is best to come here. I decided I wanted a different opportunity.”

Boys are more exposed to exploitation than girls (5 percent versus 4 percent). The probability of child
exploitation is evenly distributed among children from urban and rural areas and from all ethnic
groups. The incidence of child exploitation among children in public care increases from about 2
percent of children under 7 years of age when entering the system to over 8 percent of children aged
7 to 10 years and to more than 12 percent of those with entry ages between 11 and 14 years old.
Thus, one in every eight children who entered the child protection system in adolescence (between 11
and 14 years old) has experienced at least one form of exploitation.
About three-quarters of the exploited children come from nuclear families with three or more children
who live together in a stable dwelling. The majority of them have siblings in the child protection
system. The other exploited children arrived in the system via street routes either from a homeless
family or after running away from home. It is not clear if they ran away from home as a response to
being exploited by their parents or if they were exploited after running away from home (during the
period of living on the street), but the statistical association between the two events is very strong.
Thus, 37 percent of the children with experiences of exploitation and an entry age of 7 and 17 years
old ran away from home before entering the system. This percentage is five times higher than average
(which is 7.5 percent).
Childhood disabilities are not a risk factor for child maltreatment as children with disabilities have a
lower than average rate of exploitation.112 Nevertheless, maltreatment through exploitation appears to
have a significant impact, leading to developmental delays and special educational needs. The
incidence of developmental delays among exploited children at the time of their entry into the system
is over two times higher than average (39 percent versus 17 percent). The same is true regarding the
incidence of special educational needs (16 percent versus 9 percent). However, further research is
needed to establish whether this link is causal.
Another form of child exploitation, on which we have data only from the qualitative study, refers to
the parents who go abroad taking their children with them only with the aim of using or exploiting
them, not for the purpose of keeping the family united.
            “There are families... not from normal families, who leave for begging, prostitution, or other
            things. And for this they take their children with them.” (Focus grup professionals, Brașov)

            “Somehow we need to find a way to get a reaction on the part of the notaries. They should draw
            the attention of authorities in case they see a case raising suspicion, they should inform an
            authority, to have that case looked into, because it is not enough when wanting to take the child
            out of the country to just pay the fee as long as you are about to put that child in harm’s way.
            Therefore, we believe the power of attorney as it is right now, in its current version, is a loophole
            of the system as a result of which children enter a process of migration and exploitation through
            work and beggary.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)

However, the DGASPC professionals interviewed in the qualitative study considered that the parents'
behavior in having children in order to access various social benefits, particularly parents who live in
poverty, is the primary form of child exploitation which, in their opinion, is associated with welfare
dependency.
            ”Well, they live off social welfare, from the guaranteed minimum income or child state allowance,
            and this is why they constantly have babies, because for children under 2 years old, the allowance
            is higher than for the others, so they constantly have babies in order to have a minimum income
            in the household.” (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)
            ”There was a time… at some point when there were many requests to establish protection
            measures, especially for children over 2 years of age because the parents used that allowance
            which was slightly higher for kids under 2. The allowance paid for kids from 0 to 2 years old is
            RON 200, and that, for them, means a lot of money. And then, they asked for special protection
            measures.” (Interview with a professional, Piatra Neamț)




112
      The rate of exploitation is 2 percent versus about 5 percent of children without disabilities.

            ”I had this case: two kids were neglected, so we suggested that the parents work with us and, for
            a given time, until things got better, agree to the establishment of a protection measure. And it
            shocked me to see that they agreed to this for the older child but not for the younger one.
            Afterwards, they explained the reason. They were willing to give up RON 42 [the monthly
            allowance for children over 2], but not RON 200 [the monthly allowance for children between 0
            and 2 years old]. (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)

            birth, they keep the baby for two years, get that RON 200 allowance, and, after two years, they
            come and ask for the child to be institutionalized, then go back and have another one. For them,
            the child is a source of revenue. [...] I don`t know, maybe there should be a law according to

            beyond that, it’s up to you if you want to have more. Not necessarily a limitation, but making the
            families more accountable.” (Focus group with professionals, Brașov)

Table 17 shows that, before entering the system, more than 60 percent of all children in public care,113
lived in households that received no social benefits (other than the regular allowance for all children).
The most common benefits were the GMI and the family allowance, which are targeted to the poor.
However, no benefit was available to more than 20 percent of children in public care prior to their
entering the system. It is true that, in the households of the exploited children, the share of
beneficiaries was higher for most social benefits, but none was more than 30 percent of children. Thus,
these families might have tried to use their children to obtain more benefits, but they were not very
successful. In addition, all of these benefits are very low, only at survival level at best. Although there is
little information on income in the children's case files,114 what there is indicates that the main
problem faced by families of children in public care is not welfare dependency, but increasing access
to benefits.

 RECOMMENDATIONS

 Interventions that provide services for parents and for families and children within the community prior to
 separation on grounds of exploitation are vital. In this respect, early identification and early intervention before
 risk situations become critical are key for preventing child-family separation.
 There is a need to improve the way in which child exploitation is understood and recorded in children's case
 files, especially in some counties. There is a need to clearly distinguish between exploitation and what
 specialists interpret as exploitation based on preconception and prejudice. It is highly necessary to have a real,
 physical presence within the community, especially in the source communitites, of child protection specialists,
 together with social workers or people with social work responsibilities within the SPAS in order to understand
 the context and thus be able to develop interventions that address the causes of child exploitation.
 As a protection measure for children taken abroad by their parents for exploitation purposes, child protection
 professionals considered, at the time of the research, that a system of notification between the DGASPCs and
 notaries should be developed. At present, there should be support for the enforcement of the new regulations
 (Government Decision 691/2015) regarding the procedure for monitoring how children with parents who have
 gone abroad for work are being raised and cared for and what services are available to them, as well as
 regarding a work methodology for DGASPC-SPAS collaboration and the standard model for the documents
 produced by these two institutions.

 In addition, a solid interinstitutional collaboration is highly necessary at cross-national level. Where such acts
 (of exploitation) take place or are noticed, the Romanian legislation on revoking parental rights should be
 immediately applied (or the legislation of the county in which the abuse, neglect, or exploitation is noted), and
 the children should receive the most suitable form of protection measure, according to the child’s best
 interest, in the country of origin or destination, according to the same principle.




3.2.2.4           Deprivation of Parental Rights
In Romania, the deprivation of parental rights is regulated in the New Civil Code as shown in Box 4
below.
Deprivation of parental rights is closely linked with neglect, abuse, and child exploitation and is rather
an instrument for separating children from the abusing family than a cause in itself.

                Box 4: Legal Provisions regarding the Deprivation of Parental Rights

 The New Civil Code of 2015 includes the following regulations regarding deprivation of parental rights:

 Art. 508 Conditions: The guardianship court, at the request of the public authorities responsible for child
 care, can rule to deprive parents of their parental rights if the parent endangers the child’s life, health, or
 development through mistreatment, alcohol or substance abuse, abusive conduct, or severe neglect in
 performing their parental duties, or by severely harming the child’s best interest.
 Art. 509 Scope of deprivation: (1) The deprivation of parental rights is full and is applicable for all children
 born when the ruling was issued. (2) However, the court can rule on the deprivation of only part of the
 parental rights or only for particular children provided that this does not harm the children’s development,
 education, learning, and professional training.

 Art. 510 Support obligation: Deprivation of parental rights does not relieve the parents from the obligation
 of providing support for their children.

 Art. 511 Introduction of the Guardianship: If after the deprivation of parental rights the child is not in the
 care of either of the parents, the guardianship shall be introduced.
 Art. 512 Restoring parental rights: (1) The court shall restore parental rights if the conditions that led to their
 removal are no longer present and if the parent no longer endangers the child’s life, health, and development.
 (2) While the request is still awaiting a ruling, the court may allow the parent to be in contact with the child, if
 this is in the child’s best interest.

In the ANPDCA official reports, the deprivation of parental rights is stated as the main cause of
separation, as declared by DGASPC specialists, for about 1 percent of children in public care (Figure
19). According to the case files, parental rights have been deprived in the cases of 1.4 percent of
children since they entered the system (Table 18). Over time, some parents have regained their
rights,115 while others have lost them, so in November-December 2014 the proportion of children in
this situation represented about 1 percent of all children in public care. Consequently, a total of 2.4
percent of children in public care have had their life, health, or development put in danger by their
parents.
For children whose parents (one or both) were deprived of exercising their parental rights prior to the
child’s entering the system, the deprivation of parental rights is stated as the main cause of separation
by all parties involved, including DGASPC specialists, parents, and SPAS social workers (see the figure
next to Table 18). However, in about half of these cases, they added an underlying cause of the
deprivation of parental rights, most often neglect, abuse, violence, and/or the detention of the mother
or father. In any event, for all of the cases stated by specialists as being separation on the basis of
deprivation of parental rights, the case files show evidence of neglect, abuse, and/or child exploitation.

Children in public care whose parents have, at some point during the child’s lifetime, been deprived of
their parental rights are both boys and girls, most often from families living in source communities,116
particularly in rural areas. Among them, the share of children who had a personal identification
number at the time of their entry into the system was only 71 percent versus 84 percent of the entire
population of children in public care. Roma children have higher odds of being in this category (3.7
percent versus 2.4 percent), but they represent only about 17 percent of all children whose life, health,
or development was threatened by their parents' behavior. Considerably more cases (around 6
percent) were reported in Harghita and Vaslui counties than in the other counties.
During the qualitative research, some professionals stated that the legal process through which
parents are deprived of their parental rights is “too heavy and highly bureaucratic to genuinely and
swiftly serve the best interests of the child”. 117

115
   Parental rights have been restored for 31 percent of mothers and 41 percent of fathers who had been deprived of
their parental rights when their child entered the system. However, reintegration of their children into the family failed.
116
  The share of children from source communities is 22 percent in this category versus 15 percent of all children in
public care.

 RECOMMENDATION
 Considering the fact that the deprivation of parental rights is used as a tool to separate the child from their
 abusing family rather than a cause in itself and that all the cases stated by specialists as being separation on
 the grounds of the deprivation of parental rights also document evidence of child neglect, abuse, and/or
 exploitation, we recommend eliminating the deprivation of parental rights from the list of possible causes of
 separation and replacing it with the “child neglect, abuse, and exploitation” category.




3.2.3                 Individual-level Risk Factors (Associated
                      with Parental Behavior)
The key to preventing child abuse and neglect is resolving the known risk factors. As already
mentioned in the previous section, the relinquishment of children118 is an extreme form of violence119
that may originate in a variety of underlying causes including parents leaving to work abroad, family
dissolution (divorce, separation, or desertion of the family by the parents), parents’ unstable
relationship, infidelity, and birth out of wedlock, as well as parental disinterest.120
A large body of literature121 has shown that risk factors associated with neglect and abuse in the
families of children in child protection include parental behavior and characteristics that can be
tackled either by entire population-based policies or by targeted interventions. These risks include
alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, and parental disability or mental health problems
(primarily on the part of the mother). Other risks factors relate to a child’s disability, a child’s poor
health and/or behavior issues, premature birth, and parents’ promiscuous and/or criminal behavior. All
of these individual-level risk factors are analyzed in this section. Often, the families facing these
problems are also exposed to several other vulnerabilies associated with social exclusion, such as
poverty or lack of a stable accommodation. These structural factors are discussed in section 3.2.5.



3.2.3.1               Parents Leaving to Work Abroad
Going abroad for work is not in itself a cause of separation. Millions of Romanians work abroad but
have not abandoned their children. Going abroad becomes a cause of separation only when it turns
into parental neglect, when parents forget about their children who are left behind, cease
communicating with them, lose the connection with them, and lack a clear and agreed arrangement of
care for the children left home.
            “You, for instance - why did you have to go to the center? Do you remember?
            - Yes... But I don’t want to say why. No, because it’s embarrassing.

            Nothing we share here is embarrassing. Please, tell us.
            - Because my grandma kept scolding me; mom would leave for the UK and my grandmother sent
            me away from home.” (Focus group with children, Cluj-Napoca)


118
      For relinquishment in medical units, see section 3.1.3.2.
119
   The definition of violence is the one in Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child: “all forms of physical
or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual
abuse” (United Nations, 1989). In addition, it is based on the definition in the World Report on Violence and Health: “The
intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or
community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm,
maldevelopment or deprivation” (Krug et al., eds., 2002:5).
120
    Currently, all these causes of separation are often recorded in the official reports under the category of
“disappearance of parents” or “others.”
121
      For example, Munro (2005), Frederick and Goddard (2007), Wood (2008), Jeffreys et al. (2009), and Munro et al. (2013).

                                                                                                                         109
            ”Parents decide to leave to go abroad just like that, from one day to another. They get a phone
            call, ’Come, I found this job here!’ and they leave their children with other families. The latter [the
            substitute family,] after a while, starts to wonder: well, they aren’t sending me any money, they
            aren’t supporting me in any way, why should I raise their child? And that’s when they contact us
            saying the mom is abroad and left the kid in their care.” (Interview with a professional, Arad)

In addition, it can be a cause of separation if the parents take their children abroad with them but only
with the aim of using or exploiting them, not for the purpose of keeping the family united.
            “There are families... not from normal families, who leave for begging, prostitution, or other
            things. And for this they take their children with them.” (Focus group with professionals, Brașov)

Thus, leaving to work abroad is a cause of separation only when it constitutes parental abuse or
neglect. Accordingly, the vast majority of the DGASPC specialists have reported as the main cause of
separation either that parents left to work abroad122 or neglect, abuse, and exploitation or both. Only
for children with just the father working abroad is the main cause of separation stated as “poverty”
and rarely as “parent left to go abroad” (figure next to Table 19).

Parents going abroad can be a significant risk for child neglect but not for abuse or exploitation.
Annex 6 Table 18 shows that the incidence of child neglect recorded in the case files is 52 percent of
children with one or both parents abroad versus the average of 42 percent for all children in public
care. Also, the chances of children of parents who have gone abroad being relinquished in a maternity
ward are eight times lower than the average.
Also, parents going abroad is not associated with any childhood problems such as child disability,123
special educational needs,124 developmental delays,125 or behavioral disorders.126

   Children with disabilities account for fewer than 8 percent of children with one or both parents gone abroad versus
the average of 11 percent for the whole population of children in care.
124
   Among the children with parent(s) abroad, children aged 6 to 17 years with SEN are almost two times fewer (5
percent) than among the whole population of children in public care (9 percent).
125
   Children with developmental delays represent 11 percent of children with parent(s) abroad and 17 percent of all
children in public care.
126
   Children aged 7 to 17 with behavioral problems account for 8 percent of children with parent(s) abroad and 11
percent of all children in public care.

110
The parents of over 7 percent of children in public care left to go abroad (one or both parents), either
before the child entered the system (5 percent) or while they were within the system (2 percent), as
shown in Table 19.
Most of these children were over 3 years old when they entered the system. They arrived in the system
together with their siblings via two main routes: (i) Maternity ward --> Family with a stable dwelling --
> SPS, after a parent left to work abroad or (ii) Maternity ward --> Family --> Relatives --> SPS, after
the single-parent or both parents left to work abroad. These children are more likely to be girls than
boys but come from both rural and urban areas. Most of the cases were reported in the following
counties: Botoșani, Caraș-Severin, Hunedoara, Prahova, Suceava, and Vrancea.


 RECOMMENDATION
 Child protection professionals believe that a notification system between the DGASPC and notaries should be
 developed to protect children from being taken abroad by their parents for exploitation purposes:
              “Somehow we need to find a way to get a reaction on the part of the notaries. They should
              draw the attention of authorities in case they see a case raising suspicion, they should inform
              an authority, to have that case looked into, because it is not enough when wanting to take the
              child out of the country to just pay the fee as long as you are about to put that child in harm’s
              way. Therefore, we believe the power of attorney as it is right now, in its current version, is a
              loophole of the system as a result of which children enter a process of migration and
              exploitation through work and beggary.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)




 3.2.3.2              Dysfunctional Families
The atypical demographic behavior of the parents of children in public care, which is characterized by
unstable relationships, consensual unions, single-parent families, divorces, and separations, has
already been discussed in section 3.1.2. Family breakdowns can be the result of the death, detention,
or departure abroad of one or both parents, but it can also be the result of one or both parents
deserting their family, of parents getting divorced or separated, of unacknowledged paternity,
parental disinterest, infidelity, or birth out of wedlock.
In the present study, the dysfunctional family is defined as a family in which one or more of the
following events have occurred: divorce, separation, infidelity, parental disinterest, desertion of the
family,127 unacknowledged paternity, and birth out of wedlock.128 Seventeen percent of children in
public care were part of such a dysfunctional family when they entered the child protection system.

The dysfunctional family, as defined above, represents an important risk factor only for child neglect
but not for abuse, exploitation, or relinquishment in maternity wards (Table 20). Also, the
dysfunctional family is not associated with children with disabilities,129 special educational needs,130
developmental delays,131 or behavioral disorders.132
Among the children in public care who come from dysfunctional families, the following are over-
represented: children who entered the system between the ages of 3 and 14 years old, boys (as
opposed to girls), children from rural areas, Romanians, and Hungarians. To a large extent (over 43
percent), these children come from families with atypical structures (see Infograph Chart 1), with one
or two children and a stable dwelling. The large majority have arrived in public care via the
predominant routes related to family and kinship networks.


FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
Data from rural source communities show that the mothers of 70 percent of children in care were in a
stable relationship when their children entered the child protection system. However, in only 51
percent of these cases was the mother together with the child’s biological father, while the other
mothers had a different partner. Even fewer mothers were legally married to the child's father (26
percent of children), and only about 10 percent of children came from a family where the mother and
father were legally married and in a “good” relationship (as assessed by the mother).

So most of these children came from families where the parents were living in consensual unions or
from single-mother families. Only about a half of them lived with their fathers. Many of them had lived
in family environments in which the couple had a tense relationship, especially those between the
mothers and partners other than the child’s father.


129
   Children with disabilities account for 9 percent of children from dysfunctional families versus the average of 11
percent.
130
   Children aged 6 to 17 years with SEN represent 6 percent of children who come from dysfunctional families versus 9
percent of the whole population of children aged 6 to 17 in public care.
131
   Children with developmental delays represent 15 percent of children in public care who come from dysfunctional
families and 17 percent of all children in public care.
132
   Children aged 7 to 17 years with behavioral problems represent 9 percent of children in public care who come from
dysfunctional families and 11 percent of all children aged 7 to 17 years old in public care.

112
Many of the mothers or parents of children in public care themselves grew up in dysfunctional families
in which they suffered from different types of abuse or neglect. Thus, this is the only type of
relationship and parenting that they know. They are just continuing a cycle.
        “- Parents who end up relinquishing their children come from dysfunctional families.

        What do you mean by dysfunctional families?
        - Divorce, poverty, this is somehow perpetuated.... Or simply single-parent families, because
        many of them don’t even get married, they live in consensual unions, after which they break up,
        have other relations.

        - Or very young mothers who simply get pregnant accidentally, but neither they nor their families
        have the capacity to take the baby in and raise it.” (Focus group with professionals, Brașov)

In other cases, the mother has rejected the child. Child protection specialists explained that the main
problem in cases of maternal rejection is the lack of procedures for situations in which counselling
and/or support services fail. In any case, the absence or underdevelopment of the counseling and
support services for mothers/parents in the community cannot be denied.
        ”A very concrete example: we have a child who strongly wants to live at home, with his mother.
        He has a perfectly normal, healthy mother, living in a house with her partner - they are now
        married. They don’t have any children at home; she has other children, older daughters, living in
        their own homes. The psychologist from the center is making huge efforts to persuade that
        mother to take in her child. No, no and no. Madam, we will help you, with a job. No, I have a job.
        Well, if you have a job, and a home, take the child. No, because he causes trouble. Who sanctions
        her because she does not want to care for the child? Who will sanction her? She has everything
        she needs. She works without a legal employment contract so that her employment status can’t
        be proven in court. She lived in the home of her partner, which is not her home too, and claims
        that she can’t take in the child. The child wants it, he is fourteen, his opinion is taken into account,
        he runs away from the center to get to his mother, and his mother lives in Dej, not in Cluj, thus
        the child’s life is put in danger because he travels using all possible means: hitchhiking, by train,
        by any means he can, it doesn’t matter, he wants to be with his mother. He will not stay in the
        center. So tell me, what can one do to deal with this mother." (Focus group with professionals,
        Cluj-Napoca)



 RECOMMENDATIONS
 It is absolutely necessary to develop counseling and support services for children and families as well as
 parental education training to help families to develop parental skills in a way that avoids stigmatization.
 Proactive procedures must be developed to identify the reasons why mothers and families reject their children
 and to devise possible remedial solutions. These might include counseling the mother and father, their life
 partners, and the wider family in an inclusive and participatory way in the best interests of the child.

 It is also vital to develop a specific and accurate tool to collect information, rather than opinions, to inform
 clear and inclusive interventions for mother and child that take into account the best interests of the child and
 the core principles regarding the protection of child rights.

 3.2.3.3           Teenage Mothers
With regard to early pregnancy, two situations can be distinguished. The first situation involves
children whose mothers were teenagers (aged 12 to 17) when they gave birth to the child. The second
situation involves children whose mothers were teenagers not only when they gave birth but also
when their child entered public care. Of all children in the system, one out of every four or five
children (22 percent) has a mother who was a teenager when she gave birth to the child. The vast
majority of these children ended up living with their mothers’ family (generally in a stable home) from
where they were placed in public care at ages between 1 and 17 years old, with the same probability
and for similar reasons as for children with mothers aged 18 and over.133 Only 19 percent of children
with teenage mothers at birth entered public care before their mother turned 18 (which represent 4
percent of all children in public care).
Teenage mothers at birth (regardless of how old they were when the child entered public care)
represent about 26 percent of all mothers of children in public care.134 Teenage mothers account for
27 percent in rural areas and 24 percent in urban areas but as high as 35 percent in the source
communities. A higher incidence of teenage mothers is also evident among mothers of Roma
ethnicity (33 percent versus 25 percent of mothers of Romanian ethnicity and 21 percent of mothers
of Hungarian ethnicity).135


FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
According to the prevailing demographic model, in rural source communities, one-third of mothers of
children in public care had their first child when aged between 13 and 17 years. Thus, early
childbearing is widespread in these communities from which a disproportionately large number of
children end up in the child protection system.
Source: Survey of Households with Children in Public Care in Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data
are not weighted (N=714 mothers).

Mothers who were teenagers (12 to 17 years old) at the time of their child's entry into public care
represent approximately 6 percent of all mothers of children in care.136 The proportions are 4 percent
in rural areas, 7 percent in urban areas, and around 8 percent in the source communities. The
incidence of teenage mothers is higher than average also among Roma (8 percent) and women of
undeclared ethnicity (7 percent). Considerably higher than average shares of teenage mothers of
children in public care were recorded in Argeș, Bihor, Brașov, Bistrița-Năsăud, Caraș-Severin, Covasna,
Dolj, Olt, Satu Mare, and Vâlcea.
Most teenage mothers were healthy when their child entered the system.137 The majority were not
married, but 22 percent were living in a consensual union and 1 percent were legally married.
However, over 82 percent of the teenage mothers stated that the child’s father was unknown or that
he did not want to acknowledge paternity. Nearly all of the teenage mothers had graduated eight
classes at most and only 24 percent were still enrolled in school, while the others were financially


133
   For example, Table 21 shows that the incidence of child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation is average among the
children of teenage mothers. The risk of these children being relinquished in medical units is also average.
134
  Unknown mothers and mothers with unknown birthdays were not incuded. These represent 5.5 percent of all
mothers with children in public care.
135
   A high incidence of teenage mothers was evident in the following counties: Bihor, Brașov, Buzău, Călărași, Caraș-
Severin, Covasna, Hunedoara, Maramureș, Mehedinți, and Vâlcea.
136
  Unknown mothers and mothers with a missing date of birth are not included. They represent 5.5 percent of the entire
population of mothers.
137
   Disabilities and/or mental health problems affected 8 percent of teenage mothers at the time of their child’s entry
into the system, versus 16 percent of all mothers aged 18 years and over. In the children’s files, there is no information
on the health status of 27 percent of teenage mothers.

dependent on their families. This low educational level was accompanied by a low level of sexual
education, especially in the source communities.
            “It might be the case in single-parent families, maybe there are young girls like in the Roma
            communities and they are not legally married and they end up alone at some point or they have
            a relationship; they become sexually active when they are very young... Come to think about it, I
            think it all starts with the education received. I am educated, I know where to go for my health, I
            know where to go if I get pregnant, I know it is not good so I use protection to avoid undesired
            pregnancies so that I don’t get pregnant at 13 or 12. At 12 it’s more difficult, but at 13 they can
            have their first pregnancy. It all starts from the education received.” (Interview with a professional,
            Craiova)
            ”And there is another situation we are facing: there are a lot of underage girls who live in
            consensual unions and the parents come to inform us, but they do it when it’s already too late,
            when the parent-child relationship has been long since deteriorated. Not to mention those cases
            in which the underage girls have babies, they get pregnant. Those are also difficult situations.”
            (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)

Most children in public care whose mothers were teenagers at the time of the child’s entry into the
system are healthy: only 6 percent have a disability and fewer than 10 percent have developmental
delays.138 Table 21 shows that the incidence of violence among children of teenage mothers is over
two times lower than the average (19 percent versus 46 percent regarding any form of violence).
Nonetheless, the risk of being relinquished in a maternity ward immediately after childbirth is doubled
(52 percent versus 24 percent). So, the major risk to which these children are exposed is being
relinquished in the maternity ward, an issue which is discussed in detail in section 3.1.3.2.
As a result, only about 40 percent of children with mothers who were teenagers at the time of their
child’s entry into the system have arrived in public care after living with their mother's family. Most
often, these mothers gave up their child because the child was rejected by the family on which the
mother was financially dependent. In only very few cases, the mother was still in school and gave up
her child in order to continue her studies. Based on existing data, it is not possible to assess how many
of these mothers currently stay in contact with their child and take their child back at home after they
finish their education and find employment.

As expected, the DGASPC specialists mentioned causes related to neglect, abuse, or exploitation less
than average for these children. However, at the same time, “neglect, abuse, or exploitation” was
stated as the main cause of child-family separation for only half of the children with teenage mothers
who were subject to neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation in the family. In other similar cases, DGASPC
specialists mentioned other causes, most frequently poverty or “no information.”

 RECOMMENDATIONS
 Teenage pregnancy is highly associated with child relinquishment straight after birth. Therefore, effectively
 reducing teenage pregnancies will be vital to substantially strengthen efforts to prevent and monitor child
 relinquishment in health units. This is also highlighted in the Conclusions and Recommendations box in
 section 3.1.3.2:
     Although children are most often relinquished in health units, efforts and services for preventing this
      phenomenon should be intensified first in the community. Social workers or people with social work
      responsibilities together with community health workers and family doctors should be more active and
      better prepared to identify and monitor at-risk situations for child and mother at an early stage.

     The health monitoring of all pregnancies by community workers (especially by community health workers)
      is strongly needed along with clear mechanisms and protocols to enable the early identification of
      pregnant mothers who are very likely to relinquish their newborns and their immediate referral to the
      local social services.

     Sexual education and family planning programs for at-risk groups such as single mothers and teenage
      parents should be developed or resumed, particularly in source communities. Free contraceptives should
      be made available to vulnerable groups, whether these groups are covered by health insurance or not.
      Information, education, and communication campaigns on family planning and its benefits are also
      needed. In addition, support should be provided to vulnerable groups to decrease the cost of
      transportation to family planning centers.

     In order to prevent the consequences of teenage pregancies, we also recommend prevention programs
      that can include: (i) classes on health, sexual education, and contraceptive education initiated as early as
      possible and implemented on a permanent basis in both schools and communities (available to those
      who do not attend school) and (ii) awareness and social norm changing campaigns on the relations
      between parents/ adults and children, decision-making autonomy for youths, and youth participation in
      decisions that affect their life.




116
        The coordination and referral system between health units (especially maternity and pediatric wards) and
         social services should be improved in accordance with the legislative provisions that are currently in force.
        Social workers should be available in all health units with maternity and/or pediatric wards according to
         the legal provisions that are currently in force. In addition, other specialists should also be available, for
         instance, psychologists working with mothers in special situations (for example, with post-partum
         depression).
        All hospital and maternity ward work procedures aimed at preventing mothers from leaving their children
         alone in the hospital for several days should be strictly implemented.
        The existing services provided by maternal centers need to be improved and strenghtened in all counties
         as a way to prevent the separation of children from their mothers and families.
        Adequate special protection response services for 0 to 3-year-old children should be developed or
         strenghtened in all counties of the country (for instance, increasing the availability of foster parents to
         urgently take these children in), particularly for children with disabilities and/or with very low birth weight.

        All these measures should be correlated and integrated with the pregnancy identification and monitoring
         efforts that should be carried out before birth (as part of the prenatal services) and with the community-
         based support and assistance services for the mother/ parents and the newborn child (as part of postnatal
         services).



 3.2.3.4                Parental Alcohol and/or Drug Abuse
One in five children in public care had one or both parents who abused alcohol and/or drugs prior to
the child’s entering the system.139 In most cases, only the father abused alcohol (9 percent of children).
However, 8 percent of children witnessed their mother abusing alcohol or drugs either alone (4
percent) or together with the father (4 percent).

FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
Twenty percent of mothers from rural source communities experienced parental alcohol abuse during
their own childhood.
Source: Survey of Households with Children in Public Care in Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data
are not weighted (N=754 mothers who were brought up in a family).

The incidence of parental alcohol or drug abuse cases is much higher among children who were
neglected, abused, and/or exploited before entering the system (33 percent). Figure 25 illustrates the
strong association between the two variables.

      The incidence is even higher if children relinquished in maternity wards are not considered (26 percent).

These data confirm the results of previous UNICEF studies140 that have shown that poor child nutrition,
child neglect and abuse, and the separation of children from their families are all correlated with
parental alcohol abuse. Table 23 shows that in families in which parents abuse alcohol and/or drugs,
the incidence of child neglect is 1.7 times higher than in families in which there is no abuse of alcohol
and/or drugs. Cases of child abuse or exploitation are five times more frequent. Overall, before
entering the system, 82 percent of children with parents who abuse alcohol and/or drugs have
suffered one of more forms of violence versus 48 percent of children with addiction-free parents.
However, further research is needed to establish whether this statistical link is causal.
In the majority of cases in which one or both parents abused alcohol or drugs, the DGASPC specialists
tended to state child neglect, abuse, or exploitation as the main cause of child-family separation,
given that “alcohol leads to domestic violence, which leads to child neglect” (Interview with
professional, Bârlad).
The incidence141 of parental alcohol or drug abuse cases is higher for children aged 3 to 14 years old
at entry into the system,142 higher for girls than for boys, much higher for Romanians and Hungarians
than for other ethnic groups, higher for children from rural areas than from urban areas,143 and higher
for those from families with at least three children than from smaller families.144 Given the last statistic,
it is not surprising that 72 percent of children with parents addicted to alcohol and/or other
substances have siblings who are also in public care.

Parental alcohol and/or drug abuse is not associated with child disability nor with children with special
educational needs. Nonetheless, it appears to be relevant with respect to children's psychological and
behavioral problems. Thus, as many as 24 percent of children of addicted parents had developmental
delays145 and over 15 percent had behavioral disorders146 since their entry into public care.
Parental alcohol and drug abuse is mentioned in at least 40 percent of children's case files in all
counties from the Moldova region.

 RECOMMENDATIONS

 Parental alcohol/drug abuse significantly increases the risk of a child being exposed to neglect, abuse, and/or
 exploitation and seems to be highly associated with the occurrence of developmental delays and behavioral
 disorders. Currently, there is no national program designed to address alcohol and drug abuse. Such a
 program that targeted parents (at least those parents whose children are in the child protection system) could
 have a significant impact in terms of preventing child-family separation, increasing the chances of family
 reintegration, and, in general, of respecting the rights of children to full and harmonious development within a
 family environment.
 Furthermore, it is necessary to increase access to existing services and to develop new specialized services for
 parents who are already suffering from addiction (alcohol or drugs).




 3.2.3.5                Parental Promiscuous and/or Criminal Behavior
Before entering the system, 13 percent of children in public care lived in a family in which at least one
adult member had been in trouble with the law (had a criminal record, had been in trouble with the
police, or had practiced prostitution). 147 In most cases, one or both parents had behaved
promiscuously and/or criminally (for around 11 percent of children), while in others, an adult member
other than the child’s mother or father had behaved promiscuously and/or criminally (over 2 percent).

FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
In rural source communities, the mothers of children in public care stated that in their own childhood
in their families of origin, 4 percent lived with adults with a criminal record, 3 percent with adults who
had had problems with the police, and 2 percent grew up around a woman (or women) who was
engaging in sexual relations in exchange for money.
Source: Survey of Households with Children in Public Care in Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data
are not weighted (N=754 mothers who were brought up in a family).

The children’s files show that all parents who were imprisoned had demonstrated promiscuous and/or
criminal behavior (see Annex 6 Table 19).148 Therefore, the children of parents who behave in these
ways are at a very high risk of being separated from their family due to the imprisonment of one or
both of their parents.

Parental criminal and/or promiscuous behavior represents a significant risk factor149 for child neglect,
abuse, and exploitation (Figure 26 and Annex 6 Table 20). The risk of one of more types of child
maltreatment is especially high in families in which an adult member other than the parents has a
criminal record, has had problems with the police, and/or engages in sexual relations in exchange for
money. For example, the risk of child exploitation is approximately two times higher than the average
if only the mother or the father are in conflict with the law but is around six times higher if both
parents or an adult member other than the parents are in that situation.
In the case of children from families in which adults have exhibited promiscuous and/or criminal
behavior, Table 24 shows that the DGASPC specialists tend to specify “the disappearance of parents”
and/or “deprivation of parental rights” as main causes of separation, while often adding as underlying
causes the detention of the parents 150 and parental criminal and/or promiscuous behavior. The
neglect, abuse, or exploitation of the child are also frequently mentioned among the causes but not
more frequently than average, which does not reflect the significant relationship between criminal
behavior and risk of child abuse and neglect. Only for families in which an adult other than the parents
has behaved in this way are neglect, abuse, and exploitation usually given as the main cause of
separation.
In many case files, poverty is given as the main cause of separation, even for children who have come
from families in which parents have exhibited promiscuous/criminal behavior and in which incidents of
child abuse or neglect have occurred.

There is a strong correlation between the promiscuous and/or criminal behavior of the adults in the
family and another risk factor, namely substance (alcohol/drug) abuse.151




149
      Further research is needed to establish whether the relation is causal.
150
   As already mentioned in section 3.2.1.2, when the causes of separation are specified in the files, parents’ detention is
recorded under various categories (disappearance of parents, deprivation of parental rights, other causes, and
occasionally the imprisonment of parents).
151
   The incidence of alcohol or drug abuse is of 32 to 35 percent among adults from families in which the father has
exhibited criminal and/or promiscuous behavior (whether together with the mother or not) and as high as 55 percent in
families in which an adult member other than the parents has exhibited such behavior (versus the average of 20
percent).

120
Parental promiscuous and/or criminal behavior, especially by the mother, has multiple harmful effects
on the child's development:
 Maternal criminal and/or promiscuous behavior increases a child’s risk of having special
  educational needs. The incidence of special educational needs is twice the average among children
  of mothers with promiscuous and/or criminal behavior (18 percent versus 9 percent).152 Children
  from families in which the father has a criminal record and/or problems with police do not have a
  higher incidence of special educational needs.
 At the same time, maternal criminal and/or promiscuous behavior appears to be extremely relevant
  to the development of behavioral disorders in children. The percentage of children in care aged 7
  to 17 years with behavioral problems is three times higher than average if only the mother has
  exhibited promiscuous and/or criminal behavior and is five times higher than average if both
  parents have exhibited such behavior (30 percent and 48 percent respectively versus the average
  of 10 percent).153 However, the children from families in which only the father has a criminal record
  and/or has had problems with the police do not have a higher than average risk of behavioral
  problems.
 Maternal criminal and/or promiscuous behavior is also associated with developmental delays in
  children. According to the baseline psychological assessment received by children as they enter
  public care, the incidence of children with developmental delays (in one or more dimensions) is 21
  percent if the mother has exhibited promiscuous and/or criminal behavior, versus an average of 17
  percent. 154 Children from families in which only the father has a criminal record and/or has had
  problems with the police do not have a higher than average risk of developmental delays.
Parental criminal and/or promiscuous behavior is not associated with child disability.
The incidence of parental promiscuous and/or criminal behavior was higher among children aged 1 to
6 years old at their entry into the system,155 children from rural areas,156 and those from dysfunctional
families, especially those with more than three children.157 However, it was similar for girls and boys
and for children from all ethnic groups (with a slight over-representation of Roma children). Sixty-
three percent of children whose parents have exhibited such behavior have siblings in public care.
The vast majority of these children arrived in the system either directly from their family (53 percent)
or by one of three other less common routes:158 (i) Maternity ward --> Family --> Relatives --> SPS; (ii)
Maternity ward --> Family --> Children left home alone --> SPS; and (iii) Maternity ward --> Family --
> Children who ran away from home/street children --> SPS.
Parental criminal and/or promiscuous behavior was reported in 12 to 16 percent of children's case
files in nine counties: Olt, Galați, Bihor, Botoșani, Gorj, Hunedoara, Suceava, Vâlcea, and Bucharest
(Annex 6 Table 21).




152
   This risk is also higher in the case of children from families in which an adult member other than the parents has
exhibited promiscuous and/or criminal behavior (12 percent).
153
   This risk is also high for children from families in which an adult member other than the parents has exhibited
promiscuous and/or criminal behavior (17 percent).
154
  This risk is even higher for families in which an adult member other than the parents has exhibited promiscuous
and/or criminal behavior (32 percent).
155
  The incidence of parental promiscuous and/or criminal behavior is 15 to 17 percent versus the average of 12 percent.
Most of these children were 3 to 14 years old in November-December 2014.
156
   An incidence of parental promiscuous and/or criminal behavior of 14 percent of children from rural areas versus 11
percent of children from urban areas.
157
  An incidence of parental promiscuous and/or criminal behavior of 18 percent of children from families with three or
more children versus 11 percent of children from one-child families and 12 percent of those from two-child families.
158
   The cumulative proportion of children arriving in the protection sysyem by these routes is about 25 percent versus 12
percent of the total population of children in public care.

                                                                                                                   121
RECOMMENDATIONS

 In order to prevent the separation of children from their families as well as to guarantee the child’s right to a
 safe and full development, we recommend setting up of community-based services to ensure the early
 identification, support, and continuous monitoring of children from families with promiscuous and/or criminal
 adults. These services are particularly needed by families headed by single-mothers with no dwelling of their
 own, thus requiring them to live with relatives or other people, some of whom exhibit behavior that endangers
 the health and development of the child. In situations where the mother is also abused, both the mother and
 the children need protection and support to enable them to live in a secure family environment.
 Also, a national program should be developed for children whose parents are in prison. Some of these children
 are in public care, but others are living in families, often with single-mothers who engage in sexual relations in
 exchange for money in order to make a living. Alternatively, they may live with relatives who exhibit
 promiscuous and/or criminal behavior. Thus, these children risk being neglected, abused, and/or exploited.
 It is also important to develop procedures to ensure continuity of contact between these children and their
 incarcerated parents as well as with their siblings who are also in public care.
 Also, a support program should be developed for young people who leave public care in order to prevent
 them from sliding back into a cycle of disadvantages and from being victimized by organized crime groups
 (for example, trafficking and prostitution).




3.2.3.6           Domestic Violence
Data on domestic violence were not systematically collected within the quantitative research
component, but the theme was frequently mentioned in the qualitative study. The DGASPC
professionals, parents, and children usually mentioned domestic violence in the context of parental
alcohol abuse and atypical demographic behavior.
        “There are also problems between the parents; I know this. I refer to domestic violence, although
        I can’t say that this is such a major cause, but it happens, especially after alcohol abuse. The
        parents fight, hit each other in front of the children, and that’s when we have to act. The kids
        might become victims as well.” (Interview with a professional, Bacău)
        “I’ve had cases when the parents...there was domestic violence. The father killed the mother, and
        of course we took the children from there into public care.” (Interview with a professional, Arad)
        “How did your kids end up in public care?

        - Because I left them there. When I left their father, he had beaten me up. I ended up here, in
        child protection, and I was admitted to hospital because of the wounds. With all three kids, they
        put me under abused mothers. I was there for four months... He learned of me being there, he
        came looking for us every day. For four months, he came there every day, promised he’d change;
        at some point I believed him, I asked to be discharged, I went home on a Monday and the
        following day after I got home, he beat me up again, and the kids too, because he said they
        weren’t his. And on Wednesday I came back to the Directorate [DGASPC] with all three kids and
        they told me that, as I filed the request for discharge, they couldn’t take me back in. That’s the
        rule. And since I had nowhere to go with them, I left them there and left.... [...] They [DGASPC]
        were trying to have me reintegrated into the family, but I couldn’t live with that man anymore. He
        would beat me up every day.” (Interview with a parent whose children are in the system, Craiova)
         “How did you end up in the system?
        - Mom and dad separated and now she is with another man, who kept beating us, my sister and I,
        and once someone from the child protection called and they came and got us out of there.”

 3.2.3.7            Parents with Disabilities and/or Mental Health Problems
Whether the parents of children in care have a disability or have mental health problems is very
relevant to the development of an effective post-separation individualized protection plan (PIP). For
example, when a child has been taken into care because his or her disabled single-mother is unable to
meet her child’s needs, it may be appropriate for the child’s PIP to allow for the continuation of
contact with the mother (and other family members) while ensuring long-term substitute family care.
However, it is less likely (or even desirable) for this to be the case with a parent who has a history of
abusive or threatening behavior.
About 18 percent of children have experienced parental disability and/or mental health problems in
their family of origin before entering public care (see also Annex 6 Tables 22 and 23). Most often, only
the mother has had mental health problems (for about 10 percent of children in care). In addition,
about 5 percent of children lived in households in which an adult other than the parents had a mental
health problem and/or disability. Overall, over 22 percent of children had experienced living with an
adult with disability before entering the system.
         “There are many mothers with mental health problems and also a disability, and since there isn’t
         anyone to support or help them, we took the children in public care.” (Interview with a
         professional, Arad)
         “In many situations there are mothers with medical issues, because there might be someone with
         a certain degree of disability, or they might have a developmental delay, and not be educated.
         And many mothers with medical problems don’t have documents to prove this [they don’t have a
         disability certificate]. There are many, quite a lot of mothers with developmental delays, that lack
         a [disability] certificate.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)

Parental disability or mental health problems, usually on the part of the mother, are considered in the
international literature to increase the probability of child neglect and abuse. For children in public
care in Romania, this seems not to be the case since the incidence of parental disability or mental
health problems is lower than average among children who experienced neglect, abuse, or
exploitation (see Annex 6 Table 22).

Nonetheless, the data indicate a more nuanced reality. Figure 27 shows that:
 If only the mother has disabilities or mental health problems, the risk of child abuse and neglect
  (according to the evidence contained in the case files) is significantly lower than average (45
  percent versus 52 percent of children). Even so, it should be noted that children of mothers with
  mental health problems have a very high risk of being relinquished in a maternity ward straight
  after birth (43 percent versus the average of 24 percent). Thus, many of these children arrived in
  the system via this route. Consequently, maternal mental health problems can be a risk factor for


                                                                                                                          123
      child abuse or neglect only if being relinquished in a maternity ward is considered a form of
      neglect.
 If only the father has disabilities or mental health problems or if both parents have serious health
  problems, there is a statistically significant association between the presence of parental disability
  and the child's experiences of neglect and/or abuse. Thus, parental disability appears to be a
  significant risk factor of child neglect and abuse. An even stronger risk factor is the existence of
  another household member with disabilities or mental health problems (usually a man other than
  the father). Thus, the risk of neglect and/or abuse is about 1.5 times higher in families with paternal
  disabilities and in families with other (male) adult household member with disabilities than in
  families where only the mother has disabilities or mental health problems. Just to clarify, this does
  not imply that paternal or other male family member disability leads to child neglect and/or abuse
  but only that a man with disabilities is more likely to be present in those families where child
  neglect and/or abuse occurs (see also Annex 6 Table 22).
Paternal disability is strongly associated with another risk factor, namely alcohol abuse.159
In accordance with the results presented above, the DGASPC professionals tended to state “disabilities
of the parents” as the main cause of separation only if the mother had mental health problems and/or
disabilities. Table 25 shows that the chances of parental disability being stated as the cause of
separation in the children’s files are about five times higher than average for children from families
where only the mother or both the mother and the father have disabilities and/or mental health
problems. By contrast, if only the father has disabilities and/or mental health problems or if another
household member has serious health problems, the main cause of separation is usually stated by
DGASPC specialists as neglect, abuse, or exploitation (41 to 42 percent versus an average of 31
percent for all children in care).

In many case files, poverty is stated as main cause of separation even for families with parental
disability in which the child was abused or neglected before entering the system.
Families in which just the mother has mental health problems and/or disabilities are most often
single-parent families in urban areas who lack kinship support. Less than half have a stable dwelling,
and as a result, many of these mothers live wherever they find a place and sometimes, on a temporary
basis, they live in institutions, on the street or with various sexual partners.

   The incidence of alcohol or drug abuse is about 32 percent among fathers with disabilities versus the average of 20
percent.

Our analysis shows that there were three main entry routes into the system for children with single-
mothers with mental health problems and/or disabilities: (i) some were relinquished in maternity
wards by mothers who already had one or two children; (ii) others were relinquished to the public care
system by their mothers during periods of homelessness or when they were in between
accommodation; and (iii) a small number entered the system at the request of their mother with
whom they have a problematic relationship. These relinquished children are both girls and boys with a
higher than average risk of having disabilities and/or developmental delays. Forty-four percent of
them have siblings who are also in the system (versus the average of 50 percent).
All other families marked by parental (or adulthood) disabilities and/or mental health problems have
their own dwellings or live with relatives in large multigenerational households with three or more
children.160 The majority are from rural areas. Children from these households arrive in public care
directly from their families, and more than 60 percent of them have brothers and sisters in the system.
 Children who arrive in care from families in which only the father is disabled tend to be mostly girls
  (56 percent) aged between 3 and 10 years and in good health. Among those over 7 years of age,
  the risk of running away from home is 1.5 times higher than average (12 percent versus 7.5
  percent).
 Children who arrive in care from families in which both parents have disabilities and/or mental
  health problems are mostly boys (58 percent), and are either between 3 and 10 years of age or are
  adolescents over 14 years old who have a problematic relation with their parents. Out of these, one
  in five have disabilities, developmental delays, and/or special educational needs.
The distribution by county of the children with one or both parents with disabilities and/or mental
health problems is shown in Figure 28. Rates of children with mothers living with mental health
problems and/or disabilities are much higher than average in Dolj, Mehedinți, and Vâlcea counties,
while there are disproportionately more children with disabled fathers in Gorj and Olt.




160
      About 7 percent of these are single-parent families with only the father being present.

3.2.4                    Children with Special Needs
As of December 2014, the ANPDCA reported that there were over 70,000 children with disabilities in
Romania, the vast majority of whom lived with their families (about 80 percent). Nonetheless, not only
in Romania but in the entire Central and Eastern European region and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CEE/CIS), the tradition of placing children with disabilities in public care has
continued to prevail.161
The potential link between children’s special needs and child abuse and neglect is not only
controversial but also difficult to assess based on a rigorous methodology.162 Nevertheless, some
research163 has suggested that children with physical disability and/or mental health problem can be
at a higher risk of abuse and neglect than healthy children.
To try to understand this link in the context of public care in Romania, this section analyzes five
categories of children:
 Infants (0-12 months) born premature and/or underweight
 Children with disabilities
 Children with developmental delays;
 Children with special educational needs (SEN)
 Children with behavioral problems.164

other children or youngsters, being a member of a gang of at-risk peers, running away from home, and/or problems

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted.
Note: For the categories of children 0-17 years, children relinquished straight after birth in maternity wards are
not included.

Table 26 above shows the relation between the five categories of children with special needs and the
forms of violence they were exposed to prior to entry in the system. The following subsections provide
a more detailed analysis of this connection and of the profiles of the five categories of children.



3.2.4.1               Infants 0-12 Months Old Born Premature and/or
                      Underweight
Chapter 3.1.4 revealed that 35 percent of all children in public care were under 12 months old when
they entered the system. Fifteen percent of these children were premature and/or underweight babies,
who were almost equally divided between boys and girls, mostly from urban areas, and most of which
ended up in the system after having been relinquished in maternity hospitals after birth (82 percent).
In other words, premature and/or underweight babies are much more likely to be relinquished in
maternity wards than full-term and/or normal-weight infants (82 percent versus 67 percent).165 Only
18 percent of premature and/or underweight babies were taken home with their families and, a few
months later, entered public care directly from their families.
To note, underweight and/or premature children come from the same types of families as normal-
weight and/or full-term infants. Almost 60 percent of them come from single-parent families (single-
mother), with or without other children besides the baby, with no support from their kinship networks.
Nevertheless, a significantly higher share of underweight and/or premature children do not appear to
have any siblings in the system, which highlights a tendency – even among those mothers who have
gained experience by looking after other children at home – to give up on these children who need
time to fully develop and grow. This tendency is also reinforced by the statistically significant
association between premature and/or underweight babies and disability, as well as developmental
delays. Thus, premature and/or underweight infants are three times more likely to have disabilities
when they enter public care than normal-weight and/or full-term infants (22 percent versus 7 percent).
They are also more likely to have developmental delays when they enter the system (26 percent versus
9 percent).

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=18,065 infants aged between 0 and 12 months, of whom 2,685 were premature and/or underweight).
Note: The sum of the bars per category is 110 percent and 112 percent respectively because some case files
stated two to four causes of separation.

Table 26 shows that the risk of being neglected, abused, or exploited before entering public care is
much lower in infants aged 0 to 12 months than for children who were older than 1 year of age when
they were taken into care. Also, among infants (0 to 12 months), exposure to neglect, abuse, or
exploitation is even lower in the case of premature and/or underweight babies, which, again, is
probably due to the fact that the majority of them entered the system directly from a maternity ward.
Among the premature and/or underweight infants, only 1.2 percent were biological orphans when
they entered the system. This percentage is small but it is three times higher than the percentage of
biological orphans of full-term and normal weight. Also, they are more likely to come from
dysfunctional families (11 percent versus 9 percent) and to have mothers/parents with disabilities
and/or mental health problems (28 percent versus 22 percent). However, they have a relatively low risk
of having institutionalized parents (in prison or in health or social institutions), parents who are
working abroad, or parents deprived of their parental rights. Nor are they likely to have mothers or
parents who engage in alcohol abuse or promiscuous behavior or who have problems with the police
and/or a criminal record. At the same time, among the babies who were born preterm and/or who
were underweight when entering the system, teenage mothers are under-represented while mothers
aged between 35 to 45 years at childbirth are over-represented. Only one in ten premature and/or
underweight infants who ended up in public care were relinquished by teenage mothers whereas one
in five or six had been left behind in the maternity ward by mothers who were 35 to 45 years of age.
The main cause of these infants’ separation from their families as reported in the case files by DGASPC
specialists (Figure 30) is consistent with our analysis of the risk factors related to children’s separation
from their families. “Child’s disability” shows up more often than for the other infants, while “neglect,
abuse, or exploitation” is mentioned more rarely. “Other causes” are reported more frequently and
they generally refer to children “relinquished in a maternity ward.” Thus, these premature and/or
underweight infants were relinquished due to their “disability”.
Nonetheless, “poverty” is by far the prevalent cause reported for all the children who entered the
system between the ages of 0 to 12 months regardless by which route.




                                                                                                                            129
The files specify “poverty” as the main cause of separation for between 37 and 40 percent of these
infants (Figure 30). Remarkably, this is close to the rates contained in the official ANPDCA reports, but
they are much higher than the average rate for the total population of children in public care based
on the case file survey (32 percent, see Figure 19). Nevertheless, the data regarding the income and
the housing situations of the families of origin of these infants do not support this assessment.
Children who entered the system at the age of 0 to 12 months, regardless of the route taken, come
from families with the same socioeconomic status as those of the children who were taken into care at
1 year of age or older.

 3.2.4.2             Children with Disabilities
Out of all children in state care, nearly 11 percent had a disability before they entered the protection
system.166 Out of all children with disabilities over 3 years old, around one-third were completely
dependent and one-third needed support to carry out their day-to-day activities. The evaluations
carried out on each child when they first entered the system highlight the fact that many other
children had serious health problems. Thus, the evaluations conducted after the children had entered
the system show that children with disabilities represent almost 29 percent of all children (identified
either before entering the system or when they entered the system or at a later stage). However, in
this section we focus our attention only on children with disabilities at the moment of their entry into
public care.
Their case files indicate that neglect, emotional and/or physical abuse, and exploitation have been
reported more rarely for children with disabilities than for children with no disabilities (Table 26). The
more serious the disability, the weaker the link between child disability and maltreatment.
The qualitative study showed that in some cases, the neglect of children with disabilities is caused by
the fact that parents are not able to understand the disabilities and to meet their children's needs,
mainly due to their own inadequate education and social prejudice. In the absence of professional
support and guidance, poorly educated parents who also have other children can find it seriously
difficult to cope with a child with disabilities.
            “Which are the main difficulties you face with the children?

            - The girl, the girl, she is… she’s never been good. She has brain problems, I have some
            documents showing this, she has a handicap, has brain problems.” (Interview with parent of
            institutionalized children, Arad)

Children with disabilities have an average risk of being relinquished in maternity wards straight after
birth, but double the average risk of being relinquished in a hospital or pediatric unit after several
months (15 percent versus the average of 7 percent). Consequently, more than 60 percent of them
entered the system at an early age (between 0 and 2 years old).167
            “- The children who are most often relinquished to the system are those with serious medical
            issues, that is children who can’t move, with a twisted body,... And the main issue is the
            psychological barrier. Once the parents of these children relinquish them, to the parent the child
            ceases to exist... If, say, for the following 3 months, the child hasn’t been visited by the parents,
            then it is clear that they will never be visited again. So we’re talking here about ZERO chances of
            reintegration.
            - I have a case. Cases, actually. They ended up in a center for adults with disabilities. And I have
            raised them since they were 4 years old. Actually, since they were in the orphanage. The old
            orphanage, that’s where I took over and now they’re in their 20s.” (Focus group with specialists,
            Bucharest)



166
   Children with disabilitie represent almost 29 percent of all children in public care. This section refers only to those
children who had a disability at the time of their entry into the system, irrespective of whether or not they had a
certificate of disability. Children with disabilities when they enter the child protection system are more likely to be boys
than girls (57 and 43 percent respectively) and tend to be from urban areas (62 percent).
167
      At present, more than 90 percent of them are aged between 7 and 26+ years.

130
Only 3 percent of these disabled children are true orphans.168 For fewer than half, their parents are
either abroad or in detention. Child disability is not associated with dysfunctional families or with
parental alcohol abuse. Nearly all of them come from single-mother families or nuclear families with
one or two children. Child disability is associated only with parental disability and/or mental health
problems, particularly in families in which the single-mother or both parents also have health
problems. Nonetheless, only about 22 percent of all children with disabilities have parents with
disabilities and/or mental health problems.
So it would seem that children with disabilities are often placed in public care based on tradition than
because of neglect, abuse, or unfortunate events. However, the qualitative study showed that another
equally important reason why parents let their disabled children go into public care, particularly
children with severe disabilities, is the lack of health, rehabilitation and support services for people
with disabilities (both children and adults). True stories 4a and 4b in the next Story Bag are testimonies
to this effect. The lack of health, rehabilitation, and support services for people with disabilities is a
structural cause underpinning the separation of children from their families that is discussed in the
next section (section 3.2.5.4), which also includes recommendations.

Note: The sum of the bars per category is 115 percent and 117 percent respectively because some case files gave

The main causes of separation stated in the case files of children with disabilities, other than the
disabilities themselves, are neglect, abuse, exploitation, and poverty.
It is worth mentioning that poverty is specified as the main cause of separation for a quarter of
children with disabilities who were neglected or abused before entering the system. So, in many cases,
the DGASPC professionals selected ”poverty” over two other appropriate and relevant causes – “child
disability” and “neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation."

 3.2.4.3             Children with Developmental Delays
Fewer than half of all children in public care received a baseline psychological evaluation when they
entered the system. Actually, only 37 percent were psychologically assessed and had the results
entered in their case files. Of these children with such information in their case files, 17 percent had
various delays or disorders in one or more dimensions (emotional, cognitive, behavioral,
psychophysiological, personality, and interpersonal relationship skills) when they entered in the
system. Thirty-six percent of children with recorded developmental delays also had disabilities.
Table 26 indicates that children with developmental delays had a disproportionately high risk of being
neglected, abused, and/or exploited before entering the system. The more dimensions of
developmental delays were recorded, the more forms of violence the child had suffered.
Children with developmental delays were unlikely to have been relinquished in maternity straight after
birth but had a higher than average risk of being subsequently relinquished in a hospital or pediatric
unit (12 percent versus the average of 7 percent). So, the majority arrived in the system between the
ages of 3 and 17 years. 169
Among children with recorded developmental delays, there were more boys than girls (57 percent
versus 43 percent), more Romanians and Roma than average, and more from rural areas than urban
areas. More than half came from nuclear families with three or more children.

Note: The sum of the bars per category is 115 percent because some case files gave two to four causes of
separation.

As shown in the previous sections, child developmental delays are significantly associated with
parental substance abuse, parental disability and/or mental health problems, and parental
promiscuous and/or criminal behavior. Children with developmental delays that were recorded when
they entered the system have a lower than average probablility of being true orphans (having lost one
or both parents), of coming from dysfunctional families, of having teenage mothers, parents abroad,
or mothers/parents who are institutionalized (in prison or in social or health units).
In line with the results of the analysis above, the main cause of separation stated by DGASPC
specialists in the case files of children with developmental delays is that of neglect, abuse, and
exploitation (Figure 32).

 3.2.4.4             Children Aged 6-17 Years with Special Educational Needs
Children with special educational needs (SEN) account for 9 percent of all children aged between 6
and 17 years when they entered the system. Two-thirds of them are children with recorded
developmental delays. Also, 68 percent of them have a disability. Thus, around 4 percent of children
aged between 6 and 17 years at entry into the protection system had physical disabilities as well as
developmental delays and special educational needs, while an additional 6 percent had two of these
vulnerabilities.
According to Table 26, children with SEN are disproportionately likely to have been exploited (3.5
times higher than average) prior to entering the system, but not neglected or abused. Nearly all of
them arrived in the system between the ages of 6 and 13 years directly from their birth family or
relatives. They came from the prevailing types of families (nuclear and single-mother), most with one
or two children.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=15,742 children in public care aged 6-17 years, of which 1,456 children with SEN at entry into the system).
Note: The sum of bars per category is 124 percent and 119 percent respectively because some case files stated
two to four causes of separation.

Only 5 percent of children with SEN aged 6 to 17 years at the time of their entry into the system were
true orphans.170 Also, these children had a lower than average likelihood of coming from dysfunctional
families, having teenage mothers, or having parents who had been deprived of their parental rights,
had left to go abroad or were institutionalized (in prison or in social or health units). Nonetheless, as
shown in the previous sections, children with SEN are significantly correlated with parental disability
and/or mental health problems as well as with maternal criminal and/or promiscuous behavior.
DGASPC specialists tend to specify “child disability” as main cause of separation in six times more
cases than average for children with SEN (25 percent compared to 4 percent, see Figure 33). “Other
causes” were also mentioned in 20 percent of the cases files of children with SEN. In half of these
cases, the DGASPC specialists explained that “other causes” referred to “the need to attend a special

school” because inclusive education or alternatives to mainstream schools were not available at the
community level. The lack of educational services for children with SEN and/or disabilities is a
structural cause underpinning the separation of children from their families, as discussed in the next
section (3.2.5.4), which also includes recommendations.
Poverty was stated as the cause of separation for one in every five cases of children with SEN (who
may also have had disabilities and/or developmental delays) who were neglected or abused before
entering the system. So, in many cases, the DGASPC professionals select “poverty” over two other
appropriate and relevant causes – “child disability” and “neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation.”

 3.2.4.5              Children Aged 7-17 Years Old with Behavioral Problems
In this report, children with behavioral problems are defined as those who, before entering the system,
had experienced violence with other children or youngsters, being a member of a gang of at-risk
peers, running away from home, and/or problems with the police.
            “I would pick on girls and break windows, fight a lot and wouldn’t listen to my parents, skip
            school and my parents and I didn’t get along too well, I smoked...now I quit. Yes. I would pick on
            old ladies, beat them.” (Focus group with children, Timișoara)
            “I have many cases of children with behavioral problems, which don’t really fall into a disability
            category. To be brief, the children are bad, they steal, and they can’t control them, so the parents
            or the extended family (if the parents are abroad) can’t take the responsibility of looking after
            them anymore. And they leave them with us.” (Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)

One in every ten children in public care who were 7 to 17 years old when they entered the system has
such behavioral disorders. Children with disabilities have a lower than average probability of having
behavioral problems. In contrast, children with SEN and especially those with developmental delays
are two times more likely than average to have had behavioral problems before entering the
system.171
The data in Table 26 show that children with behavioral disorders were disproportionately likely to
have been neglected, abused (almost three times higher than average), and/or exploited (over ten
times higher than average) before entering the system.
There were more boys than girls with behavioral problems (60 percent versus 40 percent). They came
from the prevailing types of families (nuclear and single-mother), most often with three or more
children. About 85 percent of them arrived in public care directly from their family or relatives,172 but
the majority of them had a bad relationship with their family.173 Out of all children in public care, they
were most likely to have arrived in public care via a street route (10 percent versus the average of 3
percent), either by being relinquished on the street or in public spaces or by running away from home.
At the same time, they had a higher than average probability of having been taken care of by a non-
relative before entering the system.174
            “The children who are most often relinquished to the system are those with serious medical
            issues, that is children who can’t move, with a twisted body, [...] But you know, it’s even more
            difficult to deal with children with behavioral problems, because those who are confined to a bed
            are accepted more easily than those with behavioral problems, who turn the house upside down,
            who are completely unpredictable, so many parents don’t want to recognize them as their own.”
            (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)
            “Other problems related to separation arise at the age of 12 to 13, when they leave home. They
            pack up and leave home, become vagrants, and then the family can’t cope with this, so, normally,
            they contact the authorities.” (Interview with a professional, Bacău)



171
   Out of all children with recorded behavioral problems when they entered the system, 10 percent had disabilities, 16
percent had special educational needs, and 46 percent had developmental delays.
172
      For comparison, the average is 61 percent (see Infograph Chart 2).
173
      A proportion of 64 percent versus the average of 34 percent.
174
      A proportion of 5 percent versus the average of 2 percent.

            “For instance, a child has behavioral problems and the parent comes to the Directorate and says,
            'I can’t keep him/her in the family.' This is extremely unfair - for a parent to come and say they
            want to put the child in the institution because he or she has behavioral problems. And if you
            were to look at the family, at the end of the day, they are the root cause of the behavioral
            problems. The problems occur usually when they hit puberty. And the thing is that parents
            basically find it convenient to take this approach, they say ‘I don’t know what to do to him/her.
            You handle him/her!’. ‘Now, wait a minute! You’ll know what to do. We’ll tell you what to do!’ -
            this is what making them responsible means." (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)

Fewer than average children with behavioral disorders are true orphans, come from dysfunctional
families, have teenage mothers, or have parents who left to go abroad or are institutionalized (in
prison or in social or health units). A proportion of 2.2 percent of them had parents who had been
deprived of their parental rights at the time when the child entered the system, which is higher than
the average of 1.4 percent for all children in public care.175 Also, the child’s behavioral problems are
correlated with the following risk factors: parental alcohol and/or drug abuse, the presence of an adult
household member other than the parents with mental health problems, and parental promiscuous
and/or criminal behavior.

“- Harry [the child] has had problems since birth; they told me he
would live only for six hours, and now he is 3 years old. What can I                       4a
say? My husband couldn’t deal with it; he said he wouldn’t accept it.
We divorced, because he found someone else and said that the other
woman could give him healthy kids, not like mine. And that’s when I
took the child and came to Craiova, to my father’s. And I live with my
father. I stayed at home, with the child, for as long as I could. But when he got close to the
age of 3, I started to work. I looked for a job in education, but in the entire county of Dolj
you can’t find anything related to math; so I started to work as a program tester...
Which are the main problems you are faced with now?
- Time. I don’t have time for the kid, for work, for me, for the household... I work from 9 to 6.
This means that I leave home at 8:10 or 8:15 and return at a quarter to 7, in the best of cases,
or at 7. And when I get home, I don’t know what to do first. [...] My father, no...he doesn’t
take care of the child, he doesn’t help or look at him; he can’t stand the idea. And he said he
would help with anything I ask him, but not with the... The child has a neck cannula, because
he can’t breathe well, so you have to aspirate it. And there is just one lady helping me look
after him. I take him to her place in the morning, and pick him up in the evening. In the
beginning, she would come to my place in the morning, and leave when I came back from
work. Now I take him there, so she can do her house chores as well...
What are the child’s health problems?
- When he was born, the brain did not receive enough oxygen, so he has hypoxic-ischemic
encephalopathy. He can’t swallow, can’t track you visually, can’t hold his head up... This is
how things are... He needs constant care; I told you he needs aspiration. That’s why I keep
looking for a place where he can be safe, where I can leave him and stay assured that he is
looked after, and pick him up at the end of the week, or when I have more time.... That is, not
to have to run away from work all the time and leave things unfinished there....
And you came to the DGASPC hoping to find this service?
- Yes. Because what I had in mind was to admit him to a center for children with disabilities
where he is looked after and I know he is safe. To be able to take him home whenever I want
to, because I won’t sign a document by which I relinquish him to you and not take him back. I
don’t know, I kept looking, I even inquired in Bucharest. I mean a center, a place...we are many
mothers in this situation. So, we could even take turns. We said. Let’s get together. Take the
children somewhere and take turns. Two stay one day, another two on another day....I don’t
know, this could be an option. [...] When I was in Bucharest, in intensive care, I talked to other
moms in the ward. You can’t find one in the entire country...you have them abroad... I mean, a
place where you can go and die in peace, without being kicked out. Because this is what they
did with us in intensive care, they actually kicked us out because we were occupying a bed for
nothing. They used to tell us: others are coming in, and they stand a chance. Yours don’t have
any chance. You are occupying the bed. That was the idea. A place from where you are not
kicked out. You know that there you have people that don’t have any chance... But they are
looked after and allowed to die in peace. Something like this.”

“Which are the pros of the child care system?
- The main advantage is the fact that we create a safe environment for
                                                                                             4b
children who can’t be looked after at home, this on the one hand. Or if
they were to be looked after at home, they would endanger the family,
as an institution, as a unit.
What do you mean?
- Children like the ones we have here [in child care] require 24h a day care. In order for a
family member to do this, and I refer to the mother or the father, they should not have a job.
Moreover, the state provides that allowance for caretakers of children with disabilities, but it
doesn’t match the salary. Then, the family might have other children. But a child like this
requires full attention, so the family tends to neglect the others. So yes, I say it full-heartedly,
that the family should be engaged, even for this child we have here, but not as much as to
affect the other children or endanger the family in itself or the relationship between spouses.
So this is a positive thing, the fact that they can bring the child with special needs here, and
he/she is looked after?
- Exactly. Looked after, because, I told you, in my professional activity I’ve traveled to
disadvantaged areas and come across kids like the ones we have here, and for the sake of
the money received as caretaker....I saw a child left on a straw bed, who was not washed, not
taken care of, only occasionally fed, just like an animal, but who generated income. So I can’t
support this, the family could not take care of him. Or I’ve seen families that split because of
a child like this, who cries and screams at night, who has needs you don’t know how to meet.
I speak of everything from hygiene to the medical side. I had kids who were fed through a
tube for some time. It’s pretty difficult to do it at home.”

3.2.5                 Structural Risk Factors
As shown in the previous chapters, unfortunate events (with otherwise low probability of happening
among the general child population) abound in the life of children in public care.176 This chapter shifts
the focus to the macro environment and analyzes the structural risk factors associated with the
separation of children from their families.
Although cases of neglect, abuse, exploitation, and any form of violence are difficult to identify,
prevent, and properly mitigate, policies and systems in the education, health, and social assistance
sectors can provide vital preventive or early support measures that will prevent these events from
having any significant negative effects on the child’s development. For instance, a family physician
who was monitoring an ”8 month old baby girl who weighed 3 kilograms”177 could have notified the
DGASPC. At the same time, schools and health clinics can act as referral systems for cases of neglect,
abuse, or domestic violence. Last but not least, the capacity of professionals from all levels and
institutions to identify sexual abuse cases needs to be strengthened because delays in spotting these
cases can lead to negative consequences for the victim from which it is difficult to recover.
Child protection system professionals focus on individual risk factors by tending to blame the parents
and holding them responsible for not protecting their children from various vulnerabilities, regardless
of any historical and structural barriers that they may face in earning adequate income. The finger is
usually pointed at parents’ lack of education and disinterest towards their children, while poverty is
associated with parents’ unwillingness to work or look for a job. However, previous research178 in
Romania has identified four main causes of separation of children from their families that relate to
structural risk factors and are embedded in the country’s social, economic, political, and cultural
processes at macro level: (i) adverse values and norms, including customs and traditions that have
influenced behavior that has led to the child’s current situation; (ii) social inertia, especially as it relates
to the pre-1989 situation, subsequent unclear goals, and weaknesses in the transitional process; (iii)
economic poverty, particularly rural, regional, and community poverty, and its influence on children;
and (iv) weak governance in the legal, policy, and administrative systems, decentralization, corruption,
and budgetary issues. Thus, the social context within which the family lives influences the likelihood of
children suffering from the individual-level risk factors discussed in the previous sections.
Accordingly, the chapter is organized in five sections that discuss structural risk factors, four sections
tackling poverty, housing vulnerabilities, source communities, and basic social services for vulnerable
groups at the community level, and a concluding section on the priority of the development of
preventive services.

 3.2.5.1              Poverty, Welfare Dependency and Low Socioeconomic
                      Status
In the children's case files, poverty is overused as an explanation for the separation of children from
their families. As the previous sections showed, many child protection professionals prefer to use
“poverty” rather than other causes that reflect the child’s situation, such as “neglect, abuse, and/or
exploitation” or “child disability.” Despite this, poverty and low household income and expenses is one
of the least documented aspects in the children's files because it is taken for granted. Figure 35 shows
that as many as 82 percent of all case files of children in public care provide incomplete or no data on
the household incomes. In most cases, the files may include brief references to some income sources
of some of the family members (for example, a grandmother’s pension, occasional income, or a child
allowance). However, the available valid data indicate that only 4 percent of children in public care
come from non-poor households (with a per capita monthly income higher than 400 lei), and an

  additional 6 percent are at risk of poverty (relative poverty), while the other 90 percent are from poor
  or extremely poor families. This is a very strong relevant conclusion, from the perspective of policies
  for children and families, albeit based on weak data.

  2014 in order to ensure comparability.

  For a more comprehensive picture, household income data were analyzed by the entry route via which
  children came into public care (Figure 35 and Annex 6 Table 25). While some data are missing,
  especially for children relinquished in health units or those who arrived in the system via street routes,
  even the files for 79 percent of children who came directly from their families of origin contained very
  little information on income. Based on the available data, we found that children following street
  routes and those who were relinquished in health units came from extremely poor families. Children
  who arrived in the system directly from their families of origin (with a stable dwelling) were in a
  slightly better situation, while children living with relatives or other people were in the best situation,
  though even for them, 56 percent lived in very poor households before entering the system.
  The case files contain some additional data on income sources, though unsystematically recorded179
  and of rather poor quality.180 These data (see Annex 6 Table 25) reflect the prevailing pattern of
  joblessness and/or underemployment that characterizes the population of mothers, fathers, and
  families described in section 3.1.2. Most of these parents or caretakers have poor education and few
  professional skills and, consequently, they hold marginal or highly vulnerable positions in the labor
  market. Very few of them are employees in the formal sector, with the majority doing casual work in
  the “grey” or “black” informal sector. Hence, the most frequent sources of household income are
  casual work and social benefits (for 34 percent and 38 percent of children respectively).




  179
      The case files do not contain information on all of the income sources of each household member, just pieces of
  information like "the grandmother's pension" or "makes a living from a 500 lei wage." So the available data do not make
  it possible to analyze income earners or make a comparison between the earnings of workers from source communities
  and the national average of income earned by workers with the same occupation or in the same sector of activity.
  180
     With respect to income sources, the share of missing data varies between 35 percent of the case files regarding
  wages, about 40 percent related to casual work, pensions or social benefits, and a high 61 percent about the remittances
  received from household members who left to work abroad (see Annex 6 Table 25).

                                                                                                                                                 139
Wages and pensions were rare in the households where children lived before entering public care,
with only about one in every 9 to 10 children’s case files indicating that their households received
these two income sources (see Annex 6 Table 25). Only 12 percent of children in public care lived in
households that received incomes from wages versus a national average of 51 percent (see Table
27).181 Households where children were living with their relatives and/or other people had higher rates
of access to income from wages, but even then this access was very limited (31 percent of children in
urban households versus the urban national average of 64 percent and 17 percent of children in rural
households versus the rural national average of 30 percent).

Notes: See the note of Figure 35. Casual work also includes income from informal self-employment.

Unlike wages in the formal sector of the economy, income from casual work (including self-
employment) in the informal sector is three times more prevalent in the case files, especially for
households in rural areas (Table 27). Income from casual work was more often reported for
households with stable dwellings. Given the low level of education and skills in these households, it is
likely this income from casual work is not sufficient to make a decent living. Compared to wages paid
to those on formal work contracts, income from work in the informal sector tends to be irregular and
very insecure, making it impossible to properly plan a family budget. This leads families to live from
one day to another, focused on the immediate present, concerned with getting through the day:
“what am I going to put on the dining table today is what matters, tomorrow is far away.”
Out of all households of children in public care, only those of relatives and those with stable dwellings
had more than one income source (1.4 sources on average), while the others had either only one cash
income source or none at all as in the case of teenage mothers who relinquished their children in
maternity wards, mothers in institutions, homeless single-mothers, and street children. The families
with more than one income source also tended to have more chances to earn additional in-kind
incomes from their gardens or agricultural land and/or other properties, both in urban and rural areas
(see Annex 6 Table 26).
The inequalities between poor and non-poor households are highly visible in the studied population.
Figure 36 shows plainly that, irrespective of how the child entered the system, extremely poor
households had access to fewer income sources, especially wages and pensions. They did casual work
to the same or greater extent as the less poor and non-poor households, but had practically no
chance to escape poverty. Annex 6 Table 28 shows that they also had fewer chances to obtain
additional in-kind incomes, mainly because they owned fewer goods and less property.



181
   A similar situation exists regarding social insurance pensions. Only 24 percent of children in public care came from
families that received social insurance pensions (see Annex 6 Table 25), with no significant differences between rural and
urban areas.

Incomes from social assistance benefits deserve a special discussion, particularly bearing in mind that
the majority of the interviewed child protection specialists (either from the DGASPC or from the local
SPAS) mentioned the welfare dependency of the families of children in public care as the root of all
evil. The specialists believed that many families exploit their children in order to access various
benefits, which eventually leads to the child being separated from the family (see section 3.2.2.3).
However, as already shown in Table 17, before they entered the system, over 60 percent of all children
in public care182 were living in households that were not receiving any social benefits (other than the
universal child benefit allowance). The benefits that were most frequently being received by the
families of children in care were the Guaranteed Minimum Income and the Family Allowance, both of
which are targeted to poor families. However, before they entered the system, more than 20 percent
of the children in public care lived in households that received no social benefit.
Given the poverty and few benefits received by these families, child protection professionals are
alarmed about the recent regulations183 that increased the value of the benefit for family placement
and of the allowance granted upon exiting the system, because they regard these as a threat to the
proper family reintegration goal rather than as a preventive measure. Considering the assumed
tendency of some parents to use their own children as a source of income, professionals are
concerned that some parents will take their children home only to bring them back after a while or will
leave their children with their relatives just in order to collect the generous placement benefit or exit
allowance. This would increase the harm done to the children, exposing them to even more risks. It
would also put even more preassure on the public care system, already overloaded, which will have to
deal with new entries and temporary false exits.
             “- So, then, the parent leaves the child in the care of one of the grandparents and he finds a job
             either in the country or abroad. And the child is in the care of his grandparents who come to the
             Directorate (DGASPC) and request a family placement, given that the placement benefit has

      Not including children relinquished in maternity wards.
183
   Starting December 2014, allowances paid for children in placement or for those under guardianship were increased
from 97 lei to 600 lei. For children with disabilities, the monthly allowance was increased from 145.5 lei to 900 lei. At the
same time, it was agreed to pay a one-off cash allowance equal to the minimum gross salary (900 lei) when a child exits
public care (due to adoption or to family reintegration) (Government Emergency Ordinance 65/2014).

                                                                                                                                                          141
        increased starting December 1st... and this is a very well-founded concern for us, at present, as we
        are confronted with an avalanche of such requests.
        So, do the new regulations aid the prevention process or not?

        - I would not call this a prevention process; this does not look like prevention to me. I mean,
        since it stimulates the demand for a protection measure and it does not support nor stimulate
        keeping the child in the family, what else is there to say. It’s not about preventing, it’s about
        stimulating...” (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)

        “This money would be good [the reintegration allowance], but many parents use the money
        when their children are discharged and now want to put the children back into the system ... and
        at this very moment I have one such case. Here, X, wants to come again. He left from us, from the
        center, the parents took the money, they used the money given to them when the child was
        discharged and now they want to bring him back in. So you know what the situation is now, from
        my point of view, parents are spending the financial support given for the child, and when this
        financial support is finished, they put the child back into the system.” (Interview with a
        professional, Arad)


FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The data from the source communities in rural areas do not support the perceptions of DGASPC
specialists with regard to the effects of the new regulations as of December 2014 (Government
Emergency Ordinance 65/2014). In 57 percent of the 60 communes that contain source communities,
there was no registered increase in the number of requests for family placements for children during
January-February 2015. In the other communes, the number of requests for placements has risen, but
in 20 percent of these communes, the increase was similar to the winter period from previous years
and only 26 percent reported a higher increase than in the same period in previous years. In other
words, only in approximately one of four analyzed communes did the number of placement requests
for children in care increase by almost double (from an average of 2.1 to 3.8 requests per commune)
in the period right after the new regulations came into effect.
However, these results must be interpreted with caution given the relatively low number of communes
that were included in the sample and the short period of time that had passed since the new
regulations came into effect, which has probably limited the extent to which the eligible population
has learned about them. As the news spreads, it is likely that the number of placement requests will
grow.

Child protection professionals tend to believe that the whole system of social assistance benefits
distorts the value of work and does not encourage people to search for a job on the formal labor
market. While current social benefits may not be well-designed to encourage work, the prevailing

142
types of families of the children in public care are vulnerable single-mothers (see Infograph Chart 1) of
whom three-quarters have completed gymnasium at most and about a quarter of whom are illiterate
(see section 3.1.2.1). Many of these single-mothers have themselves a life history of poverty, lack of
education, and abuse, and therefore have a difficult time balancing working in insecure and hard
conditions in the informal sector and caring for their children. For most of them, the chances of
completing their education (for example, through the Second Chance national program) are very low
and, consequently, they have restricted access to various other programs such as active labor market
measures, social housing (in many localities), or even prevention programs developed by NGOs.
            “The people we work with are usually illiterate. When you take them to the Labor Directorate [the
            County Agency for Employment], they say nothing. They don’t even talk to the civil servants. They
            don’t know how to read or write; there is no point to it because they don’t register you. At some
            point, an NGO started teaching 40-year-old Roma mothers, poor mothers, with five kids at home,
            but clearly these mothers couldn’t attend those classes. They tried to educate them. You know,
            some people were willing to do that.

            There is some sort of a system in place, there is ‘A Second Chance’ [program] … Yes, but it is
            unrealistic for parents. Those parents can’t go to school and sit there like children … because they
            have things to do at home. They have children. That’s why it is very hard to motivate and support
            them to go to classes.

            In those families with twelve children, what does the woman do? Does she work anywhere? She
            doesn’t. You have no access to social housing unless you work. You definitely don’t get any help
            from HHC [NGO] if you don’t have a job.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

It is clear that under such conditions of extreme poverty, many parents try to access any income
opportunity available, whether it is legal or illegal or whether it is a social benefit or not.184
            “The child was removed from her at the age of 12, after we strongly intervened. For 2 to 3 years
            we went and did counseling work with her and the child. She was very lenient, had no rules...we’d
            say we do things like this, then we left and by the next visit she had already forgotten about the
            rules we introduced, so the child ended up in child care. [...]
            And now [after Government Ordinance no 65/2014 was issued] she filed a request, an impeccable
            file, everything, all the paperwork was there, and she tells us that the children are her
            grandchildren, brought from another county, and she wants to take them in placement. And she
            said I brought three [children] - I’ll take two and I’ll give my neighbor one, so she has an income
            too. So this is exactly why she brought the kids from a different county - for the money. She took
            them from their mother’s and brought them here. Now, since we filed for an emergency regime
            for them, we have to send them home...but for money? She clearly stated this is the reason. [...]
            When I asked her in and told her that we won’t be able to...she started to get angry, to swear, she
            threatened that she’d go to the media and to the mayor. I told her go ahead, it’s your right to
            contact whomever you want. But in any case, the protection measure should be established at
            the child’s registered home, this is what the law says, that means in the county from where you
            took the kids; moreover, you already had that child and we don’t think... And the woman is
            already 65 years old...” (Interview with a professional, Arad)

As shown in the previous chapters, it is also clear that the money is not always spent to the benefit of
the child as some parents may be drug or alcohol addicts or may smoke or spend money in
inappropriate ways while at the same time neglecting their child's needs. Nevertheless, the available
data indicate that the main problem is their lack of access to proper support and not their behavior
(see Figure 36 and Annex 6 Table 27).
As already mentioned, at the time when the children entered the system, the households from which
they came had very little access to social benefits, with fewer than 40 percent of children coming from
households that received a social benefit (other than the universal child allowance). Families with
unstable accommodation or who were homeless had even less access, given that a stable address is a
compulsory prerequisite to receive such benefits. Precisely because of the lack of a stable address,
only 28 percent of these families were receiving a social benefit. Mothers with unstable

accommodation live wherever they find a place to stay, moving around together with their children,
often from one locality to another, so even if they have identity papers, their residential address is only
temporary so they cannot apply for social benefits according to the law, even if they are eligible in
terms of low income. As child protection professionals point out, besides lack of a stable home, other
circumstances such as separation/divorce can also prevent families from accessing social benefits.
        “Mayoralties grant the family allowances but, unfortunately, practice has shown that this kind of
        financial aid goes, once again, to better-off families. The families we are talking about have
        difficult access [to social benefits] because, let’s say the couple is only separated, you need a
        divorce decree and a child support settlement. Or think about these families with problems, they
        can’t go through all these steps. Another example, if child support has been settled, even if the
        mother doesn’t get the money in effect, that income is taken into account when deciding
        whether she is entitled to that right, which is once again absurd. Therefore, the legislation has
        some gaps.” (Focus group with professionals, Braşov)



FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The data from the rural source communities survey allowed us to analyze the structural pattern of
access to social benefits for families with children in public care to a limited yet useful extent. The
analysis has the following limitations: (i) the data in this chapter concern the entire population of
children in public care from both urban and rural areas and from both source or other communities,
while the comparator refers strictly to the families of children from the rural source communities; (ii)
the data in this chapter concern the families’ income situation at the time when the children entered
the system, which could be any time between 1989 and 2014, while the data from the source
communities refer only to 2014; and (iii) the data in this chapter are taken from the children’s case files
and social inquiries, which provide only partial and unsystematic information about the income of
children’s families while the data from source communities were systematically collected directly from
the social workers of the local SPAS. Despite all of these limitations, the comparison is surprisingly
consistent, indicating a stable pattern of low access to benefits. Any differences are due either to the
food aid provided by the European Union, a benefit available only after 2007, or to the heating
subsidy, a seasonal benefit which can vary slightly unless recorded yearly. Because of these differences,
the share of families from rural source communities receiving at least one social benefit was 58
percent versus 38 percent of the entire population of children in public care. Despite these differences,
the conclusion is the same, namely that the families of children in public care have a stable pattern of
low access to social benefits.
For more information, see section 3.4.3.3 on family reintegration in the source communities.
Source: Survey of Households with Children in Public Care from Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015).
Data are not weighted (N=953 households that are still present in the commune and in which children have not
yet been reintegrated).

Among the other types of households, the proportion of beneficiaries of social benefits decreases
incrementally from 69 percent of the extremely poor to 39 percent of the non-poor. Annex 6 Table 27
shows that, while the non-poor households have benefited mainly from the placement allowance and
the allowance for people with disabilities, poor households mainly received the Guaranteed Minimum
Income (GMI) and/or the family allowance, programs which are targeted to the poorest.
However, it is useful to analyze the data in another way, from the rights perspective. From a legal
point of view, all families in extreme poverty with a per capita monthly income of less than 140 lei are
entitled and eligible to the GMI, as well as the family allowance, social canteen, food staples, and/or a
heating subsidy during cold seasons as well as other benefits (other than the universal children’s
allowance). Nonetheless, at the time when the children entered public care, only 37 percent of all
families in extreme poverty received the GMI, only 22 percent received the family allowance, and only
2 percent were beneficiaries of the social canteen, heating subsidy, and/or food staples. As a
consequence, these families were living in chronic and extremely deep poverty in the absence of
adequate support before their children entered the system, as described by a child protection
professional:
144
            “Could you tell me what poverty means for these families?

            - To support a certain number of people only on the basis of the child allowance. That is 42 lei
            per month, which is not enough to take care of a child even for a week. And they have many kids,
            not just one, but many... This would be it.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)

Thus, the poverty that was faced by children and their familires before the children entered public care
was (and is) caused by the ineffectiveness of the current policies for children and families, in addition
to the limited access that their parents had to the labor market because of their low education, lack of
skills, and, in some cases, insufficient personal efforts.

            Box 5: Ineffectiveness of Minimum Income Schemes in Many European Countries

 A very recent study of the European Commission shows compelling evidence of the fact that minimum income
 schemes in many countries have been ineffective in alleviating poverty and social exclusion in recent years. The
 common weaknesses include: (i) inadequate levels of benefit; (ii) failure to cover all of those in need; (iii) low
 levels of take-up; and (iv) a limited impact in reducing poverty. The main problem has been that these
 schemes have put insufficient emphasis on developing an integrated and tailored approach to support the
 beneficiaries and help them to integrate into society and, as far as possible, into the labor market.

As expected, households with more children are the most exposed to extreme poverty. Figure 37
shows that the proportion of children from very poor households increases from 57 percent of
households with one child (the one now in public care) to 88 percent of those with 5 to 14 children.
Correspondingly, the proportion of children with siblings at home before entering the system is 55
percent among extremely poor households, 45 percent of poor households, and 28 to 31 percent of
households in the other socioeconomic categories.185 Children with siblings in the system currently
represent 60 percent of very poor and poor children, decreasing to 19 percent of non-poor
children.186 This indicates that more than one child is usually taken into the system from extremely
poor and poor households.

Children in public care who came from extremely poor or poor households are more likely to have
developmental delays (22 percent versus the average of 17 percent) but not disabilities, special
educational needs, or behavioral problems. Also, they are unlikely to have been relinquished in a
maternity ward or another health unit (Table 28). Instead, they were highly exposed to the risk of
neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation before entering the system. They were also more likely than other
children to have faced a series of unfortunate events in their families of origin such as the death of the
mother or the imprisonment of the father, or to have experienced risky parental behavior such as
parental mental health problems and/or disability, parental alcohol and/or drug abuse, and
promiscuous and/or criminal behavior of an adult member other than the parents.

The sparse data on income indicate that 73 percent of children in public care came from extremely
poor or poor households, not taking into account those from households with unstable
accommodation or those who were homeless. If this is the case, then specifying ”poverty” as the main
cause of separation may be accurate for a large proportion of the children in public care. Nonetheless,
the case files specify “poverty” as the cause of separation for only about one-third (32 percent) of all
children.

       Box 6: More than Poverty as Justification for Removing Children from Parental Care

 “Ensure that poverty is never the only justification for removing a child from parental care; aim at enabling
 children to remain in or return to the care of their parents by, for example, tackling the family’s material
 deprivation.”
 Source: EC Recommendation “Investing in Children: Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage” (2013:item 2.2).



How did the DGASPC professionals decide on the 32 percent of children out of the 73 percent of
extremely poor or poor children for whom they indicated “poverty” as the cause of their separation
from their families, particularly considering that “poverty” should never be the only justification for
removing a child from parental care (Box 6)?
 Firstly, there is a certain inconsistency between the facts documented in the case files and the
  justification for the separation. For all children for whom “poverty” was given as the main cause, 80
  percent of case files contain no data on income. In addition, children removed from parental care
  due to “poverty” represent 33 percent of children from extremely poor households but also 7
  percent of children from non-poor households.
 Secondly, and more importantly, “poverty” is usually given as justification for the separation along
  with neglect, abuse, and exploitation or, less frequently, along with “other causes.” Nevertheless,
  for 12 percent of children in public care, “poverty” represents the sole justification. About half of
  those are children who were relinquished in maternity wards. As for the other 6 percent of children,
  the available data in case files do not contain any evidence of unfortunate events, experiences of
  child abuse or neglect, parental risk factors, or the existence of child special needs. Hence, around
  7 percent of children in public care in Romania have been removed from parental care solely on
  poverty grounds.

 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

 Most children in public care lived with families affected by extreme poverty or poverty before entering the
 system. This poverty has been (and still is) caused by the ineffectiveness of the current policies for children and
 families, in addition to the parents’ limited access to the labor market. While the children were still with their
 families, they did not receive proper access to social benefits, let alone support services. It may be that their
 parents had not applied for these benefits because some of them were illiterate, others could not afford the
 associated administrative costs, or owed fines or dues to the state. Even so, the support received by the
 families at the local level aimed at helping the family to keep their child at home was definitely insufficient,
 irrelevant, and not related to the needs of the family and the child. This has often been the untold part of the
 separation story.
 Due to the absence of appropriate support to family and children, the child protection system either has to
 contend with the issue of separations by relinquishment or to fill in the gaps left by national policies and
 community-based services (including the SPAS) by providing protection services for children who have no
 food or clothes at home or cannot afford heating during winter. Hence, families are separated in order for
 children to receive “regular meals, accommodation, and shoes to go to school.”187 A ssimilar situation often
 exists in hospitals when children are temporarily taken in to “treat” poverty rather than a health condition.
 For these reasons, there is an urgent need to revise the national policies for combatting poverty as well as the
 social assistance benefits system to better reach very poor children and their families and to effectively address
 the challenges that they face. At the same time, public social assistance services at the community level need
 to be improved and developed so that they can identify these cases and provide effective support to children
 and families at risk of separation. Only by taking this approach will Romania be able to translate the UN
 recommendations into practice: “Financial and material poverty, or conditions directly and uniquely imputable
 to such poverty, should never be the only justification for the removal of a child from parental care, for
 receiving a child into alternative care, or for preventing his/her reintegration, but should be seen as a signal for
 the need to provide appropriate support to the family.”188

 What is also needed is an assessment of the impact of the recent law (Government Emergency Ordinance
 65/2014) that increased the placement and exit allowances both on the children whom it has affected and on
 the system as a whole.
 Furthermore, other types of integrated and holistic measures and intervention packages for the family are
 necessary to increase parents’ capacity and to strengthen the family (and community) with the purpose of
 actually reducing their welfare dependency.




 3.2.5.2              Unstable Family Accommodation, Evictions and
                      Homelessness
Reliable data on the children’s housing conditions before they entered the system were available for
65 percent of children, who represent those who arrived from families with a stable dwelling, or from
relatives or other people. The other children (35 percent) were relinquished in maternity wards or
hospitals or came from families with unstable accommodation, or those who were homeless, evicted,
or institutionalized. Among the latter, data about their last dwelling were available only for 9 percent,
while data were missing for the other 26 percent.
Table 29 shows that most children in public care came from households living in overcrowded houses
with one or two rooms in conditions associated with medium to major health-related risks. Children
who arrived in care after living with relatives or other people had been in better living conditions,
while children coming from families with unstable accommodation or who had been evicted or
homeless were in the worst situation.

In comparison, the living conditions in many social protection facilities may seem truly luxurious. The
serious discrepancy between the conditions at home and conditions in public care could represent a
risk that should be addressed in the individualized protection plan (PIP). The issue of “good living
conditions” and its different meanings for children, families, and professionals was often raised in the
qualitative study.
        ”I had this case that I always use as an example. I had a mom that I took to a shelter for mothers,
        with her four kids. Meanwhile, the husband was to refurbish the house. And he did. He painted
        the outside, fixed the windows (that is, added two more boards so the cold wouldn’t get in). And
        the door...he fixed it as well as he could, he even painted the inside and I said: ok but this is an
        earthen floor. Yes, lady, but I need cement. With the municipality, we managed to give them
        cement, he poured it and despite this, we were still unsatisfied. And she said...the lady got really
        angry, used swear words and said: “What else am I supposed to do to this house?” Put carpets on
        the walls? Because she felt she had done everything possible; that it’s impossible to do more. So
        this is how things are. So for her it was absolutely great, and that’s when we thought that maybe
        we are the ones with a problem. She had beds, a table, now she had cement floors, it looked nice,
        she had a stove, pots, plates, her husband had a job, so they could afford food, so for her it was
        extraordinary. And yet, we were still not happy.

        Do you refer to some standards?
        - Yes. And that’s when I told my colleagues to pay attention to how they understand conditions.
        Because maybe the family think it’s extraordinary and they give the children everything they need,
        because she had other kids and they were in school. So she didn’t remove them from school
        claiming she couldn’t afford to keep them there. But still we wanted more, so she got angry. So,
        we have to think of conditions.” (Interview with a professional, Arad)

        ”Go back to the family? Well, before going back to my family I’d like to know that they have the
        conditions to keep me, to allow me to go to school, to have a bathroom inside, not in the
        backyard.” (Focus group with children, Craiova)

As with poverty, housing conditions should never be the only justification for removing a child from
parental care. Nonetheless, many interviewed parents mentioned “a lack of stable accommodation,” “a
lack of space,” and “improper living conditions” as one of the reasons or the main reason why they
agreed to their child being taken into public care. In the family's needs assessments included in case
files, SPAS social workers specified as main need: “poor/improper housing conditions” (24 percent of
children in public care), “lack of stable accommodation” (7 percent), “lack of heating” (1 percent), and
“lack of electricity” (1 percent). In the case files, the DGASPC specialists rarely mentioned “improper
and/or unhygienic space” (1 percent) or “evictions” (2 percent), usually next to the justification of
“poverty.”
The problem of adequate and affordable housing for vulnerable groups, especially single-mothers, is
one of the key elements for preventing child-family separation.
        ”Lack of housing is another problem. There are mothers who raise two or three children...and
        they are kicked out of their partners’ house, and this is a problem. They can’t pay rent. No
        relationship with the grandmother, or other family members. So we are their last resort.” (Focus
        group with professionals, Timișoara)

At least 4 percent of all children in public care came from families with unstable accommodation or
who were homeless or evicted. For these children, the social protection system fills in the gaps of the
national housing policies and programs. Many of these children come from dysfunctional families,
with a single-mother who is often the victim of domestic violence and who lacks the resources to
ensure stable accommodation for her children. These families with unstable accommodation or who
were homeless or evicted represent most of the cases in which housing conditions were stated as the
cause of separation by the DGASPC professionals (solely or together with poverty).
        “So you asked for the child placement?

        - Yes, I filed a request and got out of the system [from a shelter for abused mothers]; I couldn’t
        stay there anymore. They [DGASPC] were trying to reintegrate me into the family, but I couldn’t
        live with that man anymore. He would beat me every day. But I didn’t have where to go with


                                                                                                               149
         three kids, so I left them... I only took the youngest one. Because I thought that, since he was
         younger, he needed my care and protection more than the others. They all needed me, but since
         I couldn’t take them all, I thought of taking the youngest one... to start with.” (Interview with a
         parent with institutionalized children, Craiova)


         Box 7: Example of Good Practice - the Commune of Concești in Botoșani County

 The Local Council in the commune of Conceşti in Botoşani County bought and fixed up deserted or unfinished
 houses in the commune to offer them as social dwellings to needy families with children. First, the Local
 Council allocated 250,000 lei for the purchase of houses.
          “We can offer the families that will come to our commune a house with very good living conditions,
          with running water and a bathroom. We also intend to build a bathroom in those houses that
          currently don’t have one to make sure that these social dwellings are in good condition. We have
          made this decision because the population in our commune has dropped significantly. Each year,
          [only] five to ten children are born here and this has led to multi-age classrooms in school. We’ll start
          with five houses. We’ve talked with the owners and they want to sell them. The houses are in
          excellent shape and if, by any chance, more families came, we could offer up to 10 to 12 houses. [...]
          The people who will come to our commune will most definitely find a job here. We have jobs. We
          have also made arrangements at a farm. We have about 50 jobs at the greenhouses and men can
          work in forestry.” (Costel Nazare, Mayor of Conceşti Commune)
 The local initiative was an instant hit. In a matter of days, three families consisting of five adults and 20
 children moved there. One family consisted of a single-mother of six - a 19 year old, and five underage
 children who had never had a home of their own but had lived with relatives or as tenants. Another of the
 families consisted of a single-mother of seven from another county (Hunedoara) who could not put up with
 her husband’s abuse any more and took her children, the eldest aged 17 and the youngest aged only 2. She
 said: “We decided [together with the children] to go into the wide, wide world”. So far, the mayoralty of
 Concești has received about 35 applications for social housing.

In addition, 8 percent of the children in public care lived in improvised shelters and in living conditions
which put their health and development at risk before they entered the system (Table 29). As regards
improvised shelters in particular but also social housing or state-rented units, overcrowding has been
identified as a major problem because: “there are families with three to four children – two boys and
two girls – and they all share a room, they sleep in the same bed, or all the family members live in a
single room.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)


      Box 8: Preventing Family Separations by Providing Social and Affordable Housing in an
                     Integrated Package of Services for Children and Families

 An European Parliament resolution of June 11, 2013 on social housing in the European Union
 (2012/2293(INI)) ”reminds the Commission, the Member States, and local and regional authorities that
 spending on social and affordable housing is in keeping with fundamental rights, enables urgent social needs
 to be met, and, as strategic social investment, helps in a sustainable way to provide local jobs that cannot be
 off-shored, stabilize the economy by reducing the risk of property bubbles and household over-indebtedness,
 promote labor mobility, counter climate change, combat energy poverty, and alleviate health problems
 stemming from overcrowding and poor living conditions; insists, therefore, that social housing should not be
 considered a cost to be cut but an investment that pays off in the long term through better health and social
 well-being, access to the labor market, and the empowerment of people, especially the aged, to live
 independent lives.”

Only 7 percent of children in public care lived in social housing or state rental housing (with
subsidized rent) before they entered the system. They are more in urban areas and only few in rural
areas. However, living conditions in social housing, in either houses or apartments in blocks of flats,
are as bad as in most other dwellings described in Table 29. Over 50 percent are one-room dwellings,
in which live, on average, five people of which three are children. Only about one-third have an inside
kitchen, about a quarter have an inside bath and/or restroom, and about a fifth are adequately heated.
The 2 percent of children who experienced eviction before entering the system were living in such
social housing or state-rented units.
            ”In Ploiești, I refer to the town, there are only a few social dwellings. And there are situations
            when they end up in the social dwellings... and take my word for it, because in the beginning of
            my career I was in charge of social housing, you should see them now... You should see how they
            look. Awful, you wouldn’t believe your eyes... and they even evict them if they don’t pay.” (Focus
            group with professionals, Ploiești)

            ”There are some specific cases: parents evicted, they are left without a place to live. They’d keep
            the children, but don’t have where. And I actually have such cases...” (Focus group with
            professionals, Ploiești)

All the above-mentioned issues point to the same general problems of the social housing and state-
owned dwellings sector that are highlighted and analyzed in the Background Study for the National
Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020. 189 The scarcity of available social
housing has been a constant problem since 1990.190 Local public authorities own and manage housing
stock to be rented to the poorest population, but this fund is often not recorded as “social housing” as
it does not comply with the legal requirements and standards. Most often this stock consists of
nationalized or low-quality houses or apartments with reduced useful floor area, that have been
neglected in the past few years and are located in unattractive, difficult to access, and poorly endowed
urban areas with a low market price. Nevertheless, the supply of social housing is much lower than the
demand.191
The eligibility criteria for social housing are rather lax and applied differently from one locality to
another. However, one criterion is the existence of a stable residence within the administrative-
territorial unit, which often excludes precisely the families that are most in need because of being in
unstable accommodation or homeless. Actually, research has shown that many local authorities grant
priority access to social housing to families with fewer children and with sufficient income to pay the
utilities. The result is that the poorest families and those with the largest numbers of children
(especially Roma) are often excluded from social housing. The overall result is that, out of all social
housing units in urban areas, only 57 percent are rented to low-income families while the others are
let to better-off people. Nonetheless, most urban municipalities have state-owned dwellings of very
poor quality, which are not officially registered as social housing units, that are rented to low-income

The low quality of the social housing and state-owned dwellings stock is a general problem in Romania

The Situation of Social Housing survey confirmed that, in 2014, most social housing units consisted of apartments
of one or two rooms covering 10 to 37 square meters that were lived in by numerous families. Common spaces
tended to be obsolete, damaged, and/or dirty, and services such as electricity, sewerage, and water supply were
either non-existent or had been disconnected because of payment arrears. Massive overcrowding has put serious
pressure on the apartment blocks, which are not technically designed to support such a large number of users. As
most infrastructure is old and broken, the basements of these blocks are usually flooded with water and dirt. As a
result, the walls and roof are eroded and damp, which puts the residents' health at risk. Some of these areas of

   The number of applications received by urban mayoralties exceeds 67,000, while the local authorities estimate that
the need amounts to 55,000 to 60,000 units. Source: Situation of Social Housing (SSH) survey in all urban municipalities

social housing are at risk of becoming - or have already turned into - pockets of poverty (especially ghettos), with
inadequate housing conditions and general unemployment. Local authorities typically act as mere financial
managers of the buildings, and existing social housing programs are not designed to include any incentives to
encourage or require tenants to participate in the active labor market or in education or to access other social
services.

Overdue rent and/or utilities is another widespread problem

Social housing units in Romania often have high levels of accumulated arrears on rent and especially public utility
payments. This often results in whole buildings being disconnected when they do not have individual
consumption meters for each unit. The rent charged by the local authority cannot exceed 10 percent of the
income of the occupants, with the difference up to the nominal value of the rent being subsidized from the local
budget. Since the residents are typically poor, this level of rent may not even cover the maintenance costs, which
makes social housing a major drain on local finances. In the case of social housing, the local authority’s
accounting system attributes arrears in rent to the unit rather than to the renter, which means that any overdue
debt is passed to the next tenant. It is administratively difficult to cancel overdue debts that could not be
recuperated so many new social housing tenants are considered liable for the arrears associated with their new
home.

Source: Teșliuc, Grigoraș and Stănculescu (coord.) (2015:263-265).

Evicting tenants is the final step in the situation of unsettled arrears. According to the law, the term of
a rental is five years, with the possibility of extension. However, cases have been reported where local
authorities have decided to lease social housing units for much shorter terms (for as little as three
months) to make it easier for them to evict renters who do not pay their rent or utility bills. To prevent
renters from building up overdue debts for social housing costs, some municipalities evacuate people
to make them “responsible and accountable.” Thus, while the mayoralty housing department is just
applying the law in evicting people with arrears, the public social assistance service (SPAS) either is not
being informed or does not intervene. It is not clear where the evicted families end up, and these
vulnerable people, including their children, live through a traumatic life event with no protection at all.
In these cases, state institutions are definitely not respecting human and children's rights. Thus, as we
have seen above, some of these children end up in public care. In this sense, once again, the child
protection system must fill in the gaps in the national policies and programs on social housing, as well
as remedying the inaporopriate responses of the staff of SPAS and other community-based services.

         How would you focus on prevention?
         - Well, we have an awful relationship with the community; some mayoralties hang up on me...
         There were times, I couldn’t say exactly how often, but there were times when a modest-income
         family got evicted because of an unpaid electricity bill, and five or six children were placed in
         public care instead of having their bill paid. Community-based measures means it would have
         been cheaper and a lot better for the children to cover the bill, it was just one bill…” (Focus group

RECOMMENDATIONS
At the national level, there are no standards for the required housing conditions for families before their
children can be released from public care and reintegrated in the family. Nevertheless, as the qualitative study
has shown, in specific counties, such standards have been developed and used. A country-wide analysis of the
practices used by DGASPCs regarding these housing conditions as well as an evaluation of the impact of these
practices on the children and their families are also necessary. It is also important to ensure that common rules
are developed and applied in a uniform way by all case managers within the system.
The discrepancy between the child’s housing conditions at home and those in public care should be addressed
in his or her individualized protection plan to manage the child's expectations and to help him or her to
prepare for an independent life.

The public care system cannot and should not separate a child from parental care just on the basis of the
parents’ lack of access to affordable accommodation. The government should assess the need for social
housing for all vulnerable groups (including the homeless, post-institutionalized youth, ex-prisoners, victims of
domestic violence, people evicted from restituted houses, and people with drug dependencies). It should then
establish a clear national strategic framework for its housing policy involving inter-sectoral coordination and
cooperation between the central and local authorities. The range of social housing instruments should be
enhanced, and the government should consider awarding housing allowances to very poor people. To achieve
this aim, financing for social housing services should be increased.

There is a need for stable and sustained investments in increasing the number of social housing with clear
targets for young people leaving public care, families with numerous children, single-parent families, and other
categories for whom family separation is an outcome of the lack of housing.
Furthermore, it is necessary to define the way in which social houses are built, allocated, and placed in the
community. It is essential to avoid the formation of new “islands” of poverty by building agglomerations of
social housing (for example, in blocks of flats or neighborhoods), especially on the outskirts of localities.
Precisely for this reason, governments of other European countries encourage the dispersion of social housing
throughout each locality.

However, merely building social housing will not reduce extreme poverty and the number of homeless people.
The government should gradually shift the emphasis of its housing policy towards prevention, and to this
purpose, social housing services should be delivered within an integrated package of social services targeted
to families at risk of separation, youths leaving childcare institutions, people leaving prisons, asylums, and
hospitals, victims of domestic violence, and those dependent on alcohol and drugs.

A strategy for keeping track of and controlling illegal and improper settlements should be developed and
followed by special programs aimed at helping their beneficiaries to access social, health, and educational
services as well as available social benefits.
Illegal evictions and evictions in the absence of any alternative accommodation should no longer be carried
out, especially when they involve single-parent families with one child or more.

One of the assumptions that is often made when discussing the negative impact on children of being
separated from their parents is that preventing children from entering the system is more cost-
effective than treating the effects of the separation. No matter how appealing this principle is in
theory, the efficacy of measures for preventing children from entering public care depends on how the
children at risk of separation are geographically distributed. The resources that the child protection
system would have to mobilize and the actions that they would need to take would be completely
different if the families at risk were evenly spread throughout the country than if they were clustered
in compact communities. The wide range of possible situations across and within counties is one of
the key reasons why cost-benefit analyses of preventive measures are difficult to carry out and
extrapolate to other territorial contexts. Therefore, how families at risk of separation are either
concentrated or spread across and within localities is an essential element to bear in mind in the
design and ex-ante evaluations of preventive measures.
Two main questions arise in this context. First, are the children at risk of separation concentrated in
certain geographic areas or are they spread uniformly between urban and rural localities? Second, if
the children are clustered in particular areas, what characteristics of those areas could be used to
make it easier to identify and target interventions for families at risk? To answer these questions, we
used the CMTIS dataset, which contains records related to children in public care. Although the CMTIS
dataset is not ideal, mainly because the information has not been updated in some counties in recent
years, it still constitutes an extremely rich information source that has not yet been sufficiently
exploited.
To complement the information from the CMTIS, we also used census data, information from the
Atlases of Urban192 and of Rural193 Marginalized Areas in Romania, and data from the qualitative
research conducted for this report.
By definition, "source communities" (rural and urban) are sub-locality areas from where a
disproportionate number of children end up in public care. Sub-locality areas in urban settings may
refer to a neighborhood, as well as a street or a group of houses or blocks of flats, while in rural
settings they may refer to a whole village, a hamlet, or just a group of houses.
Map 1 shows the distribution of these urban and rural source communities across the country. The
next three sections address our analysis of urban areas, rural areas, and the children in public care who
come from source communities.

Source Communities in Urban Areas
The CMTIS data on the home addresses of the families with children in public care indicate that there
is a concentration of such families in a number of urban localities. Fourteen percent of mothers with
children in public care194 live in only 10 cities (see Annex 6 Table 29). When the focus is restricted just
to the urban areas, these 10 urban localities contain more than 30 percent of the mothers with
children in public care. The first 20 localities195 ranked by the number of mothers with children in
public care hold one-fifth of all such mothers nationwide; when the analysis is limited just to urban
areas, these 20 localities contain 45 percent of mothers of children in public care.
There is no strong correlation between the number of mothers in urban localities and extent of
development measured at the locality level. The question that arises is whether there are any factors
at the locality level that may predict the concentration of mothers in some localities. The data show no
significant correlation between the development level of the localities and the number of mothers in
the system when keeping constant the locality size. The apparent absence of a relationship between
poverty and the risk of the separation of the child from the family makes sense when we consider that
what may matter is not the overall level of poverty of a locality but the number and size of small areas
in extreme poverty in a town or city. The Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas in Romania196 shows that
such extremely poor areas exist in both developed (even in the most developed) and not-so-
developed urban communities.
Analyses and qualitative case studies from the Geographic Information System (GIS) suggest that
source communities do exist and that they are geographically delimited and contain a higher than
average number of families with children in public care. Moving one level below the locality level, with
the aim of targeting the preventive interventions as close as possible at those in need, we needed to
know whether the existence of source communities is confirmed for urban areas. To answer this
question, we carried out GIS analyses of the addresses of the mothers with children in the system in
five cities, while at the same time we undertook in-depth case studies in each of the areas that were
confirmed as source communities for these five localities.197
All five qualitative studies confirmed the existence of source communities in urban areas. Local
stakeholders further confirmed the existence of these source areas that had been objectively detected
through the aggregation of home addresses of mothers with children in public care. Moreover, the
researchers who visited these areas and their interviewees all described the areas as marginalized,
consisting of improvised houses or former dormitories, often not connected to utilities, and with roads
in extremely poor state (see Story Bags 5a to 5d).
For illustration, the next map (Map 2) shows how the mothers’ home addresses are distributed across
the city of Arad. The map indicates a few areas where the number of mothers is significantly higher:
there are 27 addresses concentrated in one of the areas and 24 and 21 mothers in two others, while
others show some degree of concentration as well (although with fewer mothers). Map 3, which
zooms in on one of the areas to depict whether or not the home addresses are tightly clustered,
indicates that the mothers are concentrated in well-defined areas.

   The analysis was conducted only on those counties that systematically entered data into the CMTIS and on the
mothers whose addresses were registered. The following counties were not included because the low number of cases
in their territories would have made the analysis unreliable: Bistrița-Năsăud, Botoșani, Harghita, Ialomița, Mureș, Olt,
Sălaj, Teleorman, Călărași, and Giurgiu.

case studies included maps and a total of 38 interviews with specialists and parents of children at risk of separation from
their families or of children in the child protection system. Data collection was carried out by the Metro Media

The qualitative research conducted in Arad confirms that the area that is visible on Map 3 is a source
community. This area (known as Checheci) comprises dilapidated houses situated in the center of Arad
where a number of buildings were abandoned by their owners a while ago and were then illegally
occupied by poor families. Although the community is situated in the middle of the city, most of the
houses are not connected to utilities.
Map 4 depicts a similar situation in Bacău. The GIS representation of home addresses indicates the
areas where mothers with children in public care are concentrated. These areas were confirmed and
profiled through qualitative research. The area with the largest number of mothers (27) was a cluster
of former dormitories for workers that had no baths or kitchens and many of which were disconnected
from water or electricity because of unpaid debts to utility companies. The second largest community
on the map was confirmed during fieldwork as Vântului community, populated mostly with (hetero-
identified) Roma where some of the houses were built from cardboard, plastic, and other inadequate
materials.
Arad and Bacău are large cities by Romanian standards. Nonetheless, some of the urban source
communities are situated in small cities such as Bârlad (with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants as of the
2011 census). Map 5 shows that the situation in Bârlad is similar to that of Arad and Bacău, in that the
home addresses of mothers with children in public care are concentrated in just a few areas with the
two largest containing over 30 mothers each. One of these two areas used to be a block of flats with
social dwellings called by the local people “The Ghetto”, which was abandoned due to extreme
degradation and the residents were relocated. The other area is a combination of houses occupied by
Roma families and another block of flats with social housing. The qualitative research in source
communities emphasized the high risk of social housing units becoming source communities for
children in public care, specifically because they contain many children with multiple vulnerabilities
who receive little help other than some low-level social benefits and accommodation in dreadful
housing conditions.

Source Communities in Rural Areas
In the previous section we reported that mothers with children in public care are concentrated in
particular urban areas, meaning that these are source communities for children in care. These areas
largely overlap with marginalized communities identified as “poverty pockets” on the basis of census
data, the occupants of which suffer from many disadvantages including precarious housing conditions
and a lack of human capital and formal employment. We now aim to understand whether a similar
pattern exists in the rural localities as well.
Our analysis of the data from the CMTIS indicated that mothers who have children in the child
protection system are concentrated in a number of rural localities. Table 30 below shows that, of the
2,111 communes included in the analysis, 59 each have 16 or more mothers with children in the
system, while there are 11 to 15 such mothers in each of another 103 localities. Although these 162
rural localities represent only 8 percent of the analyzed communes, they accounted for 28 percent of
the children in public care as of 2014. Thus, it is clear that source communities for children in the
protection system also exist in the rural environment. Furthermore, Table 30 shows that the reason
why these source localities sent so many of their children into care is not related to their size as only
13 percent of all rural children live in these localities.
While in urban localities the connection between the number of children going into public care and
development indicators at the locality level is not significant, the situation is different in rural areas.
Irrespective of the locality’s size, the source localities seem to have lower development indicators as
measured by the Local Human Development Index (LHDI 2011)198 as shown in Annex 6 Table 30.


198
   The LHDI measures the total capital of rural and urban administrative units in Romania on four dimensions: (i) human
capital; (ii) health capital; (iii) vital capital; and (iv) material capital. Human capital is measured by education stock at the
local level (for the population aged 10 years and over). Health capital is measured as life expectancy at birth at the local
level. Vital capital is measured by the mean age of the adult population (those aged 18 years and over). Finally, material
capital is assessed as a factor score of three specific indicators that focus on living standards: (i) the size of the dwelling

                                                                                                                            159
However, the gap in poverty rates between the source localities and other localities is not large, which
raises the hypothesis that other factors may be more important than the overall development of the
localities in explaining why so many children from these localities end up in the protection system.

to administrative-territorial units.

Data at the commune level show a strong connection between the existence of at least one
marginalized community within the locality and the number of mothers with children in public care.
According to Figure 38, while only 17 percent of localities with no mothers with children in public care
have at least one marginalized community, the probability that such a community exists is much
higher for the communes with 11 or more of these mothers (65 percent). The relationship is also
reinforced by the association between the percentage of people living in marginalized communities
aggregated at the commune level and the number of mothers from the CMTIS aggregated at the
same level (Annex 6 Table 31). For example, in rural localities with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and
more than 10 mothers with children in the system, an average of 27 percent of people live in
marginalized communities, while in the localities of similar size but with no children in the system, the
percentage of people who live in marginalized areas is, on average, only 2 percent.

The data indicate that the risk of children being separated from their families is concentrated at the
village level. Considering that each commune may consist of several villages, it would be relevant to
investigate the way in which the risk of separation is concentrated at village level. Sadly, the CMTIS
contain data on the names of the villages for only 18 percent of the mothers registered in the


space; (ii) the number of private cars for every 1,000 residents; and (iii) the distribution of the use of gas for household
consumption in the particular geographical unit. The four measures of the dimensions of community capital are
aggregated by calculating another factor score. The index is determined based mainly on data from the 2011 Census
(Ionescu-Heroiu et al., 2013).

the source communities at the village level, meaning that in reality villages with two or three mothers
whose addresses are in the CMTIS may well contain many more mothers whose children are in public
care. Figure 39 below clearly indicates that the higher the number of mothers with children in public
care in a village, the higher the probability of a marginalized community existing there as well.

A significant number of rural localities have no social work services (SPAS) aimed at preventing the
separation of children from their families. Unfortunately, there are no systematic and nationwide data
regarding social services at locality level, but the census of SPAS social workers carried out by the
World Bank in 2014 contains some information on the limited availability of services to people from
source communities. According to this census data, only 31 percent of the rural localities included in
the analysis have access to a professional social worker (Table 31). The percentage is slightly higher in
localities where the number of mothers with children in public care is lower, but this may be explained
by the fact that these localities are larger and that larger localities are more likely in general to have a
social worker within the SPAS.

Have you noticed one or several areas in the city from where a higher number of kids come
into public care? If yes, please describe the area and its specific features.


“- Yes, there is an area - in our day-to-day language we call it Checheci -
it’s an area mostly inhabited by Roma people [...] There are several
streets and on each of them, several dwellings with unregulated legal
                                                                                              5a
status. That is, these houses were abandoned at some point, then
illegally occupied by Roma families, and then abandoned again, and
others are coming, and so on and so forth and their situation is quite
serious, because there are no means to do something with that family and they don’t want
to leave the area. [...] We have many families from that area, and we had 50 families, with
between one and eight or nine kids. [...] It’s an area with many kids, Roma people, parents
without a job, most of them leave off social welfare that they receive from us [DGASPC]. It’s
an extremely poor area, with an elevated crime rate, child abuse, children with problematic
and eventually criminal behavior. These would be the main features.”

“- There are many areas like this [...] The next one is Victor Babeș
Street. It’s a block of flats comprised of one-room dwellings, that used
to be owned by a former enterprise. And there, again, we have

people... I mean, families living in a room. The kitchens and bathrooms
are on the hallway. And they are overcrowded, all together in a room.
The next example is the area of the bus station. The Bacău bus station
is on the outskirts of the city. Also former dorms for single individuals, I don’t know who
used to own them. Nicu Enea street, that’s it. These blocks of flats are organized similarly.
That is, the bathroom is on the hallway; everything is shared. People who rent, that is, big
families, most of them Roma, they rent and can’t pay the rent, so the kids are brought here.
[...] It’s an area where you have people who used to be in prison, with criminal records. Quite
often there are fights. So it’s quite risky to go in and expose yourself in such a place...
- There is another street close to Nicu Enea, it’s Vântului; and here you really have only Roma
people who don’t do anything, they don’t even send their kids to school. These are big
families, without jobs, they live from one day to the next, no stability, no future plans. That is,
they don’t have stability, don’t have resources, they depend on social welfare, support from
the municipality and this is what they expect in the future as well. These are the areas. They
are not people with a stable life.”

they choose to give them to the system...[...] Bad living conditions, no
job, no income.... No utilities, none whatsoever. Electricity - I don’t know how legal it is, but
they are directly connected to the poles. An uneducated population, with a low cultural level
- not necessary related to education, because they can go to school - but they have certain
ideas about life, hygiene, the moral norms and rules that should be obeyed. [...] Many are
working abroad and the kids are left with the grandparents, the uncles, so they are a little
out of [control]....for instance, most are criminals. This should also be mentioned. Many of the
children who commit criminal deeds, juvenile delinquency, come from that area. They can’t
be held criminally liable, because they aren’t old enough. Now, I don’t know if the parents
teach them this, or they just replicate their parents’ behavior, because their parents also
committed crimes and were convicted... These are the main features, in my opinion.”

earlier to get to work. I leave him with a neighbor, who helps him
cross the street. The same for the means of transportation - it is close.

back my two kids who are in child care. The financial status... I can’t afford to pay rent.”

Children in Public Care from Source Communities
Fourteen percent of children in public care (special protection) come from source communities. Based
on the CMTIS data, the majority of them are from rural areas (60 percent). They come from all counties
but are massively over-represented in Brașov, Constanța, Covasna, Sibiu, Vâlcea, and Vaslui (Annex 6
Table 32). Children from source communities are more likely to be boys than girls (54 percent) and are
from all ethnic groups though with an above average proportion of Roma children (15 percent versus
10 percent).

The descriptions of the source communities given by DGASPC and SPAS child protection professionals
are very much in line with the results of the existing research in Romania on “extreme poverty” and
“poor zones” or “marginalized areas” (see for example true stories 5a, 5b, and 5c from the previous
Story Bag). 199 Keeping this is mind, the case files of children from source communities yielded
surprising results. According to these data, children from source communities in both rural and urban
areas have a below average risk of having disabilities, special educational needs, developmental delays,
or behavioral problems.200 There is also less evidence of neglect, abuse, or exploitation in their case
files compared with those of children from other (non-source) communities. Child neglect was
reported for 34 percent of children from source communities, which is lower than average, while rates
of child abuse and child exploitation were at around the average. Overall, fewer children from source
communities than average were reported as having experienced maltreatment before entering the
system. Also, most individual-level risk factors201 were not particularly evident among the parents and
families of children from source communities.
Part of this is caused by the fact that many of these case files do not provide much information on the
situation of the children before they entered the system, and there is even less information available
for the children from the source communities. Another factor to be considered is the tendency of the
child protection system to respond selectively/unevenly, intervening or accepting parents’ requests for
child placement only when it comes to children who are less affected by the general context of the
ghetto, slum, or other type of marginalized area in which they live. For example, given the source
community characteristics presented in the previous sections, it would have been reasonable to expect
that the percentage of adolescents with conduct disorders from the source communities is higher
than the percentage of adolescents in public care who came from other communities. But, as

   The corresponding proportions of children with various special needs are 7, 4, 15, and 7 percent respectively versus
the average values of 11, 9, 17, and 10 percent.

   Including true orphans, dysfunctional families, parents abroad or institutionalized (in prison or in mental health
institutions), parental disabilities and/or mental health problems, and parental promiscuous and/or criminal behavior.

mentioned above, the data shows this was not the case. There are several possible reasons for this
unexpected finding. Children with behavioral problems from source communities may already be in
jail202 or they may have escaped the system or have simply not been targeted by specific interventions
so they may be living on their own in these areas as homeless people or fugitives. A similar situation
might exist with regard to child abuse. The fact that children from source communities do not have
higher than average rates of child abuse is likely to be an indication of the system’s lack of
intervention in these communities as both the existing research and the child protection specialists
have shown that abuse and violence (in all forms) is rife in these communities.
The following characteristics are typical of children from source communities who are in the child
special protection system:
(i) A predominance of children who are fatherless when they enter the system (51 percent);
(ii) A relatively high proportion of mothers who are teenagers when their child enters the system (over
6 percent);
(iii) A high rate of parents deprived of their parental rights when the child enters the protection system
(2.4 percent) versus the average of 1.4 percent for all children in public care;203
(iv) Parental alcohol abuse (primarily maternal and particularly in rural areas).
Children from source communities also have a relatively high risk of being relinquished straight after
birth in maternity wards as well as later in other health units. Their families of origin are most often
single-mother families living alone or together with relatives in a multigenerational household.
However, in contradiction with the main characteristics of the source communities, most children in
public care who come from these areas belong to families with one or two children and only 37
percent of them have siblings in the system (versus the average of 50 percent).

urban).
Note: The sum of bars per category is 115 percent and 110 percent respectively because some case files gave two
to four causes of separation.

Children from the source communities are no more exposed to poverty than all of the other children
in public care, which again is surprising. Eight percent of them had “poverty” recorded as sole cause of
separation in their case files.204

   According to ANP (2014), in the third quarter of 2013, 2,400 children had committed criminal activities but were not
imprisoned, and another 1,700 children in detention were counted in the statistics of the National Administration of
Penitentiaries. In Romania, there are four prisons for juveniles (Bacău, Craiova, Tichilești, and Târgu Mureș) and three
rehabilitation centers (Buziaș, Găiești, and Târgu Ocna).

Nor are children from the source communities exposed to worse housing conditions than all of the
other children in public care. Nonetheless, a significantly higher than average percentage of them had
either “housing problems” or “housing problems and poverty” recorded as sole cause of separation in
their case files.205
Accordingly, Figure 40 shows that the distribution of children from source communities by the causes
of separation specified by the DGASPC professionals is also average, with one exception - the over-
representation of “poverty” (sometimes sole cause, as shown previously).
In conclusion, children from source communities enter public care as a result of a rather
selective/uneven process. This fact reinforces our earlier conclusion that the profile and causes of
separation of children from the source communities do not accurately reflect their actual difficult and
distressing situations but instead reflect the lack of interventions in the source communities and in
marginalized areas in particular.
             “And do you intervene in those communities that place many children in public care?

             - Yes. Usually, we go to other places, as I’ve told you, where people are more open. In these areas
             [rural source communities], it’s not that we don’t work with the local authorities, but, given the
             economic development of these settlements, they can only do so much. And even if we
             intervened, the end result would only be taking the children into care.” (Interview with a
             professional, Bacău)
             “- In those areas [ghetto], the only criterion based on which you can make, let’s say, the decision
             about whether or not to take them is the emotional connection that the child has with the parent.
             Because they are all poor, all of them have nothing to eat, all of them are jobless and all of them
             lack electricity.” (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)


 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
 Five main conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the source communities.

 First, in both rural and urban areas, priority preventive measures can be targeted to communities with a higher
 risk of children being separated from their parents because such communities do exist and can be identified.
 There is a considerable need for such interventions in the source communities, which is known to the child
 protection workers. Nonetheless, this considerable need is somehow overlooked and is not acknowledged as a
 high priority. The response of the child protection system has been limited to cases of relinquishment in
 maternity wards or other health units, and there are no intensive interventions directly targeted to these areas.
 No work is done with parents or the community. Therefore, many children from source communities are not
 properly protected nor given support to help them break the intergenerational cycle transmitted from their
 parents. Children living in these source communities are in urgent need of intensive interventions.
 Second, the Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas206 is proving to be a useful instrument not only for identifying
 extreme poverty but for identifying source communities as well.
 Third, further research is needed to determine if the urban pockets of poverty and exclusion identified within
 census sectors in the Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas207 would be an effective targeting category for the
 urban source communities for the child protection system. To achieve this aim, data on the home addresses of
 the mothers or families of children in public care should be improved (updated, supplemented, extended) and
 should be linked to the census tools used in the 2011 census.

 Fourth, preventive measures and targeted interventions for both the rural and urban source communities need
 to be developed and implemented nationwide. In this respect, it may be feasible and useful to use innovative
 technology such as the prototype online software Aurora that has been developed by UNICEF for identifying
 and carrying out needs assessment for children at risk of separation.

   On average, 7 percent of children in public care have poverty as the sole justification for their separation from their
families.
205
      On average, 3 percent of children in public care have these sole justifications for their separation from their families.

 regard to the relatives of children in public care and their addresses will significantly improve the targeting of
 preventive interventions at the community level.




3.2.5.4              Lacking or Under-developed Prevention Services at the
                     Community Level
This section focuses on ”community-based services”, which, in line with the European Expert Group on
the Transition from Institutional to Community-based Care, this report defined as the spectrum of
services that enable children to grow up in a family environment as opposed to an institution. ”It
encompasses mainstream services, such as housing, healthcare, education, employment, culture, and
leisure, which should be accessible to everyone regardless of the nature of their impairment or the
required level of support. It also refers to specialized services, such as personal assistance for people
with disabilities, respite care, and others.”208 Social housing services have been discussed under a
previous section so the following sections focus on social assistance, healthcare, and education
services as well as on specialized services for vulnerable groups.

Community-based Social Assistance Services
A previous section has shown that the families of children in public care had little access to social
benefits before their children’s entry into the system. This section looks at their access to social
assistance within their communities by analyzing the social assessments that were performed before
their entry into the system in the communities from which they were actually taken. These
assessments are included in the children’s case files.
It is useful to recall that, among all the children in public care, 56 percent come from urban areas, 43
percent come from rural areas, and almost 1 percent come from other countries 209 or from
somewhere unspecified within Romania. The case files of most children in public care contain one or
two social assessments, but one in every ten children does not have such a social assessment.
Figure 41 shows that almost all children taken into care from rural areas have a social assessment (98
to 99 percent), generally performed by a SPAS representative. When the SPAS representative was just
an employee with social assistance duties (with no specialized training in the field), DGASPC
professionals tended to add their own social assessment more frequently than when the SPAS
representative was an actual social worker (24 percent versus 13 percent). As for the children taken
into care from urban areas (in the country or abroad), approximately 85 percent had a social
assessment, half of whom only had an assessment conducted by a SPAS representative while the
others also had assessments conducted by the DGASPC or accredited private organizations providing
child protection services (OPAs).
Social assessments carried out by DGASPC representatives (sometimes in addition to those conducted
by local SPAS) were more frequent for those children who came from the source communities (see
Annex 6 Figure 5). One possible explanation for this is the limited intervention of local SPAS in the
source communities, but mostly it is due to the over-representation of children who entered the
system after being relinquished in maternity wards or other health facilities among those from these
communities in both rural and urban areas. Annex 6 Figure 6 reveals that social assessments
conducted by the DGASPC were much more common for children in the case of these very routes and
especially street routes. For example, a quarter of the files of the street children who were taken into
care do not include a social assessment, a quarter contained a social assessment conducted by the

SPAS and the DGASPC, and 7 percent featured social assessments whose author is unknown. By
comparison, almost all the children (over 95 percent) who ended up in the system straight from their
families (with stable dwelling) or from their relatives had social assessments, of which about two-thirds
were conducted by the SPAS, 10 to 15 percent by the DGASPC, and the remaining 16 to 19 percent
were carried out by both the SPAS and the DGASPC.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=52,344).
Note: Children from rural areas with no SPAS-related details are mostly children taken into care from urban areas,
usually from health units or off the street.

Figure 42 (top chart) shows how the social assessments carried out for children in public care varied
considerably between counties. In Mehedinți county, the SPAS produced the social assessment for 83
percent of the cases while the DGASPC produced assessments for only 1 percent of all children, all of
which supplemented social assessments conducted by SPAS. However, the situation in the county of
Dolj is the opposite, with 16 percent of children having SPAS assessments and 70 percent of children
having DGASPC inquiries, half of which supplemented social assessments conducted by the SPAS. In
Suceava, Harghita, Vaslui, and Galați, the share of children with no social assessment is less than 5
percent, whereas in Dâmbovița and Caraș-Severin, the corresponding rate is almost five times higher
(23 to 27 percent).
Figure 42 (bottom chart) illustrates how the documentation of children’s circumstances prior to their
entry into public care has changed over time. The share of children with a social assessment
conducted by a SPAS (whether or not accompanied by a DGASPC assessment) increased210 while the
share of children with no social assessment in their case file decreased more than fourfold from 20
percent in 1995 to 1999 to 4-5 percent in 2011 to 2014.




210
   The share of children with a social inquiry conducted by SPAS rose from nearly 50 percent in the late 1990s to 65
percent in 2014, and the share of children with social assessments carried out by both SPAS and the DGASPC increased
from 10 percent to 16-19 percent over the period 2011 to 2014.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted; for the
top chart, only the 24 counties with solid data in the CMTIS are considered (N=45,737 children with social
assessment reports in their case files); for the bottom chart, N=47,134 children with social assessment reports in
their case files).

The social assessment report should contain data of good quality, meaning that it has to provide the
necessary information to give a clear picture of the children’s circumstances and those of their families
as required to develop an individualized protection plan (PIP) for the child. To this end, the assessment
should identify the child’s and family’s needs and the services that the community offered and the
services that it provided before the child was separated from the family and entered public care.
Without such information, the social assessment report provides only clues about the child and family,
which, as already seen in the previous chapters, are already poorly documented from many
perspectives (for example, the health of the children and their mothers and fathers and the family’s
income and housing) and does not enable the child protection professional to draw up an effective
protection plan for the child.
We evaluated the social assessments included in the case files of children in public care based on their
quality. In this evaluation, we defined a quality social assessment report as being one that
simultaneously covers, even partially, child’s and family’s needs and the services provided in the
community of origin.
We found that, out of all children in public care, 10 percent had no social assessment report and 90
percent had one or two such reports before entering the system. However, for 26 percent of them,
their social assessment report provided no key information (either about their needs or about the
services available in the community), 36 percent of the social assessments addressed only one
component (either needs or services), and only 28 percent of them offered a full picture (even if based
on partial information).
We further analyzed the quality of the social assessments and of the information that they provide.
Annex 6 Table 33 shows that the quality of these reports varies in several respects.
The share of quality social assessment reports is the highest (42 percent) in those cases where the
SPAS assessments are supplemented by DGASPC assessments. In the case of the children with two
social assessment reports, a relatively small share (18 percent) of inquiries offer no key information
(either about needs or about the response at the community level). With regard to private service
providers (NGOs and OPAs), the share of quality social assessments is low (only 13 percent) as they
tend to focus exclusively on the child’s and/or family’s needs (31 percent) or on providing less relevant
information (37 percent), though these account for less than 1 percent of all of the social assessment
reports from the case files of children in public care.
In terms of quality, there are no significant differences between the social assessment reports
conducted within SPAS by social workers and those carried out by the employees with social
assistance duties with no specialized training in the field. We believe this surprising finding reflects the
absence of a mandate requiring SPAS to conduct comprehensive inquiries into the child’s situation,
including any support that the child and/or family received within the community before the child was
separated from family and entered public care.
Also, there are no significant differences in terms of quality between the assessments carried out in
rural and urban areas, although the SPAS in urban areas are much better equipped with human and
financial resources and can provide a much wider range of responses than those in rural areas. The
rural assessments are more likely to highlight the offer of existing services and/or the services
provided at the community level to prevent children from being separated from their families.
Children from source communities are more likely to have quality social assessment reports (32
percent versus 21 percent of children from other communities) as they are more likely to have two
assessments, one conducted by the SPAS and another one carried out by DGASPC representatives. On
the other hand, the assessments for children from other communities are twice as likely to identify the
services provided to the children prior to their entry into public care (38 percent versus 20 percent of
children from source communities).
We found significant differences in the quality of social assessment reports according to the route by
which the child came into public care. The share of quality reports is above average for the children
whose mothers were institutionalized, those with mothers or families with unstable accommodation
(homeless, evicted, or living wherever they could), and those from families with a stable home. The

                                                                                                        171
share of poorly documented reports (those offering no information on either needs or services) was
above average (35 to 43 percent) for the children who were relinquished in maternity wards or other
health units, those who were in the care of people other than their family or relatives before entering
the system, and street children.
Figure 43 (top chart) provides additional information and highlights major discrepancies between
counties. It shows that the share of quality social assessment reports varies between 70 percent in
Dâmbovița and only 10 percent in Mehedinți. In other words, in Mehedinți, SPAS reports are prevalent
in the case files of children in public care (80 percent), but only one in ten of them mentions not only
the child’s and/or the family’s needs but also the services offered or provided to them at the
community level before the child entered the system. The vast majority (64 percent) give none of the
key information needed to develop effective intervention plans.
Nevertheless, the quality of social assessment reports greatly improved from 1989 to 2014. According
to Figure 43 (bottom chart), the number of quality assessments more than tripled after 2009 versus
the late 1990s. Over the same period, the share of social assessment reports that were missing key
information (on either needs or services) dropped by half.
We then moved on to analyze the available information in the social assessment reports. Social
assessments are available in the case files of 90 percent of children in public care, but only half of
them provide information about the child’s and/or family’s needs prior to the child’s entry into the
system, as shown in Annex 6 Table 34. Even where the assessments identified these needs, almost all
of them focused on the child and only about half of them also identified the family’s needs. This was
partly due to a lack of information about the family as often happens in the case of children
relinquished in health units or street children.
Others, however, reflect the tendency of many SPAS and DGASPC representatives to look at the child
separately from the family. Information about the family’s needs is available for only about a quarter
of the children taken into care straight from their family (with stable housing). For the children taken
into care from relatives, the rate drops to less than 20 percent. The only two situations where family
needs are identified in approximately half of the cases are those related to children with
institutionalized mothers and those with mothers/families with unstable housing (homeless, evicted,
or living wherever they can). Notably, during the qualitative research, some DGASPC professionals
drew attention to this tendency to focus on the child separately from the family, an approach which
conflicts with the main objective of preventing and addressing children’s separation from their family.
        “I just want to add something which I think is very important. Many times, we, all these child
        protection services, focus exclusively on the child. Very often, we offer services only to the child. I
        think that, many times, you have to work with the parents in order to get something for the child.
        As it has been pointed out here, parents are the ones who won’t or can’t, so it’s their failing that
        things are not going well for the child. Despite this, we don’t focus on and we don’t have enough
        services for parents and families like, for example, parenting classes or different forms of support.
        I mean, so many times we are all asked to be good parents, but no one prepares us for this role. I
        mean in general, but I’m basically thinking of problematic cases. I don’t necessarily think that all
        parents in Romania should be included in a parenting program; I am talking about at-risk
        situations or parents who are unable to…” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca).

The quality of the information in the social assessments on the needs of the children and/or their
families is poor because the specialists or social workers who conducted the assessments had widely
different definitions of these “needs.” Only about two-thirds of all answers mention needs. The
remaining one-third of the answers repeat the reason(s) for the child-family separation, mention a
protective measure or service, or give a generic response such as “the need for special protection” or
“upbringing, education, and development conditions.” The distribution of children with social
assessment reports available in their case files based on the identified needs is shown in Figure 44,
though the need for preventing the child-family separation was added by the research team as it was
very rarely specified in a clear manner by the specialists who conducted the social assessment reports.

                                                                                                               173
Fewer than one in five assessments indicated what services had been offered or were available in the
community that could meet the needs of the child and/or family (Annex 6 Table 34). Moreover, only
half of the assessments even referred to services, with the other half referring instead to the reasons
for separation, the child or family’s needs, or the different protective measures or services in which the
children were placed after they entered the system. These results clearly show that, before children are
separated from their families and enter public care, either very few services are available (mainly in
rural areas) or child protection professionals do not make enough of an effort to identify services in
the community that may provide an alternative to the separation (mostly in medium-sized and big
towns where various services are available).
About 40 percent of all social assessment reports were accompanied by a service plan (Annex 6 Table
34). According to Order 286/2006,211 a service plan should be drawn up by a prevention case officer
appointed by SPAS and, where applicable, the DGASPC to prevent the child’s separation from his or
her parents in the following circumstances: (i) for children at risk of being relinquished by their
parents; (ii) for children reintegrated into their families after the termination of the protective measure;
and (iii) in any situation requiring the delivery of benefits and/or services to ensure the fulfillment of
children’s rights. Under these circumstances, the fact that a preventive service plan was prepared for
only 40 percent of children before entering the system shows that the applicable regulations are not
being fully enforced.
Service plans were more common for rural children than for urban children (46 percent versus 35
percent, with an average of 40 percent) as well as being more common for children from source
communities than for those from other communities (49 percent versus 34 percent). Furthermore,
service plans were more likely to accompany the social assessments conducted by employees with
social assistance duties (within commune-level SPAS) than those carried out by social workers (46
percent versus 39 percent). Also, service plans existed for more than half of the children who had two
assessments, one carried out by SPAS and one by the DGASPC.
The greatest number of service plans existed for children taken into care straight from their families
(with stable housing) or from relatives, and the fewest were for children taken into care from other
caregivers and for street children.
As the service plan only became a requirement starting 2006, fewer than 20 percent of the children
who entered the system prior to that year had a service plan while the rate went up to 50-55 percent
after 2006. However, starting 2010, the share of children with a service plan dropped to 45-50 percent
(Annex 6 Figure 7). In general, the service plan regulation is selectively enforced at the county level,
with rates varying from around 20 percent of children in Arad, Dâmbovița, and Suceava to rates that
are more than three times higher in Harghita, Vaslui, and, especially, Neamț (Annex 6 Table 35). The
absence of a preventive service plan before the child’s entry into the system was also discussed by the
professionals who took part in the qualitative research.
        “- In urban areas, I think that the mayoralties..., as far as I could see from our collaboration with
        them, don’t comply with the law regarding the service plan.
        - They don’t have specialists.

        - They don’t abide by the law, so no... The service plan is a plan whereby I, as mayor, set... take
        some measures to prevent children’s institutionalization. Well, I don’t know if there are ten
        mayoralties across the county, well, except for Ploiești where things are as they should be,
        especially in urban areas they are not adequately trained and there is no...
        - They lack specialized staff.

        - And interest. Some cases have been known for years and are referred to us as emergencies. So,
        you can’t get your head around this, the mayor, the counselors and the secretary, everybody in
        the community... the schoolteacher, the priest, and everybody is aware of that family’s
        circumstances and they come to you, after ten years, and say: “Well, I can’t feed my child

          anymore”. And I think those parents are not informed about the available benefits or given any
          aid. I mean, they take no action, not even measures that require nothing from the mayoralty.
          - No. On the contrary, they send them straight to us. So, lately, we have been dealing with many
          cases like that where mayoralties refer all the social cases to the Directorate for Social Assistance
          and Child Protection. They know how to send that person to us. They don’t offer adequate
          information and instead they immediately give them our address for us to handle the case.
          - Well, they don’t offer information because they don’t know it, they really don’t know it. Some
          mayoralties called and asked us. This is a fortunate case because they called and asked, but most
          of the times they refer the cases to us even if they are not within our area of expertise. Even in
          the communities where the mayoralties have specialists, there are two to three specialists like
          trained social workers, but they don’t necessarily know what the’re supposed to be doing.” (Focus
          group with professionals, Ploieşti)

Let us now move from the service offer and the service plan to the services actually provided to
children in public care and to their families prior to the child’s separation from the family and entry
into care. Annex 6 Table 34 shows that only 33 percent of all children with social assessments received
any (one to five) preventive services, and most children received counseling and information or
collaborative support from different social stakeholders such as medical staff, teachers, the police, the
priest, and other representatives of the Community Consultative Structure. Therefore, only one in
three children and their families received any support from the services available in their communities
before ending up in public care. If we consider all children in public care, with or without a social
assessment in their case file, the share of children who received some kind of preventive service goes
down to 29 percent.212
First, we found a major gap between the child’s/family’s needs and the preventive services provided in
the community, even when we narrowed our focus down to the identified needs as shown in Figure 44.
Five percent of the children with social assessments in their case files were identified as having
nutritional needs, but only 0.5 percent of the children, that is just one-tenth of those in need, received
any food aid or free/cheap meals at a social canteen.213 Nearly 15 percent of children had housing
needs and only 0.7 percent received support, which is less than the 20th percentile. About 14 percent
were identified as being at risk of income poverty (because of being in a household in insecure
material circumstances and with insufficient income). Although most of these children were eligible for
social benefits, as discussed in a previous section, only very few of them were given any help to access
the benefits and/or get a job.
Second, we looked at the main characteristics of those children and families who benefited from
services provided within the community to prevent children’s separation from their families. According
to their social assessments, rural children received preventive services more frequently than those
living in urban areas (36 percent versus 30 percent). Other categories of children/families who were
commonly reported to have benefited from preventive services were:
     Children with institutionalized mothers, those with mothers/families with unstable housing
      (homeless, evicted, or living wherever they could), and those taken into care straight from their
      families (with stable dwelling);
     Children who were older than 10 years when they entered the system, and their families;
     Children and families of Romanian or Hungarian ethnicity and, to a lesser extent, those of Roma or
      undeclared ethnicity (over 35 percent versus about 27-30 percent);
     Families with both parents at home, who were older than 25 years of age when the child entered
      the system, and who had at least three children;



212
   These data match the findings of a study conducted by the Federation of Child Protection NGOs (FONPC) in 2012
according to which in 2010, of all children assisted by SPAS, only 24 percent received services, while the others received
only cash benefits, despite their being children at risk of separation from their family.
213
   The data on social benefits included in Figure 44 do not match the data on social benefits that emerged from the
income analysis (see Annex 6 Table 25).

                                                                                                                     175
      Mothers with average educational attainment (the share of children whose case files show that
       they received community-based preventive services goes up from 33 percent for those whose
       mothers completed primary education at most to 36 percent for those whose mothers have 5 to 8
       grades of schooling, and to about 40 percent for those whose mothers completed a
       vocational/apprentice school or 9 to 10 grades of schooling);
      Children with no disabilities or developmental delays;
      Children aged 6 to 17 years with special educational needs (SEN), as well as those with behavioral
       disorders (45 percent and 51 percent respectively, versus an average of 41 percent for all children
       aged 6-17);
      Children exposed to neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation;
      Dysfunctional families (as defined in Section 3.2.3.2) affected by the alcohol abuse of one or both
       parents;
      Families that include an adult member other than the parent who had troubles with the police
       and/or a criminal record;
      Families where both parents and/or an adult member other than the parent have disabilities, a
       chronic illness, and/or mental health problems.
Third, as Annex 6 Table 34 shows, we found that a quality social assessment report, especially if
accompanied by a service plan, increased the likelihood that the family and child had received help
and support within the community. This is because the process of conducting a social assessment for
a particular child makes local stakeholders more aware of the need to step in before referring the case
to the DGASPC.214 At present, not only is there little interest in conducting a quality social assessment
and designing a preventive service plan, but also “mayoralties and institutions play fast and loose”215
and ask the DGASPC for an emergency placement in order to renege, as much as possible, on their
own responsibility to intervene.
            “- But mayoralties and institutions play fast and loose; they come to us with the emergency. So, if
            we do the math and consider all things, in the past years I think that a share of… I don’t want to
            exaggerate because I don’t have any statistics, but I think that only ten percent of the cases get
            to us after an attempt to deliver some services to keep the child with the family. No, most of
            them get here as an emergency and we are caught off guard. Why? After you place your child in
            care you can no longer..., the family is no longer motivated unless they really couldn’t keep the
            child.

            But then efforts should be made to reintegrate the child immediately after his or her entry into
            public care, right?

            - Yes, but the damage has already been done, the child has been separated from the family. You
            see what happens, once the parents get rid of the child, some parents don’t want to give them
            up for adoption either, most cases are like that, you know, they don’t want to take them home
            and they let the state take care of them for as long as possible.” (Focus group with professionals,
            Cluj-Napoca)

More generally, the child protection specialists stated that, within the communities, social assistance is
too often strictly limited to the provision of financial benefits216 with no preventive or counseling
activities targeted to people or families with social vulnerabilities. In the opinion of many DGASPC
representatives, this is one of the structural causes of children’s separation from their families.



214
   For example, in the case of children with two social assessments (by the SPAS and the DGASPC), the likelihood of the
family/child having received community-based preventive services before the child entered the system goes up to 51
percent from an average of 33 percent. Also, in the case of children with service plans, the likelihood of the family/child
having received community-based preventive services before entering public care is 56 percent.
215
      Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca.
216
   This usually involves preparing the files, keeping track of monthly payments, and making house visits, generally in
order to cross-check the information in the case files.

176
            “And, again, I go back to what I initially said: specialized public services, other than filling in some
            papers related to benefits, don’t provide any kind of social assistance. This is our starting point.
            And, to a great extent, this is why county directorates, especially those from Bucharest districts,
            are working at full capacity or have exceeded their capacity by 50 percent.” (Focus group with
            professionals, Bucharest)

            “I believe a distinction should be made: social assistance comprises both benefits and social
            services. Unfortunately, I think that sometimes a lot of focus has been placed on benefits, which
            are useful up to a certain point, but then they [the beneficiaries] may become dependent on
            social support and many of them, just like Mrs. A was saying, without those services provided by
            the mayoralty which should somewhat motivate, counsel, and lift them out of that social
            incapacity, remain trapped in their deprivation and that’s how children end up in the system. The
            idea is to get them out of that situation because as years go by, if we look at the statistics we can
            see that, at the Caritas level and in the DGASPC law, the figures are consistent, nothing has
            changed.” (Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)



FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
SPAS representatives (whether professional social workers or not), at least those from the communes
with source communities, seemed to disagree with these opinions expressed by the DGASPC
representatives. They believed that their knowledge of the households with children in public care are
“good” or “very good.” On a scale of 1 to 10, 72 percent of the SPAS representatives rated their
knowledge of these households as between 8 and 10 (in other words “very good”). This percentage
varied from 89 percent for children from households where the mother or the main caregiver is still
present,217 87 percent for children from households still present in the community,218 53 percent for
children whose households of origin are still present but the mother is absent and only 39 percent for
the children whose family members have left the commune (data according to the Social assistance
data sheets from rural source communities, July-August 2015. Data are not weighted – N=85 SPAS
representatives from the 60 communes with source communities, regarding 1,263 children in public
care).

   The mother or the main caregiver of the child/children in public care was present in the household for 53 percent of
children and was absent or had left the household for the other 47 percent of children.

      The household of origin still existed in the commune for 72 percent of children in public care.

Also, on a scale of 1 to 10, the vast majority of SPAS representatives from all of the communes with
source communities rated the following items with an average score of 8.5 (“good”): (i) their
knowledge of the services and resources available in the commune and its immediate vicinity and (ii)
their skills in helping children and families from the commune to gain access to the services and
assistance they need. Moreover, they stated that they almost “always” (an average score of 8.7) felt
that they could effectively intervene to support the children and families from the commune. This
distribution by scores from 1 to 10 is shown in Figure 45.
Based on their experience, the SPAS representatives considered the Guaranteed Minimum Income
(GMI) and the family allowance to be the most efficient cash benefits in preventing child-family
separation. As regards services, the SPAS respresentatives mentioned parental counseling as the most
efficient service for preventing separation. Other services that were named, though much less
frequently, included (access to) jobs, family monitoring, and “School after School” programs for
children.


In any case, all of the professionals agreed that there are problems related to both supply and
demand. Although some social benefits (mainly the GMI and the family allowance) and parental
counseling services are considered to be efficient in preventing children’s separation from their
families, we have already shown that only a small number of children in public care (and their families)
actually received them before entering the system. The professionals explained that this coverage will
not increase since local social workers are insufficiently professional and show a certain “lack of
interest”, while the beneficiaries tend to be illiterate or poorly educated and reluctant to take any
initiative.
            “What do you do to prevent child-family separation?
            - I can’t do much more than offer social and educational counseling. Yes, this is what we do out
            there, on the ground, and at the office too; practically, whoever come in receives social and
            educational counseling. I mean, I am entitled to do this with any client who comes in if I realize
            they need it. I can inform you about your obligation to send your child to school, to register the
            child with the family physician, to keep an eye on them to avoid vagrancy or antisocial behavior; I
            do that and sometimes I can do it on and on as you do with benefits. For example, we have cases
            that we discuss with our colleagues from the DGASPC and they tell me “but why don’t you
            counsel them?”; but if they don’t ask for it, should I coerce them? That person has to submit an
            application, I tell them hundreds of times ‘come here and I’ll help you’ but they don’t come. What
            can I do?!

            Are there also families who don’t receive the benefits they are entitled to?
            - Of course there are, I’m sure of it. If a person doesn’t ask for it, you can’t give it to them by
            force. I inform them, but you are bound by law to give them the benefit, because there is a law
            with a very clear article, and they say “ah, really, OK, bye!” If they have a preschooler, I tell them
            about the CASTAN center, but they refuse to take their child there. What can I do? Then that
            child sits in front of the house all day long, clearly s/he is at risk of not starting first grade.

            But is there a risk of separation from the family?
            - This is the problem. Yes, if I identify that risk, the only thing I can do is to submit a proposal to
            the DGASPC, there is no other measure I can take, and the DGASPC is in charge of reviewing the
            case and taking it to the committee or to court.” (Interview with a professional, Piatra-Neamţ)

On the other hand, as seen in Figure 44, the amount of social assistance, including information and
parent counseling, offered to families in need in their communities is entirely insufficient. For example,
only 24 percent of children in public care and their families received any information or counseling
before the child entered the system. 219 This is why professionals stated that services such as
counseling, information, and “parenting classes” need to be scaled up nationwide.




219
      The share rose to over 30 percent for the children who entered the system after 2007.

178
        “What actions should be targeted to parents in particular to mitigate the risk of separation?

        - Parental education. Depending on how one decides to meet with the parents, twice or four
        times a month... And I’m telling you this because I participated in many [such activities]. I don’t
        know, parents learn about themselves and they put themselves in children’s shoes, it’s fantastic.
        (Focus group with professionals, Craiova)

        - Parenting classes... This is how services can develop because you identify needs in a better and
        clearer manner. They can come up with solutions themselves!” (Interview with a professional,
        Piatra-Neamţ)
        - Parenting classes for parents to learn how to be a role model for their children because the
        child actually learns from the parent. If the parent cannot be educated and does not set an
        example for the child, then the child can’t get the information s/he needs in life, right? (Interview
        with a professional, Bârlad)
        - I think I’d stick to the same idea, helping parents in their very own environment and giving due
        consideration to their culture so that they can understand why things are a certain way and not
        the other way around. Because I can see some discrepancy here… when we pursue the child’s
        best interest, we define it based on our way of thinking, of being, on how we were raised. They
        come from a different environment, with other traditions and other… and then we have to realize
        how we can help these people to understand why it is important to keep their child, by
        understanding them and not based on our concepts. (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-
        Napoca)
        - Some sort of parental education. Exactly, for those who work with us and those who are open
        to receive this information because not every parent can get that, for example legal counseling...
        (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)

        - Only parental counseling and information about the service network... If only they came
        because they receive child benefits and they also get social support for families in difficulty, what
        interest would they still have in coming to counseling? ‘Well, wait, I already get all of them and I
        still live in abject poverty’.” (Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)

However, many parents from the families who are caring for children at risk of separation refuse to
participate in counseling or parental education activities. The professionals believed that the greatest
issue is a lack of sanctions to enforce the existing regulations, as well as the absence of any
regulations regarding parents who violate the rights of their own children. In order to boost parents’
participation in counseling, they suggest that counseling should be set as a condition for receiving
social benefits (especially the GMI) and benefits should be cut or even discontinued for those parents
who do not comply with this condition.
        “What else is missing? What else should be done?
        - Constraints for parents. Penalties.

        - Yes, penalties.
        - For parents, but not only. Also for institutions...

        - There are constraints, right? But they are not being implemented.
        - Implementing mechanisms are missing. That is the problem. Leverages to help us …

        - We don’t have the legal basis. Civil judgments specify the amounts the parent … parents must
        pay to the tax office, but nothing happens. The parent doesn’t pay, they are not investigated,
        no… [...]
        - I was thinking about what could be done; maybe a more drastic measure if, for example, a
        parent already has two institutionalized children. In order to prevent the institutionalization of
        the other children, you should coerce them in some way, I don’t know how... because you can’t
        break human rights either.
        - Yes, the human right to relinquish yet another child with us. [...]

        - Or it would be better… since we’re talking about legal amendments, to somehow compel
        parents to participate in a counseling program.


                                                                                                                179
         - And they would do it just for the sake of it.

         - They either want it or they don’t … no, no. Not all the time.
         - Not all the time. You have no one to work with. And you’ve seen it, you go to get them, you
         chase them, you bring them back, the next day they’ll stop coming anyway. No, something to
         make them or to … some sort of applicable penalties. Sir, have you attended the counseling
         program? I haven’t. Aha, OK, well, there’s your fine or something. You pay or you do the
         counseling… [...]

         - Good, and if not, all these things should lead to a court ruling on… child relinquishment.
         - The law on relinquishment.

         - Yes, because relinquishment is no longer an option. We only have termination of legal …
         parental rights.

         And what is the difference? What are the consequences for parents or children?
         - Well, in the case of relinquishment, you don’t resume the proceedings, the child becomes
         adoptable. With the termination of parental rights, we must support the family to regain their
         parental rights.

         - Now, related to what you’ve said and based on my experience, in general people like that need
         to communicate. They need to talk. True, some of them may complain, let’s say, about their
         problems in order to get some money. But starting from the idea that they, like everyone else
         around us, need to communicate, the programs you mentioned… and, starting with the second
         child, based on age, material circumstances, you should somehow connect them with the benefit,
         with the welfare, with the guaranteed minimum income, the obligation to go to counseling for a
         period of time, that is something that can be done. And then, I always say a good farmer makes a
         good farm. If those who develop such programs want and know how to empower their
         beneficiaries, then their beneficiaries will come back the next day to take part in the program. If
         we are not really interested in the work we do, then they won’t be willing to come either... and
         this is also connected to the social workers’ continuing education…
         Ah, but do they still do that?

         - Well, no, but they should …” (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)

The specialists’ discussions about penalties and accountability revolved not only around parents but
also around local authorities, which have not developed enough services for the population in need.
         “- It is very clear, you will never find priorities related to these children in difficulty on a mayor’s
         agenda. They have political priorities of a different kind: roads, schools, things that generate
         money. You see? Therefore, this is a matter that should be pushed forward through a law so that
         communities are funded, but also controlled to make it more difficult for them to evade it, to
         make it so expensive that it would actually be more profitable for them to keep the child there. I
         would raise the tax from five to fifteen million, this is how much it costs you as a mayoralty if you
         place more children in public care. The things the service could do with that money!
         - So that suits them. They pay five million a month, then they are carefree, they all prefer it that
         way, right? But why don’t you take the money you’ve received from the budget, because these
         are citizens of your commune, and develop services and help them. You see, things should
         happen at a political level. Because it’s clear that everything is due to lack of resources.” (Focus
         group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

Nevertheless, the problem is not a lack of regulations. 220 Most of the professionals who were
interviewed agreed that Law 272/2004, as subsequently amended, currently includes enough
provisions for carrying out preventive activities. However, there are no concrete implementing
methodologies (manuals or guides) nor are there any mechanisms for monitoring the implementation
of these preventive activities by key local institutions. For example, the service plan, which we have
previously mentioned, is stipulated by the current legislation as a way to prevent children from being
separated from their families and yet very few SPAS produce them.


220
   For example, see Annex 6 Box 1 on the social worker’s role and responsibilities in the protection and promotion of
children’s rights.

180
However, there is one positive trend: the incidence of preventive services increased considerably over
time, from less than 20 percent of children who entered the system in the 1990s to 40-43 percent after
2007 (Annex 6 Figure 8). Nonetheless, there are still significant gaps between counties (Annex 6 Table
36), with rates ranging between approximately 20 percent of children in Arad, Caraș-Severin, and
Suceava and 72 percent of children in the County of Neamț.
Despite last years’ progress, it is obvious that neither public community-based social assistance
services nor Community Consultative Structures (SCC)221 provide enough services to prevent the
separation of children from their families. Furthermore, they are not active enough nor effective in
supporting the children’s reintegration into their families.
         “There are those community consultative committees that work inadequately in many communes.
         If they existed and worked as they should, many cases would probably not even get to us in need
         of protective measures.” (Interview with professionals, Piatra Neamț)
         “Local authorities are willing to intervene, but often they are overwhelmed in practice when it
         comes to emergency interventions. And volunteering is not very well-developed in our local
         communities. For example, the problem of contraception or other issues… I mean, the local
         community doesn’t understand that it is first of all its problem, not necessarily the problem of the
         county or of others. Mobilizing the local community this way, not necessarily the mayoralty,
         formal and informal leaders, be it the police, be it the … I don’t want to label, don’t get me wrong,
         but there are people who could actually help to find local solutions to local problems.” (Focus
         group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

Moreover, the case file data showed that only 11 percent of children in public care and their families
received any support from a person, group, or organization in the community before entering the
system. Two-thirds of them were helped by individuals, especially grandparents, aunts, uncles and
other relatives, whereas only one-third received support from local professionals, NGOs, or informal
groups. It is worth mentioning that most of the children and families who received support in the
community were the very ones who also benefited from services. The share of children who were
supported is three times higher among those who received services than the other children (24
percent versus 8 percent). Therefore, the “aid” provided within communities tends to be concentrated
on the families who also benefit from services (partly as a result of being referred by the
representatives of the SPAS or SCC).
The main structural causes of the shortage and limited effectiveness of preventive services are
synthesized in the first quote from the next Professionals’ Bag below and include:
 The very low wages paid to social workers.
         “You can’t overwork a colleague who gets paid RON 800. And this is what happens in our case
         because there are only a few of us at the city level and I suppose we are not the only ones
         dealing with this problem; I suppose it’s the same all over the country.” (Interview with a
         professional, DAS Piatra Neamț)

 Understaffed SPAS, especially in rural communities and small towns,222 and health units. Given the
  number of children at risk of separation from their families, child protection professionals believe
  that there is a major lack of staff even in the big cities.
         “Even in the city of Cluj, we currently consist of five people, so that is definitely not enough. I
         have to handle forty cases at once. I don’t know how one can be effective with every single case
         and offer them services to meet their needs, besides the fact that we only have one psychologist.
         So, you don’t have enough resources to refer the cases to. Many of them need counseling



221
   Law 272/2004 and Government Decision 49/2011 lay down the obligation for local authorities to create informal
groups meant to support social protection activities by identifying community needs and finding local solutions to
children’s social problems. Members of these SCCs include local decision-makers such as the mayor or deputy mayor,
the mayoralty secretary, social workers, doctors, police officers, school representatives, and priests.
222
   According to the census of SPAS carried out by the World Bank in 2014 (“Social Assistance Services at Community
Level,” May 2014), the shortage of staff in the SPAS in rural and small urban communities is estimated to be between
2,300 and 3,600 people (Teșliuc, Grigoraș and Stănculescu, coord., 2015).

                                                                                                                 181
            support. You visit the family, but it’s not enough, despite all our goodwill and professionalism …”
            (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

 The lack of clearly defined responsibilities at the SPAS level (not only regarding child protection)
  and excessive office work and other activities unrelated to social assistance.223
            “Most mayoralties…, though indeed, some of them have a social worker who knows what social
            assistance is all about because they have university education, but most of the times there are
            employees who are assigned social assistance duties and who have other activities to take care of,
            like the guaranteed minimum income or taxes and levies. In practice, they don’t know what to do
            first, but in general… Anyway, the Craiova City Hall is not doing great either because I know they
            are understaffed too; there are just a few people handling the entire city, with a population which
            is quite large.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)

            “If the employee with social assistance duties has to do land measurements and sometimes run
            an inquiry, they will do it hastily just to get it over with.” (Interview with professionals, Piatra
            Neamț)

 Insufficient training of social assistance staff within the SPAS.
 Lack of protocols and regulations concerning inter-institutional cooperation between local and
  county agencies, including the DGASPC. However, after the completion of the present study, a new
  regulation came into force (Government Decision 691/2015) starting September 2015 that
  established a procedure for monitoring the raising and caring of children with parents who have
  left to work abroad and the services that would benefit these children, as well as a working
  methodology for the collaboration between the DGASPCs and the SPAS and a standard model for
  documents drawn up by both institutions.
            “So, what I want to tell you is that the law on health units has been amended along with their
            obligation to conclude cooperation agreements with social assistance directorates. So far, we
            haven’t received any cooperation agreements from those units. Actually, we received two: from
            the maternity hospital in Ploieşti and from Câmpina. Otherwise... We have other maternity
            hospitals in the county; none of them have made any effort in this respect. Well, we haven’t
            concluded the protocol yet as we are only in the phase of setting the responsibilities. But what
            I’m trying to say is that there is no interest. And the only one interested was the maternity
            hospital from Ploieşti. The other maternity hospitals don’t have social workers, as required by law.
            Also, we have a very difficult collaboration with all the units in the county, except for the Ploieşti
            Maternity Hospital, where there are no problems.” (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)
            “There is an abundance of legislation in the social field and on child protection, it is an
            extraordinarily vast area. In my opinion, as long as the law only lays out obligations and
            responsibilities, we cannot expect great things! [...] At the inter-institutional level, we need child
            protection rules, more that just ‘teachers must do this or that…!’. And if they don’t? Who
            monitors that, who reports that? If I inform the police that the school didn’t tell me, [...] ok, so
            what? It looks like it’s personal, I’ve ruined my relationship with them for good because there is
            no rule based on which you can say ‘Madam, this is your duty!’. [...] For example, I know someone
            at the inspectorate and I was very curious to see the job description of a school principal. And
            you find out that the job description doesn’t stipulate that they have to inform DAS [Directorate
            for Social Assistance] or follow any of the other legal provisions. What can I do? With all the
            legislation on education, it’s hard to tell her: ‘Madam, read the child protection law!’ (Interview
            with a professional, Piatra Neamț)

The main recommendation made by the DGASPC specialists that we interviewed was to intensify
efforts to provide continuous training and support to SPAS representatives in order to increase their
capacity to provide services aimed at preventing children from being separated from their families.
        “- Regarding this, I wanted to tell you that we, at the directorate level [DGASPC], have offered
        indirect services for many years, I mean we tried to share our expertise in the field of prevention
        with the mayoralty. They often recruit unqualified staff or they delegate duties to people like the
        agricultural officer or others. Commune mayoralties. Yes, commune mayoralties, because those
        from Cluj-Napoca have never worked with us although they should have on many occasions.
        When in crisis, they would say ‘take that child’; and we’d say let’s see what you’ve done and we’d
        go there to train them, to explain to them the legal leverages available, the funds they could
        access, the NGOs that could help and how they should intervene; many times, we went with them
        on the ground even if there were no cases in the records of the directorate, we created commune
        groups, we would train them. We don’t do that anymore, but we used to do it for years, training
        the social workers from the mayoralties and, often, we even tried to get the mayors to participate
        in our meetings to see what they were all about; it’s not that easy to take five children and leave
        them with the directorate, if they don’t want to.

        - Yes, we teamed up with them, we went on the ground and delivered preventive services,
        working with the family, trying to help them manage the local resources, to access those they
        hadn’t thought about, including social housing. For many of them it was just a thing: well, the
        mayoralty has that building, let’s see how we can fix it. And you should know that sometimes it
        worked. We should invest in this sort of activities!” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

 “- The Child Protection Directorate from Iași has six area centers in the community, which are parent support
 and counseling centers for parents. Their role is precisely to support the family, alongside local authorities, to
 identify parents’ and children’s needs, and to run a targeted intervention where needed. As their name says,
 they provide parent counseling and support but also actual support to the family and child so as to prevent
 the child’s entry into public care. We work with NGOs, providing specific support where needed. All sort of
 services are provided, including training to the local community consultative structures under each local
 authority, which are operational in Iași. We also hold meetings with community social workers for their
 professional development and training so that we can become a functional network, carry out our own specific
 interventions, support each other and join forces in delivering social services. We don’t overlook the role
 played by NGOs. NGOs have supported our – the Directorate’s – actions many times; not only those meant to
 prevent children’s placement in the system but also those aiming at their reintegration, including that of
 young people leaving public care. [...] (DGASPC representative)
 - Yes, we have received a lot of support and we complement each other. The Child Protection Directorate from
 Iași trains our volunteers so that they can do a good job and be able to efficiently respond to certain cases at
 our centers, thus ensuring that the child develops properly thanks to our volunteers’ contribution.” (NGO
 representative)

Building and strengthening local capacity to provide services that may prevent child-family separation
is essential to extending social services designed to meet a wide array of needs, including child
protection. However, preventing children’s separation from their families requires much more than
that, namely the effort of the entire community, other universal services (such as education and
healthcare), and community-based services or informal support groups like SCC, as well as the SPAS
and the DGASPC. Therefore, the following sections examine these other community-based services.

- Lack of professionalized services [SPAS] in the communities.
What do you mean by "professionalize"’?
- The professionalization of the people who actually work there. They are not professional.
Meaning that they are not trained in the field or what?
- They don’t have any kind of training like legal training, work experience in the social field,
experience in working with people, they are way too overburdened with other tasks, they are
tasked with calculating and collecting taxes, as well as with granting social benefits…
- The biggest problem is that they don’t want this...
- They are just a few and they [the mayors] won’t let them. We trained some of them and
they were really open. And they told us: I have to handle many heating subsidy claims. If I
get something wrong there, I’m in big trouble. I can’t focus on your case, go there, talk to
people, be kind to the mother, loosen up, counsel her, intervene. I don’t have time for that, I
also work at night.”

“This is obvious from the very definition of the institution – Child Protection           6b
Directorate. So, they work with children who have already left their families,
they are no longer with their families, they are already in a protective setting. Work should
be done when the child is still with the family, trying to support it, to identify their resources
as well as community resources in order to help that family. And you should do that when
the child is still with the family, not when... It’s absurd! Lots of money and human resources
are allocated for children when they have already left their families, yet nothing is allocated
when they are still with their families! SPAS are underdeveloped, there is a shortage of social
workers, they don’t have money, they don’t have... they can’t visit those families, they don’t
know what to do...”

Community-based Educational Services
Figure 44 reveals that at least224 7 percent of the children in public care whose case files include social
assessments had educational needs that led to their institutionalization in the absence of services at
the community level. These needs were mostly related to special education, particularly in the case of
children with special educational needs (SEN) and/or disabilities, and to the pursuit of studies or
dropout risk, especially among rural children.
Child protection professionals pointed out that problems arise starting with early childhood education.
The case file data indicated that only 49 percent of the children who entered the system between the
ages of 4-6 years have attended preschool versus 86 percent of children aged 4 to 6 years from the
general population. 225 Thus, one key preventive measures would be to increase access to early
childhood education for the children from families at risk of separation, which would not only benefit
the child but also the family as it would allow the mother or one parent to get a job. The professionals
interviewed for this study did not recommend a benefit such as the social vouchers for kindergarten,
which was recently introduced by the government,226 but rather propse that local authorities subsidize
kindergarten and crèche fees for low-income families as already happens in some urban settlements
or in certain projects.227
            “You find solutions. For example, regarding crèches, there is a daycare center – The Protection of
            the Mother of God – for children aged 0 to 3 years, which covers demand only to some extent;
            and then for crèches there is a legislative loophole whereby a child with a service plan can go to
            a crèche for free with the mayor’s approval. As far as kindergarten goes, we don’t have that
            option unless we find the financial resources for it. And what does that mean? The parent has to
            be eligible for welfare, which however is just a small amount of money, and we have to find an
            NGO to help them; so basically, you have to go here and there.” (Focus group with professionals,
            Cluj-Napoca)

The second major problem is the non-participation in school of many children who end up in public
care. The data available in the children’s case files revealed that, upon entering the system, 19 percent
of primary school-age children (7 to 9 years old) and 6 percent of secondary school-age children (10
to 14 years old) had never been to school.228 This is a combined effect of a lack of resources, the
parents’ attitude and decisions, and a lack of accountability from educational services at the
community level. Generally, in urban and rural areas, teachers and educational establishments tend to
limit the extent of their responsibility to the schoolyard perimeter. This situation is particularly serious
for urban children, Roma children, and children with disabilities.229
            “I’ll give you a real example, an actual case of mine. I have the case of five siblings from a village,
            aged between 4 and 11 years, all out of school. So, it got to the point that an 11-year-old child
            was out of school, no one in the community took an interest in him, he was living in the
            community and no one inquired about him. So, a lack of collaboration and of interest. Still, you
            have to know what people... We [DGASPC] received a report of suspected child trafficking, that’s
            how we got to this family.” (Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)




224
    We say “at least” because the social assessments identify the needs of fewer than half of the children in public care,
consequently the share and the number of those with educational needs may actually be greater.

  Box 10: Out-of-School Children: A Comparison between Children in Public Care and Children
                                   Living with Their Families

 The total rate of out-of-school children aged 7 to 14 years who have never been to school or have dropped
 out is 4 percent for those who live with their families and almost five times higher for children in public care
 before they entered the system.

 The 2011 Census data show that, among children aged 7 to 14 who live with their families, children with
 disabilities, Roma children, and poor children are at extremely high risk of being out of school. The groups of
 children most at risk of not attending or completing compulsory education are:
  Children who are totally incapacitated (55.4 percent) and those who are significantly incapacitated (20.4
        percent);
  Children whose mothers have no formal education (22.7 percent) or completed only primary education
        (10.6 percent);
  Roma children (18.7 percent). Although the mother’s educational attainment is a relevant predictor for
   school participation, there is a great gap between the Roma and the non-Roma even if the mothers’
   educational attainment is held constant. The gap between Roma and non-Roma children is significant even
   if their parents’ educational attainment is the same and they come from the same geographical area;
  Children with many siblings in families with three or more children (6.8 percent);
  Children deprived of parental care, in other words whose parents are absent (5.4 percent).

Because the concept of inclusive education is not well developed in Romania, many educational
establishments do not integrate children with SEN and/or disabilities into regular schools.230 For this
reason, many of these children need to enter public care in order to gain access to special education,
regardless of the relationship that they have with their family. In practice in their case, entering public
care often means leaving home and going to a boarding school and not an actual separation from
their family. In this case, success is measured by the extent of the child’s ability to live independently
rather than by the family reintegration, which is not an issue here.

      Box 11: Need for a Law on Inclusive Education to Enable Children with Disabilities to Attend
                                     School in their Communities

 “Through inclusive education laws, States should establish an inclusive education system under the aegis of
 their respective ministries of education that prohibits rejection from mainstream schools on the basis of
 disability and provides for reasonable accommodation. A transformation plan should provide the framework
 for the implementation of an inclusive education system with measurable goals. States should put in place
 training programs for teachers, create reasonable accommodation funds, provide for accessible materials,
 promote inclusive environments, improve testing methods, promote the transfer from special schools to
 mainstream schools, promote monitoring through indicators on inclusive education, provide adequate support
 to students, and use appropriate communication means and formats. Schools need to be properly funded,
 while at the same time availability of resources should not be a basis for denying access to the right to
 education for a student with disability.”
 Source: OHCHR (2013).


In other cases, children from poor rural families who cannot afford to continue their education in
urban schools are referred by the social worker to the special school and vocational guidance and
assessment service (working under the CJRAE). Parents contact the school and vocational guidance
committee and their children are often accepted into special education since they have two-year
developmental delays as a result of living in poverty with little stimulation. Thus, for many children

230
   Different research studies, reports, and interviews with the families of children with disabilities have illustrated the key
problems that these families face when their children with disabilities are enrolled in the education system. They have
sounded the alarm about the inappropriate enrollment methods currently used by many (mainstream and special)
schools for different groups of children with SEN and/or disabilities. See, for example, Horga and Jigău (2010), Gherguț
(2011), Toth (2013), the European Center for the Rights of Children with Disabilities (2013), and Chiriacescu (2014).

who enter the system for causes like “child disability” and/or “poverty,” public care actually offers the
only accessible solution to receive an education.
Teachers also play a very important role in the preventive services aimed at other groups of at-risk
children. The early identification of at-risk children231 whose parents work abroad (and the subsequent
provision of support) is much more effective when it is done by the SPAS in cooperation with the
school. The DGASPC specialists interviewed for this study stressed that the following actions are
necessary to make this cooperation work effectively: (i) improving and strengthening monitoring and
reporting mechanisms at the local level (within SPAS) for the children who need support; (ii) building
the capacity of schools to compensate for parents’ absence by providing children with counseling; and
(iii) carrying out more health education activities as well as activities meant to prevent risk behavior,232
including risky sexual behavior,233 among adolescents. 234
Preventing child-family separation is related to preventing dropout. The activities run in some schools
to prevent dropouts contribute indirectly to reducing the risk of child-family separation, especially if
those activities also involve parents as well as their children.
After-school services along with daycare centers are deemed to have the greatest impact in
preventing both children’s separation from their families and dropouts from school. Almost all of the
participants in the interviews and group discussions held during our qualitative research referred at
least once to this service and its positive effects. Most of their recommendations or suggestions for
improvement in terms of prevention supported the development of such services with free access for
children in difficult circumstances who are at risk of being separated from their families.
            “In the after-school program, we noticed that the meal was an incentive for children. There are
            days when many children have nothing to eat at home, let alone a hot or meat-based meal. Well,
            in the after-school program, they get a hot meal every day, on a regular basis, with sufficient
            protein for their normal development. So, we can sign them up for an after-school program
            where they would first eat, because this is what they are looking for to begin with, and then they
            take part in the activities because they get interested; they come here for the meal, but slowly
            they get interested in the educational program and you gradually win them over... After-school
            programs should be available in every school. The law stipulates their establishment without
            making it mandatory to actually run them. And if ‘may’ turned into ‘shall’ in the law, we would
            find the required funds and this would greatly benefit the children.” (Interview with an NGO
            representative, Case study, Craiova)




Community-based Health Services
Figure 44 shows that at least235 6 percent of the children in public care whose case files include social
assessments have health-related needs that have led to their institutionalization because of the
absence of services at the community level. With regard to the healthcare services available in the
community, we identified two potential structural causes of children’s separation from their families.
The first concerns primary and community healthcare, while the second relates to health services for
adults and children with disabilities and/or mental health problems. This section focuses on primary


231
   Especially those with both parents abroad and/or who are facing psychological trauma due to their prolonged
separation from their parents.
232
   These are associated with the reduction of drug use, of harmful tobacco and alcohol use, as well as with behavioral
disorders among adolescents.
233
      Adolescents’ risky sexual behavior is directly linked to teenage pregnancies and teenage mothers.
234
   Some of these measures are already contained in Government Decision 691/2015 for the approval of the Procedure
for monitoring the way children with parents gone abroad for work are being raised and cared for and the services
available to them, and for the approval of the Work Methodology for DGASPC-SPAS collaboration and of the standard
model for the documents developed by these two institutions. This regulation only recently entered into force in
September 2015.
235
   We say “at least” because social assessments identify the needs of fewer than half of the children in public care,
consequently the share and number of those with medical needs may actually be greater.

                                                                                                                 187
and community healthcare, while the following two sections look at the health and social services
intended for people with disabilities or exposed to other types of vulnerabilities.
Based on the analyses presented in the previous chapters, families caring for children at risk of
separation are undoubtedly a vulnerable group. Few of them are included in the health insurance
system,236 and they are usually poorer, less educated, and less informed than the general population.
The data in Section 3.1.5.2 showed that only about half of all children in public care were registered
with a family physician before entering the system. Even among children taken into care straight from
a family (including relatives or other people), the share of children registered with a family physician
does not exceed 80 percent.
The Background Study for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020237
highlighted the need to increase the access of vulnerable groups to quality healthcare services. At
present, Romania’s primary healthcare network does not provide efficient healthcare services to the
poor, and the emerging community nurses network is still not sufficiently extended and strenghtened.
The national mapping exercise for the background study238 indicated that most urban and rural
settlements in Romania have at least one family physician and one or more pharmacies. Nonetheless,
over 6 percent of all settlements have no family physicians, community health nurses, or Roma health
mediators.239 Therefore, service delivery is polarized between small and poor rural communities that
lack all types of social services and larger and better developed rural communities and cities, which
have developed more and better services at the local level.
The DGASPC professionals who were interviewed for this study added the fact that the family
physician, even when available, is often not familiar with and thus does not implement the provisions
of Law 272/2004 and its subsequent amendments. Thus, in many cases, neither the family physician
nor community health workers get involved in the effort to prevent child-family separation.
            “In order to identify a problem, the doctor from the community, the family physician should
            know the community health nurse and go there, like they did in the past. I’m going back to the
            old times, maybe I’m too nostalgic. But they need to get involved, I keep going back to that
            because I am both a doctor and a social worker. You sit in your chair and you don’t know which
            pregnant woman in your community is at risk and you just say ‘I don’t have to.’ Yes, you have to.
            So, [Law] 272 says that you have to make house calls until the child is one year old, but they don’t
            know that. Or if there is a child they visit them or the mother or someone else brings the child to
            the doctor’s office and the child is very sick, the doctor calls me, the Child Protection services,
            what to do? Well, Madam, what else is there to do? Call 112, call the ambulance, you take the
            child to the hospital no matter what the mother, the father, whoever is there says. The child is
            seriously ill, you act like a doctor. You don’t have to call me at the Child Protection because
            there’s nothing I can do, but you make sure you do what’s best for that child. And this happens
            with other specialists, too. At the mayoralty, they say ‘it’s none of my business, I don’t have time, I
            can’t go, the social worker should, why should I go and monitor that?’ Lack of responsibility, to
            put it plainly.” (Interview with a professional, Craiova)

The involvement of doctors and other healthcare staff is also essential for the development of
preventive services for reducing teenage pregnancies, by improving the health monitoring of
adolescent girls with the aim of identifying pregnancies early, and by increasing the access of
adolescents to health counseling and family planning services. However, current shortcomings in the
healthcare system make it impossible to prevent children’s separation from their families as well as
other adverse outcomes such as infant mortality. In Romania:

      Based on data for September-November 2014.

   These “blank areas” lacking primary and community health services tend to be rural settlements that spread
throughout the country (with a higher prevalence in Buzău, Ialomiţa, Caraş-Severin, Vrancea, and Hunedoara), most of
which are small communes with fewer than 2,000 inhabitants, generally located on county borders and lacking any
social workers.

       One in ten births is registered to a teenage mother (aged between 15 and 19), and the
        percentage of unwanted pregnancies exceeds 50 percent among adolescents. 240 Early
        motherhood, especially when the pregnancy is unwanted, can lead to child relinquishment,
        school dropout, and even social exclusion. Therefore, it is important to reduce the rate of
        unwanted pregnancies.
       Eleven percent of newborns are premature, with preterm birth being one of the risk factors for
        children’s separation from their families (and causing more than half of all neonatal deaths). Most
        premature and/or underweight infants are born to teenage mothers and/or to mothers in the
        lowest socioeconomic groups and/or of Roma ethnicity, to those with low educational attainment,
        and those living in rural areas. Mothers in these groups either do not seek prenatal care services
        or use them inadequately, while 40 percent of women who give birth prematurely do not receive
        any systematic or regular prenatal visits.241
There is evidence that there are no or few effective family planning services at the community level,
especially for poor and vulnerable women who are most at risk of child relinquishment. Both
healthcare and child protection experts also underlined the need to increase access to family planning
services for the groups that are most at risk of relinquishing their children.
            “Underage mothers are registered by the family physician and are monitored during pregnancy,
            and their children are also registered. Monitoring means that the mother receives services but only
            if and when she comes to see the doctor... The family physician won’t go to her home to say: “Come
            see me, please.” So, although they are insured because they are underage, many of them do not
            receive services precisely because they don’t go to a family physician’s office. And she comes when
            she is already nine months pregnant and very close to giving birth. Why hasn’t she come earlier?
            Lack of information, shame, poverty, she doesn’t have clothes to wear, or she can’t get there, who
            knows? And at this first visit, I give her a laboratory referral, an ultrasound scanner referral, and
            another one to a gynecologist for a consultation. She has to travel for every one of these three
            referrals. The nearest hospital, the Botoșani Maternity Hospital, is 70 to 80 kilometers away. She
            doesn’t have the money to travel, so she won’t go. Moreover, she will not come to me the second
            time because all I do is give her unrealistic tasks instead of real solutions to her problem.” (Group
            discussions with the College of Family Physicians, the Association of Family Physicians, and the
            Association of Family Physician Employers, Botoşani County, July 2014. Qualitative research
            conducted by the World Bank in July-August 2014, as part of the Background Study for the National
            Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020).
            “Family planning services should also be developed as, currently, I can’t say that they are
            available. Not even in Câmpina, which is a municipality. There used to be an office but it was
            closed down. It’s no longer available. I’ve been working in the system for a long time and I
            haven’t come across any clinic offering this sort of services. They don’t even talk to the patients.”
            (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)

However, the child protection specialists whom we interviewed for this study drew attention to the
fact that the lack of family planning services on offer is accompanied by demand-side issues. The
problem is not only a lack of money to pay for medical tests or transportation but also other factors
that can result in at-risk women refusing to participate in, say, sex education, factors such as low levels
of education (illiteracy), religion, customs, and, sometimes, the views of the person’s spouse or life
partner.
            “We are running a program together with Sera Romania precisely on the prevention of unwanted
            pregnancies and it is going quite well in the sense that women are pretty open. The problem has
            to do with the traditions. In a Roma community, a woman who doesn’t have children is worth
            nothing and will be chased away. So … this is what makes a man proud. It is a way for him to
            prove his…” (Focus group with professionals, Braşov)
            “You can’t do anything against someone’s will. It is their right. And then, there are factors like
            education, religion, innocence...” (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)

      Box 12: Urgent Need to Improve and Increase Access to Reproductive and Mother and Child
                               Health Services for Vulnerable Groups

 Affordable and high-quality sexual and reproductive health services242 are not available in Romania, especially
 to poor and vulnerable women. The number of reproductive health interventions conducted by the Ministry of
 Health (MS) targeted to the vulnerable population has gradually decreased since 2008, as have the relevant
 budgets.243 The regulations, methodologies, and tools of the MS’s National Program (such as the criteria
 governing which vulnerable groups are eligible for free reproductive health services, the logistic management
 information system regarding contraceptives and their distribution, and the list of free contraceptives) have
 not been updated. The network of family physicians’ offices providing reproductive health services has been
 dismantled due to lack of training, budgets, and interest in this program from decision-makers at the national
 and county levels. There are no sustainable continuing medical education programs on reproductive health for
 family physicians. Only few family physicians ‒ far fewer than are needed nationwide ‒ have agreed to
 distribute free contraceptives, and the effectiveness of this free contraception program also suffers from a low
 budget and a high degree of inconsistency in procurement and distribution. There is a lack of accurate data on
 the activities carried out by community health workers (community health nurses and health mediators from
 Roma communities) in the area of reproductive health and, since these workers no longer benefit from training
 programs or any guidelines or educational materials, it is very likely that these services are infrequent and/or
 of poor quality. The decentralization of healthcare services, which was poorly coordinated and insufficiently
 regulated, coupled with the recent economic crisis have led to the current situation.

 The priority actions recommended, among others, in the Background Study for the National Strategy on Social
 Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 are:
  Revise the criteria for the free distribution of contraceptives;
  Specify priority beneficiaries (such as rural areas, poor and deprived communities, and specific age groups);
  Ensure continuity of access to a range of free contraceptives for vulnerable women of reproductive age;
  Expand the network of family physicians who are willing to deliver free contraceptives and ensure
     widespread geographical coverage;
  Train and retrain community healthcare providers (family physicians, community health nurses, and Roma
     health mediators) in delivering quality sexual and reproductive health services;
  Establish partnerships with specialized and grassroots NGOs to deliver reproductive health services and
     interventions;
  Plan, implement, monitor, and evaluate information-education-communication (IEC) campaigns and
     outreach interventions in the field of reproductive health tailored to the particular needs, beliefs, and
     traditions of the most vulnerable communities;
  Increase the local coverage of basic healthcare service providers (family physicians, community nurses, and
     Roma mediators) countrywide;
  Train or retrain community healthcare providers (family physicians, community nurses, and Roma health
     mediators) in delivering quality prenatal, postnatal, and child care;
  Monitor, evaluate, and control the delivery and quality of services.

   A comprehensive definition of reproductive health services includes other priority public health areas such as: (i)
family planning; (ii) sexual health; (iii) safe motherhood; (iv) unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted diseases, including
HIV; and (v) cervical cancer.
243
    In 2014, the National Mother and Child Health Program (which includes all reproductive health interventions) was
allocated a budget of RON 10,330,000, which was less than 50 percent of the 2013 budget and was, for example, five
times less than the amount budgeted for the National Organ, Tissue, and Cell Transplantation Program. In fact, ever
since preventive and curative programs merged into “national public health programs” funded from the state budget,
the programs that included a significant prevention component started getting increasingly lower budgets, while the
budgets for curative programs increased.

Community-based Health and Social Services for Children with Disabilities
Although, by law, children are entitled to free healthcare, many do not have access to the necessary
health services. In these cases, public care has to take over some of the responsibilities of the
healthcare system and support the families of children with serious health problems by separating
those children from the family to provide them with the health services they need. Due to the lack of
health, recovery, habilitation, rehabilitation, or palliative care services for these children, the public
care system is often the only way by which some children in difficult situations can access the services
that they need. This is usually the case for children with severe disabilities. One example is the case of
the child with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in Story Bag 4a.
          “I told you, we have families that have not relinquished the child, they placed him with us for care
          and recovery because they couldn’t take care of him. We now have a case of cleft lip and palate,
          pretty nasty; we will have the child operated on and after this, we will ensure that the child can be
          cared for in a family environment, and we will send him back.” (Interview with a professional,
          Bârlad).

          “There are children who started by using our recovery services – they would come here daily, with
          their parents, grandparents, or caretakers, and eventually they became residents. But this is
          because the grandparents were very old, had medical problems, the child had also major
          problems so they couldn’t take care of him anymore. However, the child is visited almost every
          week and whenever the grandparents can take him home, they remove him for short periods, like
          for the weekend. Based on my knowledge of the parents I see in the recovery, most cases are not
          relinquishment, the parents use these recovery services, but you can’t speak of relinquishment.”
          (Interview with a professional, Piatra Neamț).

There are very few services available at the community level for children with disabilities or for the
parents who look after these children. It is difficult if not impossible to prevent children with
disabilities from being separated from their families when parents with severe health problems get no
support within the community or close by and children have no access to appropriate services before
being separated and placed into public care. The child care specialists interviewed for this study
considered that, of all types of services for children with disabilities, priority should be given to: (i)
developing community service centers that include habilitation and rehabilitation services and (ii)
ensuring that children with disabilities and their families have access to those habilitation and
rehabilitation services.
The type of services that are not available at the community level include (see also Box 12):
     Early identification and intervention services244
     Medical habilitation and rehabilitation services
     Mobile multi-disciplinary teams
     Counseling and psychosocial support services
     Psychiatric and psychosocial habilitation and rehabilitation services
     Respite centers
     Community support services for young people and adults with disabilities
     Social economy structures for young people with disabilities




244
   Early identification is a screening and diagnostic process, designed to identify risks of deficiency, developmental
delays, and/or functional limitations in babies and toddlers. Early intervention is a set of full inter-disciplinary services
that contribute to the development of babies and toddlers with disabilities (0-3 years old) and reduce the risk of
physical, psychological, or developmental delays to a minimum.



                                                                                                                        191
      Facilitation and counseling services aimed at enabling the employment of young people with
       disabilities in the labor market
      Day care centers and day care centers with an educational focus on children with disabilities.
The child protection specialists who took part in the qualitative research also mentioned these services
often and highlighted how important they are for the child’s wellbeing and keeping him/her in the
family.
           “We have a recovery center for children with disabilities who live with their families, and priority is
           given to children from families with high risk of relinquishment. That is, they receive a therapy
           program that spares the family from all of the expenses that they would incur at home, with
           tailored services. So every child receives a full, free-of-charge tailored program. And at the same
           time, they receive counseling. There is a psychologist. Usually, it’s at the family’s request, but if
           there is a need, they receive this, both the family and the children, if they are of an appropriate
           age.” (Focus group with professionals, Craiova)

           “We set up a mobile team that travels in the county so that these children from families facing
           problems, who cannot get to us, can receive a disability certificate so that these children who
           need the financial or health support are not relinquished but can be looked after by their family.
           On the basis of that support. We mainly focus on children with a severe disability. So we prefer to
           go and see them in their community because they will not come to us.” (Focus group with
           specialists, Cluj-Napoca).

Moreover, all of these services are vital to enable the eventual reinsertion of children and young
people with disabilities into their families.


      Box 13: Services Needed at the Community Level for Children and Adults with Disabilities

    The Background Study for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 made a
    comprehensive inventory of services that need to be developed for children and adults with disabilities so that
    they have full access to care and support in their communities.

    Early Identification and Early Intervention Services
    A greater range of early identification and early intervention services that should cover the entire country is
    critical for ensuring that children with disabilities receive proper care.

     Each pediatric hospital should have an early identification unit that is staffed by professionals who are
      trained to deal with the entire spectrum of conditions that can lead to a potential disability.

     Each maternity ward and pediatric hospital should have a counseling unit to support families after a
      diagnosis of a current or potential disability. This family counseling should aim to offer guidance, concrete
      support, practical solutions, and information during the early stages of the habilitation or rehabilitation
      process.

     Each city should have at least one early intervention unit or specific services for people with various types
      of functional limitations (physical, sensory, intellectual, and behavioral).

    Currently, early intervention services are usually located in the main city of a county, which means that they
    tend to be inaccessible to many families living in smaller towns or rural areas as appropriate transportation is
    often scarce or unaffordable.245




245
    Over the past decade, some NGOs started to develop early intervention and support services for at-risk children and
their families in cooperation with local authorities and/or existing public services (such as hospitals, kindergartens, and
counseling services). Some examples are: Alpha Transilvană in Târgu Mureș (for children with neuromotor disabilities);
Speranța in Timișoara (for children with developmental problems); the Center for Motor Rehabilitation (Centrul Pentru
Reabilitare Motorie) in Cluj; Thysia and Albin in Oradea; Sense International in Bucharest, Oradea, Tmișoara, and Iași (for
children with hearing and sight impairments); World Vision in Cluj, Craiova, and Bucharest; Help Autism in Bucharest;
Iulia Pantazi Center in Bucharest, and the Inocenți Foundation in Bistrița.

192
 Habilitation and Rehabilitation Services

 The development of mobile teams for early intervention is very much needed, especially for children with
 complex medical conditions and those living in rural or isolated areas. Currently, the use of this kind of mobile
 teams for early intervention is rare in Romania.246
 More habilitation/rehabilitation centers and services are needed in small communities, including mobile teams
 that are able to provide integrated services in rural and remote areas and to people with mobility difficulties.
 Habilitation/rehabilitation services are not limited to health care but comprise a wider range of activities and a
 variety of support services for community living and daily life activities. During the past years, these services
 have been provided more and more by local authorities or by accredited NGOs. The Ministry of Health is
 supporting this positive trend. Moreover, there is a need for more medical equipment, medical consumables,
 and free or reimbursable medicines for people with disabilities.

 Services for People with Mental Health Problems
 People with mental health problems are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.247 In order to break the cycle of
 poverty and discrimination, it is necessary to introduce more income-generating and community
 empowerment programs for people with mental health problems. Many fear being “labeled” with a mental
 health problem, which is why they delay or avoid seeking treatment. This self-stigmatization combined with
 previous negative experiences with the health care system (for example, discriminatory behavior by medical
 personnel, high costs, and a lack of health literacy skills on the part of the patient) often cause the person with
 mental health problems to postpone seeking professional help.248 As a result, many mental health problems
 remain under-diagnosed or untreated. Education and advocacy programs are needed to promote mental
 health and to challenge the myths surrounding mental health problems that prevail not only among the
 general population but also among health specialists. Also, free counseling and psychosocial support services
 within the community are needed for the families of people with mental health problems.

 Psychiatric and Psychosocial Habilitation and Rehabilitation Services
 The number of psychiatric and psychosocial habilitation and rehabilitation services249 should also increase, and
 their geographical distribution should reflect the distribution of needs across the country. Currently, this type
 of service is provided in the following way. First, general services are provided for children in a small number
 of mainstream schools and kindergartens, in public and private after-school programs, and in public and
 private habilitation/rehabilitation centers. Secondly, specialized services for people with disabilities are
 provided in residential facilities for children with disabilities, in public and private daycare centers for people
 with disabilities, and in public and private habilitation/rehabilitation centers that are specifically for people with
 disabilities or mental health problems.
 Support Services within Communities

 Support services for people with disabilities designed to enable them to benefit from independent or
 supported living are crucial for their successful inclusion in society. Most people with disabilities in Romania
 live with their families and are not able to access affordable housing or support services for independent
 living. Adapting houses to take account of a person’s disability is expensive since state subsidies cover only the
 interest on a bank loan for such purposes. Many families of people with disabilities do not have high enough
 incomes to qualify for a bank loan, which makes the subsidized interest irrelevant. Furthermore, local
 authorities do not always give priority to requests for social housing submitted by families of people with
 disabilities, as stipulated in Law 448/2006. Various group homes and supported living arrangements are
 emerging, mostly for children. In-home support, legal assistance, and accessible leisure, culture, and sports
 programs are all very limited at the national level but are gradually increasing. To accelerate this process,


246
  In 2011, the MMFPSPV set up 20 mobile teams to support the families of children with disabilities in 18 counties and
two sectors of Bucharest. Each mobile team consists of a speech therapist, a physiotherapist, a psychologist, a social
worker, a pediatrician, an occupational therapist, and a special educator.

 policymakers could consider:

  Increasing the number of respite centers for children with disabilities and their parents. These centers offer
        a break for families who are providing 24/7 care for people with disabilities, and thus make it possible for
        these people to remain with their families.
  Strengthening and developing SPAS at the community level, to provide professional and peer support to
        families and carers of people with disabilities, including counseling, self-support groups, and help with
        administrative procedures and with applying for relevant benefits or social services. It is particularly
        important to help parents and carers of people with disabilities to obtain a disability certificate as a first
        step towards accessing a series of entitlements (cash benefits and services). In practice, families in rural
        areas or deprived communities are often not keen to ask for a disability certificate. According to UNICEF
        and several NGOs,250 there is a high number of undeclared disabled children in these areas, for three main
        reasons: (i) a lack of information about the application procedures; (ii) the stigma that is often attached to
        disability in these communities; and (iii) the costs involved, including the transportation costs from the
        person’s city of residence to the county Child Protection Commission (CPC) or the DGASPC office.
  Developing housing adapted to people with disabilities within the community (available as social housing
        as appartments or family-type homes).
  Increasing control over the implementation of legislation, mainly because numerous families of people
        with disabilities have drawn attention to abuses and irregularities.

Community-based Services Designed to Prevent Child-Family Separation
The services that were most often mentioned during our qualitative research as being most effective
in preventing child-family separation were daycare centers. Daycare centers “for children in need, who
can have a warm meal there and are helped with their homework by a good teacher”251 were
unanimously mentioned by the specialists who were interviewed as a more important priority than all
other types of services.
            “Opening the day center from the complex [set up by the DGASPC under a project] had some
            impact. Not a major one, let’s not dream now, but kids, when seeing that those around them
            have a different way of living, they automatically feel inclined to make a change too... Many
            children from that area were encouraged to access the service and they were actually eager to
            come. I remember that on the first day when the center was opened, the first group that came,
            although they were children from Bârlad, didn’t understand why water was falling from the
            shower. It was beyond their understanding. And we’re talking here about years 2004-2005, not
            other times.” (Interview with a professional, Bârlad)

Daycare centers for children with disabilities, including those with an educational focus, are also
included among the most effective preventive services.
Some specialists explained that, because of the compulsory standards set in the current regulations
for these day centers, the services are quite expensive. In big or medium-size towns or in localities
with active private providers, these centers might be available. However, in the rural environment and
in small urban areas where there are no private providers and where the local budget is not even
enough to pay for salaries, there is little capacity to apply for EU funding or other project-based
funding, and thus the likelihood of setting up and operating a day center is quite small. Reassessing
the current quality standards or regulating for less expensive daycare services would have a significant
impact on children from small and disadvantaged localities at risk of separation from their families.

         “How are you doing in terms of prevention? What projects or activities are there?

         - Counseling, financial support, through foundations, day centers... Unfortunately only Brașov still
         has daycare centers; the others were closed because of lack of funds.

         - And the one in the county capital is only for children in grades 1-4. So, here, daycare services
         are missing.

         - It’s good that there still are some NGOs that provide support, like Diaconia.“ (Focus group with
         professionals, Brașov)

Another problem is that very few services exist that target other categories of families at risk of child-
family separation, as discussed in section 3.2.3. Thus, in many communities, the following services are
either poorly developed or are missing completely:
     Juvenile delinquency prevention services, involving the education and social assistance sectors.
     Early identification and appropriate support services for children whose parents are working
      abroad (especially those whose mother and father are both working abroad and/or those who
      experience psychological trauma as a result of the long separation from their parents) and for the
      adults looking after these children.252 It is essential to build the capacity of local institutions to
      tackle this phenomenon because there are no signs that this workforce migration will be reduced
      in the near future, and many migrants hardly ever come home, if at all.
     Prevention, recovery, and social reintegration measures related to alcohol consumption and
      abuse,253 both for teenagers and young people and for adults (their parents). Apart from the
      limited availability of services, access to the existing services is hindered by a series of factors
      including the lack of specialist staff and of information as well as the fear of stigmatization. 254
      These interventions are even more necessary since, according to WHO, for every person who has
      an alcohol problem, seven others are affected on average (family, relatives, and friends).
     Because of the lack of preventive services to reduce substance abuse, especially in the education
      and health care sectors, and the limited capacity of the existing health, psychological, and social
      assistance services for people with addictions, in many cases, children and young adults with
      these problems do not receive any community support or receive support that does not meet
      their needs, even after they enter public care.
         “- I think that another reason is that there are insufficient prevention services: we don’t have
         enough prevention services, and I think that there aren’t enough day centers either. We can’t
         cover, I’m thinking about the fact that we don’t have services for substance abuse.
         In your experience, have you encountered this reason for children being separated from their
         families?
         - Personally I haven’t had cases in which the child ended up in public care because of this reason,
         but I’ve come across requests made by parents or children at risk, with parents who don’t know
         how to handle things... and, unfortunately, the services we can provide are also limited. I mean,
         there are counseling centers and rehab centers... But it seems that for some these are not enough,
         both in terms of numbers and type of actual services offered.

   Currently, for most children in the records of the DGASPCs, the child’s caretaker (one of the parents or a relative)
does not receive any specialized support. For instance, in December 2013, this was the situation of 95 percent of
children who had one or both parents working abroad and 88 percent of the children with a single parent working
abroad.
253
   Alcohol abuse refers to chronic consumption with health, psychological, and social consequences for the individual,
as well as to alcohol addiction (WHO, 2014:232).
254
   On the one hand, 80 percent of people with alcohol problems have not used the services that are currently available
because they do not know that they exist. On the other hand, general physicians often do not identify early-onset
alcohol-related conditions but only when these are already advanced (ALIAT, 2011).

                                                                                                                  195
          When you say substance abuse, what do you refer to mostly?

          - Ethnobotanicals and drugs. Here, there is also a legal issue related to the consumption of
          psychoactive substances, because we had the same problem with our kids, the ones we have in
          the system, with their substance consumption; unfortunately, the law does not ban all types of
          psychoactive substances from consumption. Because I had to take a child with mental troubles to
          be diagnosed, and these troubles resulted from the consumption - I actually took that substance
          from the child. The procedure states that first of all you call the emergency service, but I also
          contacted the unit fighting organized crime and asked for their support. They took the substance,
          sent it for lab tests and the result is that it is not in the category of pure psychoactive substances
          banned by law. Unfortunately, there are many such substances with an unbelievable impact on
          the child’s health, especially on teenagers, with long-term consequences, which later affect the
          child’s social integration and interaction.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

     Services designed to reduce the risk of becoming a victim of human trafficking.
     Services for preventing and combating domestic violence and those for violence victims (for
      example, crisis centers).
According to the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020,
the availability of services seems to be the main determining factor of the reporting level of cases of
violence against children. Notifications to the DGASPCs about children whose physical, mental,
spiritual, and psychological development is at risk within their families and require DGASPC
intervention increased in municipalities to 16 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, while in other cities
the increase was not significant and in rural areas it declined slightly. The strategy also highlights that
interventions for preventing and fighting against domestic violence are insufficiently developed, with
only slightly more than half of all DGASPCs having a special methodology in place for dealing with
and monitoring cases of violence, while only 27 percent have a coordination and support plan for
activities carried out in this field by local public administration authorities. At the local SPAS level, the
use of specific methodologies and procedures is limited, while specialized services are available only in
few places.



Services in Source Communities
Apart from the sectoral analysis of the deficit of community-based services, which is a structural cause
of child-family separation, it is useful to have an overall picture of some communities. Unfortunately,
at the national level, there are no data on community-based services in urban or rural localities.
However, the data collected for this study in communes with source communities can offer an idea,
although these territorial administrative units in rural areas probably have very few existing services,
even when compared to other rural localities.
Table 31 (section 3.2.5.3) has already shown that only 31 percent of communes that contain a source
community have a professional social worker. The remaining 69 percent of communes have a person
responsible for social assistance, but most of these personnel have a range of other responsibilities
within city hall. Moreover, Figure 46 shows that only 43 percent of communes that contain a source
community have a community health nurse, and only one-third also have a Roma health mediator, a
school mediator, and/or a school counselor. One out of every five communes that contain source
communities has only one SPAS representative, whereas the others have two to five community
workers (who might be social workers, staff with social work responsibilities, community health nurses,
Roma health mediators, school mediators, or school counselors). In the places with two to five
community workers, the most frequent combination involves one or more SPAS representatives (a
social worker and/or a staff member with social work responsibilities) and a community health nurse.




196
Apart from the community workers, communes with source communities also have informal support
groups for children and families in vulnerable situations, NGOs, and, in half of these communes, a
Community Consultative Structure (SCC). It is worth mentioning that the more social workers there are
in a commune, the greater the number of informal support groups and NGO service providers. In
those communities where the entire responsibility for social assistance rests on a single person from
the municipality, informal groups are rare (and are usually religious) while service providers are
virtually nonexistent. Thus, services, community workers, and informal support groups are unevenly
distributed even among the communes that contain source communities.
Figure 46 also shows the services that are available in these communities. As expected, the most
common are primary healthcare and education services (there is a school in each of these communes).
Next in line are ”Second Chance”-type services and day centers (43 and 42 percent of communes,
respectively). It should be mentioned that these services are usually provided in the neighboring town
or commune rather than in the commune included in the study, and transportation to these centers is
neither provided nor free in most cases. Daycare centers for children exist in one out of every ten
communes that we studied, but they are often just empty premises because they are unable to
operate due to lack of staff or funds or for some other reason. Overall, in the 60 communes that we
analyzed, only five centers are actually operational, with a total number of 28 employees serving
about 200 children. Even among these five centers there are striking differences - from a center with a
single employee and 17 beneficiaries, to one with 10 employees and 50 beneficiaries. This is mainly
why there is a limited number of referrals that SPAS employees make to daycare centers for children
from source communities.
A similar situation prevails in the case of ”School after School” services. Thirty percent of the 60
communes have this kind of service within the commune, or in a neighboring commune. However,
since transport to the neighboring commune is not provided and is usually not free, we considered
only those available within the commune. On that basis, only 10 of the communes that were analyzed
have ”School after School” services that serve an average of 20 to 30 kids (the minimum number is 3
and the maximum is 40), most of which are financially supported by an NGO. Only in two communes
are ”School after School” classes paid for by the local authorities, while the remainder are financed by
parents. As a result, these services are seldom available to children from source communities (the
most vulnerable). This explains the limited number of referrals to “School after School” services.
In conclusion, although the statistics in Figure 46 might paint a positive picture in terms of the
available services, the need for daycare services, which have the greatest impact in terms of
preventing child-family separation (and school dropouts), is not being met by the currently available
supply of services.

Making Prevention a Priority with Sufficient Funding
The previous chapter on structural causes showed that cash benefits, social services, education, and
health services are still ineffective in preventing child-family separation. In fact, certain deficiencies are
structural causes of children being separated from their families. All of these services need to be
strengthened, developed, and improved, both in terms of quantity and of quality, affordability, and
geographical distribution. While there are problems with supply, there are also problems with
demand, particularly because early identification and intervention services, which are by far the most
effective and least costly ways to prevent child separation, are missing or are only in the early stage of
development in all relevant sectors. Thus, communities cannot yet properly mitigate many of the risk
factors for child-family separation.

            Box 14: Early Intervention – the Key to an Effective Child Protection System

 The first form of early intervention seeks to counter the adverse effects of socioeconomic disadvantage by
 providing a rich and stimulating environment for children and ensuring that their parents have easy access to
 advice and support.
 The second form of early intervention aims to increase the involvement of all those working with children,
 young people, and families in observing and responding to low level signs of difficulty. A specific objective of
 the policy should be to motivate the contribution of several different services in helping children, young
 people, and their families.
 Professionals in universal services such as healthcare and education cannot and should not replace the
 function of social work, but they do need to be able to understand, engage with, and think professionally
 about the children, young people, and families with whom they are working. This necessarily entails trying to
 understand the circumstances of families and children at the point they seek help or when they are identified
 as needing help while using a service (such as education services, accident and emergency departments,
 during pre-and post-birth health visiting, during police visits to investigate an incident of violence, or drug and
 alcohol support). It also entails an understanding of what services social workers can be expected to provide.

The Romanian child protection system is incapable of preventing child-family separation, and
sometimes it wrongfully separates some children from their families. This is no surprise given the
context described in the previous sections. So the child protection system cannot and should not have
to make up for the inefficiencies of the social benefits system, the gaps in the education and health
care systems, the weak development of specialized services for people with disabilities and other
vulnerable groups, or the lack of policies and investments in social housing. Public care seems to be
called upon to mitigate the adverse effects that all of these shortcomings have on children. The
system is designed to be reactive and to be focused on solving “emergencies”. In Romania, five
siblings enter the system because the parents did not pay the electricity bill and the local authorities
or community bodies do not step in. Meanwhile three siblings enter the system because their mother
is beaten every day by her partner, but nobody intervenes to help her – not her neighbors, the police,
or other local stakeholders - so she has to run away but has nowhere to go with three children. A baby
only a few days old ends up in the system because his mom is evicted from a squalid social housing
room because she has not paid the rent for the previous three months. Other babies enter the system
because their mothers are accepted into maternity wards without IDs and they run away and
disappear after having their babies. Other children are admitted to hospital because their parents say
they cannot feed them and then leave. There are children who enter the system because they need ”a
place where they can die in peace, without being kicked out,” while others end up in public care
because they cannot attend a school in their community. There are children who enter the system
because their families cannot afford to feed them, and the municipality urgently calls the DGASPC
instead of intervening in the source communities and the marginalized areas because: “They are all

poor, all of them have nothing to eat, all of them are jobless and all of them lack electricity”255 and
”the end result would only be taking the children into public care.”256 This is a picture of public care
(the special protection system) as it currently exists – finding emergency solutions for the
shortcomings in other systems.
A first step towards building a good child protection system257 would be to shift the focus of the
system from ”emergency response” to ”preventing child-parent separation.” As the specialists
interviewed in our qualitative research said:
            “- Supposedly we work on prevention but, in fact, we do intervention, in crisis situations, because
            prevention would mean identifying those situations before they turn into a crisis, that is to work
            with those children who show some signs and who could end up in a crisis. Unfortunately,
            although we claim to be doing prevention, what we do is intervention. And we work on critical
            cases.
            - Exactly. Early identification and prevention - this is what’s missing. Prevention, so that we are
            not faced with situations we can no longer solve, or that we solve with a lot of effort. Better act
            before reaching that point.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

In the context of such extensive need and given the limited and deficient supply of services currently
on offer in communities, the only realistic and economically reasonable option is to focus on reducing
the number of entries into the system. At the same time, the deinstitutionalization process should be
continued, starting with the traditional institutions (those that have not been modernized), and
suitable family care alternatives should be found as permanent solutions for those children who are in
or will enter the system.
Infograph Chart 3 shows that the only way to shift the focus of the child protection system onto
prevention is to expand and strengthen all of the services discussed above at the community level.
Because these services are located within the community, they can act as a filter to reduce the number
of children entering the system as well as provide the support needed for the reintegration of children
with their families, thus increasing the number of exits from the system. For instance, if daycare
centers work well, then the likelihood of children from the community being separated from their
family decreases, and, at the same time, the chances of children in the system being reintegrated into
their families in a sustainable way increase. Therefore, developing community-based services is the
main way to improve the current state of affairs in the child protection system. Otherwise, if nothing
changes with regard to community services, the system will be unable to provide better solutions to
the problems faced by children and their families.

                 Box 15: Prevention Services Advocated for by DGASPC Managers

 Out of the 45 DGASPCs that participated in HHC Romania’s audit of Romanian social services, 42 DGASPC
 managers mentioned prevention services as the most useful tool for child protection. They highlighted the
 need to develop services aimed at preventing the child-family separation, in tandem with closing down
 traditional placement centers and continuing to develop family-type alternative care. Twenty-five DGASPCs are
 currently providing a wide range of prevention services in the form of daycare, recovery, and counseling
 centers, although this is not their responsibility under the current laws.

Two points need to be made. First, the child protection system has its own internal problems, which
are analyzed in Chapter 3.3. However, we focus here on change solutions, which are only partially
internal to the system. Many of the change solutions are to be found outside the system and are
related to coordination with other systems, such as the social assistance system, social benefits,
education, health, the labor market.
The second point is related to the fact that the change model presented above does not imply the
need to develop every kind of service in every remote hamlet. The previous sections made an
inventory of community-based services (including health and education) and highlighted those that
are most efficient in preventing child-family separation. Finding the necessary resources to fund these
services will require time, while some may need to be preceded by legal amendments. That is why it
would be useful to conduct a national assessment of existing services and to prioritize needed services
so that the available resources can be invested in the most efficient way to have the greatest positive
impact on the children and to be distributed geographically as fairly as possible.
This national assessment is even more necessary considering the overall picture illustrated by the
source communities. You will recall that, in the communes containing source communities, the
distribution of services, social workers, informal support groups, and NGO service providers tends to
follow the principle of St. Matthew: ”Whoever has, will be given more; whoever does not have, even
what they have will be taken from them.” This means that some of these communes have many
services and personnel, while in others all of these activities must be performed by a single SPAS staff
member with social assistance responsibilities. Nevertheless, source communities exist in both of these
kinds of communes. Therefore, we need to have a clearer understanding of the location and extent of
existing services in order to develop a national plan for the development of prevention services for
families and children.



                                                                                                           201
The most appropriate agency to lead the development of this national plan would be the ANPDCA,
which, in fact, already has such a project under preparation. However, it would need to draw up the
plan in close collaboration with the Family Policies Directorate and the Social Services Directorate
within the MMFPSPV, with the ANPD (National Authority for People with Disabilities), the Ministry of
Education, the Ministry of Health, the county institutions that provide methodological guidance for
services provided at the local level (the DGASPCs for the SPAS, the DSP for community healthcare, and
the CJRAE for school mediators), local authorities, and representatives of relevant associations such as
the Association of Communes, the Association of Towns in Romania, the Association of Municipalities
in Romania, and the National Federation of Local Action Groups. Romanian NGOs should also be
consulted as they are major service providers for children and families and have developed and
piloted projects that could be used as best practices and scaled up nationwide. All of these
stakeholders should agree on a single plan. Only a coordinated and mutually agreed plan developed
by such a wide-ranging partnership stands the chance of being successfully implemented in the
medium and long run.258
If local authorities are not mobilized, informed and involved throughout the process, there is a high
risk of the plan’s implementation being random and distorted. This is the view of the child protection
specialists interviewed for this study who made the following observations:
         “Preventing child-family separation is not on the political agenda, nor is it on the agenda of
         communes.” “There is no local community initiative.” “Preventing child relinquishment is not
         important to them. It is not important, they are not going to spend resources on it, it’s the
         problem of every family.” ”It is very clear, you will never find priorities related to these children in
         need on a mayor’s agenda. They have political priorities of a different kind: roads, schools, things
         that generate money.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

And the last element, which is just as important, is to ensure funding for the national plan for
developing prevention services for families and children. As explained above, the change model is not
limited to social services but covers a wide range of services and programs funded by various
ministries. Prevention activities are underfunded in all social fields, including education, healthcare,
and social assistance, because the focus tends to be on responding to emergencies and crises. This
approach opens the door for more and more children to get into difficulties and reach the point when
harm has already been done (the child has dropped out of school, the child suffers from health
conditions that could have been prevented by vaccines, or the child is separated from his or her
family). This is why promoting a national plan for developing prevention services should be supported
by the budgets of several ministries and agreed with the Ministry of Finance.
Many of the child protection specialists who participated in the qualitative study highlighted the need
to fund prevention services and activities and presented many arguments for this. One example is the
second quote from the previous Professionals’ Story Bag. Here are some more examples:
         ”The rights of a child. The first right of a child is to grow up with his natural family. So much is
         spent to provide all facilities in the centers. [...] and we give them everything that a child
         needs...but nothing is spent on prevention, so we are not ensuring their first right granted by law,
         that of living with their natural family.” (Focus group with professionals, Craiova)

         ”At the local level, the state, through the SPAS (the Public Social Assistance Service) could
         allocate enough human resources to manage these cases involving vulnerable families. Then,
         once you have the local human resources, at least two to three social workers depending on the
         size of the community, they need to be trained, to do their job, and to have enough financial
         resources, because it is sad to hear the state say that: ‘I don’t have money for social assistance,
         for prevention in the community, so I can’t pay anyone to prevent social cases.’ But, at the same
         time, the state pays for emergency support, for child care centers and protection services, for
         social welfare, so, at the end of the day, the state will give money anyway.” (Focus group with
         professionals, Brașov)



258
   With respect to actual service provision, our qualitative study highlighted a series of issues related to improving and
increasing the transparency and dissemination of the procedures for contracting social services, as well as ensuring fair
competition between NGOs and public institutions when accessing the available resources.

202
A 2013 HHC study259 also provides economic arguments in favor of the prevention model. The study
forecasted the costs that would be incurred by the child protection system up to 2020 according to
three policy scenarios: (i) a baseline scenario in which nothing changes; (ii) a moderate reform scenario
in which traditional residential centers are closed down between 2013 and 2020 and the children are
transferred to foster carers or family homes; and (iii) the deinstitutionalization and prevention scenario
involving the moderate reform plus investments in the development of community-based prevention
services, which is the model supported in this report. The results of the HHC study showed that, in
financial terms, although scenarios 2 and 3 incur higher initial capital investments, in time they allow
for recurrent savings that will exceed the costs. By 2020, the new prevention-centered system would
generate sustainable financial gains as well as benefits for children and their families (a significant
reduction in the number of entries into the system and in the number of children that are in the
system as well as improvements in the care services for children in the system). In other words, the
prevention-centered model is achievable and profitable, both in social and in financial terms.

3.2.5.5               Attitudes and Values that Do Not Support Preventing
                      Child-Family Separations
The structural causes of child-family separations also include some attitudes, values, customs, or
practices that act as barriers to preventing children’s separation from their family.
The first category of obstacles refers to the discrimination that continues to expose some vulnerable
groups to the risk of social exclusion. Although the situation has improved in recent years, the adult
population of Romania has shown a very low tolerance for 260 alcoholics, drug addicts, people with
criminal records, people suffering from HIV/AIDS, or LGBTQ people.
At the same time, Roma people are still the subject of discrimination based on their ethnicity.261 A low
level of tolerance and understanding is also shown to people with disabilities. The case managers that
we interviewed stated that labeling and prejudice prevent children with disabilities in the system from
being adopted or reintegrated.
The second category of obstacles refers to a high tolerance of harmful behavior such as alcohol abuse,
domestic violence, and begging. Although alcoholics are stigmatized, alcohol abuse is seen as normal
(even in the presence of children). Similarly, family violence is seen as common, with 60 percent of the
population tolerating violent behavior within the family as they believe that these acts are justified in
some situations or, depending on the context, in all situations.262
            ”Let me tell you something: in most villages everyone knows when a neighbor beats, abuses, or
            neglects his children on a regular basis. However, since poverty is ubiquitous, alcohol abuse is
            widely used and violence is perceived as ‘normal’ or an acceptable educational method, no one
            takes any measures in this respect. They say: we should focus on our family, and the others on
            theirs. However, when they fight, let’s say for a broken fence, they immediately remember that
            there is a social worker in the town hall to whom they can go and file a complaint. Or, even better,
            they use the Children’s Hotline and call the DGASPC, denouncing their neighbor’s ‘wrong’
            behavior. The conclusion is that we need more broken fences to defend the ‘invisible’ children.”

   The level of intolerance was measured by the share of the total population who stated that they would not be happy
to have someone from these categories as a neighbour. These data come from the European Values Study conducted in
2008.
261
   According to the European Values Study from 2008, 40 percent of the adult Romanians would not want to have a
Roma neighbor, which is two times higher than the percentage of people who would reject a neighbour with other
characteristics such as Muslims (23 percent), people of a different race (21 percent), immigrants (21 percent), or Jews (19
percent).

Physical punishment, although banned by law since 2004, is still widespread. Several recent studies
have shown that, in day-to-day family life, physical punishment is still used quite often,264 being
regarded as a ”necessary evil.”265 Many parents feel that it is a good way of educating their children266
because they are not aware of more positive methods.267 Children face several types of violences from
the adults who look after them, including neglect and physical, verbal, and/or psychological abuse,
both within the family and at school.268
The third category of obstacles, which is of major importance, is related to the tolerant attitude
towards child-parent separations shown by both the general population and the authorities. Some
child protection specialists explain that this attitude has historical roots and is closely related to the
undervaluation of children in Romanian society. The literature on child care and family separation269
reinforces this view while arguing that social acceptance of child-family separations is not specific to
Romania but is common in all former socialist bloc countries that promoted aggressive pro-birth
policies paired, in some countries like Romania, with pro-relinquishment policies.
In Romania, even now children are too often seen as a ”burden” or as a ”source of income” or as a
“risk,” not only by their families and communities but even by policymakers. According to a participant
in our focus groups with child protection professionals, “We are turning into a gerontocratic society,
which focuses a lot on those who have the power, people with the power of money, power of the
vote, power to be heard in society, while children remain an unheard voice, a silent voice, and they are
ignored.”270
            “I would like to add something which, in my opinion, is extremely important and which has been
            neglected, at least since I’ve been in child protection. We, as a nation, as people, as a country, we
            have a traumatizing history of separation. And we accept separation way too easily. So, within the
            community, very seldom do you have people who see the child-family separation as a tragedy or
            that the child’s life is somehow ruined. We have too much tolerance, and even the local
            authorities see them as a burden. So, on the one hand, in these disadvantaged areas the families
            accept the idea of separation way too easily and even when they decline it, they do so because
            the child is a potential source of revenue or of I don’t know what, so, in my opinion, in our
            country, children are not valued as they should be. We don’t have long-term thinking, so
            everyone tries to solve crisis situations, urgently, hastily, like putting out a fire, and we do not
            have a long-term vision of what will happen to that child in the future; what matters is for the
            local authority or the family or whoever has the 'problem' child to be rid of it, “problem” in a
            manner of speaking, because, most often, these children are perfectly healthy and a huge asset,
            but nobody sees that value anymore.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

The specialists say about some families and communities that they have turned child relinquishment
into a practice. The case file data shows that more than 3 percent of all children in public care have
between 5 to 10 siblings in the system, some of whom entered the system at different periods, which
means that there are families who constantly send a large number of children into the system. At the
same time, the fact that we were able to identify source communities reveals that there are some
areas where child-family separation is particularly common. For those families who are willing to make
“more babies than the DGASPC can take” and whose approach is “I make as many babies as I want




264
   The percentage ranges from 38 percent of parents who admit to the abuse and 63 percent of parents based on what
their children report, according to Grădinaru and Stănculeanu (2013).
265
      Thirty percent of parents, according to UNICEF (2014).
266
      Twenty percent of parents, according to Grădinaru and Stănculeanu (2013).
267
  For instance, 11 percent of parents immediately slap their children or pull them by the hair if they do something
wrong (UNICEF, 2014). According to the children, 18 percent say they were beaten with a stick, 13 percent with a belt,
and 8 percent with a wooden spoon in the previous year (Grădinaru and Stănculeanu, 2013).
268
   Eighty-three percent of children are scolded by teachers when they make a mistake, 33 percent are insulted and
labeled, and 7 percent of children say they are beaten by their teachers (Grădinaru and Stănculeanu, 2013).

and raise as many as I feel like,” 271 the specialists feel that the introduction of constraints or
conditionalities is required to discourage such behavior.
            “But if in two, three, four, five years I see that nothing has changed, with all the support and
            endorsement of the local community the family doesn’t want to do anything, some parents
            refuse. We have a parent who said that he will keep on having more babies than what we can
            accept in the system. What can I do in this case? We are not used to sanctioning this kind of
            parental behavior, we as an institution, and other child protection institutions. I don’t know how
            many institutions and how many DGASPCs in the country, when sending a file to court, also ask
            for the parent to be sanctioned. I mean, hello, the child was neglected, abused. At the end of
            [Law] 272 there are certain fines envisaged.
            So there are these sanctions in the law?

            Yes, there are. In a way, we are failing to observe the law because we don’t propose those
            sanctions. Because we think that these are social cases, they will never be able to pay for the
            sanction…but, in the community, they will be on town hall record as having been fined. And? If
            they don’t pay them, they’ll keep piling up. I don’t know how many of them have been arrested. I
            was thinking at some point that, for all these people that keep having babies […] we have to
            come up with a formula, one that would be accepted by judges as well as by us. (Interview with a
            professional, Bacău)

            “If we refer to teenagers, when the going gets rough and the parent can’t cope with everything,
            they come to us and say: he/she is not my responsibility. I’ve educated him/her so far, now the
            state should do it, or it should open correctional centers. So they will go to the police, to the
            child protection directorate, to the town hall and they feel that no one is solving their problem.
            At the same time, they don’t want any counseling, although this might be a good alternative. All
            they want is to get rid of the responsibility. (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca).

This kind of behavior by parents is often encouraged by the answers that they received from some
authorities or even specialists, like medical staff272 and is endorsed by the general idea, still quite
widespread, that “it’s normal for the state to raise my child.”
            “For 25 years we kept hearing that it’s alright to go on having babies because the state will take
            them and raise them, an idea which has not been counteracted by a new mainstream campaign
            to cancel this theory. People still believe that it is better to be in an institution than at home. And
            although there have been some campaigns like “Children’s homes are not at home,” they were
            feeble attempts compared to the intense pro-relinquishment propaganda promoted before
            1989.” (Focus group with specialists, Cluj-Napoca).

All these attitudes, beliefs, and practices have to be taken into account in all prevention efforts.
Community information and awareness campaigns that encourage tolerance for diversity should be
part of the development of community-based prevention services as a way of making them more
effective. These kinds of activities should target not only the general public but also staff in relevant
sectors and decision-makers.

3.2.6               Causes of Child-Family Separation from
                    the Perspective of Families and Specialists
The causes of child-family separations, analyzed in the previous five chapters, include concepts like
abuse, neglect, maltreatment, and poverty, which can be interpreted in different ways at different
moments in time, in different cultures, and by different people. For instance, poverty might have
different meanings for a child who entered the system at the beginning of the 1990s, and one who
entered it recently. Abuse and neglect were regulated by law only in 2004, so this cause might have
different meanings for children who entered the system before and after that year.
The main method used in the previous sections was to compare facts derived from the data in the
case files of children in public care with the causes of separation recorded by the DGASPC specialists.
However, we decided that it would also be useful to present additional perspectives on the causes of
separation, such as those of the stakeholders involved in the child-family separation process - mothers
and/or families, social workers or SPAS representatives, and DGASPC specialists. Our data on the rural
source communities gave us this opportunity. Figure 47 shows the results of the comparison.
There are striking differences among the responses of these three types of actors regarding the causes
of child-family separations, based on their level of education and their life experience. The mothers
and/or families and the SPAS representatives were making retrospective judgments whereas the
causes expressed by the DGASPC specialists were made at the time when the child entered the system,
so there is also a time delay between these different views.273
The share of cases with unknown or forgotten cause of separation according to SPAS representatives
is four times higher than that of cases with unknown or forgotten cause of separation according to
DGASPC specialists. This finding shows that, for 16 percent of children from source communities who
are in the system, no attempt at reintegration has been made at the community level since even the
main cause of child-family separation was already forgotten. Also, for 8 percent of these children, even
their own families have forgotten the reason for the separation.
Neither the families nor SPAS representatives made any reference to emotional abuse, sexual abuse,
or labor exploitation, including human trafficking or the sexual exploitation of the child, although they
were asked these questions directly. Child neglect and abuse were evaluations that were specific to
DGASPC professionals, whereas the families and the SPAS representatives tended to point to parental
behavior that led to the separation (parental risk factors) such as one or both of the parents leaving
the family or going abroad to work.
The situation is similar when it comes to SPAS/DGASPC/family views/justification regarding the “child
disability” main cause of separation, but here some parents and SPAS representatives added
comments regarding the lack of health, recovery, or educational services in the commune.
In terms of structural risk factors, for 15 percent of children in public care, the SPAS representatives
mentioned “inadequate housing conditions” as the main reason why the child is now in the state’s
care, whereas they seldom mentioned reasons like “poverty” or “too many children” (2 percent). The
assessments made by SPAS representatives are in line with those of mothers and/or families, who
referred to “families with many children who live off benefits in inadequate housing conditions.”274 The
DGASPC specialists tended to group these reasons under one label - “poverty” - without any
explanation or supporting data, to which they also added “housing problems” for 1 percent of
children from rural source communities.



273
    Mothers and/or families tended to offer a single reason (the main one) for the separation, whereas the SPAS
representatives sometimes mentioned several reasons related to the mother, most likely referring to her other children.
In the case files, DGASPC specialists mentioned between two and four causes of separation for some children.

Source: Social Assistance Data Sheets from Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data are not weighted
(for mothers/families, N=1,140 children in public care and for SPAS representatives, N=952 mothers from
households still in the commune). The DGASPC specialists’ assessments of causes come from the Survey of the
Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted (N=4,484 children from rural
source communities).
Note: For comparison purposes, the causes of separation taken from the case files have been regrouped in line
with the list of reasons used in the study on source communities. This is why some of the items used to identify
dysfunctional families (as defined in section 3.2.3.2) are included in the graph under “unfortunate events” instead
of under “individual (parental) risk factors.”

If we consider the three perspectives on the causes of separation for a given household, then we can
see that these causes overlap in a maximum 60 percent of the cases and are limited to the following:
(i) child disability, (ii) parental disability, (iii) imprisoned parents, and (iv) the mother and/or father
leaving home.




3.2.7                  So What Are the Causes of Separation?
The model275 that we used in analyzing the causes of child-family separation, which we elaborated on
in the previous sections, has four main components:
(1) The child might get separated from his or her family as a result of unfortunate events,276 such as
the death of a parent/parents or their institutionalization, whether in jail or in a social or a health
institution (for instance, a psychiatric hospital).
Apart from such unfortunate events, the reasons for separating a child from the family might also
include child maltreatment,277 including neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation or any form of family
violence. Child relinquishment in maternity wards or in other health units or abandonment on the
street or in a public space can be considered as extreme forms of neglect.278 This category also
includes the deprivation of parental rights, as shown in section 3.2.2.4, since all cases that specialists
categorized as being due to the deprivation of parental rights include file evidence of child neglect,
abuse, and/or exploitation.
 (2) At a more in-depth level, the model also considers the individual (parental) risk factors279 that can
lead to either violence or maltreatment of the child, such as parents leaving to work abroad,
dysfunctional families, teen pregnancies, alcohol and substance abuse, promiscuous behavior,
problems with the police or criminal record, domestic violence, and parental disability and/or mental
health problems.
 (3) We analyzed five categories of children at risk280 when entering public care: (i) infants (0 to 12
months) born prematurely and/or underweight; (ii) children with disabilities; (iii) children aged 6 to 17
years with special educational needs (SEN); (iv) children with developmental delays; and (v) children
aged 7 to 17 years with behavioral problems. We found that the disproportionate risk of being
separated from their families and entering public care to which these categories of children are
exposed stems either from parental risk factors or from structural risk factors.
(4) The model also looks at structural risk factors,281 which include: (i) poverty and the existence of
source communities; (ii) a lack of, the poor development of, or the poor coordination of prevention
services and activities in all relevant sectors (including social benefits, housing, general education and
healthcare services, and social services targeting specific vulnerable groups) in the community; and (iii)
attitudes, values, and general practices that do not support the prevention of child-family separations
and may even encourage them.

Infograph Chart 4 shows a chart of the model used to analyze the causes of child-family separation.
The model states that a child can be deprived of parental care only in certain circumstances that are
represented by the category called reasons. Child relinquishment, for instance, is a fact and a reason
for separation, but it has some underlying causes. These causes of separation can be broken down
into three major categories. At the individual level, these are risk factors that lead to parental behavior
that are likely to harm the child’s health, development, or life, and categories of children with some
features that make them vulnerable to a high risk of separation from their family. The third category at
the level of the community and society consists of structural risk factors related to the general social
and economic environment.
This multi-level analysis model takes a bottom-up approach. Structural risk factors can trigger
individual-level factors (related to the parent and/or child) which, in turn, become the reasons for the
child entering the system. Moreover, structural factors can work both ways. They can foster child-
family separation through the individual-level factors, but at the same time they can ensure or prevent
the conditions necessary to reintegrate children into their families and communities. For example, the
likelihood of a child with disabilities being separated from their family increases if the community
does not have accessible and appropriate recovery services. At the same time, the likelihood of a child
with disabilities who is currently in the system returning to their family or being adopted decreases if
the community does not have accessible and appropriate recovery services. This dual influence of the
structural factors is also presented in Infograph Chart 4. The number of children in public care cannot
be significantly reduced and children’s rights cannot be fully respected as long as prevention services
to address these risk factors are not available at the community level.
No single risk factor is sufficient to explain any given cause of separation (or reason for the child’s
entry into the system) such as child abuse or neglect. For example, if one or both of a child’s parents
are alcohol abusers, it is not a given that they will abuse their child or abandon him or her in a public
space. Only a combination of individual and structural risk factors (usually alongside other
determinants that have not been included in the model)282 can determine child relinquishment,
neglect, abuse,283 and other reasons for entering the system. Also, protective factors must be factored
in as well, such as the support of the extended family or the good relationship that a child might have
with their grandmother, which are not included in the model given that its focus is on the causes of
separation.
This is exactly why it should not be possible (at least in theory) for a child to enter the system only
based on the risk factors (individual and/or structural) or on some characteristics that the child might
have. Reasons like “mom and dad didn’t have any accommodation and didn’t have money to support
me” should not exist in a good child protection system. Nor in a good protection system would a child
with SEN have to enter the system just so he or she can go to school. Also, cases like the one in which
the five siblings ended up in the system because the parents did not pay the electricity bill should not
exist. It is clear that the baby that was placed in the system because his mother was evicted from a
social housing unit was wrongfully separated from her. Cases like the child with a moderate disability
who went into the system because his family did not accept him should also not exist.
In other words, all cases in which children go into the system because of flaws in various systems or
because certain services do not exist or cannot be accessed or because of stigmatization and/or other
prejudices are wrongful family separations. In the diagram in Infograph Chart 4, the three entry routes
(arrows) into the system that are only based on risk factors (either individual or structural) or on child
characteristics are considered to be avoidable, meaning their numbers must be decreased in order to
improve the child protection system. None of these routes can be completely eliminated since they all
exist even in the most developed societies. For instance, for children with severe disabilities who
require palliative care, facilities should exist to provide them with appropriate care, and maybe these
services cannot be provided at the county level, but can be provided at the regional level. At the same
time, separating a child from the family on social grounds cannot always be avoided, and it is not even

recommended when the family and/or local community do not take responsibility for their children.
However, gradually reducing the numbers of children entering public care via these three entry routes
would be a good indicator that the reform of the system is going in the right direction.
It was not possible for us to carry out a rigorous testing using as benchmark a control group of
children living with their families with characteristics similar to those of the children in public care.
However, based on this model, we were able to analyze the data in the case files of children in public
care using only the factual data contained in the case files, without the DGASPC specialists’
assessments of the causes of separation.
In total, for 76 percent of children in public care, the case files mentioned one or more reasons for
separation: unfortunate events (the death or institutionalization of a parent/parents), neglect, abuse,
or exploitation, child relinquishment, and/or the deprivation of parental rights. The other 24 percent of
the children were avoidable entries (Infograph Chart 4), whose case files contained no references to
any of these reasons for separation. However, their case files did refer to parental risk factors (12
percent) or the child's special needs (5 percent) or the child’s entry into the system was strictly due to
structural factors (7 percent). Table 33 shows the distribution of children based on factual data in the
case files related to the reasons and/or causes (risk factors) of their separation from the family.
        “What are the main reasons for separating a child from the family?
        - The first one is the economic context. The second, in my opinion, as someone who goes in the
        field and knows what’s happening there, is the fact that there are no prevention programs. And
        it’s true that I am the only forensic doctor around here, there’s almost no…and I know what I’m
        saying…no prevention program. The law states that the management plan should be prepared by
        the social worker in the commune. Well, the one in the commune usually calls and says “Come
        here, because I have five families” or picks up the phone when there is an emergency to say:
        “Come here, because they are killing each other; come and take them away!” Or the maternity or
        neonatology wards, or the pediatric hospitals, since we were talking about hospitals; kids are
        born and parents disappear. Or they go there because it’s winter, the kids stay and the parents
        leave. These are the main entry routes. There are also others, but as the most visible areas, these
        are the main entry routes.” (Focus group with professionals, Bucharest)

Table 33 and Figure 50 support the analysis of the DGASPC specialists regarding the causes of child-
family separations as does the above quote drawn from one of the focus groups organized under the
qualitative research. It is clear that the first priority must be to tackle the structural factors that cause
children to be separated from their families, such as poverty and inadequate housing (including a lack
of housing, evictions, and a lack of social housing units) while at the same time developing the
necessary community-level prevention services and response. These structural factors are poorly
documented in the children’s case files. For instance, the available data indicate that most children in
public care come from families that are poor or at risk of poverty and living in inadequate housing
conditions. The answers given by parents and SPAS representatives from the rural source communities
in our qualitative research confirmed these statistical results. Despite this, the factual data in the case
files show that these structural factors applied to only 36 percent of children in care (Figure 49).
However, it is exactly these structural factors that play a key role in keeping the “entry gates” to the
system wide open because they often lead to child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation and
relinquishment, especially in maternity wards, but also in other health units or public spaces (see Table
33).

Let us now take a closer look at the "entry gates" into the system in the context of our model of the
causes of child-family separation that is described above and is illustrated in Infograph Chart 4.
Child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation are documented in the case files of 44 percent of children in
public care (Table 33). Those cases where the parents were deprived of their parental rights are
included in the category of child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation. The most common is child
neglect (41 percent), which is associated with several parental risk factors, especially with alcohol or
substance abuse, being a teenage mother when giving birth (not necessarily when the child goes into
the system), and dysfunctional families.284 Children from all risk categories entered the system for this
reason, especially those aged between 0 and 17 years with developmental delays.
Child relinquishment is listed in the case files of 29 percent of children in public care (Table 33). It
usually takes place in a maternity ward or neonatology unit immediately after birth (24 percent) and is
associated with a wide range of parental risk factors, predominantly teenage mothers and parents
with disabilities and/or mental health problems. The categories of children at risk include children with
disabilities and/or developmental delays, as well as infants (aged 0 to 12 months) born prematurely
and/or underweight. Figure 50 shows that for these children there is an even more striking absence of
both preventive services in the community and support from kinship networks, NGOs, and informal
groups.
The unfortunate events that most commonly causes children to end up in public care is parental
imprisonment, but case files also offer many risk factors with which this is associated.
Avoidable entries on grounds of child disability (5 percent) refer both to children with physical
disabilities and to those with developmental delays. Most of these files also refer to various parental
risk factors. However, the qualitative research revealed that for some of these cases (we cannot
quantify how many) there is a lack not only of preventive services in the community (only 33 percent
of these cases received them, according to Figure 50) but also, more importantly, of appropriate
recovery and educational services for these children.
Avoidable entries on social grounds refer mainly to dysfunctional families and/or teenage mothers
when giving birth. The case files do not provide further data to enable a clearer understanding of the
context that leads to these child-family separations, particularly as almost all of these children were
taken directly from their families or from relatives.

    As shown in section 3.2.3.2, dysfunctional families are defined in this report as families in which one or more of the
following events have occurred: divorce, separation, infidelity, parental disinterest, desertion of family (other than going
abroad), single-parent family, unacknowledged paternity, and birth out of wedlock.

Based on the existing data, one can only speculate that the children were not wanted or were rejected
by their family or that the family was unable to create an environment that would foster the
development of the child, given the parents’ disabilities, in the absence of community-based support
and recovery or rehabilitation services for adults.
The avoidable entries on social grounds related to poverty and/or inadequate housing are actually
those case files that contained no useful information. This was the case for 7 percent of the children in
public care. Even the data on income and housing conditions provided information on only 68 percent
of these children (Figure 50).
Although entries in the public care system evolved over time depending on the reason for entering,
Figure 50 (bottom graph) shows that avoidable entries represented roughly a quarter of all entries
irrespective of the reference year. One big change was the reversal in incidence of relinquishment and
child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation, which occurred after 2004 when the regulations on child
neglect, abuse, and exploitation came into force. After the global crisis years, as of 2011, an increase
can be seen in the percentage of children who entered the system via relinquishment-related routes
and a decrease in the number of those separated from their families because of violence against the
child.
There are striking differences among counties as well (Figure 50, top graph). Child neglect, abuse,
and/or exploitation are documented in the case files of 61 percent of children in public care from
Vrancea county, but only for about a quarter of children in Covasna and for about one-third of those
in Harghita, Olt, Sibiu, Vâlcea, and Arad. Similarly, child relinquishment is a major problem, affecting
40 percent of children in public care in the counties of Bihor, Sibiu, Harghita, and Vâlcea but only 10 to
15 percent of children in Gorj and Suceava. Avoidable entries also vary, from a minimum of 14 percent
in Caraș-Severin to a maximum three times higher (42 percent) in Gorj county. There might be several
reasons for these differences. For example, counties may face different issues related to child-family
separation or the training of the local DGASPC staff who filled out the case files may vary, as well as
their attitudes towards a case file and how they see, for instance, neglect and/or abuse or poverty.
Overall, out of all of the issues considered in Table 33, more than two-thirds (65 percent) of case files
have three to eight possible causes that lead to child-family separation. In other words, there are
several vulnerabilities that most children in public care and their families are faced with before the
child enters the system, which actually confirms what was found in previous studies.285 In the absence
of a clear methodology and a work algorithm, every DGASPC chooses a main cause of separation from
a wide range of possible causes, and this is later also used in the ANPDCA official reports. The
relationship between the causes of separation as derived from the model proposed in this chapter
(based on factual data in the case files) and the officially stated causes is presented in Table 34 below.
Table 34 shows that the practices used to select and state the causes of separation are, usually,
associated with the factual data in case files. However, there are also inconsistencies. For instance, in
30 percent of cases with social causes related to poverty and/or inadequate housing the specialists
provided different justifications (usually the death of the parents or child neglect, abuse, and/or
exploitation), which are not apparent from the factual information in the file. Also, the DGASPC
specialists overuse poverty as a cause, even when there is evidence of child neglect or abuse or of the
death of the child’s parents. Maybe the overuse of “poverty” as a cause of separation is encouraged by
it being listed among eligible justifications, unlike relinquishment. However, in Romania there are
almost 1.3 million children living in households at risk of monetary poverty and even more who are
affected by severe material deprivation. Most of them live in households so poverty cannot be the
only reason for separating the child from the family but must be just one aspect of a wider set of
circumstances that also includes individual risk factors as well as a lack of proper support from the
community and/or from the child’s kinship network or other relevant stakeholders.

information
Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=52,344).
Note: *Unfortunate events refer to death or institutionalization of a parent/parents. The sum of percentages in
each column exceeds 100 percent because two to four causes were sometimes mentioned for a child. The colored
cells show percentages that are significantly higher.

It is difficult to identify the main reason why a child entered the system, especially if no prevention or
support measures were taken for the family or child within the community. This is why the outcome is
often more visible than the cause. For instance, here is an example of this child who ran away from
home. “The eldest started to do this when he was 12 and kept doing it until 14, when he ended up in
the system” (Interview with a professional, Bacău). The case got the attention of the local institutions -
“he kept running away from the family, the police would find him and take him back home,” but the
child’s vulnerabilities remained invisible to the social worker, the doctor, and the teacher in the
commune. “This lasted for about two years, until [the mother] took the child to DAS, the Social
Assistance Directorate, because he was going to influence the other two [children] at home. ’I can’t
take care of him anymore; I don’t know what else to do.’ The family felt it was more than they could
handle so the child came into the system.” (Interview with a professional, Bacău).
Subsequent to the child entering the system, with regard to the causes, this case was associated with
poverty. “They live in a consensual union, they all share a single room, the father leaves to work, luckily,
he works… in Bucharest, in Brașov… and the mother stays home with the children. Shortages, they
don’t always have food or othe things they need” (Interview with a professional, Bacău). In other cases
in which the child ran away from home, the specialists attributed this to a lack of parental skills for
dealing with teenage issues, irrespective of whether the family was poor or not. “Other separation
issues arise at the age of 12 to 13 when the child leaves home. They leave home, run away with their
luggage, become vagrant, so the family can’t deal with this and they contact the authorities”
(Interview with a professional, Bacău). In all of these cases of teenagers with behavioral problems that
were mentioned during the interviews, there was a combination of factors, including the parents’ low
level of education (and lack of parental skills), dysfunctional families, many children in the family,
monetary poverty, precarious housing conditions, and no proper support within the community.
Sometimes, there was also the use of physical punishment against the children or the parents’ alcohol
abuse and/or poor health. Out of all these, different specialists, or sometimes even the same specialist,

216
select one main cause that is recorded in the child’s case file. In other words, the same type of
situation is recorded and reported differently with no logical reason. Even so, none of these so-called
causes are either necessary or sufficient to explain why the child ran away from home; only the entire
set of factors can reveal the whole story of the child’s situation.
Since most cases of child-family separation involve a range of vulnerabilities, the DGASPC specialists
need an information management model to help them decide on the main cause for separation. The
analysis model proposed in this chapter could serve this purpose. It would mean that the official
reasons for the separation would be stated in the case files together with a thorough factual
documentation of all the dimensions suggested in the model: parental risk factors, child's special
needs, and structural factors. Figure 51 shows what the statistics on the causes for entering public care
would look like (how they would change), both for the entire population of children aged 0 to 17 and
for children under the age of 3, if the proposed analysis model were to be applied.
The adoption of this kind of model at the national level would not only change the statistics but would
also show the deeper causes of child-family separations, which would help Romania to work towards
improving its child protection system in accordance with principles shown in Box 1. Moreover, this
model would send a message that child relinquishment is a national problem rather than continuing
to use “poverty” as a justification for child-family separations.
To avoid stigmatizing parents, which is anyway emphasized sufficiently, every child’s situation should
be documented according to the whole range of risk factors, both individual and structural, on the
basis of a methodology for identifying and understanding the complex causes of separation. This
methodology should be applied nationwide in a consistent way to all children and their families. Also,
to avoid the possibility of “relinquishment” becoming an empty label, the list of structural factors
needs to be supplemented with a list of all the types of interventions and services received by the
family and child before the child entered the system.

CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
Analyzing the causes of child-family separation is extremely important because different causes call for
different responses. Consequently, in order to understand the needs and the history of a child before
preparing an appropriate individualized protection plan, it will be essential to implement Government Decision
691/2015, which lays out a working methodology for the collaboration between the DGASPCs and the SPAS as
well as a standard model of documents to be used by both agencies. This methodology includes tools to
capture the full range of risks and causes of separation by DGASPCs and by SPAS throughout Romania. Using
this methodology based on the analysis model presented in this section would require specialists to:

- State the reason(s) for the child-family separation (to be used when drafting the official ANPDCA report);
- Conduct a full and systematic assessment of all parental risk factors and check if the child have special needs;

- Document all structural factors by providing complete data on income, housing, community of origin, service
plan available before entering the system, services received in the community, and support received in the
community from relevant stakeholders;
- Extensively justify all avoidable entries by indicating the types of services or activities that are not available
within the community such as recovery services or other services for people with disabilities or vulnerable
groups and inclusive education (see section 3.2.5.4)

The cause analysis would then be used as input for an individualized protection plan (PIP) that would include
not only the services that should be provided to the child in public care, but also a plan for how the SPAS at
the community level should work with the child’s mother or family.
Also, the analysis would underlie the budget required to implement the services/iinterventions envisaged in
the plan.
This methodology should be part of an IT information management system available both to DGASPC
specialists and to SPAS representatives as pilot projects have demonstrated that this can be functional and
effective. The IT tool would help specialists by simplifying procedures and reducing bureaucracy while at the
same time making it possible: (i) to have one unified approach at the national level; (ii) for SPAS and DGASPC
specialists to coordinate their activities in real time; (iii) to monitor the activities performed by all relevant
stakeholders; and (iv) to provide the ANPDCA with enough data to swiftly adjust the regulations, programs,
and measures on the basis of sound evidence.

Moreover, the analysis of existing services (particularly deficient/scarce ones) would become available to local
authorities, and, once aggregated at the county and national levels, could be shared with the relevant county
and central authorities. In this way, the need for more services that would reduce the number of children
entering the system and increase the number of children leaving the system would become more visible and
measurable.

It is absolutely vital that sufficient financial resources are made available to enable the local authorities and
service providers to intervene consistently and on time and to develop community-based prevention services.
Only in this way will there be early and targeted interventions capable of preventing situations in which risk
factors can accumulate until they reach a crisis.

”Do you like the rooms you are in? Would you like for
something to change?
- No.
- I would: the windows and the bars. To remove the bars and
put insulated glazing windows.
But what do you have against the bars?
- I don’t know.
- The windows are really old, the wind blows through the sides and it’s cold during the night.
And the bars? Why do they bother you?
- If someone wants to throw me something, I can’t catch it. There’s not enough room for my
hands to go through.
- I don’t want anything to change. We have bars, too, but we are ok with them, we even like
them.
Why?
- Because for us, having bars is like a game. A role play. For instance, I`m the duck and you`re
the drake. We have this team game. We have two teams, one on each side, two flags and
two jails. We all have to fight to get the flag of the other team and win. And if caught, you
are thrown in jail. And in summer we have many competitions. At school, during the
'Different Week,' which is now, in April, I run. I ran in other races and came second. This kind
of strategy game.
- And if we have bars, they can’t jump and, God forbid, harm themselves. There are also
younger kids who could jump and break their neck or hit their head.”

This section discusses the key issues related to life within the child protection system in Romania. The
analysis is organized into five subsections as follows: (i) moving the child from the family into public
care; (ii) the types of children in public care; (iii) the children’s individualized protection plans (PIPs);
(iv) length of time children spend in the system; and (v) children’s opinions about the quality of care
that they receive.


3.3.1                Moving from the Family into the Child
                     Special Protection System
This subsection analyses how children actually entered the system. The analysis refers to the entries of
children who were in public care in November-December 2014. The total number of entries is higher
than the number of children because about 3 percent of children in public care have had multiple
entries (between two and four).
There are three main ways in which the DGASPC can be informed about a child who may need to be
taken into the protection system: (i) the SPAS (responsible for 24 percent of all entries according to
the children’s case files); (ii) other institutions, mostly maternity wards or neonatal units (30 percent);
and (iii) the child’s family (28 percent of all entries). Many specialists claim that family notifications are
not so frequent because “no one wants to denounce themselves for not observing their own child’s
rights.”286 In addition, the DGASPC can take its own initiatives (“we take the initiative most often on
cases highlighted in the media or by the community”287), and notifications can be made by other
people and also by the children themselves, for instance through the Child’s Hotline or by going
directly to the DGASPC. DGASPC initiatives, notifications made by other people and, especially,
notifications made by children account for very small shares, while 6 percent of all entries are not
documented in the case files.
Figure 52 (top graph) shows that referrals from SPAS, after increasing during the first part of the 1990s,
declined between 1998 and 2001 and then increased again, reaching 27 percent of the entries in 2014.
Referrals from other institutions followed the maternity ward relinquishment trend, plummeting from
70 percent to 31 percent of the entries during the 1990s, then increasing at the beginning of 2000
only to decrease again steadily until 2011. At that time, the trend was upward, reaching 35 percent in
2014. Requests from families increased during the first part of the 1990s, then reached a stable level in
1997 at about 30 percent of the entries (27 percent in 2014). The shares of other sources of
notification were consistently low. However, notifications made by other people have been slightly
increasing in recent years, which was highlighted by DGASPC specialists during the interviews when
talking about awareness raising and involving the population in reporting cases of child abuse. It is
worth mentioning that the percentage of entries that are not documented in the case files tends to
remain at a rather constant level, irrespective of the year.
Figure 52 (bottom graph) also shows striking differences from one county to another with respect to
children entering public care. The share of SPAS referrals varies from a minimum of 11 percent of the
entries (in Dolj) to a maximum that is three times higher (38 percent of all entries in Suceava).288 The
percentage of referrals made by institutions is correlated with that of cases of relinquishment in
maternity wards, ranging from 9 percent of the entries (in Gorj county) to a maximum almost five
times higher (42 to 44 percent of all entries in Dolj, Sibiu, Harghita, and Bihor counties).

  SPAS referrals represent more than one-third of all entries in other counties from Moldavia, too, such as Bacău,
Neamț, and Vrancea.

Requests made by families range from a minimum of 15 percent of all entries in Constanța county289
to a maximum of 49 percent in Gorj county, more than three times higher. The share of entries carried
out on the DGASPCs’ own initiatives is twice the national average in the counties of Gorj, Vaslui, and
Satu-Mare (9 to 10 percent) but almost ten times higher than that of counties like Caraș-Severin (with
only 1 percent of all entries at the county level). Similarly, notifications received from third parties
represent only 2 percent of all entries at the county level in Satu-Mare but 14 percent in Arad, 12
percent in Galați, 11 percent in Prahova, and 10 percent in Botoșani and Dâmbovița. The percentage
of entries that are not documented in the case files also varies, from a minimum of 2 percent of all
entries in Vâlcea county to a maximum of 22 percent in Bistrița-Năsăud.
Annex 6 Table 37 presents a profile of cases specific to each type of referral. SPAS referrals relate
specifically to children aged 3 to 14 from families with a stable accommodation who were looked after
by relatives or were left home alone after their parent(s) left. A large number of cases notified by the
SPAS were for families who received prevention and/or support services in the community before the
child entered the system.290 The most frequent cases notified by the SPAS were related to child
neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation, especially in the context of parental alcohol abuse and/or the
existence of an adult in the household other than the parents who behaved promiscuously, had
problems with the police, and/or had a criminal record.
The DGASPCs’ own initiatives included children of all ages, especially those relinquished in pediatric
units, abandoned on the street or in public places, or from families with no stable dwelling or a place
to live or families comprised of single-mothers who were institutionalized. However, most cases in
which DGASPC took its own initiative related to cases of child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation,
from families with a stable accommodation, with parental alcohol or substance abuse, in other words,
exactly the same cases as notified by the SPAS, except that these families had not received any
services or support in the community before the child entered the public care system.
A possible explanation for this overlap between the many cases that the DGASPCs took up on their
own initiative and the typical cases notified by the SPAS could be the fact that SPAS have a practice of
referring cases to the DGASPC without taking any preliminary steps. According to the current
regulations, the social worker in the community is supposed to identify cases of children at risk
together with a mixed (multidisciplinary) team, to assess them, and discuss them with the Community
Consultative Structure (SCC).291 Together the SCC and the SPAS are expected to find the best solution
given the local context, prepare a service plan, and then provide the child and the family with the
services needed to prevent their separation (information and family counseling at a minimum). The
DGASPCs are supposed to be the last resort for use only if the community-level intervention fails. The
previous section 3.2.5.4 on social assistance services in the community has already shown how
infrequently and ineffectively these methodological norms are implemented. The community social
worker is often just a person with multiple duties and limited knowledge in the field, while
multidisciplinary teams hardly exist outside the DGASPCs, SCCs were set up only in some localities,
and the service plan and prevention services are poorly implemented and underdeveloped. According
to the DGASPC specialists, this is why many cases are not “handled” at the community level and why
SPAS emergency referrals are used more and more: “the social referent immediately makes a referral
to our institution [DGASPC], which intervenes within 24 hours after the referral, and within 72 hours
there is also an initial full case assessment.” (Focus group with professionals, Focșani).




289
  Also in Bacău and Neamț counties, requests made by the families account for less than 20 percent of all entries in the
county.
290
   However, although above the average, the families who received prevention services prior to their children entering
the system represent only 39 percent of all entries notified by the SPAS, while those who received community support
amounted to 16 percent.
291
   Law 272/2004 and Government Decision 49/2011 introduced an obligation for local authorities to create informal
support groups for social protection activities to identify community needs and solve social issues related to children at
the local level. The members of these SCCs should be local decision-makers like the mayor/deputy mayor, the secretary
of the municipality, social workers, doctors, police officers, school representatives, and priests.

            ”Quite often, the social worker is also the case manager. Yes, they are everything. The case
            manager should have a team, but he/she is both social worker and case manager… Yes, they have
            to work with the police, the school, the doctor, the municipality… and with third parties, the
            neighbors who know the situation. But without the involvement of all stakeholders… we go there
            with our own team.” (Focus group with professionals, Iași)

            ”Truth be told, there is a huge responsibility on the social worker who collects the data for the
            initial assessment. Because he/she is the one that proposes the case and does field assessment,
            there is no mixed team; maybe they get some help from colleagues… But in local communities,
            the social worker goes, discusses, analyses, and… well, he/she suggests some protection
            measures, and then the case goes before the Commission of the Child Protection Directorate, or
            the courts, if we speak of emergency placement.” (Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)

            ”We go back again to the specialized public services, to the social worker from the commune.
            The law says that the person in charge with drafting the management plan is the social worker at
            the commune level. Well, this social worker picks up the phone and calls the Child’s Phone
            emergency line: Please come, we have an emergency, take him/her. And the child is taken. In 50
            percent of the cases, that child should not be separated from the family, because that is his/her
            family.” (Focus grup with professionals, Bucharest)

            ”But the mayoralties and the institutions play fast and loose, they come to us with the emergency.
            So if we do the math and consider all things, in the past years I think a share of, I don’t want to
            exaggerate because I don’t have any statistics, but I think that only 10 percent of the cases get to
            us after an attempt to deliver some services to keep the child with the family. No, most of them
            get here as an emergency and we are caught off guard. Why? After you placed your child in care
            you can no longer…, the family is no longer motivated unless they really couldn’t keep the child.”
            (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

Actually, several DGASPC specialists mentioned during the qualitative study that they have to take
over some of the responsibilities of local SPAS, either because they are understaffed or because local
councils or mayors are not all that interested in social issues. In every county there are municipalities
that are supportive of the identification and prevention of child-family separation risks, but also
municipalities “with which we have a disastrous collaboration, who hang up on us, who wouldn’t even
talk to us.”292
            ”Well, the fact that when I ask [SPAS] for a social assessment to identify the relatives, their answer
            is that they could not find the family at the residence address. All of the letters we had from them
            said: ‘not found at the place of residence.’ Well, I don’t believe this, if you have 10 people living in
            that household, how can you not find anyone at home? And how come I can always find
            someone there?” (Interview with a case manager, Craiova)

As can be seen in Annex 6 Table 37, referrals from other institutions usually involve babies aged 0-12
months relinquished in maternity wards or other health institutions (62 percent of referrals).
Premature and/or underweight babies stand a higher chance of being referred to the DGASPC. Of all
premature and/or underweight babies, 67 percent entered the public care system following a
notification made by health institutions. Also very likely to be referred by health institutions are babies
whose mothers/parents have disabilities and/or mental problems.
Requests from families usually involve children aged 3 years or older from families with a stable
accommodation or who are being looked after by relatives (Annex 6 Table 37). In this category, there
was a very large number of cases that could be seen as avoidable entries293 that were mostly due to a
lack of effective community services to help families cope with their issues and stay together. Out of
all of these avoidable entries, half were requests from the family and a quarter were notifications from
the SPAS.294 The parental risk factors associated with the family`s request to place the child in public
care were dysfunctional families, the parent(s) leaving to work abroad, and the existence of an adult
other than the mother/parents in the household with disabilities and/or mental health problems.

292
      Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca.
293
      See Infograph Chart 4 from previous section 3.2.7.
294
  The other quarter were notifications from other institutions (7 percent), other people (7 percent), or the DGASPCs’
own initiative (4 percent). For 7 percent of the avoidable entries, there was no information on who referred the case.

224
The profile of cases notified by other people is similar to that of the cases notified by the SPAS.
Most requests from children come from those aged 7 to 17 years who were exposed to abuse and
exploitation in their families, who have a stable accommodation, live in poverty, and are characterized
by multiple parental risk factors, especially alcohol and/or substance abuse, dysfunctional families, and
parents who are working abroad and/or have disabilities and/or mental health problems. Out of all
children who requested to be placed in public care, those in the 7 to 17 age group with behavioral
problems are over-represented. It should be mentioned that the statistical data do not support the
impression given by the qualitative study that children with behavioral problems enter the system
primarily at their parents’ request. Thus, the largest percentage of children with behavioral problems
entered the system following a notification made by a SPAS (32 percent) or another institution (34
percent), and only one in ten entered public care at the request of their family or following the
notification of another person. The requests made by children represent 2 percent of all children with
behavioral problems who entered the system. This percentage might seem small, but it is more than
10 times higher than that of all other children in public care.
When it comes to removing the child from the family, there are clear methodological norms. For
children with a stable accommodation, after the DGASPC has received a notification related to the
case: “a team from the Office for entries and exits immediately goes there [to the child’s location]. If
the situation is of high risk, they might even go there at night; it doesn’t matter when, the team is
ready and available to go at any time. First, we have a field visit and an initial assessment. We listen to
and involve the municipality, the SPAS, the local authority, and based on the initial assessment, a
solution is proposed. That is, whether the child can still stay with the family, and we will monitor them
with the municipality, or if he/she has to be immediately removed. During this initial assessment, we
gather information from all social stakeholders, we search for relatives down to the fourth degree,
who could get involved to prevent the child-family separation, but this depends on the case. After all
these options are exhausted, the child is placed in a public care service depending on his/her age and
health. If it’s an emergency, the child is immediately removed or, if need be, a president’s ordinance295
is issued.” (Interview with a professional, Bacău)
The decision to separate a child from the family may be taken: (i) by the DGASPC director, in cases
requiring emergency intervention; (ii) by a court; (iii) by the Child Protection Commission (CPC); or (iv)
based on a presidential ordinance, in cases requiring emergency intervention.296
If, following their review, the DGASPC representatives conclude that there are sound reasons to
believe the child is in a high-risk situation involving abuse and neglect, and unless there is no
opposition from the child’s caretakers, the DGASPC director establishes an emergency placement
measure.
If the child’s caretakers refuse or hinder, in any way, the assessments conducted by the DGASPC
representatives and the DGASPC has good reasons to believe the child is in a high-risk situation
involving abuse and neglect, the DGASPC petitions the court for a presidential ordinance for
emergency placement.
Emergency placements are also enforced for children relinquished in hospitals if they are in good
health and can be discharged.297 Figure 53 shows that children are placed in public care based on a
decision of the DGASPC director 20 times more often than based on a presidential ordinance (40
percent versus 2 percent of all entries). The explanation given by the DGASPC specialists for this
outcome is that, when they go to see the families, they do so together with the police.


295
      The presidential ordinance is a temporary order for emergency placement which is followed by a court ruling.
296
    Article 94, paragraph 3 of Law 272/2004 introduces two conditions both of which need to be met in order for a
presidential ordinance to be issued for an emergency placement. These are: (i) the people who are looking after the
child have rejected or hindered the assessments conducted by DGASPC representatives, and (ii) there must be solid
evidence of an imminent danger to the child, as a result of child abuse and neglect. See http://legeaz.net/spete-
civil/plasament-in-regim-de-urgenta-950-2009 (in Romanian).

     Government Decision 1103/12.10.2014 introduced several methodological clarifications regarding children
relinquished in maternity wards or other health institutions. See the Official Gazette of Romania no. 37/January 16, 2015.

        ”We are quite resourceful these days and we don`t need too many presidential ordinances
        because we team up with the police. When the child is at risk and our team goes with the police,
        the parents tend to take one step back and don’t come at me to swear or push me aside, or slam
        the door in my face or hit me to prevent my taking the child. This way, we can immediately
        remove the child with the emergency provision without the need for a presidential ordinance,
        which would require some time in court…” (Focus group with professionals, Iași)

If the risk is not imminent and the parents approve, then the case is taken to the Child Protection
Commission (CPC) to decide on a special protection measure. The CPC makes its decision based on
the proposals made by the DGASPC representative who describes the child’s current status to the
Commission in the presence of the mother/parents and the child, after which the CPC issues a
decision. If the parents do not agree to a protection order being established, then the court is notified
and a civil ruling is issued (which is different from a presidential ordinance). Of these two ways of
entering the system, Figure 53 shows that decisions by the CPC are almost four times more frequent
than decisions made by a court (41 percent versus 11 percent of all entries).
Figure 53 (top graph) shows that placement decisions by the DGASPC director have consistently
increased in terms of their share of all entries, from under 10 percent in the early 1990s, to a high of
54 percent in 2014 (the average is 40 percent). On the other hand, placements through a CPC decision
steadily decreased until 2009, after which they slowly increased from 23 percent in 2009 to 29 percent
in 2014. The shares of the other two methods – court rulings or presidential ordinances – increased
after Law 272/2004 came into force. However, the percentage of presidential ordinances has been
consistently low (2 to 4 percent of all annual entries into the system), whereas the percentage of
entries by court rulings almost tripled from 9 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2009, and then dropped
to 12 percent in 2014 (with an average of 11 percent between 1989 and 2014).
So, out of all entries in the child protection system (as of November-December 2014), the largest
share (52 percent) consisted of cases with no imminent risk for which there was a CPC decision or a
court ruling, about 42 percent were high-risk cases with an emergency placement ruled by the
DGASPC director and, very seldom, through a presidential ordinance, and for 6 percent of the entries
there was no information in the case files. However, looking at the 2010-2014 timeframe, we see a
different pattern: most entries (54 percent) were emergency placements, most through a decision of
the DGASPC director, and in only 42 percent of the cases was there a CPC decision or a court ruling.
Entries with parental consent (decided by the CPC) increased, whereas those without the parents’
consent (ruled by the courts) decreased. The share of entries on which there was no information in the
case files remained constant regardless of the time period considered.
Figure 53 (bottom graph) shows striking differences from one county to another with regard to who
made the decision about a child entering the system. Thus, entries as a result of a DGASPC director’s
decision varied from a minimum of 14 percent of all entries in Bistrița-Năsăud to a maximum of 74
percent, in Sibiu. Still on emergency placements, there were almost no presidential ordinances in
Bistrița-Năsăud, Covasna, Gorj, Hunedoara, and Satu-Mare, but they accounted for more than 5
percent of all entries in Galați and Vâlcea. Entries with parental consent through a CPC decision were
quite numerous in some counties – Bistrița-Năsăud and Neamț (62 to 67 percent of all entries)
whereas in others they accounted for less than a quarter of all entries (Caraș-Severin, Sibiu, and
Vrancea). Entries with no major risk and without parental consent, enforced through court rulings,
accounted for a large share in Caraș-Severin (22 percent) and particularly in Mehedinți (30 percent),
but they accounted for less than 5 percent of all entries in several other counties. Thus, while
emergency entries (especially through a decision of the DGASPC director) prevail in some counties
such as Vrancea, Dâmbovița, and Sibiu, in others (Botoșani, Mehedinți, Bistrița-Năsăud, Vaslui, Gorj,
Neamț and Hunedoara), between 64 percent and 74 percent of all entries are decided by the CPC or
the courts.
Annex 6 Table 38 presents the profile of specific cases for different entry routes into public care. As
per the rules described above, entries into the system based on a decision of the DGASPC director
usually concern babies (those aged between 0 and 12 months) relinquished in maternity wards and
cases of child abuse and/or exploitation.

                                                                                                           227
The categories of children that were significantly more likely to have entered the system through a
decision of a DGASPC director were children at risk of separation, especially premature and/or
underweight babies 298 but also children with developmental delays and teenagers with behavioral
problems. For instance, out of all children with behavioral problems aged 7 to 17 in public care, 61
percent entered based on a decision of the DGASPC director (versus the 40 percent average) and 6
percent were also emergency placements but based on a presidential ordinance (versus the 2 percent
average). Other categories of children who were more likely to enter the system based on a decision
of the DGASPC director were children left home alone after their parent(s) left, children from families
with unstable accommodation or homeless families, children abandoned on the street or in other
public spaces, and children who had run away from home (street children). However, these cases
represent only 7 percent of all children subject to emergency placement based on a decision of the
DGASPC director. Most of these children were neglected by poor families with a stable
accommodation.
As discussed above, the presidential ordinance is used when the health, development, or life of a child
is being endangered within the family (especially in cases of child abuse) and when parents are
against the child being taken by the DGASPC. Annex 6 Table 38 shows that most of these cases
involved children from families with stable accommodation living in poverty and/or poor housing
conditions and characterized by parental alcohol and/or substance abuse.
CPC decisions tend to be associated with avoidable entries (those that could be avoided if effective
community services were available), with 57 percent of all avoidable entries being based on a CPC
decision.299 Entries more likely to have been decided by a CPC decision were those involving children
with teenage mothers at the moment of the child’s entry, children with institutionalized mothers, and
children with disabilities and/or SEN, though they represent only a small share of all CPC decisions.
Entries into the child protection system through a court ruling (other than a presidential ordinance)
concerned children 3 and 17 years old from families with stable accommodation or who were in the
care of relatives, whose parent(s) had disappeared either because of unfortunate events (death or
institutionalization) or because they were abroad, or whose family had broken up (because of divorce
or separation, for example). This is why there was no parental consent in the case files (which would
allow for the cases to be assessed by the CPC), so the cases were sent before the courts. Cases in
which parents are present in the home but disagree with the establishment of a protective measure
are rare.

 3. The family being the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth, well-being
 and protection of children, efforts should primarily be directed to enabling the child to remain in or return to

 families have access to forms of support in the caregiving role.

 4. Every child and young person should live in a supportive, protective and caring environment that promotes
 his/her full potential. Children with inadequate or no parental care are at special risk of being denied such a

The way in which the decision to separate a child from their family is taken (documentation of the
case and justification of the separation) is crucial to ensure that the child’s rights are respected. The
UN Convention on the Rights of the Child acknowledges the importance of all children growing up in
a family: “for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, the child should grow up
in a family environment” (Preamble) and “States Parties shall ensure that a child shall not be separated
from his or her parents against their will except when (…) separation is necessary for the best interests
of the child” (Article 9).301
The information available to those deciding whether or not to separate children from their families
should be significantly improved, regardless of how the decision is made or who makes it. In the
previous chapters we saw that many elements related to the child’s status before entering the system
are not properly documented in the case files. Then, in section 3.2.5.4 we analyzed the existence and
quality of the social assessments conducted before the child enters the child protection system and
found them to be lacking. Furthermore, we have shown that not enough efforts are made to keep
children with their families, particularly because of the lack of several types of community-based
services. The official audit reports of the ANPDCA found the same types of problems for all DGASPCs
across the country.


Common issues associated with placement with substitute or extended families that were noticed during the
ANPDCA’s audits:

      In only few cases did SPAS provide services aimed at preventing child-family separation prior to the
       establishment of special protection measures.

      The documents underlying the proposal for emergency placement of the abused/neglected child do not
       reference the conditions of imminent danger to the child.

Annex 6 Table 38 provides additional information in this respect, as drawn from the children’s case
files. According to this data, the best documented files are those prepared for presidential ordinances.
It is possible that the files sent to courts that are considering granting the ordinance are more
carefully prepared as there is an over-representation among these cases of families and children who
received community-based prevention and support services prior to the case reaching the court.302
Entries into the system based on a decision of the DGASPC director are associated with requests
received by the DGASPC from institutions (particularly the health units where the children were
relinquished), the decision being founded on the DGASPC and/or SPAS social assessments whose
documentation is of average to good quality.
The worst documented files seem to be those prepared for the Child Protection Commissions, which
are associated with requests received from families. This is probably one of the main reasons why
entries based on the CPC decision are correlated with avoidable entries: the family makes a request,
the case manager (who might be the SPAS social worker) makes a recommendation, and the CPC
makes a decision even based on a poor social assessment that has not provided enough information
on the case. During the qualitative study, several opinions were expressed related to entries into the
system based on a CPC decision:
 There is a mistaken impression among child protection professionals that the number of these
  entries is small or constantly decreasing compared to entries based on court rulings (which is
  contradicted by the data in Figure 53, top graph ):
            “The number [of entries based on a CPC decision] is small, usually two to three cases, not more
            than three per year, in which the parents come and we have their approval, meaning that we can

   Of all children from families who were provided with prevention and support services prior to the child entering the
system, only 3 percent entered on the basis of a presidential ordinance (versus the 2 percent average).

                                                                                                                  229
            have a Commission decision. Usually, decisions are taken by courts.” (Focus group with
            professionals, Focșani)
            “The number [of entries based on a CPC decision] is small because most of them come from
            broken up families, [the parents having] gone to work abroad. They fail to inform the local
            authorities within the official 40 days’ timeframe that they are going to leave, and the children
            are left in someone else’s care. So we have to go through the court, because we don’t have the
            parents’ consent.” (Focus group with professionals, Craiova)

 Professionals were critical of the CPC, stating that the decision to place the children into public
  care is taken “too lightly” and that the CPC fails to enforce the requirement to go through all the
  preliminary steps of working with the family in line with current regulations and with the UN
  Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children (Box 16 above).
            “I, as the manager of a center, after seeing the children I have there, I think that for some of them
            the protection measure was established too easily. For instance, a child that came to me, raised
            by the grandparents, who, at some point, was absent from school, was disobedient with his
            grandmother, stopped going to football practice, and he came to us with a special protection
            order. It is possible for the grandparents to refuse [to care for the child], they don’t have parental
            obligations, but…at the end of the day it’s a subjective thing, it comes down to the person that
            was in charge of that case ... if someone had worked with the grandparents and the child… or
            maybe I see things differently.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

 The professionals also expressed opinions according to which decisions are taken based on a file
  “which has documents in proof, documents related to income, health status, lack of
  accommodation, maybe a psychological assessment. Yes, a lot of documents and evidence, but…
  everyone does what they can… the social worker, the case manager who prepares the case file and
  presents it before the Commission.”303
The main problem highlighted by DGASPC specialists is not being able to provide support fast
enough to children in vulnerable situations once they have been identified. Some children might have
to wait quite some time before receiving services that are not immediately available, whereas
emergency cases (especially those involving abuse or relinquishment) require a fast intervention and
removing the child from the family/hospital as soon as possible. As one judge has said, “Two months
of delay in making decisions in the best interests of a child or young person equates to one percent of
childhood that cannot be restored.”304 This is also the opinion of the DGASPC specialists who drew
attention to the fact that sometimes it takes too long to get the presidential ordinance, and, in
practice, “the emergency” might take even more than two months, during which time the child is left
without any support with the abusing parent/adult.
            “It takes some months to remove a child [from the family]…and we speak of abuse?
            - Exactly. Yes, the emergency procedure.

            - When we deal with abuse…or even with neglect, but if it is in the long run and things have not
            improved… But a couple of days ago we had a happy case: the lawyer came with the ordinance, it
            was accepted, we were awaiting for it to be legalized so that we could start this procedure. But
            we got a phone call from the child’s mother who said that she had thought things over and was
            willing to cooperate with the Directorate, that she didn’t want us to use bailiffs so she would
            bring the children to us. So together we went and accompanied them to the emergency
            reception center. This was a happy case.
            - And all these deadlines arise because the Civil procedural code sets a maximum deadline of 48
            days to prepare the motivation, which is… to have an abused child and leave him/her with the
            abuser for a month and a half is, in my opinion, really stupid.

            - It could be even worse, you could go and pay a visit, witness the child being beaten, and not be
            able to remove him/her from there. This is the biggest…

       - Yes. Or find him/her tied down and starved. And you can’t take him/her, you can’t do this with a
       placement decision.” (Focus group with professionals, Ploiești)
       ”There are cases when there is a court decision to remove the child from the family, but we could
       not do it, although we went with the police, we couldn’t take the children from there. There was a
       big scandal… And the final court ruling was issued in September 2014 and the child was removed
       from the family only in January 2015 because the final ruling had not been drafted… Which
       should have been ready in a few days… This is the thing with courts – they entail significant risks
       for the children, after all, that is why there is a court order in the first place, for special situations,
       to help us remove the children without delay. I think there should be a courthouse for children,
       where everyone is specialized in child-related issues.”(Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)



RECOMMENDATIONS
In order to reduce the number of avoidable entries into the child public care system, community-based
prevention services should be developed, as shown in a previous chapter. At the same time, in the short run, it
would be useful to develop a stricter procedure governing children entering the system at the family’s request,
especially based on a decision of the Child Protection Commission. This should start with the proper case
documentation and introduce an obligation that requires the authorities to follow all the steps that precede
the placement of a child in public care. The procedure should be enforced in a consistent manner all over the
country, and it should involve the DGASPC multidisciplinary teams (for the initial case assessment), together
with SPAS representatives, the Community Consultative Structures, and local authorities.
Courts should be created all over the country specifically for minors and their families. At the same time,
targeted training on child-specific issues should be provided for judges and clerks.

3.3.2               All Categories of Children in All Types of
                    Special Protection Services
From this section on, we will analyze the child public care system, focusing on the types of care
available to children temporarily or permanently separated from their family and the process by which
children are placed in one of these services. However, before beginning, it is useful to understand the
general context in which the data on the current status should be interpreted. The first section will
present a brief history of the Romanian child protection system while the second section compares
Romania with other countries in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and with those in the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) at the time of the research. The third section conducts an
inventory of the protection services included in this study and their distribution across counties in
Romania. The fourth section focuses on how children are placed in one service or another as revealed
by the November-December 2014 data in the case files.

 3.3.2.1            Developments in the Child Protection System after 2000
The communist regime left Romania with a disastrous child protection system. A network of large
institutions was developed between 1945 and 1989, and poor families were encouraged to leave their
children (especially those with disabilities) in public care. Traditional child protection methods, like
placing a child in distress with extended family members, were undermined. In the context of the pro-
birth policies and the economic depression of the 1980s, the results were a catastrophe. It is estimated
that in 1989 over 100,000 children were living in institutions in very bad conditions and that more than
16,000 children had died from treatable illnesses or other causes.305 Moreover, even if the physical
conditions had been reasonable, the institutionalization had a strongly negative impact on children’s
health, development, and psychological status as a result of the depersonalization, rigid routine, and
social distance that was prevalent in those institutions.

The government has made significant progress in the past 15 years in terms of reducing the number
of institutionalized children and developing family-based care services. The total number of children in
child care (in both residential institutions and family-based care) has significantly decreased from
almost 89,000 children in 2000 to roughly 60,000 at the end of 2013 and down to almost 59,000 at the
end of June 2014.306 However, at the same time, the total number of children in Romania has also
decreased so the ratio of children in child care remained the same after 2005 (about 1,600 to 1,700
out of every 100,000 children aged between 0 and 17 years), which shows that the system failed to
reduce the share of children in the public care system. So this is still a priority for the years to come.
Figure 54 shows the structural changes that have happened in the child protection system following
the development of family-based services. Starting with the beginning of the 2000s, this has led to a
significant reduction in the number of children in residential institutions in favor of family-based care
services. The number of children in residential institutions (public and private placement centers,
including small group homes) decreased from a maximum of over 58,000 in December 2000 to 21,365
on June 30, 2014. In 2011 the number of institutionalized children increased307 for the first time in 15
years, a consequence of the population getting poorer and of the country’s limited budget. However,
the rate began to decrease again after 2011. The government’s recent wave of reform of the child
protection system has set deinstitutionalization as a top priority, which should continue and accelerate
the reduction in the numbers of children in institutions.

3.3.2.2                Romania’s Child Protection System in the CEE/CIS Region
The UNICEF Report “At Home or in a Home” shows that the legacy of institutionalizing abused and
neglected children, or those with disabilities continues in all Central and Eastern European states (CEE)
and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).308 In the context of a serious deterioration of
the housing conditions and increasing poverty, many families leave their children in institutions either
temporarily or permanently. After 2008, the global crisis affected the situation of children in the entire
CEE/CIS region. Thus, at the end of 2013, about 1.3 million children in the entire region lived
separated from their families in various types of alternative care.309
The Romanian child public care system is one of the largest in the CEE/CIS region, caring for about
60,000 children. Only Poland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Russia have larger child care systems. However,
according to the ratio of children in public care compared to the total number of children in the
country, Romania occupies an average position in the region (with 1,600 to 1,700 children in child care
per 100,000 children aged 0 to 17 years versus an average of 1,850 per 100,000 both in the CEE/CIS
region and among the countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia).310
The number of institutionalized children in the CEE/CIS region is the highest in the entire world, with
about 525,000 children growing up in residential institutions. Despite recent reforms in all of these
countries that resulted in more children being cared for by alternative families, over 40 percent of the
525,000 are still in institutions. Thus, the Romanian child protection system is in line with most child
protection systems in the region in still depending, to a large extent, on institutionalized care, which
inhibits children’s development potential (Figure 55).

children in residential institutions include young people aged 18 years and over. Data exist for the 1990-1999
timeframe, but they cannot be compared with those after 2000 because of all the changes in the system.

Macedonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Hungary, and Uzbekistan. Out of these, the countries
that had more children in public care than Romania (in 2013) were: the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Moldova, and Russia.

                                                                                                              233
What is even more worrisome is the fact that the child protection system of the region depends
heavily on institutions to care for children with disabilities. Across the region, about 212,000 children
with disabilities were in institutions in 2013. In several countries, children with disabilities constituted
more than half of all institutionalized children. In this respect, too, Romania occupies an average
position, as shown in Figure 55.

Note: *Data for 2012. **Data on children with disabilities are missing.

At the same time, it is worthwhile mentioning that, in recent years, governments of the CEE/CIS region
have been constantly concerned with reducing the number of children under 3 years old in residential
institutions because of the devastating effects institutionalization can have on the child’s health and
development. Since 2005, Romanian law has forbidden the placement of children under 2 years old in
a residential service (Law 272/2004). As a result, Romania holds an above average position in the


234
CEE/CIS region in terms of the number of children under 3 in institutions (93.9 per 100,000 children
aged 0 to 3 years).311
In 2014, an amendment to Law 272 from 2004 was passed, stating that “the placement of children
under the age of 3 can be assigned only to the extended or foster family or to a foster parent, with the
placement of these children into residential care being forbidden.” However, the amendment also
states an exception according to which “a child under the age of 3 can be placed in residential care if
he/she has severe disabilities and is dependent on care from the specialized residential services.”
In recent years, more and more countries in the region are seeking to ensure a better start in life for
very young children and, therefore, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovakia have
already adopted or are in the process of adopting a series of legal measures forbidding the
institutionalization of children under 3 years old.

   According to HHC (2012), a small group home (CTF) is a residential unit with maximum 12 children, with maximum 4
children in a bedroom, organized based on a family model, with living room, kitchen and bathroom.
313
      The classification of each placement center by type was made by ANPDCA together with DGASPC.
314
   According to HHC (2012), an “old type,” “traditional,” or “classical” institution refers to a residential center with over
12 children/young people, with at least four children/young people in a bedroom, and with shared bathrooms for the
residents living on the same floor.
315
   According to HHC (2012), a “refurbished,” “restructured,” or “modulated” institution refers to a residential center with
over 12 children/young people, organized in units, with each unit typically consisting of a bedroom, a living room and a
bathroom.

Other services like maternal centers, emergency reception centers, guardianship, specialized
supervision, and day and night shelters are only steps on the way to placements in the system and
therefore, by convention, they are outside the scope of this research.316
In order to fully understand the analyses presented in the following chapters, we first present a
general overview of the child protection system based on ANPDCA data.317 The way in which child
protection services have developed so far differs significantly from one county to another:
 First, while in most counties, children are in family-type care,318 there are four counties and two
  sectors in Bucharest where more than half of all children in care are in residential services.319 At the
  same time, in eight counties, more than 70 percent of children for whom a protection measure was
  established were placed in family-type care.320
 Second, the way in which residential services have been reformed or developed varies significantly
  from one county to another, as seen in Figure 56 and in Annex 6 Table 39.



Residential Services
As at November 30, 2014, the DGASPCs reported a nationwide total of 408 apartments, 686 small
group homes, and 215 placement centers, which were either public institutions or were managed by
accredited private organizations (OPA).321
OPA residential services represent about 24 percent of all residential services (according to December
31, 2014 data). Most private residential services are small group homes (41 percent of all small group
homes). Only 8 percent of residential services for children with disabilities are managed by OPA. The
proportion of private residential services increases every year but varies between counties from a
minimum of less than 5 percent of children in residential services in 13 counties and one sector in
Bucharest to a maximum that is eight times higher in Bacău, Bihor, Prahova, and Timiș, with the
highest value (59 percent) being in Hunedoara county. As of December 31, 2014, at national level, 19
percent of children in residential services were in OPA facilities. For children with disabilities, the
percentage drops to 3 percent.
The other residential services are public, in that they are managed by the county DGASPCs. In other
words, 76 percent of the residential services in the country are public and they account for 81 percent
of the children in residential care (as of December 31, 2014). The equivalent figure for children with
disabilities is over 97 percent.
According to November 30, 2014 data, residential services in the form of apartments are available in
27 counties and in the six Bucharest sectors, but their number varies from 2 to 29 per county. Six
counties322 and sector 3 in Bucharest account for 40 percent of all apartments in the country.
Small group homes (CTF) are available across the entire country, except for two sectors in Bucharest (3
and 4). However, their distribution is uneven, varying from 1 to 62 small group homes per county.
Homes for children with disabilities represent 30 percent of all small group homes. Altogether, eight
counties account for almost half of the CTFs for children with disabilities, and seven counties account

316
   In other words, children in the sample who received only these services were not considered in the analysis, they are,
by convention, “cases out of scope” (see Annex 6 Table 1).
317
      www.copii.ro
318
   As of December 31, 2014, at the national level, 63 percent of children in the child protection system were in family-
type care, and 37 percent were in public residential institutions or institutions managed by OPAs (accredited private
organizations providing child protection services).
319
    As of December 31, 2014, these counties were Alba, Harghita, Sălaj, Sibiu, and sectors 1 and 2 in Bucharest. If we look
only at placement centers, the order of the counties changes, with the first three being Iași, Brașov and Prahova.
320
   As of December 31, 2014, these counties were Caraș-Severin, Dâmbovița, Galați, Mehedinți, Olt, Vaslui, Vâlcea,
Vrancea, and Sector 5 in Bucharest.

for about half of all small group homes for children without disabilities. Over 40 percent of all 686
small group homes in the country are located in six counties: Alba, Arad, Bacău, Bihor, Maramureș, and
Mureș. Of these, in Bihor and Maramureș the small group homes managed by OPA look after a
substantial number of children in residential care, whereas in the other four counties, the small group
homes are mainly public services.
Out of the 215 placement centers in the country, most of them (111) are old-type/classical institutions
in buildings with at least four children or young people per bedroom and shared bathrooms for the
residents living on the same floor. The other 104 centers have been restructured or modulated as
units. Both classical and modulated placement centers have, on average about 50 beneficiaries.
Placement centers exist in all counties, except for Brăila and Giurgiu, and in the six sectors of
Bucharest.


FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
Data gathered from the source communities for the child protection system show that 40 percent of
those in rural areas live close to a residential center for children (located in that commune or in a
neighboring one).
Further research is needed to test the assumption that placement centers influence nearby
communities to be more tolerant towards child-family separation. Proximity to residential centers
increase the odds that people will regard the placement of a child in this kind of institution as
something “normal”, a way of finding somewhere close to home, a place where the child can be
accommodated in decent conditions (sometimes better than at home), fed, clothed, sent to school,
and supervised.
This assumption is all the more plausible given that the children can pay visits to their homes on
weekends or during the holidays. Such an assumption should be tested especially for children from
poor families from rural areas who enter the system at their family’s request.
Source: Social Assistance Data Sheets from Rural Source Communities (July-August 2015). Data are not weighted
(N=60 communes with source communities with 1,140 children in public care, in November-December 2014).

As discussed above, there are several different subtypes of placement centers. 323 There are 45
placement centers taken over from MEN (former dormitories of special schools) nationwide. All of
them are public residential services. Most (37) are old-type/classical institutions, and some have been
restructured/modulated. These former dormitories of special schools are quite large institutions, with
an average of 60 children per center. Placement centers taken over from MEN exist in 20 counties and
in two sectors of Bucharest (2 and 6). The counties of Buzău, Neamț, Brașov, and Prahova each have
four centers taken over from MEN.324
Nationwide, there are 96 refurbished/modulated placement centers, other than MEN centers. The
biggest share are centers for children with no disabilities (55), whereas the remaining 41 modulated
centers are for children with disabilities. One out of six centers is managed by OPA, but only one of
these is for children with disabilities. As a general rule, the OPA modulated centers are usually smaller
than those managed by the DGASPCs, with, on average, about 25 beneficiaries versus the average of
45 children in public modulated centers. At the same time, modulated centers for children with
disabilities are smaller than those for children with no disabilities (on average 30 beneficiaries versus
60 for modulated centers managed by the DGASPCs and 9 beneficiaries versus 28 for OPA modulated
centers). In terms of geographical distribution, modulated placement centers exist in 32 counties and
two sectors in Bucharest (3 and 4). Modulated centers for children with disabilities are quite evenly
distributed across 23 counties and in sector 3 from Bucharest, whereas there is a strong concentration
of modulated centers for children with no disabilities - 9 counties account for about two-thirds of all

these centers.325 The counties of Iași and Neamț, followed by Hunedoara and Constanța, have the
most modulated centers other than those taken over from MEN (with nine, eight, seven, and six
institutions respectively).
Altogether there are 74 classical placement centers other than MEN centers. Most of them (47) are for
children with no disabilities, and only 27 are classical centers for children with disabilities. More than
one out of four centers are managed by OPA, but very few of them are for children with disabilities.
OPA classical centers are usually smaller than those managed by the DGASPCs (on average about 25
beneficiaries versus the average of 50 children in public classical centers). Classical centers for children
with disabilities tend to be smaller than those for children without disabilities (with on average 40
beneficiaries versus 60 for the classical centers managed by the DGASPCs). In terms of geographical
distribution, classical placement centers other than those taken over from MEN are located in 23
counties and four sectors in Bucharest (1, 2, 5, and 6).326 Most of these centers are concentrated in
seven counties, with over five centers per county in Sibiu, Prahova, Vâlcea, Botoșani, and sector 1 in
Bucharest.
The mix of residential child public care services differs significantly from one county to another as
shown in Figure 56. While in some counties like Prahova, Sibiu, and Vâlcea, classical and/or modulated
placement centers prevail, others counties provide care mainly in small group homes and apartments
(such as Mureș, Maramureș, Giurgiu, Brăila, and Alba). This is why the analysis of public care services
presented in the following chapters will vary significantly at the county level given the striking
differences in the mix of services.

   Modulated placement centers for children without disabilities other than MEN centers exist in 25 counties and in
sectors 3 and 4 of Bucharest.
326
    Classical placement centers for children with disabilities other than MEN centers exist in 15 counties and in sectors 2
and 5 of Bucharest. Classical placement centers for children with no disabilities are located in 19 counties and in sectors
1, 2, 5, and 6 of Bucharest.

                                                                                                                      239
Closing down the old-type/classical institutions (including those taken over from MEN) is a priority for
the government as part of the deinstitutionalization process targeted by the new wave of reform in
the child protection sector. Speeding up the process by which all classical residential institutions for
children will be closed down is a priority objective in both the National Strategy for the Protection and
Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 and the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty
Reduction 2015-2020 as well as the Romanian Partnership Agreement for the 2014-2020 Programming
Period and the EC’s 2014 Country Specific Recommendations for Romania. The European Union has
specified deinstitutionalization and the transition to community-based care as priorities to be funded
from its Structural Funds, and approved, for wide use, the Common European Guidelines on the
Transition from Institutional to Community-based Care, which provide practical advice on how to
switch sustainably from institutional care to family-based or community-based alternatives for people
who are currently in institutions and for those living in the community without appropriate support.327
In November 2014, there were 111 such old-type placement centers all over the country (of which, 37
former dormitories taken over from MEN). Figure 56 shows that classical institutions that should be
closed down are not evenly distributed in the country. So far, 14 counties and two sectors in Bucharest
have completed the process of closing down classical institutions.328 Map 6 shows the countrywide
distribution of residential services, highlighting in red those counties that will require priority
interventions in order to close down their classical placement centers.



Human Resources of the Child Protection System
As shown in the previous section, the DGASPCs, which are funded from the state budget and by
county councils, are both the main providers and the main contractors of residential child care services.
Moreover, when it comes to family-type care services, DGASPCs play an even greater role as fewer
than 1 percent of all foster parents are managed by OPA. Consequently, the DGASPCs need
sustainable and appropriate financial and human resources in order to develop not only a national
network of child public care services but also services targeting other vulnerable groups (especially
adults with disabilities).

   These counties are Alba, Arad, Brăila, Călărași, Constanța, Dolj, Giurgiu, Hunedoara, Maramureș, Mehedinți, Mureș,
Satu Mare, Teleorman, and Vaslui. The two sectors in Bucharest are sectors 3 and 4.

DGASPCs are big employers of specialized staff. After the structural changes that took place in the
beginning of the 2000s, the total DGASPC staff increased from 36,000 in 2002 to over 41,200 in 2008
but started to decrease after the budget cuts in 2009. The downward trend continued until 2012 when
staff numbers stabilized at around 32,000 to 33,000 employees (Figure 57 and Annex 6 Table 40). In
line with the policy of closing down institutions and developing family-type care services, the number
of employees in residential public services continuously decreased (except for a short time between
2006 and 2008) by about 8,000 people between 2002 and 2015. On the other hand, the other staff
categories (especially foster parents) significantly increased at the beginning of the period (2002 to
2007) and then gradually their numbers decreased. The development of daycare services started to
grow at a faster pace between 2012 and 2015.
The number of the DGASPC staff in public family-based care and in residential services closely
followed the trend in the number of children who received these services (Annex 6 Table 41 and
Annex 6 Figure 9). However, the number of foster carers decreased faster than the number of
beneficiaries,329 which increased the child/foster carer ratio from 1:1 in 2002 to 1:5 to 1:6 between
2010 and 2015. As for public residential services, the number of beneficiaries decreased faster than the
number of staff, so that the child/DGASPC employee ratio was reduced from 1:9 in 2002 to 1:2 in
2008/2009.330 Later, the number of staff decreased more abruptly, resulting in a 1:4 to 1:5 ratio
between 2010 and 2015.331 The available data do not allow us to estimate the ratio of children to
personnel directly involved in child care as they only refer to the total number of employees.
As of December 31, 2014,332 the DGASPCs employed more than 32,200 people, of whom 37 percent
were foster parents, 38 percent worked in residential services, 11 percent worked in daycare services,
and 14 percent worked in their core structure. Annex 6 Table 40 shows that there are striking
differences from one county to another in terms of the structure of DGASPC staff:
 The number of staff in family-based care varies from 8 percent to 80 percent of all employees
  across counties (that is, between 64 and 1,456 professional foster parents).333
 The share of employees in residential services varies from a low of 1 percent to a high of 64
  percent.334 In 13 counties, more than half of all DGASPC staff work in residential services.
 Daycare services are the most unequally distributed at the county level. Five counties have none of
  these services335 and 22 counties employ a very small number of people (under 10 percent) in
  daycare services, whereas three counties and four sectors of Bucharest each have between 20 and
  48 percent of all of their employees working in these services.336 Altogether, the employees from
  these counties and from these sectors of Bucharest represent about half of all employees working
  in public daycare services in the entire country.
 The percentage of staff employed in the core structures of the DGASPCs also varies, from 5 percent
  to 36 percent. The minimum (5 percent) is in Vaslui, where there are fewer than 100 employees in

329
   From 2008 until 2015, the number of beneficiaries decreased by about 2,100 children, and the number of foster
parents employed by the DGASPCs decreased by more than 3,000.
330
  Between 2002 and 2009, the number of children in public residential services decreased by more than 18,000,
whereas the number of DGASPC staff working in these services was reduced by less than 4,300.
331
   Between 2009 and 2015, the reduction in the number of children of about 3,100 was similar to the loss in the number
of employees in public residential services, which was about 3,500.
332
      As of December 31, 2015, the total number of DGASPC employees was 32,600 people.
333
   Shares of 20 percent or less were found in the Bucharest sectors and in Cluj and Brașov counties. The maximum
proportion (80 percent) was found in Vaslui, but rates exceeding 50 percent were also recorded in Dâmbovița, Vrancea,
and Caraș-Severin.
334
   The minimum of 1 percent belonged to Vaslui. Shares of under 20 percent were also recorded in sectors 3 and 6 of
Bucharest, in Satu-Mare, and in Caraș-Severin. On the other hand, rates exceeding 60 percent were found in Sălaj and
Brașov. In absolute values, Iași had the maximum number of employees in residential services, 756 people, which
represented 43 percent of the total staff in the county.
335
      These counties are Constanța, Ilfov, Mureș, Prahova, and Sălaj.
336
   These are Dolj, Satu-Mare, Suceava, and sectors 1, 3, 5, and 6 of Bucharest. Sector 6 has the highest number of staff
in daycare services (367), which represent 48 percent of all staff.

                                                                                                                   241
      the core structure to monitor and coordinate a network of over 1,450 foster parents as well as two
      maternal centers, three emergency reception centers, one modulated center, a shelter, eight small
      group homes, and six apartments. At the other end, in sector 2 of Bucharest, more than one-third
      of staff work in the DGASPC core structure (36 percent), which means that there are more than 200
      people to coordinate, monitor, and assess five classical placement centers, fewer than 100 foster
      parents, a small group home, a shelter, an emergency reception center, a maternal center, and 16
      apartments. A quarter of the staff in sector 6 of Bucharest and in the counties of Alba and Arad
      work in the core structure of the DGASPC, whereas less than 10 percent of staff do so in Brăila, Iași,
      Dolj, and Tulcea.
The DGASPCs reported employing only 1,030 case managers at the national level, either in the core
structure or in residential services. Our research included a survey of case managers, but these data
will be presented in a separate volume, which is in progress.
As you can see, counties are organized very differently and use a variety of HR policies. DGASPC’s
county policies comply with the current legislation but do not seem to be correlated with the total
number of children in public care in the county or with the specific mix of services that it provides. For
example, for a total number of 700-800 children in public care, the number of core DGASPC
employees varies between 29 employees in Brăila, 39 in Tulcea, 62 in Sălaj, and 80 in Gorj and 81 in
Mehedinți. On the other hand, sector 2 in Bucharest has more than 200 people in its core structure for
fewer than 600 beneficiaries, whereas in Iași, which has the highest number of beneficiaries (over
3,600 children), the DGASPC core structure comprises only 122 people.
The next two examples refer to the mix of residential services at the county level (Figure 56) and the
numbers of staff employed by the DGASPCs in public residential services (Annex 6 Tables 39 and 40).
Thus, the DGASPC in Iași, with over 1,300 children in its public residential services, has succeeded in
renovating most placement centers and has built a small number of small group homes and
apartments. Meanwhile, the DGASPC in Bihor has five old-type institutions and a large number of
small group homes (more than three times the number in Iași), most of which are managed by OPA.
As such, out of all of the over 800 children in residential services, only about 450 are in public
residential services, and the number of DGASPC employees in residential services is nearly three times
lower in Bihor than in Iași (265 versus 756 employees). In contrast, the DGASPC in Mureș closed down
all of its classical institutions and now provides residential services in small group homes, about half of
which are managed by the DGASPC. Out of all 670 children in residential services in Mureș, the
biggest share (over 450) are in services managed by the DGASPC (that is, about one-third of the
number of beneficiaries in Iași), with less than half the number of DGASPC staff that Iași has (392
versus 756).
The third example refers to the counties of Alba, Arad and Mureș, which have a similar mix of
residential services consisting mainly of public small group homes (Annex 6 Table 39) and have a
similar number of beneficiaries of residential services (450 to 490 children). However, the ratio of
children to DGASPC employees in public residential services ranges from 1:2 in Mureș, to 2:2 in Arad,
and 4:4 in Alba (Annex 6 Table 40).
Irrespective of these differences, all DGASPCs are faced with serious difficulties when it comes to
meeting their needs for the human resources and skills necessary to provide the services. According to
the social services audit carried out by HHC Romania in 2012, DGASPC general or deputy managers
mentioned several problems related to human resources in the child protection system, including: (i)
many vacancies given the hiring freeze in the public sector since 2010, leading to understaffing
particularly for staff working directly with children (such educators, nursemaids, and nurses); (ii)
nepotism in hiring practices; (iii) a lack of performance indicators, making it impossible to produce
staff appraisals; (iv) an absence of tools to motivate and sanction staff; (v) declining staff quality in
recent years, partly because of low investments in the continuous training of specialized staff;337 and
(vi) the fact that the added value of this type of training is not measured.


337
  Only 20 percent of the DGASPC staff from 45 counties attended any professional development training courses in
2010 (HHC Romania, 2012).

 RECOMMENDATION
 In the medium and long term, in order to meet the objectives in the National Strategy for the Protection and
 Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 and those in the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty
 Reduction 2015-2020, it will be necessary to strengthen DGASPCs’ role in strategic planning, methodological
 coordination, and supporting SPAS at the community level as well as in monitoring and assessing service
 providers at the county level. At the same time, their role as the main provider of social services should
 gradually be abolished. If these actions are taken, then DGASPCs will have to be completely reorganized and
 strengthened in almost all counties by outsourcing their existing services to private providers and by hiring
 more specialists in strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation, and case management. Therefore, the share
 of DGASPC employees in residential services can be expected to decrease constantly, while the share of staff in
 the core structure to increase in order to perform the coordination, SPAS assistance, and monitoring and
 evaluation functions. Another change to be expected is one concerning the DGASPC staff profiles which will
 incur a significant drop in the number of cooks, nursemaids, administrators, and drivers and a corresponding
 rise in the number of staff specializing in the protection of children and other vulnerable groups.




3.3.2.4               The First Stage of the Special Protection Service: How
                      Children Are Placed in the First Stage After Being
                      Admitted in the Public Care System
The analysis presented in this section is based on data from the case files of children in public care on
their most recent admission into the system. Among the children in the system as of November-
December 2014, 97 percent had only one admission in the system and 3 percent had multiple
admissions, meaning that their most recent entry may be their second, third, or fourth. As a general
rule, the date of the admission in the public care system is considered by most DGASPC experts as
being the date when the first child protection measure was issued (for the admission in question).
Therefore, at the time of their most recent admission, 55 percent of the children received a placement
measure, 44 percent were admitted with an emergency placement, and only 0.2 percent had
specialized supervision (a temporary protection measure established for children who have committed
criminal acts and are not criminally liable in which the child stays with the family provided that he or
she complies with certain obligations.338
At their most recent admission, in the first stage after the protection measure was issued, 52 percent
of the children were placed in family-type services, 46 percent were placed in residential services, and
1 percent were placed in other types of services such as counseling or recovery or daycare centers.339
This overview refers to the children who were in the public care system as of November-December
2014 but who were admitted in the system at any time between 1989 and 2014. Therefore, the
analysis of their information reflects all of the structural changes that had occurred in the child
protection system in the previous 25 years. The services recently underwent major changes (see the
previous section), and the practices related to the manner in which the children are placed in care
were also modified in accordance with the regulations and methodologies introduced in the
meantime. As a result, the children admitted into the system during 2013 and 2014 were more likely
than before to be placed, at least initially, in family-type services (65 percent) rather than in residential
services (34 percent).340




338
      For the other children (0.8 percent), there were no data regarding which protection measure was used.
339
      For 1 percent of the children, there was no information in the case files.
340
      The other 1 percent of the children were placed in other services.

                                                                                                              243

Figure 58 (top graph) shows that 2004, when Law 272 on the protection and promotion of children’s
rights entered into force and 2011, when it was updated, represent turning points. Also, other recent
regulations (such as Government Decision 1103/2014) led to a rapid increase of the share of children
placed in family-based services, especially for children aged 0 to 3 years.341 Therefore, while the share
of the children placed in residential services decreased from 90 percent at the beginning of the 1990s
to 33 percent in 2005 and then to 26 percent in 2014, the share of those placed in family-based
services increased from 10 percent to 65 percent in 2005 and then to 73 percent in 2014.342 These
trends were reflected in most counties but not in all. As we can see in Figure 58, in Bihor, Botoșani,
Constanța, and Mehedinți counties, the changes were very small or non-existent.
In order to understand the criteria that are used to decide on where the children are placed in the first
stage after they are admitted into the public care system, we analyzed a series of factors including: (i)
the child’s characteristics (such as gender, age, ethnicity, and the environment they come from); (ii)
the structure of the family of origin and the child’s relation to it; (iii) causes343 of the child’s separation
from the family; (iv) the route by which the child was admitted into the system; (v) the family history
related to the child protection system (for example, multiple admissions and any siblings in the
system); and (vi) the type of protection measure issued when the child was admitted into the system.
The results of this analysis are presented in Annex 6 Table 42 and are discussed in this section.
We started by analysing the specific profile of the children with a higher probability than average of
being placed in each type of service. Then, we analyzed the groups of children with special needs and
the manner in which these children were distributed among the services, as well as how the practices
of placing these special groups have evolved in time.



Family-type Services
Of the total of 52 percent of all children in the system who were initially placed in family-type services,
25 percent were placed with professional foster carers, 23 percent with relatives, and 4 percent with
other families or people. After 2010, we observed an increase in the placement of children with foster
carers and at other families or individuals and a decrease in placements with relatives up to the fourth
degree (Annex 6, Figure 10). As a result, 42 percent of the the children who were admitted into the
protection system in 2014 were placed with foster parents, and 8 percent with other families or
individuals, while the share of those placed with relatives was 23 percent (meaning that a total of 73
percent of all children admitted in 2014 were placed in family-type services).
Placement with foster carers is typical of children aged 0-2 years (particularly those under 1 year old)
who were relinquished in maternity wards or other health units (Annex 6, Table 42-A).344 Among
children who were placed with foster carers after their admission in the system, children relinquished
in maternity hospitals represent 51 percent, while 34 percent ended up in the system as a result of
neglect and/or abuse. Most of these cases were notified by a health unit or were identified on the own
initiative of the DGASPC, and their admission into the system was decided by the DGASPC director (56
percent) or by the Child Protection Commission (CPC) (31 percent).345 Most of the children admitted
into foster care had a protection measure of emergency placement (60 percent). Although the case

341
   The placement of children aged 0-2 years in residential care has been prohibited by law since 2005. Starting 2014,
this interdiction was extended to all children under the age of 3, except for children under 3 years old with severe
disabilities who are dependent on the care provided in specialized residential services.
342
   As an observation, the data from the case files of children in public care are very similar to those reported annually by
the ANPDCA to the UNICEF TransMonEE Database.
343
      See Infograph chart 4 and section 3.2.7.
344
   Among children who, after being admitted in the system, were placed in foster care, 58 percent were under one year
old and another 21 percent were 1-2 years old. As a result of the association between placement in foster care and
children relinquished in hospitals, over two-thirds of the beneficiaries of this service come from urban areas (where the
birth was registered).
345
   Admission by presidential ordinance is very rare - only 4 percent out of all children who, after admission in the
system, were placed in foster care, a share which, although smaller, is two times the average.

                                                                                                                       245
files of most of these children included a social assessment, only 60 percent of the case files contained
a list of the child’s relatives up to the fourth degree. Premature and/or underweight babies, children of
teenage mothers (at the time when the child was admitted in the system), and children of
institutionalized mothers all have a higher probability than average of being initially placed with foster
carers, but their shares of all children placed in foster care are minor.346 Placement with foster carers
covers 57 percent of the children in public care in Vaslui county, 44 percent in Harghita, but only 6
percent in Hunedoara or 3 percent in Gorj (as compared to the average of 25 percent).
Placement with relatives up to the fourth degree is typical of children over 3 years old who, prior to
being admitted into the system, were in the care of a relative (usually their grandmother) who lived
together with the child’s family and with whom the child had a good relationship (Annex 6, Table 42-
A). Among children who, after being admitted into the system, were placed with relatives, two-thirds
came from multigenerational households where the grandmother/grandparents lived together with
the parent/parents, siblings,347 and possibly other relatives. In addition, 18 percent lived with relatives
(usually grandmother/grandparents) away from the family. Placements with relatives are more
frequent in rural areas, and, as a result, 58 percent of the children placed with relatives came from the
rural environment and 20 percent came from rural source communities.


FROM RURAL SOURCE COMMUNITIES
The data from the source communities for the children in the protection system show that, at the level
of the communes that contain these communities, there is a large number of children in family-based
services:
     Children have been placed in foster care in 41 communes (68 percent of the communes included
      in the sample).348 In these communes, over 280 foster carers take care of more than 307 children
      (with an average of 8 foster carers and 9 children in placement per commune) with significant
      variations from one commune to another (a minimum of one foster carer and one child and a
      maximum of 50 foster carers and 35 children).
     Children have been placed with relatives in 56 communes (93 percent).349 In these communes,
      more than 517 children are in the care of approximately 400 households (with an average number
      of eight children and six households per commune) with a variation among communes, from a
      minimum of one child placed in one household to a maximum of 34 children in the care of 25
      households.
     Children have been placed with other people or families in 20 communes (36 percent).350 In these
      communes, more than 100 children are in the care of over 70 households (with an average of six
      children and four households per commune), with large differences between communes, from a
      minimum of one child and one household and a maximum of 33 children placed in 21 households.
Source: Social assistance data sheets in the rural source communities (July-August 2015). Data are not weighted
(N=60 communes with source communities with 1,140 children in public care as of November-December 2014).




346
   Premature born and/or underweight babies represent 17 percent, children of teenage mothers 6 percent, and
children of institutionalized mothers under 1 percent out of all children placed in foster care.
347
   Thirty percent of the children in placement with relatives lived with siblings before being admitted into the system
(versus the average of 34 percent). As of November-December 2014, 37 percent of them had siblings in public care
(versus the average of 50 percent).
348
   Among these communes, 35 provided us with data on the number of foster parents and the number of children in
foster care in the commune.
349
   Among these communes, 50 communes provided us with data on the number of children placed with relatives and
the number of households where these children were placed.
350
   Among these communes, 18 communes provided us with data on the number of children placed with other
individuals or families and the number of households where these children were placed.

246
So, in practice, most of the children placed with relatives (over 80 percent) receive a continuity of care,
meaning that they are in the care of the same relative whose care they were in before their admission
to the system. For 90 percent of them, being admitted into the system meant the establishment of a
placement protection order.351 The reasons why these orders were granted included being part of a
dysfunctional family352 (30 percent versus the average of 17 percent), having parents abroad (11
percent versus the average of 5 percent), having parents who are in prison (12 percent), or another
unfortunate event (9 percent). Based on the separation cause analysis model developed for this study,
we found that avoidable admissions are massively over-represented among the children placed with
relatives (45 percent versus the average of 24 percent) as shown in Figure 59. Among children in
placement with relatives, there are, on the one hand, children left with their grandparents for social
reasons related to parental risk factors and, on the other hand, children left with their grandparents
who do not have enough resources to raise them and who then resort to the placement order.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted
(N=51,800 children for which there was data on the type of service in which they were initially placed after their
most recent admission in the system).
Note: *Unfortunate events refer to the death or institutionalization of the child’s parent(s). For the analysis model,
see Infograph Chart 4 and section 3.2.7.

Placement with relatives is usually found in connection with children’s case files containing social
assessments carried out by SPAS and/or DGASPCs, most of which are accompanied by a plan of
services. As a result, among all children in a family placement, the families that received preventive
services, mainly information and counseling, before the child’s admission into the system, are over-
represented. Maybe precisely as a result of this action, most of these families or individuals (almost 60
percent) filed for child placement353 and the child was admitted into the system based on a decision of
the CPC.354




351
   Other measures/orders, such as specialized supervision or guardianship, were established for fewer than 1 percent of
the cases of placement with relatives. The other children (approximately 9 percent) received emergency placements.
352
    In this report, a dysfunctional family is defined as a family where one or more of the following events have occurred:
divorce, separation, infidelity, parental disinterest, desertion of family (other than parents being incarcerated or working
abroad), unacknowledged paternity, and birth out of wedlock (other than to teenager mothers). Seventeen percent of
the children in public care came from a dysfunctional family when they entered the system.
353
  Another 25 percent of the cases were notified by the SPAS, especially those involving divorce, separation, excessive
consumption of alcohol, or parents with disabilities and/or mental health problems.
354
   In other 29 percent of the cases, the decision to admit a child into the system was taken through a court ruling where
the parents’ approval was missing, mainly if the parents were abroad, were incarcerated, and/or had exhibited
promiscuous behavior, had problems with the police and/or a criminal record.

                                                                                                                           247
 The structure of the families of origin of the children in placement with relatives (Figure 60) and the
 reasons why these children were admitted in the protection system indicate that many of them
 continued to be cared for in the family by the same people (usually the grandmother or both
 grandparents) who were caring for them before but with the addition of a monthly placement
 allowance.355

 For children in placement with relatives only based on social reasons (especially those related to
 poverty and precarious housing), the government should consider replacing this special protection
 measure with a type of special social benefit, possibly as part of the Minimum Social Insertion Income,
 which is expected to become operational in 2018. Therefore, any family that has in its care one or
 more children deprived of parental care may have access to adequate support without any additional
 pressure on the child protection system. This new benefit could be considered a preventive measure
 that would: (i) provide both the child and the family by providing them with adequate support within
 the community; (ii) increase coverage of such cases; and (iii) be uniformly applied nationwide.
 For the time being, at least in some counties, the DGASPCs have adopted unwritten rules on refusing
 placements with relatives (for example, in cases of children with parents working abroad) while others
 accept all parents’ requests “for reasons not attributable to the parents, generally, poverty...”356
 According to the current regulations, placement with relatives (as well as in foster care or with other
 families) calls for quarterly reevaluation and monitoring visits conducted by the DGASPC in
 cooperation with the local SPAS in order to verify how the order is applied. Nevertheless, even the
 ANPDCA357 control reports show that: “The reevaluation of the child’s situation and of the reasons
 having led to his/her separation from the natural family is not carried out within the terms established
 by the current legislative framework, due to large caseloads and/or lack of transportation.”

 families.

As of November 30, 2014, 50 percent of the children in public care in Gorj and 43 percent in Bistrița-
Năsăud county were placed with relatives while only 4 percent in Sibiu and 3 percent in Neamț
received such placements (versus the average of 23 percent).
Placements with other individuals or families was the least common and mostly involved children who
had been in the care of an unrelated person (such as a neighbor or a friend of their parents) before
their admission into the system. In fact, 44 percent of the children cared for by unrelated people
before their entering the system were initially placed with other individuals or families.358 Nevertheless,
these cases represent only a quarter of all children placed with other individuals or families. The others
were children from families with steady accommodation (around 40 percent) or children relinquished
in health units (26 percent).
Placement with other individuals or families is usually done based on social assessments by the SPAS,
with the case being notified to the DGASPC by various actors (in 26 percent of the cases the
notification was made by a person rather than an institution)359 and the decision being taken by the
CPC (55 percent) or by a court ruling (19 percent). Concerning the distribution by counties, the share
of children placed with other families varies between 1 percent (in Bistrița-Năsăud, Harghita, and
Vâlcea counties) and a maximum of 8 percent (in Olt).360
Children placed with other individuals or families are from all categories and in similar proportions as
all of the children in public care. This shows that placements with other individuals or families are a
family-type service which, regardless of the purpose for which they were initially created, are not a
solution that can be targeted either to a specific group of children or to specific types of difficult
situations that the children may go through. Our analysis of the reasons for children being separated
from their families shows that avoidable admissions are over-represented also among children placed
with other individuals or families (31 percent of beneficiaries versus the average of 24 percent). In
other words, this type of protection service seems to be mostly used for children admitted into the
system only for social reasons, mainly when their parents are working abroad or if they have teenage
mothers.
According to Law 272/2004, “The person or family receiving a child in placement must live in Romania
and must be evaluated by the General Directorate for Social Assistance and Child Protection with
regard to the moral guarantees and the material conditions that it must meet in order to receive a
child in placement” (Article 62, paragraph 2). Families who wish to take a child on a placement must
submit an application addressed to their local DGASPC in which they explain their desire to care for
and raise a child who is deprived of parental care. A social worker will then be assigned to evaluate the
“moral guarantees and material conditions” of the family. If the evaluation report is favorable, then the
social worker together with the family petitioning to care for a child decide on what kind of child
would be the best fit to be placed with the family, after which the family is put on a waiting list until a
child with the right profile is identified. If a person or family have had contact with a child in a
residential center and wants to take that child in placement, at least in some counties they can submit
a written application to this purpose to the child’s local DGASPC. Unlike foster carers or families who
want to adopt a child, these families are not required to attend any courses or a special type of
training. Instead, they receive free information and counseling from the DGASPC, and after they
receive a child in placement, they have the right to meet the child’s case manager and be informed
about all actions towards the child’s integration or reintegration with his or her birth family. Also, they
are entitled to support from public and private institutions in taking care of various health-related
problems the child may have as well as to parental leave (for children up to 2 years old) and to the
monthly placement allowance of 600 lei. In addition, if the child becomes available for adoption, the


358
   Precisely because of the over-representation of children who were cared for by unrelated people before entering the
system, in the case files of children placed with other individuals/families there is also an over-representation of
information on people in the community who provided support for the child or his/her family (24 percent versus the
average of 11 percent).
359
      For comparison, such a notification was submitted only for 7 percent of the children in public care.
360
      High shares are also recorded in Suceava (7 percent), Bihor (6 percent), and Arad (6 percent) counties.

                                                                                                                 249
placement family has priority (along with the child’s extended family) if they have had the child in their
care for longer than six months.
Given this legal framework, an important question that remains to be answered is how this type of
service relates to the other family-type services and to the adoption process. There is a pressing need
for an analysis of this issue given that the mechanism for selecting these families is less stringent than
the mechanism for selecting foster parents and adoptive families and it is applied incompletely and
unevenly across the country. These issues were mentioned only sporadically in the qualitative study,
but a recent control report361 from the ANPDCA also found the following problems:
      The detailed case evaluation report most often did not contain an analysis of the reasons that lead
       to the child’s separation from his/her biological family, it merely repeated the information from
       the initial evaluation.
      Children are placed with substitute families without those families having to undergo an
       evaluation to ensure that they are capable of meeting the child’s needs.
      When filing the placement application, potential substitute families nominate a particular child
       whom they have already met in various circumstances, which, in the absence of any proper vetting
       of these families, can lead to the child ending up in an abusive situation.
      The evaluation of individuals or families who want to receive a child in placement is uneven across
       the country (for example, in some places, a psychologist is involved but not in others).
      The evaluation of the material conditions of the extended or the substitute families records only
       their incomes with no analysis of any other material resources and without taking into
       consideration the household’s expenses.
      The substitute family and the child are not prepared (either informed or trained) before the social
       protection measure is established.


 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

    A thorough analysis is necessary of children’s placements with relatives. Particularly for those placed with
    relatives for social reasons only (related to poverty and precarious housing), the government should consider
    replacing this social protection measure with a special social benefit managed by the SPAS, possibly as part of
    the Minimum Social Insertion Income (MSII), which is expected to become operational in 2018. This new
    benefit would be a preventive measure that would: (i) benefit both the child and the family by providing them
    with adequate support within the community; (ii) increase coverage of such cases; and (iii) be uniformly
    applied nationwide. Of course, such an initiative would have to be well thought out and designed to minimize
    fraud and errors, serve the best interests of the child, and ensure that children and the families caring for them
    receive adequate support within the community.
    It will also be necessary to clarify the role played by placements with other individuals or families as well as
    their relation to other family-based services. For the time being, placements with other individuals or families,
    regardless of the purpose for which they were initially created, are not a solution that can be targeted either to
    a specific group of children or to specific types of difficult situations that the children may go through.
    The procedure for deciding on the placement as well as the monitoring and post-placement support
    mechanisms and services need to be revised and standardized.

Small-scale Residential Services
As at November 30, 2014, 46 percent of all children in public care were placed in residential services, 8
percent being in small-scale residential care such as apartments and small group homes. After a steep
decline between 1999 and 2005 (when it reached a low 4 percent), the share of children in these
services increased after 2008 to around 8 to 11 percent, where it remains for the time being (Annex 6
Figure 11). Most of the children in small-scale residential care are placed in small group homes for
children with no disabilities (5 percent). The share of children in small group homes for children with
disabilities decreased continuously from 5 percent in the early 1990s to 1 percent in 2014 (with an
average of 2 percent for the entire period), while the share of children placed in apartments, in the
first stage, increased to 3 percent in 2011 and then decreased to 1 percent of the children admitted in
the system in 2014 (with an average of 1 percent).
In section 3.3.2.3. and Figure 56, we have already shown how unevenly these services were developed
in the field. Consequently, the share of children placed in apartments and small group homes varies
accordingly, with the maximum being in those counties that have invested in such services. 362
However, due to the fact that these services were developed in time, there are also counties (such as
Alba and Arad) which, despite having a relatively large number of apartments and small group homes,
have a relatively small number (and share) of children placed in small-scale residential services in the
first stage of their most recent admission into the system. Children ended up in these services only at
later stages, after the dissolution of certain placement centers and after the apartments and small
group homes became available.
Children over 6 years old (especially those aged 15 to 17) are most likely to be placed in apartments in
the first stage after their admission in the system, particularly boys363 of Romanian ethnicity364 (Annex,
6 Table 42-B). Most of these children come from nuclear families with a stable dwelling (86 percent)
who live in poverty (50 percent) and are dysfunctional (21 percent) and/or where there is parental
disability and/or mental health problems (24 percent) as well as alcohol abuse (47 percent). The main
cause of child-family separation was neglect and/or abuse (83 percent). Among the children placed in
apartments immediately after their admission in the system, certain categories of children are over-
represented – those with developmental delays (38 percent versus the average of 17 percent of all
children aged 7 to 17 years old in the system) and those with behavioral disorders (14 percent versus
the average of 10 percent). More than half of the apartment beneficiaries had their cases documented
by the SPAS in a social assessment report of good quality (in that it identified the needs and services
in the community), based on which the emergency placement measure was decided by order of the
DGASPC director. In the other cases, the notification was made by various factors, including by the
child,365 and the final decision was taken mainly by court ruling or presidential ordinance.
Small group homes (CTFs) for children with no disabilities have a typical profile of the beneficiaries
very similar to that for apartments (Annex 6, Table 42-B). Those who are placed in CTFs for children
without disabilities in the first stage following their admission into the system are mainly 3 to 17 year-
old children who suffered from neglect and/or abuse in their families (55 percent versus the average
of 44 percent) or were relinquished in health units at the age of at least 1 year. One out of ten of these


362
   Out of the 24 counties with solid data in the CMTIS, there were high shares of children placed in apartments in Bacău,
Botoșani, and Caraș-Severin. As regards children in small group homes, the highest shares (almost 20 percent) are in
Bacău and Bihor counties. On the other hand, some counties with a large number of apartments and/or small group
homes do not have sufficient CMTIS data to allow for a rigorous analysis, namely Brăila, Maramureș, Mureș, and
Teleorman.
363
   Boys represent 68 percent of the children placed in apartments in the first stage following their entry into the system
(versus the average of 53 percent).
364
   Children of Romanian ethnicity represent 80 percent of the children placed in apartments in the first stage following
their admission into the system (versus the average of 54 percent). Nevertheless, this may partly be an effect of the
under-representation in the CMTIS sample of some counties with a relatively large number of apartments.
365
   Two percent of the apartment beneficiaries entered the system due to requests from the children themselves. This
share is small, but it is ten times higher than for the children placed in other services.

                                                                                                                     251
children was separated from his or her family only because of social reasons such as poverty and
precarious housing. Most came from nuclear families (91 percent), with a stable dwelling (70 percent)
or who lived in multigenerational households, with many children,366 or who lived in poverty (45
percent) and had parents who were abusing alcohol (34 percent). Also, among the children placed in
small group homes for the non-disabled immediately after their admission into the system, children
with behavioral disorders are over-represented (12 percent versus the average of 10 percent children
in care aged 7 to 17 years). Most of the cases of children in this type of CTFs were notified by the
SPAS (35 percent versus the average of 24 percent), by other institutions (in the case of children
relinquished in health units) or were placement requests made by their families (most of which were
avoidable admissions for social reasons) or by the children themselves. The decision to issue a
placement protection measure (63 percent of admissions versus 37 percent admitted with an
emergency placement measure) was taken by CPC (52 percent) or by the DGASPC director.
Small group homes (CTFs) for children with disabilities are very different. Boys and girls of all ages and
ethnicities, originating from both rural and urban areas are placed in such services in the first stage
after they enter the system, but they all have in common being part of one or more of the following
groups with special needs: (i) children with disabilities (67 percent of beneficiaries versus the general
average of 11 percent); (ii) children with developmental delays (60 percent versus the average of 17
percent); (iii) children aged 6-17 years with special educational needs (47 percent versus 9 percent);
and (iv) rarely, children aged 7-17 years with behavior disorders (16 percent versus 10 percent). A
share of 84 percent of the beneficiaries of CTFs for children with disabilities come from nuclear
families where both mother and father were present when the child entered the system. The main
reasons for these separations were child relinquishment in health units (38 percent versus the average
of 29 percent), child neglect (34 percent), or child disability. In fact, avoidable admissions related only
to child disability are over four times more frequent in the case of those in CTFs for children with
disabilities than in the whole population of children in public care (23 percent versus the average of 5
percent). As shown in section 3.2.7, these admissions in the system have both structural causes, such
as the lack of rehabilitation services in the community, and individual causes related to the family’s
lack of resources, incapacity, or lack of interest in meeting the child’s needs.
These cases were generally notified by the SPAS and by the health institutions where the children
were relinquished or were requests from the families. Usually, the case ended up with the CPC which
issued a placement order (67 percent) based on which children were admitted to a small group home
for children with disabilities. For children relinquished in health units, in most cases, the emergency
placement measure was established by order of the DGASPC director.


 CONCLUSIONS

 Small-scale residential services have a clear typical profile. Apartments and most small group homes generally
 meet the needs of children who have experienced neglect and/or abuse in the family, while some small group
 homes are dedicated to children with disabilities.
 However, there are very few small group homes, especially those for children with disabilities, their numbers
 are decreasing, and they are unevenly distributed across the country.




366
  As a result, 72 percent of the children placed in CTFs for children without disabilities in the first stage following their
admission into the system have siblings in the system.

252
Placement Centers
Of the total of 46 percent of all children in the system (as at November 30, 2014) who were initially
placed in residential services, 24 percent were in placement centers, 8 percent in small-scale
residential care (apartments and small group homes), and 14 percent in other services (emergency
reception centers and maternal centers). Thus, not only is the proportion of children in public care
placed in residential services high, but most of these children have lived in placement centers, the
institutions that are the least likely to provide a family environment.
We must take into consideration the fact that this share refers to children who entered the system
over a period of 25 years (1989 to 2014) during which many centers were closed or restructured. The
share of children in placement centers decreased almost tenfold, from 79 percent in the early 1990s to
only 8 percent in 2014 (Annex 6 Figure 12). Nevertheless, out of all children admitted into the system
starting 2005, 8 to 14 percent were placed in placement centers in the first stage following admission.
These trends in time reflect the structural changes in the system. Thus, the decrease in the share of
children placed in placement centers was due to the closing of some structures and reducing the
number of “old type,” “traditional,” or “classical” centers as well as the number of children in these
centers. Meanwhile, the share of children placed in “refurbished,” “restructured”, or “modulated”
centers increased in the 1990s, then slightly decreased and eventually it stabilized to around 6 percent
per year. At the same time, the share of children in the centers taken over from the Ministry of
National Education (MEN) (former dormitories of special (education) schools367) remained relatively
steady at approximately 1 percent of all children in public care.
Placement centers are available in almost all counties in the country, but they are strongly
concentrated in a few counties, as mentioned in section 3.3.2.3. and Figure 56. Accordingly, the share
of children in placement centers in the first stage after their admission in public care closely follows
the distribution of these institutions in the field.
Our analysis in this section considers only the centers that were operational at the time of the research,
where 17 percent of the children in public care were placed.368 Most (9 percent) were placed in
classical placement centers, among which the centers for children without disabilities accommodate
most children (6 percent). Because classical placement centers have been operating for a long time
and for many years they were the only type of child protection service available, the typical profile of
the children placed in these old-type institutions (as can be seen in Annex 6 Table 42-C) was strongly
influenced by the share of children aged 11 to 17 years who were admitted into the system when they
were under 1 year old, in other words before Law 272/2014 entered into force. Thus, our analysis
shows that classical centers (for children with and without disabilities) were institutions that hosted
particularly children aged 0-2 years relinquished in health units (accounting for over 63 percent). As a
result, it was more useful to narrow our analysis of these classical centers down to the last five years
(2010-2014). The data are presented in Annex 6 Table 43.
Out of all children admitted into the system between 2010 and 2014,369 3 percent were placed in
classical placement centers in the first stage following their entry into the system, with 2 percent being
placed in institutions for children without disabilities and 1 percent in centers for children with
disabilities. The following categories of children had an above average probability of being placed in a
classical placement center for children without disabilities in the first stage after their admission into
the system: (i) children 3 to 17 years old who come from families with three or more children,
especially from rural areas; (ii) children who were neglected, abused, and/or exploited within the
family (72 percent), mostly by parents who abused alcohol (36 percent); and (iii) children left home
alone as a result of their parents’ being in detention (13 percent) or having left abroad to work (13

      Special schools are part of the special education system for children with disabilities/deficiencies.
368
   Placement centers that were closed down, which were not included in our analysis, were where 7 percent of the
children in public care were initially placed.
369
  Children placed in placement centers of all types represent 12 percent of the children who entered public care during
2010-2014.

                                                                                                                  253
percent). Very few are children whose mothers are institutionalized, although this share is still ten
times above the average. Out of all children placed in the last five years in classical placement centers
for children without disabilities, one-third were teenagers with behavior disorders, 27 percent were
children with developmental delays, and 71 percent had siblings in the system. Therefore, almost six
out of ten beneficiaries of these classical placement centers are children with special needs. More than
half of the cases were notified and documented by the SPAS, and the protection measure was decided
by a court ruling (22 percent), more frequently than for other children due to parents’ absence or
refusal to cooperate.
Even though the current legislation forbids the institutionalization of children under 3 years old
(except for those with severe disabilities who are dependent on care in residential specialized services),
between 2010 and 2014, the classical placement centers for children with disabilities received children
of all ages (between 0 and 17 years old) but especially boys (66 percent) and children from rural areas
(62 percent). Most of them (85 percent) came from nuclear families made up of a mother, a father,
and two to three children. The prevailing reasons for these children’s separation from their family were
relinquishment in health units (30 percent) and child disability.370 Among the beneficiaries of classical
placement centers for children with disabilities, 20 percent were premature and/or underweight
babies, 80 percent were children with disabilities, 66 percent were children with developmental delays,
and 62 percent among the children aged 6 to 17 had special educational needs. In addition, 27
percent of the children had at least one parent with disabilities and/or mental health problems. These
children entered public care in two ways: those relinquished in hospitals received an emergency
placement ordered by the DGASPC director after being notified by the health unit, and the remaining
children were admitted with a placement measure ordered by the CPC after a request from the child’s
family.
Seven percent of all children in public care were placed in modulated placement centers in the first
stage after their admission into the system, 4 percent of which in restructured institutions for children
without disabilities and 3 percent in centers for children with disabilities (Annex 6 Table 42-C).371
The profile of the children admitted to modulated placement centers for children with disabilities has
been steady in time (see for comparison Annex 6 Table 42-C and Annex 6 Table 43). As opposed to
small group homes and classical placement centers which accommodate children of all ages,
modulated placement centers seem typical of children 0 to 2 years old. Both at the level of the entire
population of children in public care and of the children admitted in the system between 2010 and
2014, approximately 80 percent of the beneficiaries of modulated placement centers are under 3 years
old, particularly infants 0 to 12 months old with health problems. Therefore, the modulated placement
centers for children with disabilities are institutions where young children prevail, most of whom were
relinquished in health units (60 percent) or separated from their family because of the child’s
disabilities (11 percent).372
The profile of children admitted to modulated placement centers for children without disabilities
becomes much clearer when we narrow down the analysis to the period 2010 to 2014 (Annex 6 Table
43). Children 3 to 10 years old have a higher than average probability of being placed in a modulated
placement center for children without disabilities in the first stage after entering the system and
represent 71 percent of the beneficiaries of these services. Although most of them are of Romanian
ethnicity, Roma children are statistically over-represented (15 percent). More than three-quarters of all
of these children come from nuclear families with three or more children where both parents live at
home, who live in extreme poverty and substandard homes (67 percent). Also, 88 percent of them
have siblings who are also in the system.



370
   The share of children in modulated placement centers for children with disabilities separated from their families due
to neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation is below average (23 percent versus 44 percent).
371
   Of the children admitted into the system between 2010 and 2014, 6 percent were placed in modulated placement
centers - half in those for children without disabilities, and half in those for children with disabilities (Annex 6 Table 43).
372
  The share of children in classical placement centers for children with disabilities separated from their families due to
neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation is below average (34 percent versus 44 percent).

254
The reasons for these children being separated from their families were child negligence, abuse,
and/or exploitation (65 percent), social causes related to poverty and precarious housing (18 percent),
or parental factors (12 percent).373 Thus, a large share of avoidable entries into the system can be
found in the modulated placement centers for children without disabilities. The great majority (81
percent) of the beneficiaries of these centers entered public care (SPS- special protection system)
directly from the family (via route Maternity ward --> Family with stable accommodation --> SPS), but
two rare routes are also over-represented: (i) Maternity ward --> Family with no stable
accommodation or homeless --> SPS (5 percent) and (ii) Maternity ward --> Family --> Children who
ran away from home/street children --> SPS (1 percent). Associated with this, children with behavioral
disorders represent 16 percent of the beneficiaries of modulated placement centers for children
without disabilities, versus the average of 10 percent. Given the profile of the prevailing share among
these centers’ beneficiaries, children most often end up in modulated placement centers for children
without disabilities based on CPC order after a notification by the SPAS or at the request of the child’s
family.
The third type of placement centers are former dormitories of special schools taken over from the
Ministry of National Education (MEN centers). (See for comparison Annex 6 Table 42-C and Annex 6
Table 43.) These MEN centers can be either the classical type or the modulated type. Given the small
number of children in the modulated-type MEN centers, we will limit the discussion to the classical-
type ones. Only 1 percent of all children in public care (and 2 percent of those who entered the system
between 2010 and 2014) were placed in such institutions in the first stage following their admission
into the system. These services were and remained mainly former dormitories/boarding houses of
special (or inclusive) education schools. However, in the last few years, they have been taking other
types of cases as well. The centers taken over from MEN mainly contain children between 7 and 17
years old, of whom 53 percent are girls and 47 percent are boys. The majority of the beneficiaries are
children with disabilities (36 percent), with developmental delays (40 percent) and/or special
educational needs (41 percent of the children between 6 and 17 years) who came mostly from nuclear
families (82 percent) with many children (61 percent), with whom they have good relations (over 50
percent). Also, 62 percent of the beneficiaries have siblings in the system.
For 40 percent of them, child disability was the reason why they entered the system (versus the
average of 5 percent). However, in their case, the child disability actually refers to a structural factor,
namely the absence in their community or near their home of any opportunity to attend school. The
other 60 percent of the beneficiaries entered the system due to neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation (48
percent) or social causes related to poverty and precarious housing (9 percent) or other causes. Most
of the children in classical MEN centers entered the system directly from their families, but one out of
every ten children came from a homeless family or one without a stable dwelling. The cases were
generally documented by the SPAS based on social assessment reports that largely failed to identify
the children’s needs or the community services or assistance provided to them before they entered
the system. Among those who entered the system in order to attend school, most were taken in
following their family’s request, usually based on a placement measure established by CPC. The other
cases were either notified by the SPAS or the children made their own requests, with the protection
measures being emergency placements issued by the DGASPC director.
The present study did not collect data on the quality of the special protection services, or on the
equipment or costs of residential services. Nevertheless, during the qualitative study, DGASPC
specialists often brought up the fact that most of the residential services, including old-type or
restructured placement centers, apartments and small group homes, were noticeably improved over
the last ten years. According to the specialists, the main problem is the overcrowding in the centers, at
least in those counties with many classical centers.
         “Because our centers are overcrowded with children. We cannot even provide the conditions
         required by the minimum standards first and foremost because there are many more children
         [than there are available centers/space]. You know, you are conducting a survey now, but in order

  Most frequently, parental factors refer to alcohol abuse and/or promiscuous behavior, problems with the police,
and/or having a criminal record.

              to understand the real situation, you need to see what the Directorate’s centers look like and
              what these children’s homes are like. Because we provide them with all the necessary amenities in
              the centers. In fact, the children do not want to return home because here they have everything
              while home they have nothing. We have an obligation by standards and law to provide them with
              everything any child needs. It’s not only about the child, we even provide members of their
              families with necessary things, but we do not give them the first right granted by the law, the
              right to live with their natural family.” (Focus group with professionals, Craiova)



 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS

 The problems of placement centers are strongly related to those of children with special needs. Most residential
 services, including small-scale ones, were and still are concentrations of children with special needs. As
 presented in the figure below, the accumulated share of groups with special needs – children with disabilities,
 children with developmental delays, premature or underweight babies aged 0 to 12 months, children between 6
 and 17 years old with special educational needs, and children between 7 and 17 years old with behavioral
 disorders – represent 56 percent of the children initially placed in apartments and 90 percent of those initially
 placed in small group homes for children with disabilities. As a comparison, children from these groups
 represent only 10 to 12 percent of those placed with relatives and less than a quarter of those placed with other
 individuals or families or with foster parents.

 child development, especially in the early years. The UN Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children say
 that “facilities providing residential care should be small and be organized around the rights and needs of the
                                                                                                  376
 child, in a setting as close as possible to a family or small group situation.” There are studies that prove that
 reducing the number of children in care from groups of 12 to 14 to groups of 6 to 7 children while also reducing
 the number of caretakers to two per group has a remarkable positive impact on children’s development, even
 those with severe disabilities, across a wide range of abilities (motor, cognitive, personal-social, adaptive, and
 communicational), as well as in terms of the relationship between the child and his/her caretaker. Therefore, in
 order to provide children with adequate support, protection, and care to enable their full intellectual, physical,
 and mental development, the current placement centers must be replaced with small-scale services.

Other Residential Services
The other residential services discussed in this section are the emergency reception centers (for
neglected, abused and/or exploited children) and the maternal centers (for mothers and their children
at risk). In the first stage after they entered the system, 14 percent of the children in public care were
placed in these services, 13 percent in emergency reception centers (CPRU) and only 1 percent in
maternal centers (CM). Annex 6 Figure 13 shows that these shares followed different trends over time.
The percentage of children placed in emergency reception centers increased approximately ten times
between the beginning of the 1990s and 2003 (from 2 percent to 19 percent), while these services
were being developed, after which it remained relatively constant except for two periods of steep
decline, once between 2004 and 2006 and once after 2011 (from 21 percent to 10 percent in 2014). By
contrast, the percentage of children placed with their mothers in maternal centers has consistently
been around 1 to 2 percent. However, these are children who went into the maternal centers only to
remain in public care, which means they are representative of maternal center beneficiaries for whom
efforts to prevent child-family separation failed.
As of November 30, 2014, there were 67 emergency reception centers (CPRU) operating in the country,
with one to three in each county except for Sălaj county with five and Satu Mare and Ilfov counties
with none. Approximately one in every eight children in public care was initially placed in an
emergency reception center (Annex 6 Table 42-D). The children most likely to be placed in emergency
reception centers were those between 3 and 14 years old, especially those from rural areas (53
percent), from nuclear families with three or more children (63 percent), from families in which one or
both parents abused alcohol (36 percent) and/or behaved promiscuously, had problems with the
police, and/or had a criminal record (12 percent), and with whom the children did not have good
relations before entering the system (53 percent of children aged 6 and over). Most of the
beneficiaries entered the emergency reception center directly from their family, but there is an over-
representation of children left home alone after their parent’s departure (2 percent), children from
families who lived wherever they could (4 percent), those in the care of non-relatives (3 percent),
children relinquished on the street or in public places (over 1 percent), and children who had run away
from home (2 percent). Children with developmental delays (26 percent) and with behavioral disorders
(18 percent) are also statistically over-represented. The main reason for these children being
separated from their families was child neglect, abuse, and/or exploitation (67 percent of the children
placed in emergency reception centers in the first stage after they entered the system). Almost all
beneficiaries entered the emergency reception centers based on an emergency placement measure
established by order of the DGASPC director, but 8 percent of the beneficiaries had a placement
measure.
As of November 30, 2014, there were one to three maternal centers (CM) operating in every county
except Caraș-Severin and Covasna as well as in sectors 3 and 6 of Bucharest. These centers provide
accommodation and specialized interventions for mother and child with the aim to prevent separation.
Annex 6 Table 42-D shows that children with a higher than average probability of being placed in a
maternal center are those between 0 and 2 years old (especially those under 1 year old),377 who come
from nuclear families (94 percent), most with two to three children (61 percent). From the groups of
children with special needs, premature and/or underweight babies represent almost a quarter of all
maternal center beneficiaries aged between 0 and 12 months. The children who received care in
maternal centers and remained in the system are more likely than average to have mothers who are
teenagers, mothers with disabilities and/or with mental health problems. Also, one out of every eight
children remained in the system because their mother was homeless or did not have a stable dwelling.
In situations such as these, the preventive services provided by the maternal centers seem to have
been less effective.

   Children between 0 and 12 months old represent 56 percent of children initially placed in maternal centers and those
between 1 and 2 years old represent 23 percent of those children.

 RECOMMENDATION
 Additional research is needed on the efficiency of maternal centers in preventing child-family separation in
 order to identify what other services should complement the existing ones or what regulations should be
 changed to improve the outcomes of maternity centers and to reduce the number of children remaining in the
 system.




The First Protection Service in Which Children with Special Needs Are Placed When
They Enter the System
In this section, instead of looking at services, we shall be focusing on the initial placements of children
with special needs and if there have been any modifications in how these placements were made over
time. The distribution of groups with special needs over the entire period 1989 to 2014 and over the
last five years (2010-2014) are presented in Figure 61.
According to the regulations introduced since 2005, the share of children between 0 and 12 months
old who were placed in residential services (of all types) decreased from 46 percent to 16 percent of
the children who entered the system between 2010 and 2014. However, even in the last two years,
approximately one in every seven babies who enter the system is still placed in residential services
(with less than 3 percent being placed in maternal centers). This is probably because of the legal
exception (at the time of the research) allowing the institutionalization of children under 3 years old if
they have severe disabilities and are dependent on care in specialized residential services. Thirty
percent of children who need a great deal of support, such as premature and/or underweight babies,
were placed in a residential service, especially in placement centers for children with disabilities, in the
period 2010 to 2014. However, this age segment also registers the most progress, with high and
increasing shares of children who, at least in the first stage, were placed in a family-type service.
For children aged between 1 and 2 years, the situation improved considerably less, with the share of
those initially placed in a residential service decreasing from 43 percent of all children in public care to
34 percent of those who entered between 2010 and 2014. Of these, 8 percent are in placement
centers.378
As for children who entered the system at the age of 3, the new regulations were too recent to have
affected the data from November-December 2014. Thus, over half of the 3 year-olds who entered the
system between 2010 and 2014 were placed in residential services, 13 percent of which in placement
centers.379 In other words, even now (at the time of the research), a significant share of children in
public care spend their first years of their life, when their brains are developing, in an inappropriate
and unstimulating environment.
Children in other groups with special needs were strongly concentrated in residential services. For
example, as can be seen in Figure 61, children with disabilities had very little chance of being initially
placed with relatives (12 percent versus the average of 23 percent),380 with a professional foster carer
(11 percent versus the average of 25 percent),381 or with other individuals or families (3 percent versus
the average of 4 percent).382 A similar situation is evident for the other groups with special needs as
well.

378
   The others were placed in an emergency reception center (11 percent), in small residential services (11 percent),
especially in small group homes for children with disabilities, in maternal centers (3 percent), and in other services (1
percent).
379
   The others were initially placed as follows: 24 percent in emergency reception centers, 9 percent in small group
homes for children without disabilities, and 5 percent in apartments or in small group homes for children with
disabilities.
380
      Children with disabilities represented fewer than 6 percent of children initially placed with relatives.
381
      Children with disabilities represented fewer than 5 percent of children initially placed with professional foster carers.
382
   Children with disabilities represented fewer than 7 percent of children initially placed with other individuals or
families.

Therefore, 70 to 80 percent of children with disabilities, children with developmental delays, children
between 6 and 17 years old with special educational needs, and children between 7 and 17 years old
with behavioral disorders have been and still are being placed in residential services. Of these children,
more than half of the children with disabilities and those with special educational needs were in
placement centers. The children with developmental delays were distributed in three approximately
equal parts between emergency reception centers, placement centers and other residential services. In
contrast, children with behavioral disorders went mostly to emergency reception centers (34 percent)
but also to placement centers (20 percent), small residential services (14 percent), maternal centers (2
percent), and other services such as specialized supervision (10 percent).
The subject of specialized supervision and, more generally, of the lack of services for children and
young people with behavioral disorders was brought up by the DGASPC specialists in the qualitative
research. Some typical opinions on this subject were as follows:
        ”If you were to consider the characteristics of the beneficiaries, are there any barriers to
        implementing the activities?
        - Many of the beneficiaries in our care show signs of behavioral disorders. They are usually taken
        into the system at quite an advanced age when it is already too late to intervene and change the
        way they are.* Recently we took in a lot of trafficked girls. They were trying to create a group of
        customers and when I introduced them into the system, I was not able to intervene efficiently
        since there were no specialized centers for certain categories of beneficiaries. The only ones
        available in my case are those for children with disabillities and those for normal children. Within
        the group that includes the normal child, I have to deal with different characters and typologies
        of beneficiaries who interact with other children and lead them to indulge in anti-social behavior,
        those who are already part of the group in question. At least in residential centers, if we happen
        to take over some siblings aged, say, 17, 15 and a younger one of 12, it is very difficult to mold
        them, since they have a certain level of knowledge and their personalities have been shaped
        already. It is really difficult and I start to wonder whether it was a good thing I took in that young
        person from the community. And we take in a lot of kids who do not attend school. I try to
        integrate them into the school system when they are 15, 16, 17 years old by using The Second
        Chance program, the types of education for those who have not been in school at the proper age.
        Their reintegration is very difficult to achieve. Considering their behavior, it is extremely hard. We
        are not prepared to deal with behavior disorders and with young delinquents. I put a delinquent
        under the same roof with three other children, and if we are talking about a child who has the
        ability to manipulate others, then one of the other three will definitely end up being a delinquent
        too.
        So, you are saying that specialized centers or services are required for this type of behavior?

        - Yes. I was thinking at a certain point, I know that I saw a documentary somewhere in Germany
        about those community corrections. Young people who had committed anti-social crimes were
        brought somewhere to a village. They were taken over by two or three educators who submitted
        them to a whole range of physical and intellectual activities. Rehabilitation was achieved by
        activity. What should I do here in the middle of Bacău? Besides household activities and
        psychological counseling, there is nothing else that can be done. And the number of children
        that the Prosecutor’s Office sends us for specialized supervision is constantly increasing. I do not
        have the right place to proceed with this specialized supervision because the required services
        have not been developed. And across the country, the number of services dedicated to this
        specific purpose is quite low. I believe that those community correction programs would be
        beneficial in this regard and that they should be developed. Because the number of these
        children is increasing and a lot of them choose to leave school. The delusion about leaving the
        country takes control over them, they come in contact with different kinds of individuals, there
        are a lot of networks available at the community level that take advantage of the fact that these
        children are in public care. The thing is that we cannot have full control of a child’s life, we cannot
        do this and we should not do it either...” (Interview with a DGASPC specialist, Bacău)
Note: *We believe these attitudes and stereotypes need to be addressed and actively discouraged.

Before we conclude, we should highlight once again the fact that now, as well as in the past,
approximately two-thirds of the children who entered public care for social reasons related to parental
factors, and approximately three-quarters admitted for reasons of poverty and precarious housing are
in family-type services, particularly placement with relatives. Therefore, in order to address avoidable
entries, a reassessment of family-type serviced should first be conducted.
The available data only allow for an analysis of the type of protection service in which the young or
older children are placed, whether they are boys or girls, Roma or from other ethnic groups, with or
without special educational needs. They do not make it feasible to test hypotheses about the possible
existence of discriminatory practices for placing certain groups in “better” or “worse” services.


 RECOMMENDATIONS
 The legislation in force and the new methodologies prepared by the ANPDCA provide a good regulatory
 framework, which, however, is only partially implemented. It is particularly necessary to accelerate the
 implementation of the regulations regarding the placement of children under the age of 3 in family-type care
 services instead of in residential services.
 It is also necessary to eliminate the exception regarding children aged 0-3 with severe disabilities, who for the
 time being do not have equal opportunities as the other children in the system.
 Considering the large-scale concentration of children with special needs in residential services, especially
 placement centers, there is a pressing need to develop procedures governing the placement of children with
 disabilities as well as of those with developmental delays and/or special educational needs, in order to provide
 these children with a real chance of personal development and of living as independent a life as possible.
 Also, most counties will need to develop psychological counseling and support services for children with
 behavioral disorders.




3.3.3                 The First Individualized Protection Plan
In Romania, Law 272/2004 introduced the case management principles in the field of child protection,
and Order 286/2006383 set out the detailed methodological rules governing the drawing up of the
Individualized Protection Plan (PIP) for each child. According to these regulations, the PIP must be
initiated immediately after the case has been referred to the DGASPC by the SPAS (or after the
DGASPC director has ordered the emergency placement). Depending on the case in question, the PIP
may have one of the following goals: (i) reintegrating the child within their family of origin; (ii)
fostering the socio-professional integration of young adults aged 18+ who are about to leave the
child protection system; or (iii) pursuing a domestic adoption.
Figure 62 shows the distribution of children who entered public care each year starting 2005 up until
2014, by the PIP goal that was established for them when they first entered the system. The
percentage of children whose PIP goal was reintegrating with their family rose from 69 percent of
those who entered the system in 2005 to 92 percent in 2014. Adoption was the goal assigned to 9-10
percent of the children who entered the system in 2005, but this dropped abruptly to 3 percent in
2014 after Law 273/2004 on adoption was updated.

The share of children whose PIP goal was socio-professional integration also dropped significantly,
from 7 percent of the children who entered public care in 2005 to 1 percent of those who entered in
2014 (with an average percentage of 4 percent over the entire period). This PIP goal is reserved for
children who are about to leave the protection system when they come of age (18 years old). As the
sample for this analysis is the children who were still in public care in November-December 2014, this
means that at least some of the young people who received this PIP goal at the beginning of the
period under analysis had left the system by the time of the study. Other than these three goals, for 2
percent of the children the goal as stated in the case files was life skills training, transfer to an adult
care center, or other goals. Three percent of the children in public care in 2014 had no PIP goal set in
their files (a decline from 6 percent in 2005), and 2 percent of the children had no information at all on
this matter in their case files.
There were significant discrepancies between children from different counties in terms of their PIP
goals (Figure 62, bottom chart). Reintegration within the family is the prevailing goal for the entire
population of children in the special protection system. However, in the PIPs, it varied between 58
percent of the children in Caraș-Severin and 92 percent in Harghita among the 24 counties with solid
data in the CMTIS. Adoption was stated as a goal for fewer than 5 percent of the children in several
counties (with a minimum of 1 percent in Arad and Gorj), while in other counties it was stated for
more than 10 percent of the children (with a maximum of 28 percent in Caraș-Severin).384 The
percentage of children for whom no PIP goal was established also varied between virtually zero in
Bihor and Bistrița-Năsăud and approximately one in ten children in Arad, Sibiu, and Suceava. Thus, the
way in which the PIP goal is assigned to children seems to vary significantly from one county to
another.
Although reintegration within the family was not specified as the goal for all children in public care
(Annex 6 Table 44), it was still the prevailing goal for most children, except for teenagers (particularly
those between 15 and 17 years old), those with socio-professional integration as their PIP goal (13
percent for those aged 11 to 14 and 3 percent for those aged 15 to 17), children whose parents had
died or were institutionalized, children relinquished in health units, children with teenage mothers,
and those with multiple entries in public care.

  Other counties with quite high percentages of children whose PIP goal was adoption were Prahova (10 percent), Satu
Mare (10 percent), Vâlcea (10 percent), Mehedinți (14 percent), and Galați (17 percent).

                                                                                                                     263
Adoption was more likely than average to be the first goal specified in the PIP for children under 1
year old, for those from families with no extended family support (whether or not the parent/parents
is/are home), for children whose mothers are teenagers when their children entered the system, and
for those relinquished in health units.385 The categories of children who were less likely than average
to receive adoption as their first PIP goal were children with disabilities, children aged 7-17 with
behavioral disorders, and children with siblings in the system. In contrast, premature and/or
underweight babies, children with developmental delays, and those aged 6 to 17 with SEN had an
average likelihood of receiving adoption as their PIP goal (see also Annex 6 Table 44).
There is a significant correlation between the first PIP goal and the age of the child upon entering the
system (Figure 64). Thus, adoption was the PIP goal assigned to one in every five children aged 0 to 12
months and one in every ten children aged 1 year old, while for children aged 2 years, the adoption
share suddenly dropped to 5 percent and was hardly used at all for children over 9 years of age. In
contrast, socio-professional integration was stated as the first PIP goal for 2 percent of the children
aged between 0 and 7 years old, rising with the children’s age, reaching 100 percent of 18 year olds.

Socio-professional integration was set as a first PIP goal for about 4 percent of children in public care.
Those with a higher than average probability of receiving this goal were children aged 11-17 (when
they entered the system), boys and girls alike, children from rural areas (6 percent versus 3 percent
from urbans areas), those with good relationships with their parents or family, children with SEN
attending special education schools, and children with behavioral disorders. Unlike the goal of family
reintegration, the socio-professional integration goal seems to be underused. However, this may be
because this analysis is limited to the first PIP goal established for the child as soon as he or she enters
public care.
There is very little connection between the first PIP goal assigned to the child and the first service in
which the child is placed after entering the system. The only exceptions to this are very young and
older children. Young children with the greatest chances of being adopted are mostly placed in
family-type services, while the services in which the older children are mainly placed (for example,
apartments) are appropriate for the socio-professional integration PIP goal (Annex 6 Table 44).
According to the regulations, the PIP should be preceded by a service plan aimed at preventing the
child’s separation from their family. This plan is requested by the DGASPC and is drawn up,
implemented, and monitored by SPAS or staff with social assistance duties at the community level as

   A large number of children from urban areas and of those with undeclared ethnicity also received adoption as their
PIP goal.

discussed in section 3.2.5.4. However, Annex 6 Table 44 shows that the only correlation between the
first PIP goal and the information underlying it seemed to be for children who were assigned adoption
as their PIP goal. Most of these were children taken from hospital units and, therefore, the majority of
them had no service plan and/or quality social assessment report.
As far as the way in which the PIP goal is established, a recent control report386 from the ANPDCA
found that:
      The PIPs contain objectives that do not help to achieve the proposed goal (such as counseling for
       the mother with a view to family reintegration even though the mother’s address is unknown).
      Adoption is sometimes established as a child’s PIP goal without first having exhausted the options
       for reintegrating the child with his/her family or without establishing any changes in the family
       situation at the time the special protection measure is being established.
      Specialists often do not actively look for the children’s relatives up to the fourth degree before
       placing the children with substitute families, usually because the relevant population records do
       not keep track of the population by degree of kinship.
      The child’s relatives are not informed about the steps they need to take to enable the
       reintegration of the child.
As Table 35 shows, only approximately half of the children in the special protection system had a list
of relatives up to the fourth degree in their case file. Only for children whose PIP goal was adoption
did specialists make more intensive efforts to find the child’s relatives, but even here only for 60
percent of them.

According to the DGASPC experts, the PIP goal specified for almost three-quarters of the children in
public care is adequate and relevant (Table 35).387 The percentage drops to 68 percent of those with
adoption as their PIP goal. For the other quarter, the experts either mentioned a different goal than
the one in the case files (3 percent) or explained the reasons why that goal could not be achieved. For
instance, in the case of adoption, the experts mentioned that the reason why no adoptive family was
found for some children was because sometimes children were only “given an adoption goal by

   It is worthwhile mentioning that even for 65 percent of the children with no PIP, DGASPC specialists still considered
that the PIP goal was both relevant and adequate given the child’s situation.

                                                                                                                    265
number without any real chance of being adopted,”388 because the parents refused to give their
consent, or the child refused to be adopted. As far as reintegration within the family is concerned, the
experts invoked the various risk factors we have already discussed in this report (parents are deceased,
parents are unknown, parents are gone abroad, there are no relatives, grandparents are too old,
insufficient financial means, parents have no job, homelessness, parents abuse alcohol, lack of daycare
units and community recovery and rehabilitation services), while they believed that socio-professional
integration is mainly hindered by the lack of protected jobs.
However, most of the DGASPC experts referred to two groups of children with special needs for which
none of the PIP goals is adequate - children with behavioral disorders and children with disabilities.
For children with behavioral disorders, the system does not provide the most efficient services to
prepare them for an independent life or to reintegrate them within their families. For children with
disabilities, especially for those with severe handicaps, long-term placements are necessary. For youths
with disabilities who are about to leave the system, the experts said that what is needed is sheltered
workshops389 with permanent surveillance along with ensuring housing to enable some of them to live
a (semi)-independent life.
The problem is that there are only three PIP goals to cover a wide variety of children’s situations,
needs, preferences, and circumstances. Establishing comprehensive and appropriate sub-goals for the
various categories of children is absolutely necessary to enable child protection specialists to establish
achievable objectives and roadmaps for each child, in connection with the provision of a more
diversified package of services for that child.
Besides its goal, the PIP is developed along specific intervention programs (PIS) for each child. These
programs should meet a broad range of needs390 and “should specify short, medium, and long-term
objectives, activities appropriate for those objectives, which may be regular, routine, or determined by
certain procedures or events, the duration of the activities, the designated responsible specialized staff
and other stakeholders, and the methods envisaged for program monitoring and
evaluation/reevaluation.” (Order 286/2006)
In addition to the challenge of effectively achieving the PIP goal, the implementation of these specific
intervention programs (PIS) also involves practical problems that were often brought up in discussions
by the DGASPC experts.
            “To what extent do you consider that the activities set out in the PIP are being followed?
            - We are trying to stick to them because that’s why we do them and everything that’s in the plan,
            so we also follow those PIS that we develop... based on the PIP and there are short-term,
            medium-term, and long-term objectives, there are the formal communications that we send to
            the person’s records department or to the city hall, to the local police to see if the parents have
            shown up in their area of residence, if they have returned from abroad, and, if they did not, to
            find a way to contact the parent somehow. Being from different villages, we cannot see from here
            if they came back home or not, and when they return, the parents do not always come on the
            first or second day to visit us, sometimes they don’t even come to see their child or they come on
            the last day before they leave again; they say “I’m going to catch the train or to take the bus” or
            some other transportation from Craiova and in that situation, we submit a formal communication,
            we submit a lot of them every three months, we come back [to the area] to see if the parent has

   According to Law 448/2006 on protecting and promoting the rights of people with disabilities, sheltered workshops
(which may be located in community facilities, daycare centers, residential centers and special education facilities) are
settings adapted to the needs of people with disabilities, enabling them to receive skill training and development and
improvement activities.
390
    These needs are: (i) health and health promotion needs; (ii) the need for care, including the provision and promotion
of the child’s welfare; (iii) physical and emotional needs; (iv) educational needs and the need to ensure that the child
achieves school results appropriate to his/her development potential; (v) the need for leisure; (vi) socialization needs;
(vii) the need to preserve the child’s relationships, as applicable, with his/her parents, extended family, friends, and other
people with whom the child has developed affectional bonds; (viii) the need to develop independent life skills; and (ix)
the need to reintegrate the child with the family.

        returned, or if any relative wishes to take the children and raise them, if their conditions, the
        house in which they lived, have improved, [following] a welfare report or something.
        - Or, for example, we agreed to prepare a contract with the family and if the family has not
        returned to the country, there is no one to do this with. So, there are reasons why the PIS cannot
        be implemented.” (Focus group with specialists, Craiova)

Moreover, many of the DGASPC specialists believe the PIP reevaluation that is required every three
months is a bureaucratic burden that does not benefit the child. This attitude is understandable given
that the entire decision-making process is more administrative than child-centerd and is based on
poor quality and fragmented information.
        “Maybe this PIP should be done initially, but revised only when problems occur, because there
        are situations in which there is no change in the child’s progress and one has to do it every three
        months, which is nothing but a copy-paste job, you see.” (Interview with professionals, Piatra
        Neamț)



 RECOMMENDATIONS

 It is necessary to revise the methodological rules regarding the individualized protection plan (PIP) and related
 specific intervention programs (PIS) to allow for a more comprehensive and effective achievement of the PIP
 goals. On the other hand, diversifying the choice of public care services provided to children is key to
 establishing more effective objectives and intervention plans.

 A small share of children from public care, particularly children with severe disabilities, have a PIP goal
 involving being transferred to an adult center. This type of goal should be eliminated because, otherwise,
 although the child protection system prioritizes deinstitutionalization, it actually prepares some children for
 institutionalization after they turn 18. This means that, for children between 0 and 17 years old, the Romanian
 state acknowledges the importance of care in a family environment, but as soon as the child becomes a young
 adult, the state considers institutionalization as appropriate. Besides the immeasurable negative effects on the
 young adult, this seems to be wasteful in economic terms.
 Of course, too many rules and regulations may limit the work of child protection experts and may require
 them to shift their attention from the child’s interest to the required administrative tasks. However, the entire
 public care decision-making process needs to be based on more systematic and quality information, which is
 inevitably time-consuming to gather and record.

Vignette 1
Please describe clearly how you would proceed in the following hypothetical case: you are notified
about a 10-year-old little girl, Lavinia, currently in public care (in a residential placement, small group
home) who, according to the medical report, suffers from behavioral disorders. Lavinia comes from a
deprived family and has another five siblings, two of whom are also covered by a protection measure.
                           We received answers from 81 case managers, randomly selected from the
                           793 who participated in the study.
                           What is the PIP goal proposed by the case managers for this child?
                           What do case managers think should be done in this case?
                           Most case managers supported the PIP goal of reintegrating Lavinia into
                           her family (31 out of the 47 who responded). When asked what should be
                           done (according to their own opinions but also within the legal framework),
                           most of the interviewed experts recommended various types of services
                           including psychological counseling and services to assess the causes of her
      Reintegration into   behavioral disorders. However, only a few of them recommended working
      family               together with Lavinia and her family in order to support her reintegration
                           into the family or her adoption. Thus, a permanent long-term solution is
      Reintegration or     definitely supported as a PIP goal but less in terms of the courses of action
      adoption
                           in the PIS (specific intervention plan).
      Adoption             Six case managers oscillated between the PIP goals of family reintegration
                           and adoption depending on the intentions of Lavinia’s family. Nevertheless,
                           none of the case managers envisaged adoption as being a “pragmatic”
      Socio-professional
      integration          solution with high odds of success in this situation, as was the case for the
                           child relinquished at birth (Vignette 2). This was probably because of the
      Other PIP goals      age of the child, which decreases the likeliness of a successful adoption, as
                           well as the fact that Lavinia had a group of siblings inside the system, which
                           some of the managers saw as a difficulty in reaching the adoption goal
                           because “the family may adopt only if they are willing to take all of the
                           siblings” (Interview with a professional, Satu Mare).
In the case managers’ opinion, what are the child’s chances of being reintegrated into her
natural family or of being adopted?
Only eight of the case managers considered that there was a strong chance of a successful family
reintegration in this case. Five of the case managers gave a higher chance of success to the adoption
solution in this hypothetical situation. Most of those with no experience of similar cases (28 cases
workers out of 47) opted for a temporary solution, namely keeping Lavinia into the system and
providing her with the necessary specialized services.
On the basis of similar actual cases, the interviewed case managers considered that the most difficult
aspects of the case management related to this hypothetical situation would be: (i) establishing a link
and collaborating with the family or relatives; (ii) offering specialized services, including psychological
counseling and therapy to the child; (iii) family counseling and accountability; (iv) collaborating with
the relevant institutions; (v) monitoring and reevaluating the PIP and the PIS; (vi) establishing the PIP;
(vii) implementing the PIP and training the multidisciplinary team that contributes to the case
management process; and (viii) identifying issues and carrying out an initial and detailed case
evaluation.

3.3.4                 Too Much Time Spent in the System
According to the UN guidelines for child alternative care: “Removal of a child from the care of the
family should be seen as a measure of last resort and should, whenever possible, be temporary and
for the shortest possible duration.”391 We analyzed the time spent by children in the Romanian public
care from this perspective.
On average, a child spends 7.5 years in public care.392 Although the variable is quite evenly distributed,
there is a range of 0 to 25 years, which means that the data should be analyzed carefully. This section
focuses on those categories of children who are more likely than others to spend longer than average
periods of time in the system.393
Girls spend slightly less time in care than boys (on average, 7.3 years versus 7.6 years). There are small
but statistically significant differences related to the child’s ethnicity. On average, Romanian children
spend 7.2 years in the system, Hungarian children spend 7.8 years, and Roma children spend over 8
years.394 The structure of the family from which the child comes is also relevant. Children with
extended families (especially grandparents) have the shortest stays (6.2 years), while children from
single-parent families, especially single-mothers, have the longest (8.35 years).
Before going further, it is worth reflecting on the meaning of the average length of stay in public care
for one group of children or another. The analysis was carried out on children who entered the
protection system at any time between 1989 and 2014 and at any age between 0 and 17 years.
Consequently, most differences between various groups of children, even if statistically significant, are
in fact a combined effect of the mix of the ages of those children when they entered the system and
the year in which they entered the system. This relationship is not simple. For example, older children
do not automatically spend more time in public care because they may have entered the system when
they were 1 to 2 months old or when they were 17 years old. At the same time, two children entering
public care at the same age may spend very different lenghts of time in the system depending on
their entry year. If among Roma children, for instance, there is an over-representation of children
relinquished in the maternity hospital395 who entered the system in the 1990s, then the difference
between this group and another in terms of length of stay is not determined by ethnicity but is the
result of the combination between their entry ages and the number of years at group level.
Based on this reasoning, we analyzed the length of stay in the system by groups of children based on
what age they were when they entered the system and their current age (as of November-December
2014). Results are reported in Figure 65. These showed that:
(i) The average length of stay in public care increases with the age of the child, from 0.1 years for the
group aged under 12 months to 12.4 years for those aged 18 and 26 (and over). This monotonous
growth is determined by the existence, within all age groups, of a significant percentage of children
who entered the system when they were under 1 year old (usually, after they were relinquished in a
maternity ward).

(ii) The average length of stay drops to half or even one-third for children who entered the system at
the age of 3 or more, at the level of all age groups. For example, for the group of youths aged
between 18 and 26, the average length of stay in the system is 18.1 years for those who entered the
system when they were a few months old, but this drops to 17.1 years for those who entered the
system when they were 1 to 2 years old and is as low as 10.5 years for the children who entered the
system when they were 3-17 years of age. Consequently, the general average of 12.4 years spent in
public care by youth groups aged between 18 and 26 is the combined result of these three subgroups.
The same pattern can be observed for all age groups.
The analysis refers to children in public care, in other words, the children who have not completed
their stay in the system during the period of time under scrutiny. Consequently, it is only a snapshot of
a moving target. One year spent in the system may not seem much from the perspective of the adult
making the decision to place the children in care, but for a 1 year old, this is equivalent to his/her
entire life. To better understand this phenomenon, we need a time reference. For this purpose, we
chose the period of time between the child’s birth and the present time (Nov-Dec 2014), meaning the
entire life of the child, to which we related the length of time spent in the system. As such (see Figure
65, bottom graph), it is obvious that, regardless of their current age, the children who entered the
system when they were under 1 year of age stand a very good chance of spending their entire life
until they are 18 to 26 years old in the child protection system, including the first years of life, which
are crucial for their development. For children who entered the system when they were between 1 and
2 years of age, the situation is somewhat better, but among them, those who were 7 to 10 years old in
November-December 2014 had already spent 78 percent of their life in the system, and the equivalent
percentage is 88 percent for those young people who were 18 to 26 years of age at the time of the
case files survey.
Among the groups of children with special needs, only children with disabilities, especially those with
severe or accentuated disabilities, spent a longer than average period of time in public care. Those
who spent a shorter than average time in the system (5.5 years) were children with SEN because most
of them stay in public care only during the school year.

with disabilities and/or mental health problems. None of the other characteristics of the child and/or
family are relevant to the length of stay in the system.

The particular first protection service in which the child is placed is not relevant either, nor are the
protection measure or the child’s PIP goal. However, if we further divide the period of time spent in
public care into stages determined by changes in the child’s protection measure, service, or service
provider, significant differences can be noted (Figure 66). Over a quarter of the children in public care
passed through three to ten different stages, most of them changing their service provider (for
example, being transferred from one professional foster carer to another or from a center to another
center of the same type). Such routes within the system are illustrated in Infograph Charts 5 and 6.
Our analysis of the length of stay in public care by the number of stages that the child goes through
found that children for whom a stable solution was found (only one stage) had spent an average of 82
months in the system. Most of them were not young children but were 7 to 26 years old and were
placed with relatives or foster carers. Among those with two stages, most of them were children aged
3 to 10 who had entered the system with an emergency placement measure after being relinquished
in a maternity hospital. Subsequently, their protection measure was changed to placement, and they
were placed with professional foster carers. This category of children has also spent only 80 months
on average in the system.
For children who have gone through three stages or more, the average lengths of stay in the system
increase (Figure 66 top graph). Variations can be noted also in stage lengths, protection services and
service providers. This category includes the children who entered the system before the public care
reform process. Figure 68 (bottom graph) shows that, starting 2004, the percentage of children with
stable solutions (those who have only gone through one or two stages) has grown significantly, while
the percentage of those with frequent changes decreased considerably.
The number of stages that each child goes through is not only determined by changes in the related
legislation, but also, to a great extent, by the combination of protection services available at the
county level (see section 3.3.2) as well as by the DGASPC strategies for the various categories of
children. Figure 68 (top graph) illustrates the current differences between counties. In Mehedinți 90
percent of the children in public care went through only one or two stages regardless of their age,
whereas in Sibiu (a county with many placement centers), almost half of the children went through
frequent changes/stages.


  RECOMMENDATIONS
 To reduce the length of time spent by children in public care, not only must the number of exits increase but
 also the number of children who enter the system under the age of 1 (especially after being relinquished in
 maternity hospitals) must decrease. This section has shown that these children are at a high risk of staying in
 the system during their entire childhood and adolescence, although they stand a good chance of being
 adopted if their natural family refuses to reintegrate them.

 A child spends an average of 7.5 years in public care in Romania. However, over 13,000 children have already
 spent their entire lives so far only in the system.



                                                                                  1-25%
        Length of stay in the system as                                           26-50%
             % of the entire child's life                                         51-99%
                                                                                  100%



 The fact that one in every five children aged between 15 and 26 now in public care has spent his or her entire
 life in the system and almost one in every three has spent 90 percent of their life in the system demonstrates
 the urgent need to develop exit paths that would offer these children real chances for the future. Because they
 entered public care 15 to 26 years ago, they are likely to have gone through many centers, but the “system” is
 the only family they know. When these young adults reach the age when they have to leave, the “system”
 simply withdraws just as their parents disappeared when they were little, leaving them with no independent
 life skills, no solid education to enable them to earn their living, and with no housing choices.

  RECOMMENDATIONS
 Not only do these individuals spend years in the system, but many of them are often moved from one place to
 another, from one service to another, for periods varying from 2 to 60 months. The situation has improved in
 the last years, but the consistency of child care is still not a paramount consideration.

 Our key recommendation is to shorten the time spent by children in public care and to shift the focus on the
 family model, by increasing the capacity and the number of professionals who provide direct care, flexible
 interventions across multiple needs and, most importantly, who have strong communication skills when
 working with children. Moreover, it is essential to support the reintegration of children within their
 families/communities by allocating resources to fund services in the community and focusing interventions on
 the child, not on the system, so that the child may grow up in a family and break the cycle of disadvantage.




3.3.5            Children’s Voice
Only 58 percent of the case files of children in care aged 10 or older mentioned their opinions about
the separation from their families and the establishment of the protection measure. The children
whose files contained this information were mostly boys over the age of 15, of Romanian or
Hungarian ethnicity, with no disabilities or SEN but with behavioral disorders.
For two-thirds of the 10-year-old children and older, there is no mention or statement in their files
about their opinions of the quality of the services they have received or their level of satisfaction. In
other words, two of every three children in public care do not seem to be consulted as to their
opinions and preferences. The one-third who were consulted gave fairly positive opinions. These
positive opinions tended to be expressed mostly by female children under 15, of Romanian ethnicity,
with no disabilities or developmental delays, while negative opinions tended to be expressed by male
children over the age of 14, with disabilities, developmental delays, and/or SEN.

(N=35,358 children 10 years old and older).

Overall, children demonstrated a positive perception of the material and housing conditions in public
care, but at the same time those who participated in our focus group discussions spoke of their need
for affection, understanding, and communication on the part of the staff. While children emphasize
the communicational and emotional side, specialists are mostly concerned with issues related to the
material and housing conditions in the centers.




                                                                                                          277
            “What is missing in the center where you are staying? I see some of you have not rated it at 10. The
            ones who didn’t rate it at 10, what is missing? What would make you… what should change for you
            to rate it at 10?
            - To know that at least one person in that house will take your side and will never betray you, or
            will… Because I don’t trust them… if only a little bit, a fraction if they could love me too.
            Seriously… there things are…
            So they don’t love you?

            - No.
            Why do you say that?

            - Because I feel them.” (Focus group with children in public care, Craiova)

Even if, in general, the living conditions in the centers have improved in recent years, a recent study396
showed that the system is deficient in terms of working with the beneficiaries. “Young people have
been complaining of the lack of programs designed for their leisure time, for the development of
independent life skills, and for socialization activities outside the sheltering institution. Other young
people have been complaining that they are not allowed to have a girlfriend or boyfriend, as the case
may be, the DGASPC employees’ motivation being: ‘We are protecting them. They don’t understand
that, but [otherwise] we can expect to find newborns on our doorstep any time.’ Nobody talks to them
about sexual and contraceptive education, everything is taboo. This is how young people end up
having sexual identity crises, moments of searching for their own identity.”
When they were asked what made them happy, children said their siblings who are with them in the
system, their parents’ visits, telephone conversations with their parents, and the chance to continue
their studies.
            “- What makes me unhappy is that I wish my parents would visit me a little more often. That’s it...

            - What makes me happy first of all is that I have my siblings with me and this is what I enjoy most.
            And what makes me unhappy is that my parents don’t visit much.

            - I am happy I have got the chance to continue my studies because this is what I wanted –
            musical studies. And I am happy when at home there is a joyful, very active atmosphere, and
            unhappy [because] I don’t keep in touch with my parents, my mother calls me rather seldom, and
            that’s about it.” (Focus group with children in public care, Focșani).

In group discussions, children confessed they wished that violence and the consumption of alcohol
and other substances would no longer exist in their birth family, and also that they had good housing
conditions. Only if these conditions were met would the children want to return home. Although they
want to keep in touch with their families, they are aware that, beyond the lack of affection and
parental care, the protection system provides them with better conditions and more opportunities.
            “- I wish most bad things could be deleted, that there would no longer be any booze, alcohol,
            and cigarettes. That everything went back to normal. And that I could be my daddy’s little
            monkey again.

            - I for one, no, I wouldn’t like to go back [home], because I have discovered another life here, I
            can say I’ve become emancipated since I came here. I also don’t want to go back because I have
            more opportunities here than I would have at home. To graduate.” (Focus group with children in
            public care, Focșani)

            “- Before going back to my family I’d like to know that they have the conditions to keep me, to
            allow me to go to school, to have a bathroom inside, not in the backyard.” (Focus group with
            children in public care, Craiova)

Out of all children’s needs, the need to have their voice heard, to have somebody they can talk to, a
person to whom they can tell anything and whom they can trust is the most important. Therefore,
staff working directly with children in public care should communicate with children more, spend

278
more time with them every day, listening to their stories, dissatisfactions, joys, opinions, needs, and
desires. At the same time, the children should be consulted and actively involved in deciding on their
daily activities, in preparing their own intervention plans and in all aspects of life that directly affect
them (such as education, health, and leisure) in order to develop the decision-making, planning and
management skills needed to live an independent life.
        “When you are upset, like all teenagers and children are in general, who do you talk to about such
        things?
        - To my conscience.

        - To my best friend.
        - I hypnotize myself. I watch YouTube hypnosis videos and I calm down.

        - Or I go to sleep.
        How about you?

        - I also go to sleep to calm down…
        - I access Facebook.

        - I try to talk to the right person. I mean, I study the person first [before I decide to talk].

        And who do you happen to talk to?
        - Nobody. I mean, I don’t know, I don’t have those kinds of thoughts.

        OK. And you, who do you talk to when you are upset?
        - Nobody and I try to calm down. I mean, sorry. I do talk to somebody. I talk to God.” (Focus
        group with children in public care, Craiova)
        “- When I am very angry and upset, the next day I go to tae kwon do, I take the dummy and I kick
        it until it falls. Even if it weighs two kilos.
        But do you talk to anybody when you are upset?

        - I don’t talk, I rather fight.” (Focus group with children in public care, Cluj-Napoca)

Our analysis of children’s case files showed that 52 percent of the files included some mention or
document concerning the child’s participation in decisions or their being consulted about relevant
issues, such as preparing the PIP, the service plan, and issues related to education or health. These
files tend to be for children over 15 years old, of either gender, of Romanian and Hungarian ethnicity,
with no disabilities, developmental delays, or SEN. Of all groups of children with special needs,
children with behavioral disorders seem to be consulted more frequently than average.
In group discussions, the children said that they would like the following:
 More pocket money
 Better food
 Internet access
 More money for clothing
 Nicer clothes of their own choosing.
This shows that it is very important for children to be consulted about their needs, to learn how to
prioritize their needs, how to buy clothes, how to prepare the daily menu, and how to manage their
pocket money. All these tasks will help them to develop independent life skills.
In order to increase children’s participation in the care that they are given, it will be necessary to build
the communication skills of the staff involved in working with the children. Training programs should
focus more on including children in the decision-making participative process rather than just
listening to their views in order to make decisions about them. Moreover, to overcome organizational
barriers, it will be necessary to ensure that case management is carried out in a way that is much
friendlier to children.

Model of Good Practice for Developing Independent Life Skills
“- Moreover, we have advanced. You see, in the past, a child of normal development living in an institution did
not have access to the kitchen and was not able to acquire those kinds of independent life skills because of
hygiene regulations. But we, as a Directorate, changed this model and put the family model in place.
Consequently, the children in the institution are allocated food money that they are responsible for managing
themselves. Thus they learn to manage a budget and to cook a meal, to balance their meals as much as possible
so that they should have no gaps. I remember everything about the assistance and support center, it was created
in 2004 or maybe in 2005, and I had the chance to oversee the first generation who received this service. And on
the first day I brought food to them, I told them to put the food in the fridge, and because the fridges were new,
we cleaned them before plugging them in. And then I told each child to put their food in their own fridge. There
were three kids who lived in a sort of flat. When I went to plug the fridges in, I luckily looked inside. For them, the
fridge was like a wardrobe. The eggs were in the freezer because it was the top shelf, and the meat was in the
lower boxes. They didn’t know any different because they had no opportunity to learn that anywhere, they only
went to the canteen. They were involved in certain activities occasionally with their teachers, but it was not a
routine thing. And that’s what I wanted to say, much progress has been made, in that young people’s integration
is no longer as difficult. They know how to manage money. In the past, they didn’t know how to determine how
much they would need, how much bread they would eat.” (Interview with a professional, Bârlad)

Staff working with young people should be skilled and should have the abilities and capacity required
to help them to prepare for their exit from public care and to become independent. Specialists
believed that nowadays young people develop a certain dependency on the system, which is very
detrimental to their future and to their preparation for life.
         “- Because we made the mistake of employing unskilled people and now we don’t have the
         results we would like to have. We can say that they were successful from the point of view of the
         child’s emotional development and of the family environment, while the children were young
         they made very good progress, but when they became teenagers and realized that, wait a minute,
         these are not our parents, that, wait a minute, they have their own children, look, we are different
         and what will happen to us in two years’ time, then the truth comes out.” (Focus group with
         professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

         “- We have youths for whom we find employment and after a month we have to have them
         employed elsewhere, and in another month, again, elsewhere, because they are not used to it [to
         working/work ethics]. We have to admit that in centers, and come to think of it, even with foster
         carers, children get used to being at the receiving end rather than being taught how to provide
         for and manage themselves so when they leave the system and have to live on their own, they
         cannot manage money, or create a budget for themselves, or create a daily schedule because
         they were brought up in the system in which the foster carer told them “go to school” or the
         teachers at the center told them “go to school.” The teacher at the center gave them pocket
         money, the children weren’t tought how to manage/spend it. This creates potential problems
         that need to be corrected. I don’t know if this is the case with foster carers, but in the centers
         they surely need intensive independent life programs, not just to learn how to use the washing
         machine. So, in practice, give a young person the money and see how he/she manages, clearly
         they will have nothing left the next day. We [adults] don’t have anything left the next day either,
         but for other reasons. But it should be a more or less independent program, under supervision,
         to observe what the young person is actually doing because we have children who are able but
         who don’t know to look at the clock and see that they should be at work at 8 o’clock. They don’t
         know that, they were sent to school from 1st grade through to 12th grade, in the same way. It is
         true that children often don’t learn these independent life skills in normal families either, but it
         seems families are a little bit more responsible.” (Focus group with professionals, Timișoara)

Our data do not indicate any mentions by the children, parents, or specialists with regard to any abuse
in public care. However, other studies have shown that abuse seems to occur in some institutions.

                              Box 17: Children’s Voices on Life in Public Care

 A recent study 397 of placement centers found the following:
 - Youths running away from the centers to live on the street because they are beaten by older colleagues and
 their stuff is stolen.
 - The existence of a “torture chamber” called the “isolator” (an isolation ward) in which the youths are confined
 in pairs when they are late, a technique that the center staff acknowledged using as a disciplinary method.
 - Centers with locked gates because the youths are not allowed to leave the building.

 - Centers where outsiders are not allowed to access or interact with the youths, the reason being that it
 doesn’t serve the “interests of the child.”

 - “Nineties style” centers with grey walls and dozens of lonely children nobody listens to, and teenagers saying
 that “the idea of living in captivity destroys you emotionally, spiritually, and mentally.”

 - Children wishing for people who understand them, “Who stop treating us like animals” (a 15 year old). “The
 Headmaster of the center shouldn't be allowed to beat us for any reason” (a 16 year old). “Nobody should
 swear at us again” (a 16 year old), “We want to be offered a chance to live our lives” (a 17 years old).
 - Psychologists seen by the children as “informants,” which is the reason children give for not trusting them
 enough to discuss their problems with them.

The main message expressed by children in public care during our focus group interviews was that, in
general, the material conditions in the system are satisfactory, even better than at home for most of
them, but that what is missing is a person who makes time for them, someone with whom they can
build a relationship based on trust, “someone to love me too, man, you know.” This is the primary
need that the public care system fails to meet. Second, from the point of view of older children, they
wish for a certain degree of independence and to participate more actively in all of the decisions that
may influence their life, from the clothing they wear to their PIP goal.

                           Box 18: Children’s Voices Reflected in Other Studies

 Of all the rights that children now have, the one they rate highest is the right to protection from abuse.
 Children and young people told the Munro review that what they value most are good relationships with
 professionals they can trust and practice that focuses on their needs. Building a trusting relationship with
 professionals is seen as important as it provides children with ways of getting information, knowing about
 their rights, having their say and making choices, and finding out how decisions about them are being made.

 Children and young people have also said that they do not want social workers who keep leaving them. They
 want social workers who “are there for them,” who talk to them, listen to them, and respect them. They want to
 deal with professionals whom they can trust (that is, someone who is honest, reliable, and who the child can
 depend on). They want someone who can offer them the support they need at important times of change in
 their lives. But, above all, they want social workers who are able to treat them as individuals, with their own
 unique needs, views and interests.

 They have also said that professionals are well placed to help and support a child who may be at risk. Teachers,
 school counselors, support workers, advocates, children’s rights officers, and many others can all play a vital
 role in creating the right environment for a child to feel that it is “safe to tell.”

   This study was conducted in 2015 by the organization Desenăm Viitorul Tău (Drawing Your Future) together with
Hope and Homes for Children Romania. It examined the placement centers in 22 counties and I five sectors in Bucharest.
The aim of the study was to review of what happens when youths reach the age when they have to leave the system,
specifically how the protection system prepares them for an independent life and what happens to them after they exit
the system. The research target group was 979 institutionalized youths.

Are there categories of children for whom reintegration within the
                                                                                           8a
family proves to be more difficult than for others?


“- Young children want to go home, while older children want to be in
a center. Older children, somewhere around 12, 13 years of age, are able to see the
difference between the conditions at home and the conditions in centers and to decide that
they prefer the conditions in the centers. But this is only the case for older children. Young
children want to go home.
- Yes, but the child’s expectations of his/her family should be considered as well. We have
children who want so much to live with their parents in a single room that it wouldn’t matter
to them that there’d be nothing for them to eat there all day long but carrots. For them, the
fact that at home they don’t have a place to wash themselves, except for the basin available
in the yard, is not important, whereas the fact that grandma comes to visit them twice a day
and that their mother is there is more important than our running water, regular meals,
clothes, and all the comfort we can provide. Children come from home crying which makes
me go through this constant state of anxiety, wondering what is in the child’s best interest,
what does the child feel and what are my own feelings and thoughts about the child in
question.”

“ - Yes, the disabled child, my colleagues are right.
- And those with behavioral disorders.
                                                                                           8b
- If the child with disabilities is left in the state’s care, that’s where
he/she’ll remain... till the last day of his/her life.
- Yes. Because this becomes a family struggle, an expense, an effort,
somebody who needs to take care of the child 24/7. It is very difficult. [...]
- And the main issue is the psychological barrier. Once the parents of these children decide
to relinquish them, to the parent that child ceases to exist. If, say, for the following three
months, the child has not been visited by the parents, then it is clear they will never be
visited again. So we’re talking here about ZERO chances of reintegration.
- I have a case. Cases, actually. They’ve ended up in a center for adults with disabilities. And I
have raised them since they were 4 years old. Actually since they were in the orphanage. The
old orphanage, that’s where I took over and now they’re in their 20s.”

“To what extent can the reintegration of children within their
biological families be supported by activities carried out in the                        8c
community?
- To the extent you are able to make some material resources
available for them, but you can't be certain it will work, in my
opinion.
Why do you say that?
- Well, we had an actual case here. I had a girl who was sent back to her family. The mother
wasn’t there, because it was a case of neglect, but the girl was reintegrated at her
grandmother’s. A living environment was created, the grandmother was supported with
goods or money, I’m not sure what the case file stated. The idea was great. She gathered all
siblings, including the girl that had been here. The girl had ended up with us because her
mother scalded her face with hot water. I don’t know if this was intentional or by mistake,
but she even went to jail because of this, especially since she also used the girl to beg.
Together with a plastic surgeon from Brașov, Dr. Ardean, who supported us a lot, and with a
team of UK doctors, we managed to do many surgical interventions on the girl to reshape
her face, to save her ears, because she risked losing her hearing. I think that, overall, she was
subject to over 10 surgeries. And after this, there was this project idea; the girl was placed
with her grandmother, and she was very happy. She was enrolled in school, we paid for her
afterschool. The colleagues would help her do her homework, because here she was with the
kids, and couldn’t have followed the normal educational path. And she was very happy that
she was with the family, with her siblings and grandmother. But despite all this, after half a
year, when we had scheduled another surgery, we couldn’t find her because her mother had
been released from jail and had taken her away, and she was last seen in Suceava or some
place, begging again. Now how do you explain to a group of people who came from the UK
to do a surgery on the child that she’s not to be found?
I see. This is a specific case. But, in general, does the reintegration of children into their
community families succeed?
- Yes. All necessary steps are being taken. This is a case that came to mind that I knew about,
I told you there were risks involved. But it can work just as well, you can't say it doesn't work,
the problem is to provide the right conditions, and in our public policies there is no
awareness of the fact that the family has to be involved as well, there is no education without
coercion.”
                                                          (Interview with a professional, Bârlad)




                                                                                              283
The main difficulties encountered by specialists in reintegrating the children into their natural families
as shown by the qualitative study, are: (i) the refusal of children to return to their biological family; (ii)
the refusal of the parents to reintegrate the children into the family; and (iii) the family finding it
difficult to meet the necessary conditions for the reintegration to succeed.
As a rule, young children want to go home, whereas older children prefer to live in centers. As they
reach adolescence, children become aware of having been rejected by their family and can develop
feelings of hatred towards their parents, no longer wishing to go home. Also, the longer children
spend in the protection system, the weaker their connections with their families. A rift occurs between
the child and the family, and reintegration becomes more difficult to achieve.
        “Why would anyone aged 18 who has grown up far from their parents want to live with these
        parents? In our center we have all teenagers. I tell you, this age of adolescence is the age when
        the young person becomes aware of things. Think about it, we have a psychologist at the center,
        he is terrified and doesn't know what to do anymore, how to work with them, because this is the
        moment when youths realize they have been rejected, worst of all, by their own parents. They
        have school mates. Good, bad, regardless how they are, they're mum and dad. For them, the
        worst psychic trauma is that someone has cast them away. A hatred develops in them. It's
        terrible.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

On the other hand, children often reject being reintegrated into their families because of the
expectations about living conditions that they have come to have during the time they have spent in
public care. In general, the housing conditions of their natural families do not change while the
children are in the system, and the conditions provided in the centers and the lifestyle they have here
make them not to want to return home.
        ”They were getting closer to their coming of age and had to return to their families. The
        conditions in their family were the same, I'm speaking about the same as years ago, and by then
        they were used to a different lifestyle, it was very difficult for them to adapt to the family
        environment. And as a rule, say rather from what we've heard and less from our own experience,
        very few of the children grown up in foster care will go back to their family environment. Well,
        especially now, because the conditions in the family are not the same as the ones they are used
        to. They were brought up nicely so, if you see them, you think they won’t return or that going
        back to their environment would be difficult.” (Interview with professionals, Craiova)

The interviews with specialists have shown that there are various reasons why parents do not want
their children to be reintegrated. On the one hand, in the case of dysfunctional families, when the
mother has another life partner who does not want the child, the reintegration cannot take place
regardless of how much the child might want this and despite all of the necessary conditions for
reintegration being met, such as the financial and living conditions.
        ”On the one hand, there are parents who did not want to have children in the first place and gave
        them away. They won't be interested in getting them back. Then there are children who are
        willing to try, nevertheless. Now, I don't know how confidential this might be, but a 14-year old
        girl wrote in her diary: “even though you gave me away, when I grow up I will have a job and
        money and I will be the one to provide for you so we can be together.” (Focus group with
        professionals, Cluj-Napoca)

On the other hand, in the case of children placed with their relatives, reintegration often does not
happen because the foster family is not willing to give up the foster care benefit, which is a significant
source of income, especially in rural areas.
        ”I think it is probably a big mistake for Law 272 to have increased the foster care benefit to 600
        lei, especially for family foster care. Because we have many children placed with relatives,
        grandparents, uncles and aunts, we'll never ever be able to reintegrate those children into their
        biological family, take them from their grandparents and give them to their parents if the
        grandparents receive a benefit of 6 million and the parents maybe receive an aid of 1 million. So
        it's clearly impossible, even though we tried... Give the aid to the parent, help the parent bring up
        the child in the family and then they will leave the protection system.” (Interview with
        professionals, Piatra Neamț)

There are situations when it is hard for specialists to determine whether a child should be reintegrated
into their family or not, for example, when the standard conditions are not met but the family wants
their child and does everything possible to provide the best for them (see section 3.2.5.2). As
recommended in section 3.2.5.2, a careful review is needed of the standards regarding the housing
conditions required before the child’s reintegration into their family as well as of these conditions’
impact on the child and the family.




3.4.1                   The System's Children
The population analyzed in this study consists of children who had entered and remained in public
care between 1989 and 2014. During this time, many others left the system through reintegration into
their families, adoption, “integration in society”, or transfer to an institution for adults with disabilities
(for young people aged 18 years or older). A few of them (2.8 percent) died while in the protection
system.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care: Sampling Lists (November-December 2014). Data are
not weighted (N=8,954 children with available data sheets out of the total of 9,110 children selected from the
CMTIS).
Note: See also Annex 6 Table 45. The 18-26 age category included young people over 26 who were still in the
system.

As shown in section 3.1.4, more than half of all children in public care were between 0 and 3 years old
at the time of their entry into the system (35 percent were under 12 months old). Not only do children
who enter when they are under 3 years old (and especially under 1 year old) prevail among children in
public care at any given time, but they also tend to stay longer in the system. To test this hypothesis,
we looked at the available information on the current situation of the children in the sample, including
those who left the system.
Comparing the current situation of youths aged 18 to 26398 by the age at which they entered the
system shows that the prevalence of children whose entry age was under 3 is not only the effect of a
higher number of entries but also the effect of a lower number of exits than among those who
entered the system over the age of 3 (Figure 70 and Annex 6 Table 45). Thus, among the youths aged
18 to 26, those who entered the system when they were younger than 3 make up a distinct category.
Among these: (i) a significantly larger than average percentage is still in the system (44 to 47 percent);
(ii) a significantly larger percentage than average was transferred to institutions for adults with

age (around 25 to 26 percent).399
Furthermore, out of all children who entered public care before the end of 1996 (who all turned at
least 18 in 2014), those who still were in a protection service in 2014 had entered when they were
under 3 years old (especially under 1 year old) (Figure 71). Children who entered when they were
under 12 months old represent about 25 percent of all children who entered public care between
2007 and 2014, but also account for almost 71 percent of all those who entered the system between
1989 and 1996.

(N=52,344 children).

Thus, children who enter the special protection system when they are under 3 years old (and
especially those who are under 1 year old) appear to be more likely to become “the system's children”
than the other children in public care.400 There are more than 18,000 children who entered the system
when they were less than 12 months old and over 9,100 children who entered at ages between 1 and
2 years. These are all potential “children of the system.” About one-third are children with disabilities
(mild, medium or severe). Their distribution by age cohorts and by health condition at present is
shown in Annex 6 Table 46.
Irrespective of whether these children’s parents are alive and known, the very short time that the
children spent at home before entering public care was insufficient for a strong enough relationship to
grow between the children and their mothers or parents to motivate the mothers or parents to
reclaim the child. This is particularly the case when no support or counselling has been made available
to these mothers or parents. As a result, most ceased having any communication with their children a
long time ago. As Figure 72 shows, regardless of their current age, the children who entered the
system when they were under 1 year old had a less than average amount of interaction with their
biological family (where interaction is defined as the fact that a relative (regardless of how distant)
submited at least one visit request, visited the child, contacted the child by telephone, sent packages,
or took the child on vacation. In reality, in 30 percent of cases in which there has been some
connection with the family, the children who entered the system before turning 1 year old received,
on average, only one visit per year or were contacted by telephone, most frequently by their mother.



399
   For comparison, among the youth aged 18 to 26 who entered the system when they were 3 years old or older, 37 to
39 percent are still in the system, 1 to 2 percent were transferred to institutions for adults with disabilities, and 38 to 39
percent left the system when they came of age.

Every passing day decreases the child's chances of being reintegrated into the family, especially if
there is no connection between them. After three years of separation, their chances of leaving the
system decline considerably. After six or seven years of separation, if no adoption has been successful,
their chances of exiting the system diminish even further, while their chances of being reintegrated
into their family are virtually zero. Therefore, this group of potential “system's children” needs to be
acknowledged as such and treated properly. Just setting reintegration into the family as a PIP goal for
a child is not enough, especially if it is not based on any analysis of the actual chances of reintegration
for each and every child and if it does not trigger a specific sequence of actions involving the children
and their families.
More efforts should be made to get these children adopted as a permanent solution. If no safe, stable,
and secure parenting relationship has been established by the time the child reaches 10 years old,
then the potential “system's children” should enter an institutional pathway of independent living that
includes life skills education in which they grow up in a small group house, preferably located in a
small community in which they can build friendships and social networks until they reach 18 years of
age. Furthermore, this pathway should include the provision of either social housing or assisted living
facilities for people with disabilities (both supervised independent living arrangements) for when the
young person leaves the system. Otherwise, these young people will have no real chance to be
integrated into society and to build a sustainable life. This institutional pathway (and the
corresponding social housing program) should be designed and implemented as soon as possible so
that it may yield visible positive effects starting with those children who are currently (2014) 3 to 6
years old.
        “It is absolutely necessary to create a legal framework for youths leaving public care, whether
        they are with disabilities or not, because after they leave, their trace is lost and everything that
        the state invested in them for 18 or 25 years is abandoned... It’s like building a house but leaving
        it without a roof on top. In my opinion, this is what’s happening here. And I’m telling you this
        because I myself spent my childhood in public care, this is what happened to me too. I was
        simply left hanging in the air, only God guided my steps on one path and saved me...” (Interview
        with professional, Craiova)




                                                                                                                      287
At the same time, experts acknowledge the fact that long-term solutions are necessary for potential
“system's children” with severe disabilities and little chance of managing on their own. If no other
permanent solution is possible, small group homes should be used for children with disabilities, even
after they become adults. Meanwhile, medium to long term plans should be designed for the
transition from institutional to community-based care as well as for supervised independent living
arrangements, and health (rehabilitation) services.


      RECOMMENDATIONS
 Many children arrive in public care when they are under 3 years old (and particularly under 1 year old). They
 face a serious risk of becoming “the system's children.” This risk should be acknowledged and counteracted by
 developing two distinct institutional pathways.

             The first pathway for children should be for independent living including not only family-type
              alternative care in smaller communities, but also the provision of social housing or assisted living
              facilities for when the youth (aged 18 to 26) leave the system.
             The other pathway should be for children with severe disabilities who cannot manage on their own.

 In the absence of such pathways, the child protection system will only provide care during the childhood
 stage, without being able to live up to its catchphrase “making all efforts to keep children with their families”,
 by failing to plan for the thousands of young people who leave the system every year without any family
 support.

 We reiterate some of the recommendations of the Background Study for the National Strategy on Social
 Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020,401 which are relevant for the development of the two institutional
 pathways recommended above.
 There is a special need for support services for young adults with disabilities living in their communities. Apart
 from such services as in-home support for those with complex dependency needs or help with daily home
 activities and personal care, there is a wide range of needs specific to young people that must be met. These
 include:
 (i) the need to find and keep accessible housing, live independently and, in some cases, manage financial and
 personal assets;

 (ii) the need for habilitation and rehabilitation services adapted to the specific need of adults with disabilities
 and provided in the context of independent living;

 (iii) the need for vocational education, training, job coaching and employment support (all tailored to people
 of different ages and at different stages of the professional cycle);

 (iv) the need to access other community services such as healthcare, legal services, outdoor activities, cultural
 activities, and leisure facilities; and

 (v) the need to have a balanced family life (requiring, for instance, family counseling and sex education).
 Services for independent living are a very specific and important category that must be developed in the
 coming years, particularly to integrate post-institutionalized young adults with disabilities into society as well
 as to provide a transition from residential care to community-based services.

3.4.2          Too Few Adoptions



Story Bag

What are the more difficult cases from the adoption
perspective?
"- I have children for whom internal adoption procedures
have been opened but who are not considered to be a                                        9
match because the Romanian Office for Adoptions has the
final say and they consider certain lists, criteria… so these
children get stuck [at the theoretical matching stage]. They
are older, they are 10 to 11 years old and have siblings, so
nobody wants to adopt them, there are no families willing to
do that… people interested in taking care of a child this age or of more children at once. Or
of 14-year-old children… So, even if you open the adoption procedures, you get stuck, and
once you open the procedure, children are no longer allowed to stay in touch with their birth
families and so, for two years, you basically block their chances of reintegrating with their
families and their relationship with their families, and… they do not even get to be adopted.
So, for these children those two years are frozen, there is nothing you can do.
- When it comes to children with disabilities, things are even more difficult. It is even harder
for him or her to be adopted because we [in Romania] have a different mentality: we only
want children with fair hair, blue eyes, and in great health. This is why some of the disabled
children defined as adoptable remain in the system with a protection measure as nobody
wants to adopt them.”
                                                         (Interview with professionals, Craiova)


“- I think that the adoption law should be also changed because we have families with many
children in the system, they bring them when they are young or relinquish them in the
maternity ward and afterwards they say, I’m not giving him or her up, they are mine, I will
take them back home, and it is obvious that those who want to adopt a child prefer a young
child they can shape. We are forced to open adoption procedures even if the child is 14
years old and we have the duty to contact family to the fourth kinship degree, sometimes
the kids are from a family of 11, and then one has to run all over the place to ask for the
reintegration of some children whom their extended family may have never seen and/or
heard about before.
If the parents do not want to give them up for adoption, what happens?
- One cannot do anything at all. Without the parent’s consent, one cannot.
- Despite the fact that maybe all children from those families are in public care. If they do not
want to, one cannot do anything.”

                      the CEE/CIS
Adoption is considered to be the best solution for children who can no longer be reintegrated into
their birth families. Therefore, all efforts must be made to find the most suitable family or individual
who wishes to provide parental care to the child in question within their country of origin. According
to UNICEF data (Figure 73), in the CEE/CIS region, the adoption rate in Romania is currently below
average (98 adoptions per 100,000 children aged 0-3, all throughout 2013, versus the CEE/CIS average
of 123, see Annex 6 Figure 14).402

Since 2004, the gross rate of adoption within the CEE/CIS region followed a downward curve. Romania
followed the same trend with slight fluctuations, ending up with only 750 adoptions in 2013.403 The
fluctuations in the number of adoptions care mainly due to changes in national regulations. In 2004, a
new law on the legal status of adoption (Law 273/2004) was introduced, which came into force as off
January 1st 2005. Consequently, between 2006 and 2012, international adoptions were restricted to
certain categories of people who could adopt a Romanian child. In 2011, the law was subject to new
changes and additions, enforced as of April 2012 (through Law 233/2011). The new provisions
broadened the categories of adoptive persons eligible for international adoptions, and as a result, in
2013, seven international adoptions took place. A new law regarding adoption was passed in 2016
(Law 57/2016), which introduced more flexible procedures and shorter deadlines for the adoption
process.

3.4.2.2 How Children Enter the Adoption Process
Beginning with this section, we go back to the analysis of the data found in the case files of children in
public care, specifically the data collected via the Adoption Form designed for the children in public
care who, at the time of our research, had adoption as their PIP goal (see section 2.3).404
Of all children who were in public care as of November-December 2014, an average of 14 percent had
passed through various stages of the adoption process:
 Four percent entered the system before 2005 and started the adoption procedure without having
  adoption set as their PIP goal (since it was not yet required by law), while other children who
  entered the system during the same timeframe were provided with adoption as their PIP goal
  sometime after 2005.
 Five percent entered the system between 2005 and 2014 and received adoption as their first PIP
  goal immediately after entering the system.
 Five percent entered the system between 2005 and 2014 and received adoption as their PIP goal
  only after several attempts had been made to reintegrate the child into his or her birth family.
Thus, almost 7,100 children (14 percent of children in public care) had gone through one or more
stages of the adoption process which, however, was not completed and these children were still in the
system at the time of the study. For more than 1 percent of these children, the adoption was either
interrupted or it simply failed, while for three-quarters of them, the PIP was changed from adoption to
reintegration into their families. These interrupted or failed adoption cases were unevenly distributed
across counties, as shown in Annex 6 Table 47. As expected, the numbers of these cases were
significantly higher in those counties with high shares of adoptable children (such as Dolj, for instance),
but they were also high in some counties with relatively few adoptable children as a share of all
children in public care (such as Arad and Constanța counties, see Figure 76).
Considering all these factors, at the time when the data were collected (November-December 2014),
adoption as PIP goal was still valid for approximately 12 percent of the children in public care (namely,
about 6,500 children). For all of these children, an Adoption Form should have been filled in, but for
the reasons explained in section 2.3, valid forms were prepared for only 90 percent of them (5,805
cases). Figure 74 shows that the missing adoption forms were evenly distributed among the three
categories listed above.

In this study, an “adoptable child” is defined as a child in public care for whom adoption was
established as their PIP goal. Therefore, the valid forms analyzed below refer to adoptable children as
of the end of 2014. Of the 82 percent of them who had entered public care between 1996 and 2011,
97 percent had the adoption process initiated in 2012 (Figure 75).

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care: Adoption Form (November-December 2014). Data are
weighted (N=5,805 children with an adoption PIP and a valid form).

On average, it took five and a half years for a child in the special protection system to obtain a PIP
proposal for adoption, namely the time between the moment when he or she entered the system to
the beginning of the adoption process. In fact, in the population of adoptable children as of the end
of 2014, there were major differences between those who entered the system before 2005 and those
who entered after 2005. More precisely, for children who entered the system between 1996 and 2004
(30 percent of all adoptable children), it took an average of approximately 10 years to get a PIP that
targeted adoption. On the other hand, for the children who entered the system after 2005 (after Law
273/2004), it took an average of only 3.5 years for an adoption file to be opened.
As a result, these averages are strongly influenced by the presence, among the adoptable children at
the time of the study, of the many children who entered the system many years before and who
received a PIP adoption goal only after the enforcement of Law 233/2011. In fact, although the
adoption process began for almost all of these children between 2012 and 2014, if we look at the
distribution of adoptable children according to the year of entry into the system, we notice that a
roughly equal number of children having entered public care during 2001-2013 were selected as
potentially adoptable each year, with a national average of 430 per year (Figure 75).
Figure 76 shows a similar approach underlying the number of adoptable children for whom an
adoption procedure was opened in 2012-2014, approach which was followed by most counties in the
country, with different shares.
According to the DGASPC specialists, the significant time lag between the child’s entry into public care
and their being declared adoptable was mainly due to the many steps that need to be taken in order
to comply with the law. During the first step, the objective is to reintegrate the child with his/her birth
family, since this is considered to be the best long-term solution for the child. The adoption procedure
is to be opened only if this objective cannot be accomplished (because the family is unknown) or if it
fails to be accomplished (even after consulting the parents or other relatives up to the fourth degree).
Therefore, the significant amount of time that passes between the child entering public care and the
the adoption file being developed is due to the legal requirement to find the child’s parents and/or




292
relatives up to the fourth degree, to consult them, and to get their consent for the child’s adoption,
unless they opt for reintegration.405

          parents show no interest and the child cannot be reintegrated into the extended birth family,

          is initiated, the file is sent to the adoption department which then continues with the fieldwork,
          proceeds to consult with the parents, if it manages to find them, and with the relatives regarding
          the consequences of adoption, and takes down their statements. These people have 60 days to
          change their mind, to reconsider their statement, and if nothing changes, the file is sent to the
          court with a proposal for initiating the adoption process. If after analyzing the contents of the file,

months. If the relatives cannot be traced during this timeframe, the child will be eligible for adoption.

Children who entered the system between 2005 and 2014 and who entered the adoption process later on (in their
second to fifth PIP). *These results were similar when considering both the refusals and the approvals of the
relatives regarding the reintegration of the child. **Only adoptable children with valid forms were taken into
consideration.

Another factor that is often mentioned as an obstacle to initiating the adoption process is the
requirement to obtain the parents’ consent to adoption. The parents will often refuse to let their child
be considered for adoption although they also make no further efforts to take the child home or to
participate in any parenting classes or counseling services aimed at improving the chances of
reintegrating the child into the family. In fact, there is no obligation for parents with children in public
care to participate in such classes or services, nor are there services developed for this purpose.
However, the legislation in force starting 2012 allows the system to disregard the right of one or both
parents to consent to or refuse the adoption of one of their children if there is proof that the refusal is
abusive.406
         “Yes. But you see, once the parents got rid of the child, they are the kind of parents who also
         refuse to give him or her up for adoption or take him or her home, just so that the state may
         keep him/her as long as possible”. (Focus group with specialists, Cluj-Napoca)

         “To be declared adoptable, but to also be young enough for adoption, otherwise it is a complete
         nonsense, there are some that want to be adopted and it can’t be done [because their parents
         won’t have it]. And here we are, in the system, always facing their unjustified refusal, because if

Romania, part I no. 259 of April 19, 2012.

            you look at it over time, by year, I am right, if you do a statistical analysis, you will find in the
            system the same children whose parents said no [to adoption] because they said they were going
            to take the kids home but never did. So the children will turn 14, 15 and still be in the system and
            when they must exit the system at 18, let’s say that they no longer want to attend school and exit
            the system, you cannot then reintegrate them into their homes because the family will say they
            are already adults and there’s no place home for them anymore. So there’s this vicious circle that
            makes the child stay in the system...” (Focus group with specialists, Brașov)

Regarding the steps that have to be taken prior to initiating the adoption process, the data in the case
files shows that specialists make more efforts to identify the parents of adoptable children and to
obtain their consent or refusal to reintegrating the child than they make for children who have never
had an adoption PIP (Table 37). For example, there is a list of relatives up to the fourth degree in the
case files of 62 percent of the adoptable children compared to only 47 percent of the files for other
children. However, this accounts for only about two-thirds of adoptable children. For the other one-
third, these efforts were not made even though only approximately 10 percent of them have unknown
and/or deceased mothers or relatives. Moreover, for fewer than half of the adoptable children (a
similar share to the entire sample), the case files had no assessment by the case manager or person in
charge with implementing the PIP with regard to their real chances of being reintegrated into their
natural families. Overall, the DGASPC experts who filled in the adoption forms felt that adoption as a
PIP goal was relevant and appropriate for fewer than three-quarters of the children selected for
adoption, with the rest having very limited chances of completing the process successfully. This means
that the DGASPC experts admit that their adoption efforts will fail for more than one-quarter of the
adoptable children.
Adoption is analyzed in this section as a process through which the child passes from public care to a
permanent living solution. However, in order to examine the adoption process, we needed to develop
a profile of the children considered eligible for adoption. That is the theme of the next section.

3.4.2.3 The Profile of the Adoptable Child
Data from the case files helped us to identify the profile of those children in public care who enter the
adoption process (Annex 6 Table 48). Adoptable children were different from the children without an
adoption PIP in several ways. Adoptable children were much more likely than average to have entered
the system when they were under 1 year old as a result of being relinquished in maternity wards (61
percent).407 They were aged between 1 and 10 at the time of the study (68 percent) and were
biological orphans with no extended family (12 percent) or came from families of single-mothers (62
percent), adolescent mothers (6 percent), or mothers with disabilities and/or mental health problems
(21 percent) who usually had completed primary school at most. This profile is strongly associated
with that of the children who received an adoption PIP immediately after entering the system (section
3.3.3).
Generally, adoptable children come from small, poor families (40 percent) that have fewer children
than the families of the other children in public care. However, 46 percent of them had siblings in the
system, of whom 38 percent had an average of two adoptable siblings among whom a 1.4 siblings
could be adopted together.408 It is worth mentioning that the children from families with parental risk
factors had a much lower probability of entering the adoption process than other children.
Consequently, avoidable entries into the system (children entering the system only for social reasons)
were under-represented among adoptable children.
Children with special needs were significantly under-represented among adoptable children, especially
children with severe or marked disabilities (9 percent). However, in certain counties, such as Gorj,
Hunedoara, Mehedinți, Dolj, and Olt, children with a handicap or disability in the system accounted for
more than 40 percent of adoptable children (versus the average of 29 percent of all children in public


407
      Resulting in high numbers of children from urban areas and with undeclared ethnicity.
408
   The number of adoptable siblings varies between 1 and 8, and the number of children that can be adopted together
varies between 0 and 5.

                                                                                                                    295
care). By contrast, these children accounted for under 20 percent of adoptable children in Bihor,
Botoșani, Constanța, Covasna, Satu-Mare, Suceava, Vaslui, and Vâlcea counties (of the counties with
solid data in the CMTIS, as shown in Annex 6 Table 49).
Children aged 6 to 17 with SEN and children aged 7 to 17 with behavioral disorders were also
statistically under-represented among adoptable children (Annex 6 Table 48). However, the absence of
these two groups was probably largely due to their age more than to their belonging to a group of
children with special needs. By contrast, premature and/or underweight infants were over-represented
(12 percent).
Although at the time of the study most adoptable children were between 1 and 10 years old, there
were children who had started the adoption process at all ages between 0 and 16 (Figure 77). Young
children prevailed among those who had entered the system starting 2005, while those aged 9 to 12
(with an average age of 10) prevailed among the children who entered public care during 1996-2004.
Also, there were differences among counties in terms of the age at which the adoptable children had
entered public care. In Gorj, Constanța, and Bistrița-Năsăud counties, all adoptable children entered
the adoption process at 0 years old. In Vâlcea, Dolj, and Caraș-Severin counties, the percentage of
adoptable children who entered the system at the age of 7-10 years was significantly higher than the
national average.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care: Adoption Forms (November-December 2014). Data are
weighted (N=5,805 adoptable children with valid adoption forms, though for two percent of them there is no
information about the date when the adoption process was initiated).
Note: Adoptable children (A) = Children who entered the system before 2005 and who entered the adoption

second to fifth PIP).

Regarding the protection services in which the adoptable children were placed, placement with a
professional foster care prevailed (Annex 6 Table 48). Only 4 percent of adoptable children were in
placement centers, compared to 19 percent of those who never had an adoption PIP. Also, only 7
percent of adoptable children were in small-scale residential services versus 18 percent of the other
children. By contrast, 80 percent of adoptable children were placed in foster care compared to 27
percent of those who had never entered the adoption process (Figure 78).
Adoptable children who had no valid adoption form and are therefore missing from the analysis in the
following sections had a different profile than the one reported above. The children for whom the
DGAPC experts had never filled out an adoption form (although the children subsequently received
adoption as their PIP goal) had a significantly higher probability of being boys, Roma children,
children with developmental delays, and children from families with parental risk factors

296
(mother/parents with promiscuous behavior, or who had problems with the police and/or a criminal
record, living in poverty). Also, those children placed with other people or families were over-
represented among children with an adoption PIP but no adoption form (11 percent versus an
average of 7 percent for all children in the system). This category of children represented over 1
percent of the children in public care, and were unevenly distributed among the counties (Annex 6
Table 47).409

Finally, Annex 6 Table 48 also provides information about the children in public care who experienced
a suspended or failed adoption during their stay in the system. First, 92 percent of them were children
aged 7 or older. Second, an above average share of them had siblings in the system (54 percent
versus the average of 50 percent) and approximately one in every ten had developmental delays.
Although children relinquished in maternity wards prevailed (as they did among all the other
adoptable children), children who were relinquished in health units at ages over 1 and those who
entered the system after running away from home (including street children) were over-represented
among children with suspended or failed adoptions. Although they were older than 6 at the time of
the study, to a significantly higher than average extent these children were placed in family-type
services, especially with other families or individuals or with foster carers, and in small-scale residential
services (Figure 78).
As we already stated above, suspended or failed adoption cases were unevenly distributed among
counties (Annex 6 Table 47).
We conducted a simultaneous analysis of the factors that influence the allocation of a child into the
adoptable or non-adoptable categories using a logistic regression (Table 38). This analysis showed
that this selection is largely based on four factors: (i) the age of the child; (ii) the structure of the
original family who must give their consent for the adoption of the child; (iii) the route via which the
child entered the system; and (iv) the efforts and strategy of the county DGASPC.
All other things being equal, we found that a child aged between 0 and 3 is significantly more likely
than a child aged 10+ to be declared adoptable and to not have experienced a failed adoption. A
child of 4 to 9 years old in public care is almost four times more likely than a child aged 10+ to enter
the adoption process but is also two times more likely to have a failed adoption on file.

  Among the 24 counties with solid data in the CMTIS, the share of adoptable children for whom no adoption form had
been filled in varied widely, with a maximum of nearly 7 percent of the children in public care in Satu-Mare county.

The child’s current family structure is also a significant predicting factor. With all other things being
equal and controlled for, the children with the greatest chances of entering the adoption process are
biological orphans with no supporting relatives or the children of single-mothers. The existence of an
extended family lowers the chances of a child being declared adoptable almost threefold in line with
the system’s emphasis on reintegration into the natural family as the best permanent solution for the
child. However, taking into account the limited efforts and underdeveloped community services to
identify and support the families at risk of separation (Table 37),410 it may be that the mere existence
of some relatives prevents a child from being considered for adoption even when the child’s existing
relatives do not want to or cannot care for him or her. As can be seen in the regression model
featured in Table 38, when children’s files contain statements from their relatives up to the 4th degree
refusing to integrate and raise them, it increases fivefold the children’s chances of entering the
adoption process, whereas statements regarding an integration approval reduce them significantly,
which is not unexpected. However, even in cases where nothing is known about a child’s relatives
(particularly in cases of relinquishment), the chances of the child entering the adoption process are
greater than for those who have known relatives and the file does not include any statement of
approval or refusal from those relatives. Similarly, children who only have a father tend to have little
chance of being declared adoptable, maybe because this situation requires specialists to work with the
family a great deal, the father is harder to find, or it requires time and effort to convince him to
cooperate.
System entry routes are relevant because they show us that, when all other things are equal, children
relinquished in health units, especially those relinquished immediately after birth, are considerably
more likely to enter the adoption process than those children who lived with a family first and then
taken into the system. On the other hand, children taken into the system after having run away from
home (and street children) have relatively high chances of being declared adoptable but few chances
of going through the process successfully.
The number of adoptable children is also significantly influenced by the strategies and efforts of the
DGASPCs at the county level. Annex 6 Table 47 and Figure 76 show that, while in Dolj county 40
percent of the children in public care were adoptable (4 percent of whom had a suspended or failed
adoption), a large share of counties had started an adoption process for fewer than 10 percent of the
children in their care. The regression model in Table 38 confirms the fact that children from all
counties except Caraș-Severin and Galați were up to 10 times less likely to be declared adoptable than
children in the protection system in Dolj County, after reintegration efforts failed.
There were differences not only among county DGASPCs but also among case managers in terms of
how children were selected to enter the adoption process. In our survey of case managers, we used,
among others, the vignette method, a friendly method for analyzing work practices which compares
case workers’ reactions to the same hypothetical situation. However, these results must be interpreted
with great care because the case managers’ answers to fictional situations may differ from how they
would react in the real world.411 In order to illustrate the various approaches taken by case managers
in the field of child protection in Romania, we used three vignettes, one of which relates to adoption
and is presented below (Vignette 2).
Vignette 2 shows that, for a healthy child relinquished in the maternity ward immediately after birth,
the majority of case managers would first try to identify the child’s natural family and reintegrate the
child with them. Subsequently, ”depending on the case developments,” they would initiate the
adoption process. Consequently, most case managers would focus on finding a permanent solution (a
family) for the child, and, depending on what time and resources were available, they would carry out
a detailed assessment of the situation, which differs from the “front door decisions.”

           Please describe clearly how you would proceed in the following hypothetical case: a request from
           hospital/ maternity ward X regarding child Andrei, 3 days old, relinquished at birth. Andrei was born at
           full term, he weighs 3.5 kg, has received an Apgar score 9 at birth, and is of Romanian ethnicity.
           Andrei's father is unknown. (No information is provided on the mother.)
We received answers from 77 case managers, randomly selected from the 793 who participated in the research.

What is the PIP goal proposed by the case managers for this child?


                                          Reintegration into family, focus on working directly with the family
                                          Family reintegration followed by adoption if reintegration fails
                                          Adoption
                                          PIP with no goal, at least for a while
                                          "According to the law"
                                          Others



What do case managers think should be done in this case?
The first group of responses advocated for taking a long-term approach to find a permanent solution for the
child, with individualized solutions. Specifically, these case managers recommended family reintegration for the
child, possibly followed by adoption. Generally all explanations concerning the necessary actions were detailed
and centerd on identifying positive ways and resources that could be used, for example, “the identification of
resources and of resource people for the child within the extended family on the mother’s side who wish to get
involved in raising the child” (Interview with a professional, Bucharest), “identification and counselling of the
mother, accommodation in a maternal center, and the identification of family and community resources that may
support the reintegration of mother and child” (Interview with a professional, Iași).
The second group of responses also advocated for taking a long-term approach to find a pragmatic and fast
permanent solution in the interests of the child. Specifically, these case managers recommended adoption. The
hypothetical child had the profile most sought after by adopting parents so they recommended, “placement with
an adopting family and adoption of the child without looking for the mother since this is a case of abandonment”
(Interview with a professional, Vaslui) and the “immediate initiation of the adoption process to identify an
adopting family asap” (Interview with a professional, Hunedoara).

The third group of responses provided short-term, temporary solutions for the child (a PIP with no goal) by
placing him in emergency care with a protection service, with no reference to a long-term solution and with no
previous assessment of the family situation: “deprivation of parental rights; emergency placement with a foster
carer” (Interview with a professional, Satu Mare).

The fourth group of responses were either “according to the law” or did not reveal any clear measures to take in
this case: “for such a child, a method, a measure of protection must be found; we would inform competent
authorities and specialists will take the best steps” (Alba) or “I think that all efforts being made at present would
be efficient in solving the situation of this child” (Dolj).

In the opinion of case managers, what are the child’s chances of being reintegrated into his natural family
or of being adopted?

Good and very good chances were the answers given by the case managers who focused on finding permanent
solutions for the child.

On the basis of similar actual cases, the interviewed case managers considered that the most difficult aspects of
the case management related to this hypothetical situation would be: (i) identifying the mother/ extended family
and assessing the family situation; (ii) securing an emergency foster care placement; (iii) drafting the
relinquishment protocol; and (iv) ensuring the child’s right to an ID/ birth certificate.

In addition to this prevailing reaction, there were another four different groups of responses, almost
equal in number, among the case managers who provided an answer. The first group referred to
pragmatic ways, based on their experience, of reaching a permanent solution for the child as soon as
possible. In the opinion of these experts, the child in question had a good chance of being adopted
rapidly. Therefore, they said that they would ”skip through the stages” of family reintegration because
these stages use precious time and they would go directly to “emergency adoption”. The responses of
this group of case managers seem to back up the findings of recent studies412 of practices in the field
of child protection according to which oftentimes there is little involvement of the family, there is not
enough partnership-driven work and the issues raised by the case managers about the family tend to
be rather negative.
The second group of responses did not consider the chances of the child being reintegrated or
adopted and did not refer to a permanent solution for the child but was limited to the emergency
entry of the child after being relinquished in the hospital and the rapid identification of an available
foster parent to care for him or her. All attention and efforts of these case managers were directed
towards finding a temporary solution, with the operative word being ”emergency.”
The third group of managers often referred to standards and regulations and answered with the
monotonous formula ”according to the law”, with no assessments or explanations. Adoption was an
option to the extent that it was “according to the law.” More generally, their answers to the questions
were opaque and did not allow for identifying any practices or concrete activities to be applied, at
least in theory.
The fourth group of case managers expressed various (”other”) opinions and concentrated on
experience and the rich caseload as a way to illustrate the unpredictable situations that can occur (and
that usually occur) in the field. Their discourse concerned ”fieldwork” and various types of obstacles
encountered ”in real life” (such as parents with no identity documents, mothers with disabilities and/or
mental health problems, parents leaving home, and difficulties associated with collaborating with the
authorities, such as the failure to comply with legal terms and conditions).
Therefore, it is clear that current practices used in the child protection system result from a
combination of national legislation, the various strategies used by the DGASPCs and by the case
managers, only some of whom consider permanent solutions for the child and even fewer are
concerned about offering family support and about working directly with the families.

                                 Box 19: Profile of People who Adopt in Romania

 Most people who adopt in Romania are people with secondary, higher or postgraduate education, are aged
 over 30, with an average age of over 38. Almost three-quarters are from an urban area. In 88 percent of cases
 they are families and the other 12 percent of cases are single women. Most couples are in a stable, long-term
 relationship that has lasted more than five years. The single people who want to adopt are aged over 40, with
 at least secondary education (almost half with tertiary education or a PhD). Eighty-six percent of adopting
 people have no biological children of their own, and the decision to adopt has come in most cases after
 several failed attempts to have their own children.

 3.4.2.4        The Stages of the Adoption Process
Adoption is hereby analyzed as a process through which the child passes from public care to a
permanent living solution. There are several stages to the adoption process as set out in Law
273/2004 and subsequently amended by Law 233/2011, which introduced a practical matching stage
before entrusting a child for adoption. This chapter will analyze the six stages of the adoption process
as established by law (at the time of the study):
                (I)      Submitting the file to the adoption office
                (II)     Opening the adoption procedure (DPA)
                (III)    Theoretical matching with the aim of adoption (PTA)
                (IV)     Practical matching with the aim of adoption (PPA)
                (V)      Entrusting the child for adoption (IVA)
                (VI)     Court Approval for/Revocation of the adoption
Of the 5,805 children with an adoption PIP at the time of data collection (November-December 2014)
and with valid Adoption Forms, some 1 percent were in the preparation phase at the time of the
study, in that their files had not yet been submitted by the DGASPC child protection office to the
DGASPC adoption office. These children are not included in the analyses described below because
they had not yet entered the actual process.
The data analysis revealed that, out of all children who entered the adoption process, 86 percent were
in the first three stages of the process (of whom 68 percent were in stage III involving theoretical
matching) and only 5 percent had reached the final stage. At the county level, not only did the
number of adoptable children vary widely but also their distribution in each stage (see the top graph
of Figure 80 and Annex 6 Table 50). In those counties with larger numbers of adoptable children, most
of them were in the theoretical matching stage (stage III), probably because the number of adopting
parents was not large enough to increase their chances for a match. Meanwhile, in counties with lower
numbers of adoptable children (such as Harghita, Vaslui or Constanța), over one-third of the children
had reached the final stages of the process.
In our process analysis that follows, we assumed that any child in a given stage had gone through all
the previous stages. For instance, we assumed that children in stage IV of the adoption process
(practical matching) had had their files submitted to the adoption office (stage I), had had an official
adoption procedure initiated (stage II), and had successfully passed through the theoretical matching
process (stage III), which means a list of potential adopters had been identified. Figure 80 (the bottom
graph) presents the distribution of adoptable children according to all of the stages they had gone
through up to November-December 2014. The process looks very different depending on the
perspective chosen for analysis: one that concerns only the situation existing at the time of the study
and one that also considers past stages (cumulative perspective), as can be seen in Figure 79 below.

The following sections are based on the cumulative perspective. The method we applied compares the
profile of the children in each stage of the process at the time of the study with the profile of the
children who had already concluded that stage. The aim of the analysis was not only to describe the
stages of the adoption process but also to use comparisons to discover whether there are any types of
children with an above average probability of remaining stuck in a certain stage.
In order to locate the process in time, the years in which these children began the adoption procedure
were those between 2005 and 2014, with 98 percent of children beginning the process between 2012
and 2014. Figure 81 clearly shows that, as might be expected, the more recent the start date, the more
likely a child was to be in the first stages of the process. At the same time, Figure 81 shows that there
are some obstacles in the process since almost all children who started it between 2005 and 2011 had
only reached stage II – opening of the adoption procedure (DPA) or stage III - theoretical matching
with the aim of adoption (PTA).

weighted (N=5,624 children).



(I) Submitting the File to the Adoption Office
For almost all adoptable children in public care, the process started when their file was submitted by
the case manager to the DGASPC adoption office. In the case of only 1 percent of children, the
process began with submitting a request for opening the adoption procedure (DPA) to a court of law,
most probably because at that time there was no adoption office in the DGASPC. This first stage had
been completed by 97 percent of the children who had entered the adoption process by November-
December 2014, with only 3 percent still being in stage I.
The profile of the children who were still in stage I (file submitted to the adoption office) largely
resembles the general profile of adoptable children presented in section 3.4.2.3 (see Annex 6 Table
51). Because they were children of a very young age who had recently entered the system, they had
the defining characteristics of the adoptable child, namely babies relinquished in a maternity ward413
for whom all efforts to reunite them with their families had failed, so that one to four years later the
adoption process was started. Most of them did not have adoptable siblings and came from families
headed by single mothers, especially adolescent mothers (14 percent) and mothers with disabilities
and/or mental health problems (41 percent). Few of these children were disabled (21 percent versus
the average of 29 percent), but among this group there was an over-representation of children with a
severe or marked disability (15 percent). There was also an over-representation of babies born
prematurely and/or underweight (18 percent of them).




413
      As a result, children with an undeclared ethnicity and those from urban areas are over-represented.

304
It is notable that among this group of children at the very beginning of the adoption process, there
was a massive over-representation of children who had entered the system only as a result of social
causes, either related to the specific profile of their parents (for example, adolescent mothers or
parental disabilities) or to poverty and/or precarious housing conditions, though the number of
children from families living in poverty was much lower in this group than in other groups or in the
overall population of adoptable children (32 percent versus 40 percent).
Children who were in the first stage of the adoption process at the time of the study had had contact
with their biological family or relatives up to the IV degree almost twice as much as children in the
other stages (30 percent versus 17 percent). Most of them had had contact within the previous year,
with the average being six months earlier.
The shares of children in stage I were not distributed equally throughout the whole country. Only 12
counties declared having any such cases, with most being in the counties of Bacău, Galați, Vaslui, and
Suceava, as shown in Figure 80 (top graph).
As already stated, all children who entered the adoption process went through this stage.
Consequently the date at which the case managers handed over the files of children with an adoption
PIP to the DGASPC adoption office is the same with the distribution of children according to the year
in which they started the adoption process (Figure 81 left box) as follows: 2 percent in the period 2005
to 2011, 18 percent in 2012, 50 percent in 2013, and 30 percent in 2014.



(II) Opening the Adoption Procedure (DPA)
As of November-December 2014, of the total number of children in the adoption process, 97 percent
had reached the stage of opening the procedure (DPA) and 82 percent had passed on to the following
stages (Figure 80, bottom graph). Consequently, 15 percent of children were still in this stage.
A small group (around 1 percent) of the children in stage II had started the adoption process in 2011-
2012, spending more than two years in the DPA stage. These children had disabilities and had entered
public care before the age of 1, having been relinquished in the maternity ward. Their adoption files
had been prepared when they were between 7 and 14 years old. Only 16 percent of them had
adoptable siblings, so they could be included in a group of siblings. Children who spent more than
two years in the DPA stage only existed in four counties: Dolj, Galați, Prahova, and Vaslui.
The group of children then in the DPA stage were mainly children of single-mothers who had been
relinquished in the maternity ward, a large share of whom were declared adoptable less than one
year after entering the system so that a quarter of them were between the ages of 0 and 2 at the time
of the study (see Annex 6 Table 51). The specific profile of this group included the following
characteristics: an over-representation of children from large families,414 especially from rural areas (30
percent) and from families living in poverty (49 percent), which for 1 out of every 10 children was the
main reason why they had entered the system (9 percent). In total, avoidable entries amounted to 15
percent of this group, a percentage which was almost double the share of children who had
completed this stage of the adoption process. In addition, significantly higher shares of the children in
stage II (DPA) had entered the system after being left home alone or after living for periods of time
with relatives or on the street as a consequence of unhappy events and/or exploitation.




414
      Consequently, a larger than average share of them had siblings in the system, though not adoptable ones.

                                                                                                                 305

With regard to the sub-stages within stage II, at the time of the study, a DPA request had been
forwarded to the court for 39 percent of the children in stage II and a ruling/decision was expected.
Meanwhile, 22 percent of the children were waiting for the court to send its decision officially to the
DGASPC, and 36 percent of children were in the phase pending a final DPA court ruling.

Our analysis of case files shows that a child who had reached the DPA waited one month415 on
average between the time the case manager handed over the file to the DGASPC adoption office and
the time the DGASPC request to open the adoption procedure was submitted to the court, as required
by law. There was, however, considerable variation among cases, from a minimum of one week at the
most to a maximum of 16 months. Consequently, in some cases the child had to wait for more than a
year before the request to open the adoption procedure was submitted to the court.
In order to analyze the duration of the sub-stages within stage II (DPA), we used the information on
the children who had concluded this stage. We found out that for those children the whole DPA
procedure lasted, on average, 130 days (approximately 3.7 months)416 from the submission of the DPA
request until the final DPA court ruling. Table 40 shows that what takes longest is the court to
pronounce its ruling on the DPA request, around 68 days on average. The DPA court ruling was
communicated to the DGASPC, on average, in 35 days after it was pronounced, and it became final 59
days after it was pronounced.

The length of time varied substantially between counties depending on the quality of the services
provided by the county courts as well as on the quality of the collaboration between the court and the
DGASPC. The county of Galați had the longest average duration (eight months), while the county of
Dâmbovița had the shortest (1.7 months).

(III) Theoretical Matching (PTA)
The theoretical matching is a critical stage in the adoption process. As many as 82 percent of all
children who had entered the adoption process reached this stage, but only 14 percent went on to the
following stages (Figure 80, bottom graph). Consequently, in stage III (PTA) we found the largest
number of adoptable children.
Of the almost 3,900 children who were in this stage at the time of the analysis, 31 percent had had no
theoretical matching up to that point while 69 percent had at least begun the theoretical matching
process. The 31 percent of children with no theoretical matching consisted of two sub-groups (Figure
84): the large majority had recently received their final DPA court ruling and were waiting for the
adoption offices to start the theoretical matching procedure, while for a smaller group (around 6
percent), the theoretical matching had started but no list of adoptive families had yet been issued,
even though the DPA court ruling had been final ever since 2006-2011. This smaller group of children,
representing some 2 percent of all children in stage III (PTA), seemed to be stuck in this stage since
they had been in stage III for an average of over five years.417 This group consisted mainly of children
with disabilities or children with developmental delays, with no adoptable siblings, who had entered
the system before they were 1 year old, had started the adoption process when they were over 3 years
old, and were between 7 and 14 years old at the time of the study. They were from Bihor and Prahova
counties. This group would appear to have very little chance of going through the adoption process
successfully.

As mentioned above, the majority of the children in the theoretical matching stage at the time of the
study (69 percent) had had at least one list of potential adoptive parents drawn up by the DGASPC.
Table 41 shows that an average of four PTA lists was drawn up for these children, which is more than
the number of lists prepared for the children who had continued on to the next stages of the adoption
process. The differences were even greater in terms of the maximum number of PTA lists prepared,
with a maximum of 14 having been prepared for children then in stage III versus seven lists for the
children who had completed this stage. Of all children then in stage III (PTA) for whom the DGASPC
had prepared at least one list of adoptive parents, 11 percent had had 8 to 14 lists prepared for them.
This means that none of the adoptive parents on the previous list(s) were prepared to take them on.
Accordingly, this is a second group with apparently very little chance of going through the adoption
process successfully.

  The average time between the court’s final DPA ruling and the time of the study was 60.5 months, with a standard
deviation of 15.6 months. By comparison, for the other children waiting to start stage III (PTA), the average time was 10.3
months, with a standard deviation of 7.2 months.

The largest share of this latter group consisted of boys (69 percent) who had entered the system when
they were over 1 year old, had spent more than three years in the system, had reached the point of
adoption at the age of 6 or older, and were 7 to 17 years old at the time of the study. Almost all of
them were children with no disabilities, from nuclear families, from urban areas, living in poverty
and/or precarious housing conditions (52 percent) who had entered the system for reasons of child
neglect. Some of these children were relinquished by their parents on the street or in other public
spaces.

Another indication that the group of children with 8-14 PTA lists is stuck in stage III is the average
time that had passed between the final DPA court ruling and our research phase - an average of 18.5
months versus about 13 months for children with 1-7 lists of adoptive parents.418 These differences are
even more apparent in Figure 85 below.

Other than the two groups with little chance of completing this stage, the children in stage III (PTA) at
the time of the study tended to consist of (see Annex 6 Table 51): (i) children between 7 and 17 years
old who began the adoption process later than other adoptable children; (ii) a slight over-
representation of Roma children; (iii) children with one or both parents who had problems of excessive

alcohol consumption and/or disabilities and/or mental health problems;419 (iv) a significant proportion
of children from rural areas (with no higher a risk of poverty than the average) who received no
preventive services or aid in the community before entering the system; (v) children with siblings in
the system, of whom most had one to two adoptable siblings (45 percent versus 25 percent of the
children who went on to the subsequent stages); and (vi) children with disabilities, including severe
and marked disabilities (35 percent of children who were then in stage III and 49 percent of children
with no theoretical matching versus 6 percent of all children who went on to the next stages), and/or
with developmental delays (14 percent and 16 percent respectively versus 9 percent).
Considering that most children in this stage had at least one PTA list of potential adoptive parents, it
was not clear what was preventing these children from moving onto the practical matching stage
(stage IV). In this regard, too, it was possible to distinguish a group of children with a large number of
lists (60 percent of children had 8 to 14 lists versus 32 percent who had 1 to 7 lists). The reasons given
by prospective adoptive parents for not going ahead with a practical match, as shown in Figure 86, are
basically even for both categories of children (those with eight toten PTA lists and those with one to
seven lists), with one exception, child-related reasons are provided for 26 percent of children with 8 to
14 PTA lists versus only 10 percent of those with 1 to 7 lists. In most cases, the main reason given by
adoptive parents was the child’s older age (23 percent). Reasons that were rarely mentioned were the
child's ethnicity (fewer than 10 percent) or gender (male) as well as the child’s “physical features” and
his or her “behavioral problems.”420 In very few cases (3 percent), the adoptive parents’ reasons for not
agreeing to the practical match included the child’s medical history (disabilities) or the requirement to
adopt a group of siblings.

However, for all children who could not go on to the practical matching stage, the reasons were mostly
related to their potential adoptive parents. The fact that, in most cases, the adoptive parents wanted to
adopt the child who had already been placed with them draws attention once more to the need for an
analysis of how placement with other families or individuals influences the adoption process.
These data are consistent with the findings of a study by UNICEF and ORA421 showing that 72 percent of
adoptive families want children under 3 years old and 81 percent of them want children with no medical
issues. Also, the study concluded that children who have siblings in the system are harder to adopt. It found
that 94 percent of families adopt only one child, and in 40 percent of cases, families prefer a particular child
with whom they have had previous contact, usually a child whom they have already fostered.
At the county level, the highest numbers of children in stage III (PTA) at the time of the study were in
Dolj, Caraș-Severin and Galați (Figure 80, top graph). However, when we compared children in stage III
to all children who had entered the adoption process, we noticed several counties registered rates
higher than the national average, with the highest being in Mehedinți and Botoșani (Figure 87). In
order to guide potential interventions, it is useful to know that there were also very high percentages
of children at serious risk of not completing this stage of the adoption process in Dâmbovița,
Hunedoara, Vrancea, Mehedinți, Arad and Bihor.

In conclusion, after an average period of 3.7 months until a final DPA court ruling was obtained,
children tended to get stuck in stage III (PTA), particularly if there was a large number of children who
started the process at the same time, as was the case with the 2012-2014 wave of children in the
adoption process that we analyzed in this study. The high percentage of children in stage III at the
time of our study was to be expected given that the wave of children intended for adoption was not
accompanied by an increase in the number of prospective adoptive parents. Also, given that a
significant number 422 of adoptive parents want to adopt a particular child, namely the child whom
they already had in foster care, then the actual number of available adoptive parents is even lower.
Therefore, it will not be possible to streamline the process and move more children out of stage III
unless measures to increase the number of adoptive parents in Romania and, if possible, abroad are
taken. Measures are also required to unblock the process for the two sub-groups identified in this
study - children with too few or no PTA lists for too long a time and children with too many PTA lists
but no successful outcome - without which these children are likely to spend years in the adoption
process, without ever finding a permanent solution for their future.



(IV) Practical Matching (PPA)
About 800 children (14 percent of all children who had entered the adoption process) had reached
stage IV, the practical matching stage (PPA). A practical match was approved for 8 percent of these
children who then passed on to the subsequent stages, while around 6 percent remained in stage IV
at the time of the study (Figure 80). As shown in Figure 81, all of the children in stage IV (PPA) had
entered the adoption process between 2012 and 2014.

The children who were in stage IV (PPA) fell into two distinct groups according to the number and
outcome of their practical matches. Fourteen percent had an approved practical match so had
qualified to pass on to stage V (IVA), but most (67 percent) had only had unsuccessful matches.423
Figure 88 shows that the children who had only unsuccessful matches can be subdivided into those
with one to two failed PPAs (51 percent of the children then in stage IV) and children with 3 to 17
failed PPAs (16 percent). While the first group’s number of failed PPAs was similar to that of the
children who had completed this stage, the second group was at risk of getting stuck longer at this

stage, especially those who had more than six failed PPAs. All children who had a successful practical
match had a maximum of three failed PPAs.


Because of their prevalence, the children who only had failed practical matches determined the
specific characteristics of the group of children who were in this stage at the time of the study (Annex
6 Table 51). They were mostly boys (64 percent versus 37 percent of boys who completed this stage),
children who had entered the protection system before the age of 1 after having been relinquished in
maternity wards, those whose adoption procedure began when they were 1 to 2 years old and who
were 3 to 6 years old at the time of the study. The share of children from risk groups (such as children
with disabilities) was extremely low. Children from source communities are over-represented in this
group (23 percent versus an average of 12 percent) as are those from nuclear families (28 percent
versus an average of 10 percent). Ninety-six percent of the children in this group were placed with
foster carers compared to 64 percent of those who had received a practical match.
It is noteworthy that the only significant difference between children with one to two failed PPAs and
those with 3 to 17 failed PPAs was the children's ethnicity. The share of ethnic Romanian children
prevailed among the children who completed the practical matching stage (above the average of the
sample) while children with unknown or undeclared ethnicity prevailed among children with 3 to 17
failed PPAs (Table 42).

The reasons for the failed PPAs that were expressed by potential adoptive parents and recorded in the
children’s case files complemented and reinforced this finding (Figure 89). For the children with one to
two failed PPAs, the reasons were related to the adoptive parents in almost all cases. Reasons related
to the child were mentioned in 55 percent of the cases, most commonly in reference to the child's
medical history. For 91 percent of the children with 3 to 17 failed PPAs, the reasons given were related
to the child, while in only 40 percent of the cases the reasons given were related to the adoptive
parents. In the case of these children, the main child-related reason that was stated was the child's
ethnicity (in 60 percent of cases), followed by the child’s “unknown origin.”
These results confirm the views expressed by DGASPC experts during our interviews, in that the
adoption process in Romania is strongly influenced by the sometimes unrealistic expectations that
prospective parents have concerning the children they wish to adopt. They do not want just any child
but the “perfect” “Romanian” child who is “blonde with blue eyes,” a “hale and hearty” child with an
“IQ of 147.” Therefore, Roma children and children with disabilities are least likely to be adopted. Also,
the chances of a child being adopted lower increasingly as the child gets older. Prospective parents
want children who can be “shaped,” and that window of opportunity, according to experts, closes
around the age of 5. The quotes of Story Bag 9 are illustrative in this respect.
         “Relying on your work experience so far, how much does the ethnicity of a child in child protection
         matter, I mean, first of all, the ease with which he or she enters the system and the ease with which
         he or she then exits the system?

                  - In adoptions, yes, because everyone wants children who are blonde with blue eyes and an IQ of

                  “If we talk about adoption, we've found in recent years that most families who want to adopt a
                  child do not adopt children who have passed a certain age, those over the age of 5. Very few
                  people expressed a desire to adopt a child of an older age. Most of them want very young
                  children, and we try to split our efforts somehow [between these two situations]. Ok, what are the
                  chances of adoption for child X. Although it is not fair, but having a very large number of cases,
                  you think which is the most likely child to go, whose adoption is most likely to work. I told you,
                  this is not a fair approach, but neither can I open an adoption procedure for a young man of 14
                  because I would stand no chance [to make it work].” (Interview with a professional, Bacău)

The chance of a child receiving an approved practical match increases when the adoptive individual or
family lives in the county where the child is under protection (Figure 90). In 74 percent of the failed
practical matches, the individuals or families were not resident in the district or county where the child
was protected, compared to only 21 percent of those involved in approved practical matches.

In 54 percent of the failed practical matches, there was no visit or meeting between the child and the
family or individual with whom that match was made, whereas in 51 percent of the approved practical
matches, four or more visits or meetings took place (the law requires that a minimum of four meetings
must take place between the child and the prospective adoptive parents). The child had permission to
visit the family in only 1 percent of the failed practical matches and in 16 percent of the approved
practical matches.

 The average duration from the initiation of the adoption process (the submission of the file to the
  adoption office) to the beginning of the first practical match (whether failed or approved) was 9.6
  months.424 The minimum period was 3 months and the maximum was 37 months.
 The average duration of a failed practical match was approximately 11 days. However, there is a
  considerable variation from one failed PPA to another. The longest ones seem to be the first two
  PPAs, which may take up to nearly five months. As of the third failed PPA, the average durations
  gradually decrease.
 The average time period between the submission of the file to the adoption office and the
  beginning of an approved practical match was 10 months.425 The minimum period was 3 months
  and the maximum was 37 months.
 The time between the beginning of the approved practical matching process and the conclusion of
  the practical matching final report ranges from 0 days (when the match was achieved the same
  day) to 3 months. The average time length is 0.5 months. For most children (40 percent), this
  process lasted less than a month.


Asking the child for their opinion of the prospective adoptive person or family was found to be an
uncommon practice.

At the county level, the highest number of children in stage IV (PPA) at the time of the study were in
Caraș-Severin and Harghita (Figure 80, top graph). A comparison between children in stage IV and all
children who had entered the adoption process showed that several counties registered rates higher
than the national average (which is 6 percent), with a maximum of five times higher than the average
in Harghita county (32 percent). Moreover, Figure 93 shows that inter-county differences extend to the
children’s profiles as well. Thus, there were many children in Harghita in the practical matching stage,
many of them already having had a large number of failed PPAs. In contrast, Constanța did not
provided any data on adoption (because it did not fill in the adoption forms), Bistrița-Năsăud only had
a small number of children in this stage but all had approved PPAs, while in Gorj all children had only
failed PPAs though these were few (one to two PPAs).

The conclusion of the previous section remains valid, namely that it is vital to increase the number of
available adoptive parents in order to increase the chances that practical matches will succeed. Also, it
is necessary to increase the effectiveness of the courses attended by those individuals and families
who want to adopt a child. In parallel, education and communication campaigns at the community
level should focus on raising awareness of adoption and adopted children and changing negative
attitudes that reject and undervalue children, regardless of their gender, age, ethnicity, health status or
parents.



(V) Entrusting the Child for Adoption (IVA)
Of all children who started the adoption process, 469 children reached this stage (8 percent). Of these,
about 1 percent did not have to complete this stage because they had been in foster care for more
than two years with the person or family who wanted to adopt them. Therefore, they went directly
from PPA to court approval of the adoption. Over 4 percent of all children in the adoption process
completed stage V (IVA) and went on to the next stage. Therefore, at the time of the study about 3
percent of the children in the adoption process were in stage V (IVA) (Figure 80).
Children who were very young when they entered the adoption process have a higher than average
probability of getting to stage V (IVA) having gone through the previous stages when they were less
than 3 years old (Annex 6 Table 51). At the time of the study, the following groups were over-
represented in stage V: (i) girls (60 percent); (ii) Romanian children; (iii) those with no siblings; (iv)
those from urban areas and not from source communities; and (v) those from a single-mother family
(78 percent) who had completed at least secondary school and/or those of teenage mothers. There
were some babies born prematurely and/or underweight in stage V, but there were no children from
any other group of children with special needs. The main reasons why they entered the system were
relinquishment (85 percent) or neglect (12 percent). Twenty-two percent of them (compared to an
average of 6 percent) were placed with other families or individuals, and 90 percent of them
(compared to an average of 62 percent) had never had any connection with their biological family.
Therefore, the children who had reached stage V (IVA) largely corresponded to the “ideal” profile of an
adoptable child as described by the potential adoptive parents.

For these children, approximately 9.5 months passed between the submission of the child’s file to the
adoption office (stage I) and the submission of the IVA request to the court (stage V). It took an
average of eight days between the preparation of the practical matching report (stage IV) and the
submission of the IVA request to the court (in accordance with the legislation, this is only supposed to
take five days).
In stage V (IVA), it took an average of three months between the submission of the IVA request to the
court and the court ruling becoming final.

As with stage II (DPA), the duration of stage V (IVA) reflects the cooperation between the DGASPCs
and the county courts. Only in two counties did stage V (IVA) take longer than the national average -
Bacău and Galați - and these same counties also took longer to get children through stage II (DPA).

(VI) Court Approval/Revocation of Adoption
Of the total sample, 307 children (5.4 percent of all adoptable children) reached the last stage of the
process (Figure 80, bottom graph). For 87 percent of them, the IVA court ruling was an approval, while
for 13 percent, a revocation.
The small number of children with a revocation court ruling (39 children) allowed for a descriptive
analysis only. For 11 of the 39 children, the court revoked the IVA 56 days after the child had moved in
with the adoptive family and, for 17 children, 165 days after. For the remaining 11 children, the
adoption forms contained no information on the date when the child moved in with the adoptive
family. The reasons for revocation according to the adoptive person or family included the ethnicity of
the child, the fact that the child’s birth had not been attended by healthcare professionals, and the
person’s or family’s personal wish to give up the adoption.
In all 39 cases, the PIP goal remained a domestic adoption, and for 22 of the children the theoretical
matching procedure was resumed.
On average, children reached the approval stage 13.5 months after the initiation of the adoption
process and 40 days after the IVA court ruling became final. The approval stage took an average of 2.2
months, including 40 days until the delivery of the court’s ruling, 30 days for the court ruling to be
communicated to the DGASPC, and 30 days until the ruling became final.

The adoption process took longer for certain groups of children including children older than 3, those
with siblings in the system and/or who were adoptable, children with disabilities, those with
developmental delays, premature and/or underweight babies, those whose mothers were teenagers
when the child entered the system, those with parents abroad, and children with parents with
disabilities and/or mental health problems.
Most children who reached the last stage of the adoption process and received the court’s approval
for adoption (Annex 6 Table 51) had the following characteristics: they were girls, had no siblings in
the system or who were adoptable, had only one theoretical match426 and no failed practical match,427
entered public care at early ages (38 percent were 0 to 2 years old versus the average of 20 percent),
and had no disabilities and/or developmental delays. More than one-third of them had had
placements with relatives or other individuals or families.

426
   Of the children who had reached this final stage of the adoption process, 63 percent had only one theoretical match,
while of the entire sample of children who had reached the theoretical matching stage, only 17 percent had only one
theoretical match.
427
   Of the children who reached the last stage, 94 percent had no failed practical match. For the whole sample, 35
percent of the children had at least one failed practical match.

At the county level, the counties with the highest number of children in stage VI were Galați and
Bacău (Figure 80, top graph). The national average rate is 5 percent of all children in the adoption
process, while rates five to six times higher were recorded in Bistrița-Năsăud, Satu-Mare, and Vâlcea.
We were unable to analyze the children’s natural parents’ motions for a review of the IVA/Approval
court ruling because there were very few of these requests.



Overview of the Adoption Process in Romania
Our analysis of the adoption process by stages highlighted the main bottlenecks in the process and
identified the children with lower than average chances of overcoming them. Four such bottlenecks
were identified:
(1) In stage II (DPA), there were children who had entered the adoption process as early as 2005-2011
and in November-December 2014 were still waiting for the opening of the adoption procedure.
(2) In stage III (PTA), there were children with no PTA list although their DPA court ruling had become
final as early as 2006-2011 (in other words, they had had too few PTA lists for too long).
(3) In stage III (PTA), there were children who had had too many lists of adoptive parents (8 to 14 lists)
that had not led to any practical matches. Benchmarking them against the children who had
completed stage III showed that, after three PTA lists, the chances of reaching the practical matching
stage significantly decreased while after seven lists they came close to zero.
(4) In stage IV (PPA), there were children with 3 to 17 failed practical matches. According to our
analysis of the progression of children through the higher stages, after a third failed PPA the chances
of being adopted decrease considerably.
However, the main limitation of the analysis remains the absence of a counterfactual consisting of
national and international finalized adoption cases.428 As a solution, we built a “moving” pseudo-
counterfactual by comparing each stage with the following stages to determine the chances of
children becoming stuck or successfully adopted. This methodological choice yielded results but did
not allow for a refined observation of certain small groups and/or groups with very specific

   Because of the legislation restricting international adoptions, it was not possible to build a counterfactual for
international adoptions (see section 3.4.2.1).

characteristics because usually these are distributed among stages in an erratic or distorted manner.
Consider for example the situation of children with disabilities who “artificially” entered or were
“forced” to enter the adoption process in the opinion of the DGASPC specialists who were interviewed
in the qualitative study.
            “For example, where the reintegration of children is not... for children with severe disabilities who
            require specialized medical care, permanent medical assistance, who are in specialized centers for
            children with disabilities in our country. They are vegetables,* for example. Family reintegration is
            not possible even if the parents would like that, say, hypothetically, you cannot leave them there
            because they don't have the necessary medical services. You make efforts, because that's how it
            is, once reintegration fails, you should make the necessary arrangements to quickly open the
            adoption procedure. You go through the steps, identify relatives up to the fourth degree, using
            the census, identify them, take interviews, evaluate their living conditions, and open the internal
            adoption procedure. No one adopts them. Social-professional integration, it’s not even an issue.
            Socio-professional integration is for children over 16. Automatically even if they reach 16, you
            cannot socio-professionally integrate them. You can’t fit the profile. You draw a PIP with an
            adoption goal, you set out to achieve that goal, but you can’t do it." (Interview with a
            professional, Craiova)
Note: *We believe that such attitudes and stereotypes need to be addressed and actively discouraged.

To better understand the experience of the children with disabilities who entered the adoption
process, Figure 96 illustrates the entire process from entry to the court approval or revocation stage
(last stage of the process), highlighting potential bottlenecks. To read the results correctly, it is useful
to recall that the group of children with disabilities (at the time of their entry into the system and/or at
the time of the study) represented 29 percent of all children in the adoption process429 and entered
the process earlier430 within the wave of children selected for adoption in 2012 to 2014.

    Children without disabilities represented 62 percent, while for 9 percent of children, there were no data in their case
files.

   The distribution of children with disabilities by the year of their entry into the adoption process was as follows: 3
percent entered in 2005-2011, 24 percent in 2012, 51 percent in 2013, 21 percent in 2014, and 1 percent was not known.
The corresponding rates for children without disabilities were: 2 percent (2005-2011), 15 percent (2012), 47 percent
(2013), 34 percent (2014), and 2 percent (not known).

                                                                                                                                                        321
In total, there are fewer children with disabilities than children without disabilities (6 percent versus 9
percent) within the bottleneck areas (the red quadrants of the figure). Statistically, the difference is
significant and leads to the conclusion that children with disabilities have a lower probability of
stalling in the adoption process than other children.
Children without disabilities go through the early stages, which are predominantly administrative, at a
faster pace and have a 7 percent likelihood of getting stuck in the theoretical matching stage (stage
III) when the child’s characteristics are weighed against the expectations of the adoptive parents (as
they are described in the various studies conducted and as the study results are interpreted by the
decision-makers involved in the matching process). Children without disabilities may also get stuck in
the practical matching stage (stage IV) where potential adoptive parents play a very important role.
In contrast, children with disabilities go through the early stages very slowly. After they are declared
adoptable, they then wait, sometimes for years (3 percent), for their case managers to submit the DPA
request to the court. For children with disabilities with an open DPA request, the total time between
the submission of the request to the court and the court ruling becoming final was shorter than for
children without disabilities (average of 116 days or 3.3 months versus 135 days or four months).431
Next, once the DPA court ruling becomes final, the chances of children with disabilities getting stuck
or having to wait longer for the issuance of a PTA list are considerably higher. In addition to the 2
percent of the children with disabilities who were stuck, one-third of children with disabilities received
no theoretical match (a share over two times higher than for children without disabilities) even though
they entered the process earlier than non-disabled children. The most likely explanation for this is that
the theoretical matching process did not find any adoptive parents who were capable of “turning a
blind eye” to the child’s health status.
After this stage, there were very few children with disabilities. However, two facts can be observed.
First, children with disabilities represented only 11 percent of children in stage VI. In other words, at
the end of the process, the share of children with disabilities as a percentage of all children was almost
three times lower than at the beginning of the process (11 percent versus 29 percent). Second, more
than two-thirds of the children with disabilities who had reached stage VI had been placed with
relatives or other individuals or families (67 percent versus 35 percent of non-disabled children).
Therefore, the chances of children with disabilities being adopted are lower than those for children
with no disabilities. Their chances could be increased by reconsidering the theoretical and the practical
matching procedures but also by better training DGASPC specialists on how to communicate with
potential adoptive parents about the circumstances of children with disabilities, especially as some of
them have only minor or moderate disabilities.




431
   The standard deviations are 75 days for children with disabilities and 92 days for those without disabilities, indicating
a more homogeneous treatment of children with disabilities by the courts.

 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 In our analysis, we looked at the status at the time of the study (November-December 2014) of the wave of
 children in the protection system who had been declared adoptable between 2012 and 2014.
 These children entered the adoption process with a range of very different characteristics, but those who had
 significantly higher chances of completing the process were: young children, especially those between 0 and 2
 years old, girls, children with no siblings in the system, and children without disabilities and/or developmental
 delays. More than one-third of them came from placements with relatives or other individuals or families.
 For the children with the above features who were in the final stage, the adoption process had lasted, on
 average, 15 to 16 months.
 There are four main sources of bottlenecks in the process:

 (1) In stage II (DPA), there were children who had been entered the adoption process as early as 2005-2011
 and in November-December 2014 were still waiting for the opening of the adoption procedure.

 (2) In stage III (PTA), there were children with no PTA list although their DPA court ruling had become final as
 early as 2006-2011 (in other words, they had had too few PTA lists for too long).

 (3) In stage III (PTA), there were children who had had too many lists of adoptive parents (8 to 14 lists) that had
 not led to any practical matches. Benchmarking them against the children who had completed stage III
 showed that, after three PTA lists, the chances of reaching the practical matching stage significantly decreased
 while after seven lists they came close to zero.

 (4) In stage IV (PPA), there were children with 3 to 17 failed practical matches. According to our analysis of the
 progression of children through the higher stages, after a third failed PPA the chances of being adopted
 decrease considerably.
 Increasing the number of available adoptive parents is vital to increase the numbers of successful theoretical
 matches and accepted practical matches. As of the beginning of the adoption process, after the average of 3.7
 months required to receive a final DPA court ruling, children tend to get stuck in stage III (PTA), especially if
 many children begin the process at the same time. The high percentage of children in stage III at the time of
 our study was to be expected given that the wave of children intended for adoption registered no response
 from the prospective adoptive parents. Also, given that a significant number432 of adoptive parents want to
 adopt a particular child, namely the child whom they already had in foster care, then the actual number of
 available adoptive parents is even lower. Therefore, it will not be possible to streamline the process and move
 more children out of stage III unless measures to increase the number of adoptive parents in Romania and, if
 possible, abroad are taken.

 The fact that, in most cases, the adoptive parents wanted to adopt the child who had already been placed with
 them draws attention once more to the need for an analysis of how placement with other families or
 individuals influences the adoption process.
 Measures are also required to unblock the process for the two sub-groups identified in this study - children
 with too few or no PTA lists for too long a time and children with too many PTA lists but no successful
 outcome - without which these children are likely to spend years in the adoption process, without ever finding
 a permanent solution for their future.
 It is also necessary to increase the effectiveness of the courses attended by those individuals and families who
 want to adopt a child. In parallel, education and communication campaigns at the community level should
 focus on raising awareness of adoption and adopted children and changing negative attitudes that reject and
 undervalue children, regardless of their gender, age, ethnicity, health status or parents.
 Therefore, to ensure that all children have a real chance at a successful permanent living solution will require
 rethinking the theoretical and practical matching procedures and improving the training of specialists on how
 to communicate with prospective adoptive parents about the circumstances of children with disabilities.

“It is an apartment building with 100 families I think, I think
we are around 100 families. A single building, but mostly of
Roma people, I don’t know what to call them not to offend                                    10
them, gipsies. Yes, it is a building of gipsies and there are
other families, I don’t know if there are 10 Romanian
families in all. We also lived with my mother-in-law, when I
moved to my husband’s apartment I lived with my mother-
in-law, but we couldn’t live there with the children. This is
how we got here... I can’t let my child go outside, because you hear only dirty words, because
this is what people around you are like, and you basically have nowhere to go. We only go to
the park sometimes. I prefer to stay at home, to watch TV, or I don’t know, if the child has no
place to run a little, to have his own room or I don’t know, to play there, do his homework
there, later on, which will become neccessary... But we have no choice because we have
nowhere to go, we can’t financially afford to pay rent.

Well, when he comes home, he always says: mom, when can I go play in the yard? Or he tells
me: mom I want to play too, but I can’t. He’s sad when he comes home sometimes. In the
morning, he can’t wait to go to kindergarten, what can I tell you, he’s glad to go play with
the children. When he comes home, it’s like home, I only have, look, only this much space,
one per two square meters, in the middle of the house. ... it’s one room, kitchen and
bedroom in the same place. And then: don’t jump there, don’t touch that, don’t pull that, be
careful not to drop the other, so the poor kid has to sit in a corner, on a bed, to just sit with a
toy in his hands and fiddle with it.”

This section describes the features of families with children in public care who live in "source
communities." In section 3.2.5.3, we demonstrated the existence of such geographical concentrations
of mothers/parents with children in public care, both in rural and urban areas. The research that we
conducted in the 60 communes that contain such source communities has enabled us to reach a
better understanding of the circumstances of families with children in public care. The goal of the
assessment was twofold. The first aim was to investigate the extent to which the support system is
meeting the needs of these families and thereby facilitating the reintegration of the separated
children. The second aim was to understand to what extent the children who are still in the home are
being efficiently protected and monitored to ensure not only that they will not need to enter the
public care system but also that they are not living in conditions that are unfavorable to their growth
and development.
As shown in Chapter 2.3 regarding the data and method used in this study, our survey of households
with children in public care in the source communities was based on a sample of mothers identified
using the available data in the CMTIS. Among the households living at the addresses given in the
CMTIS, only 61 percent still comprised either the mother or another person who had cared for one or
more children now in public care. The other 39 percent of the households no longer lived in the
commune.433 Moreover, in the source communities of the 60 communes under analysis, an additional
139 families with children in public care were identified who were not registered in the CMTIS, as
shown in Table 45 below.

 RECOMMENDATIONS
 The survey (particularly the actual collecting of the survey data) underlined the fact that a significant share of
 the target families (those into which children might be reintegrated) is unstable. For almost 40 percent of the
 addresses drawn from the CMTIS for the rural source communities, no member of the child’s family could be
 found. This shows that more systematic and repeated efforts must be made to maintain contact with the
 families of children in public care, without which it will be impossible to achieve the PIP goal of reintegrating
 children into their families.
 Given the wide geographical dispersion of families, it is clear that such efforts cannot be made by case
 managers alone. The responsibility for maintaining contact with and monitoring the conditions of the families
 of children in public care must be shared in fact, not theory with the social workers who are closest to these
 families. In the absence of any true collaboration between the child protection professionals and the
 community social services, family reintegration will not only be difficult but may even be unsustainable. It is
 worth recalling that the case managers who were the most critical of SPAS and of the Community Consultative
 Structures were precisely those who had managed to reintegrate children into their families.

    Only two mothers refused to participate in the survey, and there were eight cases in which households were present
but no longer included either the biological mother or any other person who had cared for one or more of the
institutionalized children prior to their entering the system.

                  in Public Care in Rural Source Communities
Out of the 873 surveyed households, the assessment in this chapter focused only on households with
at least one child under 18 years of age who was separated from the family (772 cases).434 Of these
772 cases, in 705 at least one child was still separated from the family at the time of the study
(interestingly, in 15 cases one or more children had returned in the family, while others had remained
in public care). Moreover, out of all households with at least one child still separated from the family,
in 63 percent of the cases, the mothers still lived in the home, while in the other 37 percent of cases, at
least one other person who had cared for the child (usually, the grandmother) was present.

are not weighted.

In at least two-thirds of the households with children in public care at the time of the study (68
percent), there was at least one child who still lived with the family. This was the case even though the
child who was in the system was admitted because of the existence of certain factors in the household.
In 70 percent of households where the mother of the children in care is present, at least one other
child still lives there. Even though these children were not always the children of the mothers with
children in care, in half of these cases at least one of the mother’s children lived in the household
(Table 46). As might be expected, a reverse relationship can be noticed between the number of
children in public care and the number of children still living in the household - the higher the number
of children still in care, the higher the likelihood that no other child lived in the household (Annex 6
Table 52).
There seems to be no clear relationship between a child’s presence in the household and the main
cause of separation for the child in public care. Children were found to be still living in households
where this should not be the case given the reasons why the children in care were taken out of the
household (Figure 97). It is even more difficult to explain why this was allowed to happen in the case


434
   The other 101 cases in the sample refer to children who were separated from their families but who in the meantime
had turned 18. They either continued to be in public care (still continuing their education or looking for a job), or were
transferred to an institution for adults with disabilities, were reinserted in families, or were socio-professionally
integrated.

326
of households where the mothers of the children in public care were still living with at least one child.
For example, some mothers were still living with their children in cases where the reasons for another
child being taken into care had been the family's inadequate housing conditions and precarious
financial situation.
This situation raises multiple questions. If extreme poverty is addressed only by sending the children
into the system, why are there still children living in these households? A family’s extreme poverty is
obviously not going to be solved automatically just by removing some of the children from the
household. On the other hand, if the family’s poverty was solved in the meantime, then why were the
children still in care? The same questions are relevant when children were separated from their
families for other reasons such as neglect or alcoholism. If after careful monitoring and intervention
the problem was solved, the separated children should have been reintegrated in the family, and if the
problem was still not solved, then why are other children still living in the household? These are
particularly relevant questions for avoidable cases, which are those related only to social causes.435

The study carefully examined the characteristics of the households of children in public care in order
to better understand the conditions in which they would be living if they were to be reintegrated into
their families. Much could be learned from focusing on the children who were still living in these
households because they not only represented a good counterfactual but also because some of them
could have been in an increasingly vulnerable situation themselves.
The analysis focused on two types of children:
(i) the children of mothers who had at least one other child in the system and
(ii) children who were not the offspring of the mothers but either lived with them or lived in the
households from which the mothers had left.
In studying these children, we analyzed multiple facets of social exclusion, including housing,
education, child care, health and nutrition, and income.



Housing
Section 3.2.5.3. showed not only that there are source communities from which a disproportionate
number of children enter public care but also that these communities overlap to a great extent with
marginalized areas.436 Our analysis showed that, although a significant share of families with separated
children is concentrated in marginalized areas, they tend to be widely dispersed among communes
(both urban and rural). As the survey collected complete information on the households living at the
addresses given for the mothers with separated children, we were able to examine in detail the
overlap between extreme poverty at the community level and the risk of children being separated
from their families. These data indicated that 50 percent of selected mothers lived (or had lived) in
villages that contained marginalized areas. An interesting issue is that, the sample revealed a few
villages with concentrations of mothers that were not found as being marginalized. This may have
been because it was possible to identify marginalized areas based on the census data only when a
minimum number of households in a census sector was reached (50 households), and this minimum
number might be too high to make it possible to identify all of the concentrations of families at risk.
Approximately half of the families of the separated children lived in clusters on the outskirts or even
outside communes (Figure 98). Accordingly, the probability of a household being located on the
outskirts or outside of the commune is greater if the village in which it is located has at least one
marginalized area.

   Marginalized areas were identified using 2011 Census microdata and were defined as intra-commune areas
characterized by three types of disadvantages - low human capital, lack of formal employment, and precarious housing
conditions. See the Atlas of Marginalized Urban Areas (Swinkels et al., 2014) and the Atlas of Marginalized Rural Areas
(Teșliuc, Grigoraș and Stănculescu, coord., 2016).

Because they are located on the outskirts of the commune, one-third of the surveyed households are
likely to be living in poor housing conditions and to have only limited access to services (Annex 6
Table 53). Nineteen percent of these households have a river, brook, or pond within a radius of 200
meters of their house, which puts them at risk of flooding (or may have already suffered from
flooding). Also, 11 percent are located near derelict buildings or ruins, and 22 percent are located near
woodland that the household members have to cross in order to reach the commune center on roads
that are often impassable at certain times of the year. Fifty-eight percent of the households in these
difficult locations are in villages that contain marginalized areas.
In many of the households from which children entered the public care, housing conditions are still
inadequate, sometimes extremely so, which makes the children’s reintegration unlikely in the absence
of measures to counter this problem (Table 47). What is worrying is that other children still live in the
vast majority of households where the living conditions are unacceptable. Four percent of the
surveyed households live in improvised shelters, huts, or derelict homes, and two-thirds of these
households still include at least one child. Overcrowding is also a problem for a high percentage of
the surveyed households and is almost entirely associated with the presence of children in the
household. A quarter of children living in these households live in homes that are not even connected
to the electricity network, the vast majority do not even have a well within the household, and a
quarter of households (and a quarter of the children) lacked the means to heat the home over the
previous winter at least a few times a month.

      RECOMMENDATIONS
 Three recommendations can be made based on the territorial dispersion of the sampled households in the
 source communities.
 The most efficient way to prioritize interventions aimed at preventing child-family separation would be to
 target the marginalized areas that contain a large number of mothers with children in public care. These areas
 can be identified using the Atlas of Urban Marginalized Areas437 and the Atlas of Rural Marginalized Areas.438

 The second way to target prevention interventions might be to focus on those communities that contain high
 numbers of mothers or families of the children in public care. The mapping of these areas will require the
 constant updating of the information in the CMTIS.
 Regardless of how they are targeted, systematic interventions are needed in all of these source communities.
 In the medium term, there is a need for social workers to monitor at-risk cases within each commune as it is
 impossible to detect these cases using geographical targeting instruments.

 Solving the housing problem can contribute to the reintegration of children in care and to keeping other
 children within the family by eliminating the precarious housing conditions that caused the separation.
 However, it does not break the cycle of disadvantage, which continues in the source communities and which
 lead children to be taken into the protection system for other reasons.




Consumption in Households with Children
Housing problems are exacerbated by other difficulties within households that affect the children still
living there. Of all children living in households with at least one child in public care, 14 percent had
nothing to eat at least once a week in the previous six months, while a quarter of them had faced this
problem at least a few times a month (Annex 6 Table 54). Almost half of the children eat a maximum
of only two meals per day while 8 percent eat just one meal a day. In relation to their clothing, for only
one-third of the children their parents stated they had bought new clothes, while a third have only
clothes bought from second hand stores, and the other third have clothes they received from
neighbors and relatives. However, these data did not show how often clothes are actually acquired
these different ways and if they are sufficient to keep children clothed (Annex 6 Table 55). Half of the
surveyed households stated that their income was not enough to cover the minimum necessities, with
62 percent of children living in this type of households (Annex 6 Table 54).



Children’s Education
Participation in education is low, most frequently for children with mothers who still live in the
household. In relation to kindergarten attendance, for instance, only a little over half of the children
between 3 and 6 years old were enrolled in kindergarten or in nursery school (Table 48). Attendance
percentage is significantly higher (76 percent) for children who are not the biological offspring of
these mothers. This difference in percentages shows a deficiency of the protection system, which
should have provided these mothers with services to improve the living conditions of the household
in order to prevent the separation of the other children and to ensure the reintegration of the children
who had already been taken into care.

Only 70 percent of children over 6 years old are enrolled in school, with the percentage being slightly
lower for the children of mothers who have children in public care compared to the other children.
Moreover, of the children of mothers who have other children in public care, only half go to school
every day, and approximately 20 percent have repeated at least one school year, which leads to a
higher probability of dropping out of school later on and of low achievement in the educational
system in general. The situation of these children is bad even at the primary level – only 66 percent of
children between 6 and 10 years old go to school on a daily basis and more than 10 percent have
already repeated at least one school year.

For 41 percent of children who live with their mothers and manage to attend school, their mothers
stated that they never know how to help them with homework, and for another 38 percent, the
mothers said that they can only help some of the time. The percentage of children whose parents
cannot help them with homework is high even for the basic level of education – those for children
aged 6 to 10 years old (Table 49). Only for 17 percent of children aged between 7 and 14 who go to
school their parents said that they could help with homework most of the time or all the time. The
situation appears even worse for the whole sample of children of school age regardless of whether
they go to school or not. Only 21 percent of all children aged 6 to 10 go to school and have parents
who can help them with homework always or most of the time (the equivalent percentage for children
between 7 and 11 years old is only 12 percent).

Having parents who know how to help their children with homework is strongly linked with the child’s
learning outcomes. Of the children who go to school but have parents who never know how to help
them with homework, a quarter do not attend school every day and 22 percent have repeated at least
a year. The percentages are 3 percent and 12 percent respectively for those who have parents who
know how to help them always or most of the time (Annex 6 Table 56). For children with extremely
low school attendance and parents with little involvement in their academic life, the educational
system will need to make major efforts to genuinely include them in the educational system and to
make up for the deficit of knowledge and values that most of these children will already have
accumulated.



Disciplining Children
Based on statements of the mothers or carers, it was possible to explore the methods used to
discipline the children in the surveyed households. According to these statements, 5 percent of
children are most often disciplined with a slap or with a beating (Figure 100). Other frequently used
methods include threatening with punishment (14 percent of children) or yelling (11 percent).

Mothers and carers were also asked “how often do you use physical correction in order to raise and
educate children properly?” Only 68 percent of them said they had never used this method and 8
percent said they do this most of the time or always (Annex 6 Table 57). It is important to note that
physical punishment was used less frequently on the children who lived with mothers who had
children in public care than on the other children who lived in the households. This may indicate that
the effectiveness of counselling services for parents of children in the system was rather limited.
Moreover, these percentages are probably higher in practice for two reasons: (i) the survey question
only asked about which disciplinary methods were used most often but not about the most extreme
punishment ever used and (ii) the question measured only the stated practices.



Other Risky Situations in Households with Children in Public Care
In 17 percent of the sampled households, adults are behaving in ways that could negatively impact
the children’s development if they were to be reinserted into their families. These types of behavior,
which include excessive alcohol consumption, abuse and violence, criminal records, and problems with
the police, constitute individual risk factors for the separation of the child from the family (Table 50). It
is important to note that most of these problems happen in households with at least one child; for
example, in 63 percent of the households in which the child’s carers have stated there is excessive
alcohol consumption, there is at least one child in the household. Fifteen percent of children who live
in the surveyed households are affected by these problems. As with the questions referring to
disciplinary methods, these problems are likely to occur with a higher frequency in practice than was
stated in the survey.

3.4.3.2          Support Provided to the Original Households of Children
                 in Public Care in Rural Source Communities
In this section we will analyze to what extent the original households of children in public care receive
the necessary support to solve the problems they are facing so that the separated children can be
reintegrated into the family and the children who still live in the households are not themselves taken
into the system. The support should also ensure that all of these children can live at home in
conditions that will not limit their development potential for the rest of their life. The data from the
survey of rural source communities can help us to understand which families from the target group
receive social benefits that might help them to solve their problems even partially, and to what extent
they have had access to a social worker with whom to discuss the situations of all of their children.



Providing Financial Support to Households in Need
A quarter of the sampled households with very low incomes said they had not received any means-
tested benefits during the year of the survey. Of those individuals with income under 100 RON, only
67 percent mentioned that they had received the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI), the family
allowance, or a heating subsidy. One-third of those with incomes under this level said that they had
received another type of aid as well (Annex 6 Table 58). The share of beneficiaries declines as
household income increases. The percentage of those with low incomes who do not get any type of
aid is similar among households that still contain children and also for all households suffering from
severe material deprivation (inability to heat the home, lack of electricity in the household, living in
improvised shelters, or being unable to feed themselves properly), including those in which children
are still living (Table 51).

A significant share of households whose children were taken into public care for financial reasons do
not receive any of the means-tested social benefits. As noted in Figure 97, the (A) section, according
to respondents, precarious housing conditions were the cause of separation for 21 percent of the
sampled households while other reasons associated with material deprivation were the cause in
another 9 percent of the cases (5 percent consisting of households with monthly per capita incomes
of less than 400 lei and 4 percent consisting of families with four or more children). Although one
might have expected these households to have received financial support in order to enable the
children’s reintegration in the family and prevent new entries into public care, nearly a quarter of them
had received no aid in the previous year (Table 52). The share of those who do not get any aid is lower
for households with children than for the total number of households. The lack of support for these
groups was confirmed by the responses of the social workers (which, as we noted in Figure 97, do not
overlap perfectly with the responses of the children’s mothers/carers). According to their assessments,
even though a much larger number of separations occurred for reasons of material deprivation, more

than a quarter of the households that should have been financially supported to enable their child to
be reintegrated had not received any support.

      CONCLUSION

  Those households whose children were taken into care for preventable reasons such as poverty or poor
                     439
  housing conditions are not receiving sufficient support for the family to overcome these difficulties and
  enable them to bring their children back home. This perpetuates the risky situation even in households where
  other children continue to live and continues a cycle of disadvantage that can lead to more children entering
  the system and being separated from their families, with significantly increased costs and significantly worse
  results.
  Research is needed to identify the causes of social and school exclusion and to what extent these are
  influenced by the households’ precarious housing conditions. Helping families to access adequate housing as
  part of an integrated package of services could offer solutions for the various problems faced by children and
  families in source communities.

Interactions with SPAS Social Workers/Staff with Social Work Duties
In order to reintegrate children into their families, it is important to ensure not only financial support
where needed but also a regular interaction with a social worker. SPAS social workers should ensure
an ongoing monitoring of the sampled households to prevent the situation in which any children still
present in the household are taken into public care and to provide constant guidance and support to
the families to help them solve their problems and facilitate the reintegration of their separated
children.
However, despite the importance of interacting with a social worker, most households do not seem to
experience enough of these interactions (Table 53). For example, in households with at least one child
in the protection system and other children still in the household, only 15 percent of the children’s
carers said that they interact monthly with the social worker, while another 24 percent said that they
have only one interaction every two to three months. In households where the mothers of the
separated children are still present, these interactions are equally infrequent, only increasing slightly
when the mothers live with other children in the household.

Even if we narrow down the analysis to households with serious problems in which children are still
living, we still find a low frequency of interactions with the local social worker. Figure 101 shows that,
regardless of the problem in question, the percentage of households interacting with the social
worker on a monthly basis is no higher than 20 percent, and in about a quarter of the cases, the social
worker has never met with members of the vulnerable households. For instance, only 19 percent of
members of households with children present and with stated alcoholism problems said that they met
with a social worker every month. In the case of households with problems of abuse and violence, only
5 percent of households with children have interacted every month with a social worker. Even if some
of the problems faced by households are more difficult for a social worker to observe, thus leading to
the infrequent interactions, there are equally low percentages for households where the children are
not in school or are living in improvised shelters, barracks, or ruins. A low frequency of interactions is
also evident for households where mothers continue to live with other children.
Moreover, the low frequency of interactions with a social worker applies even when the cause of
separation indicates that the other children present in the household are highly vulnerable to harm,
such as neglect or excessive alcohol consumption (Annex 6 Tables 59 and 60).

In such households, the risk that another child will be taken into the protection system is higher than
in the general population. This is confirmed by the share of the survey respondents from these
households who stated that they had thought about the possibility of giving up the children still living
in the household to the public care system in the future (Table 54). Among the households with
children in the system where other children still live with their mothers, 5 percent stated that they had
thought about giving them up to public care. In the case of children who have already been separated
from their families at least once in their lifetime, the percentage rises to 21. The link between having
been in the protection system in the past and the likelihood that this could happen again is confirmed
by the fact that 10 percent of the mothers in the sample had been in public care themselves in the
past (the percentage is 12 percent if we include the siblings of mothers with children in public care).440

Why does the frequency of interactions with the social worker (or the person with social assistance
responsibilities in the SPAS) vary so much between households? To answer this question we examined
the relationship between the frequency of interaction and different types of factors: the social worker’s
profile, the location of the household within the village, the characteristics of the mother, and those of
the separated child.
Regarding the features of the SPAS social worker/person with social work responsibilities, what seems
to matter is not the person’s type of specialization, but whether this person has a higher education or
not. In the case of the respondents living in localities served by SPAS staff with social work
responsibilities who do not have higher education, 51 percent have reported interacting with them
once a year at most. However, the percentage increases to 41 in the case of respondents in localities
served by SPAS staff who had studied social assistance or sociology, 40 percent if they studied
economics or law, and 38 percent if they have other specialization (Annex 6 Table 61).
The location of the household within the commune or village, as well as the features of the
community to which it belongs, are also significant predictors of the frequency with which the
respondents interact with the SPAS social work staff (Annex 6 Table 62). For households in villages at
the periphery of the commune, their interaction with a social worker is monthly in only 9 percent of
cases, while for villages in the center of the commune, the equivalent percentage is 22. Similarly, the
position of the household within the village or outside it is key to predicting the frequency of
interactions with the social worker. For households located in the center of the village, the interaction
is monthly in 24 percent of cases, while for households located at the outskirts or outside of the
village, in only 11 percent of cases.
Mothers with separated children living in households with other children have a slightly higher
likelihood of interacting with the social worker every month than mothers with separated children but
with no other children in the household. Social workers seem to interact more rarely with households
where the mothers are no longer present, even if other children live in these households (in 54
percent of these cases, the frequency is once a year or less) (Annex 6 Table 63).
We used a logistic regression model to carry out a simultaneous analysis of the factors predicting
whether the SPAS social worker interacts at least once every two to three months with households
with children or households with mothers with separated minor children (Table 55). We found that all
of the predictors previously mentioned are significant. Households where mothers of separated
children live with other children are more likely to be visited than other households with children. Also,
if the social worker has a higher education, the frequency of interactions is higher, which is also the
case if the household is located in the center of the commune or village or between center and the
outskirts.

The role of these predictors becomes even clearer when the analysis is focused only on households
where the mothers still live, as it is possible that, when mothers were not present in the sampled
households, the social workers focused their interventions on other households where mothers were
present (including those in other localities). To remove this ambiguity, the analysis below covers only
households containing mothers with separated children.
Whether the person with social work responsibilities has a higher education or not seems to be
important in explaining the frequency of his or her interaction with the mothers (Annex 6 Table 64).
The share of mothers reporting having interacted at least two to three times a month with the person
with social work duties is over 40 percent if the person has a higher education but only 27 percent if
the person has no higher education. Moreover, the percentage of mothers who interacted frequently
with that person is only 14 percent when they do not have any other children living with them in the
household.
The location of households containing mothers with separated children in a marginalized community
and/or within or outside the village is a significant predictor of the frequency of interaction with the
social worker. If the household is located in a marginalized area, then mothers with separated children
are less likely to interact with a social worker at least once every two or three months (Annex 6 Table
64). The picture is more nuanced when we take into consideration the presence of other children in
the household as in this case being located in a marginalized community does not seem to matter. In
non-marginalized areas, 52 percent of mothers with children in the household have interacted with a
social worker, while in marginalized areas, only 26 percent. The location of a household in the center
of a village or commune is also a significant predictor. Forty-eight percent of mothers from
households located in the center of these localities interact with a social worker every two to three
months, versus only 30 percent of those located at the outskirts or outside the locality (similarly, for
mothers who no longer live with the children but live in households located in marginalized
communities, the percentage of visits is significantly lower.)
The quality of the house in which mothers live is also a significant predictor, but in the opposite sense
than is desirable. Only 32 percent of mothers living in houses with problems (roof leaks, damp walls,
rotten/damaged floors or windows) interact with a social worker once every two to three months,
while 49 percent of those who do not have such problems interact this frequently with a social worker
(Annex 6 Table 64).
The mother’s characteristics also count. Mothers who are less educated and older are less likely to
interact with the social worker (Annex 6 Table 64). Only 34 percent of mothers with no education and
35 percent of mothers with a primary education interact frequently with the social worker, whereas the
percentages are much higher for mothers with a secondary education or an education beyond
secondary school (51 percent and 48 percent respectively). We also noticed that these interactions are
more frequent for mothers aged under 25 than for other mothers.
The age of the child when last separated from the family and the length of time spent away from the
mother are also relevant in predicting the frequency of interactions with social workers (Annex 6 Table
64). If children were separated when they were over 2 years old, then the likelihood of the social
worker interacting with the mothers still living in the households is higher than average. Interestingly,
this relationship does not seem to apply when there are no longer any children in the household. If
the child has been separated from the mother for less than two years, then the likelihood of any
interaction with a social worker is higher (39 percent of the mothers who had been separated from
their children for more than two years interact frequently with the social worker, versus 48 percent of
the mothers for whom the separation occurred more recently).
Because some of these variables are inter-related (for example, the mother's education level is related
to the type of the community in which she lives or to her housing problems), it would be helpful to
understand the extent of the role played by each of them. The logistic regression model shown in
Table 55, which predicted the odds of having interactions with the social worker at least once every 2-
3 months in the case of mothers living in the households, allowed us to carry out this type of analysis.

A multivariate analysis confirmed the relationship between all the variables discussed above and the
likelihood of interacting with the social worker. For instance, in households where the mother lives
with her other children, the likelihood of interacting with the social worker is 2.7 times higher than for
mothers in households where there are no other children, with all other variables being equal.

More importantly, these variables interact with each other so that people with different characteristics
have completely different likelihoods of interacting with a social worker. The regression model
presented above (Table 55) made it possible for us to estimate the likelihood of interacting with a
social worker for people with various characteristics and in different contexts, as shown in Table 56. It
can be seen that, for a person under 25 (who therefore has a generally higher than average likelihood
of interacting with a social worker), the likelihood of interaction can be very different depending on
the person’s other characteristics as well as the characteristics of the community in which the person is
living and of the social worker serving that community.
For mothers who have favorable characteristics, the likelihood of interacting with a social worker is
close to 100 percent. In the case of mothers with children separated when they were over age 5, living
with other children of their own, having at least secondary education, not living on the outskirts of
villages, living in a house with no major problems, in a locality covered by people with social work
duties with a higher education, there is a 94 percent estimated likelihood of interacting with the social
worker. Similar percentages occur when social workers have a higher education and mothers have few
negative characteristics (for example, in terms of education, location in the community, and housing),
even if the children were separated at an early age or if mothers do not live with other children in the
household.
If the mother lives on the outskirts of the village/commune in a poor quality house, the likelihood of
her interacting with a social worker decreases dramatically. This decrease is even more significant
when the social worker does not have a higher education than when he or she does have a higher
education (especially in households where children are still present and where children were separated
at older ages). Therefore, if the social worker has a higher education and the mother lives with her
other children, the percentage decreases by 26 percentage points (from 94 percent to 68 percent)
when the characteristics of the mother are worse and by 40 percentage points (from 87 percent to 47
percent) when the characteristics of the mother are similar but the social worker does not have a
higher education. Most worrying is the fact that when the mother has a low level of education and she
is not living with any other children, the likelihood of frequent interaction decreases to a maximum of
44 percent, even when the social worker has a higher education and the children were separated at
older ages.

The role of the social worker without higher education varies greatly depending on the characteristics
of the household that he or she is supposed to support. For households where there are children
present, the living conditions are decent, and the mother has a secondary or higher education, the
likelihood of interacting with a social worker with no higher education is similar to when the social
worker has a higher education (the difference is only 10 percentage points). However, when the
mother lives in unfavourable conditions and has primary education at most, the difference is at least
20 percentage points. In these circumstances, a mother who does not live in the center of the village,
has no higher education, does not live with any of her children, lives in a house with problems, and
was separated from her children when they were younger than 2 years old has a likelihood of only 16
percent of interacting with a social worker every two to three months or more often.

 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 A first conclusion is that, in terms of the characteristics of the social worker, what seems to matter is whether
 he or she has a higher education or not. In other words, to improve the system’s performance and to
 adequately meet the needs of children and families in difficulty, it is crucial that every commune in Romania
 (particularly those with source communities and/or marginalized areas) has at least one person with social
 assistance responsibilities within the SPAS who has higher education. Ideally, this person would be a
 professional social worker.
 In addition, in line with the provisions of the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s
 Rights 2014-2020, we make the following recommendations: (i) ensuring that there is a functional Public Social
 Assistance Service (SPAS) in every administrative territorial unit; (ii) filling any vacant positions in the child
 protection system; (iii) ensuring that each SPAS includes specialized personnel; (iv) combining two or more
 rural localities under one SPAS in those cases where there are not enough resources to set up one SPAS in
 each; and (v) establishing a SPAS in each urban locality where none exists at the moment.
 In accordance with current legislation441 and in line with the recommendations of the National Strategy for the
 Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 and of the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and
 Poverty Reduction 2015-2020,442 we recommend that the Government of Romania introduces a minimum
 package of social services for children as part of an integrated package of interventions to be mandatorily
 implemented in every urban and rural community. This minimum package of interventions should involve the
 following steps: (i) carrying out field work to identify potential beneficiaries and early intervention services; (ii)
 assessing the needs of vulnerable or at-risk communities, households, and people and planning the delivery of
 services and interventions based on an approach centerd on the family and the individual; (iii) providing
 information and counselling services to vulnerable groups and people at social risk, people who have
 experienced domestic violence or neglect, drug consumers, former prisoners, single-parent families with low
 incomes, and young people at risk (such as young offenders, young people who have dropped out of school,
 and children from families with low incomes); (iv) providing administrative support to clients (for example, to
 help them fill in application forms for various types of benefits) and social, health and legal assistance; (v)
 providing referral to specialized services; (vi) monitoring and visiting all people in vulnerable situations within
 the community; and (viii) developing housing services that meet the needs of poor and vulnerable families.

 This minimum package of interventions should be complemented with other preventive services (such as
 social canteens, daycare centers, or services targeting vulnerable groups) depending on communities’ specific
 needs and resources. For the effective implementation of this minimum package, professionals (especially
 those from universities, service providers, and the National College of Social Workers in Romania) will need to
 develop family- and individual-centerd tools and methodologies for the adoption, assessment, planning,
 design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of these services. These tools and methodologies should
 be taught in a continuous training program for social work personnel at the local level.

 According to the analysis presented in this chapter, the greatest challenge will be to increase access to any and
 all of the community-based services for families with children, especially those at risk of separation from the
 child, who live on the outskirts of localities, in source communities, and/or in marginalized areas (rural and
 urban) in homes of poor quality and where the adults have low levels of education. Currently, the children in
 these families not only live in need and difficulty but also have fewer opportunities than other children to
 benefit from any support or help at the community level.

3.4.3.3           Chances of Reintegration of Separated Children from
                  Rural Source Communities
This section estimates the chances that children from rural source communities who are separated
from their parents will be reintegrated into their families, from the perspective of their family. For that
purpose, we will analyze the frequency with which parents and other carers interact with their children
in care, their desire to reintegrate the children into their households, and what they think the chances
are of this happening in the near future.
More than half of the separated children who come from the rural source communities have not
interacted with their parents or other carers since they entered public care. The parents or former
carers of 55 percent of all separated children from rural source communities stated that they had not
seen or talked to them at al since the separation (Table 58). Although it might be expected that the
interactions with the separated children would be more frequent when their mothers were still living
in the household, the difference is only 4 percent (54 percent for households where the mother is still
living versus 58 percent for households where the mother is absent).

The lower the age of the children at separation, the less likely they are to interact with their parents or
carers after entering the system. In the sample of separated children from the rural source
communities, 46 percent were less than 1 year old at the time of their last separation, and another 17
percent were between 1 and 2 years old (Annex 6 Table 65). The age at which the child was last
separated from the family is a relevant indicator for the probability of interacting at least once with
the parent or carer after the last separation. The carers or parents never interacted with the children
again in the case of 59 percent of the children separated when they were under 1 year old versus 36
percent of the children older than 10 at the time of the separation (Table 59).
There is a significant difference between the children whose mothers are still living in the surveyed
households and those where only the carers were present. In the case of children who were under 1
year old at the time of the last separation, it makes no difference whether the mother was present or
absent in the children’s households of origin. In both situations, around 60 percent of the children
have not seen or talked to their former carers or parents since entering public care. However, the
difference becomes visible as the age of the children increases. Among children aged 10 or older
when they entered the system whose mothers still live in the household, 24 percent have had no
contact with anyone from the household of origin, whereas in the case of children whose mothers no
longer live in the household, 50 percent have had no such contact (Annex 6 Table 66).

When the analysis focuses only on the previous year, the percentage of children who have not
interacted with their parents or former carers increases even more since some of the children have
been in the system for a long time and any interactions they might have had with their families shortly
after the separation will likely have diminished in time. This can shed light not only on the child’s
interaction with the family but also on the chances of the child being reintegrated into the family in
the near future. Table 60 below indicates the frequency of interaction during the period of one year
and shows that 68 percent of the children from the rural source communities did not interact with
their parents or carers even once in the previous year and only 18 percent interacted with them at
least once a month. The percentages are similar when the analysis focused only on the children whose
mothers still live in the sampled households (Annex 6 Table 67).

In order to understand which children are least likely to be reintegrated into their families we have to
analyze the factors that might forecast the frequency of interactions between the separated children
and their parents or former carers.
 Separated children who entered public care directly from maternity wards have had much less
  interaction with their families than those who were taken from their grandparents or other
  relatives or families. Most children from the rural source communities were sent into public care
  from maternity wards at their last separation (71 percent) (Annex 6 Table 68). Only 9 percent of
  these children interact with their parents/former carers a few times a month, versus 22 percent of
  those who were separated after living with their grandparents or other families (Annex 6 Table 69).
  The difference between these two groups of separated children (who entered public care from the
  maternity ward vs. after living with grandparents or other relatives or families) by type of
  protection measure established for the child is even higher in the situations where the mother still
  lives in the surveyed household.
 Up to a point, the income of the households is not a significant predictor of the frequency of
  interactions with separated children. The survey data show that the percentage of separated
  children who do not interact with their parents is approximately the same regardless of their


                                                                                                               345
      income level – between 62 percent and 70 percent of the separated children do not interact at all
      with their mothers or former carers (Annex 6 Table 70). The only difference is that weekly
      interactions are much more frequent than average in the case of children whose families have
      relatively high incomes of more than 540 RON per capita. These percentages do not differ when
      we analyze just the children whose mothers are still present in the households.
 The characteristics of the mothers, such as the type of the community where they live in, their past
  experiences with the special protection system, their level of education, and the type of
  relationship they have with a current partner all predict how likely they are to interact with their
  separated children from the moment of separation (Annex 6 Table 71). Separated children whose
  mothers do not live in marginalized communities have a significantly higher probability of
  interacting with their mothers. While 22 percent of such children interact with their mothers on a
  weekly basis or several times a month, only 7 percent do so when the households of origin are in
  marginalized communities. If the mothers themselves were in public care in the past, then the
  probability that they will interact with their separated children is higher. The lower the mothers’
  level of education, the lower the probability that they will interact with their separated children.
  Seventy percent of the separated children whose mothers had only up to four years of schooling
  had not seen their mothers at all during the previous year, versus less than 57 percent of the
  separated children whose mothers’ level of education was higher. The type of relationship that the
  mother has with a current partner and had at the time of the separation is also associated with the
  frequency of interaction. Mothers who are currently in a stable relationship and those who at the
  time of the separation were not together with a man other than the child’s father are more likely
  to interact with their separated children.
 The age at which the child was separated is a strong predictor of the frequency with which their
  mothers interacted with them over the previous year. For the children who were separated under
  the age of 2, the probability of not having interacted with their mothers at all during the previous
  year is 72 percent, while for those who were aged 6 or older when they were separated, this
  probability decreases by half (only 37 percent) - see Table 61. Meanwhile, the percentage of
  children interacting weekly or several times a month increases from 8 percent to 37 percent.

 How much time has elapsed since the child’s last separation from the family is also associated
  with the frequency with which children were contacted by their mothers during the previous year.
  Fifty-one percent of the children whose separation had occurred less than two years before had
  not been contacted by mothers, versus 67 percent when the separation occurred more than six
  years earlier (Annex 6 Table 72). An important factor seems to be the dynamics between the age
  of the child at the time of the last separation and the time that has elapsed since then. Both for
  children separated when they were under 1 year old and for those separated at the age of 6 or
  older, the time since the separation does not seem to influence the frequency of interaction with
  their mothers. For the first category, the probability of the children not having interacted with
  their mothers in the previous year is high regardless of how long they had spent in the system
  (about 70 percent), while for the second category, the rate is half (35 percent). However, for

346
    children aged between 2 and 5 when they were separated from their families, the time since the
    last separation particularly significant. While only 18 percent of these children relinquished for less
    than two years had not interacted at all with their parents or other former carers in the previous
    year, 67 percent of those who had already spent six years in the system had not interacted with
    their families.

 The interaction of those in the household with someone competent to support the reintegration
  of the separated children is also a significant predictor of the frequency of interactions between
  separated children and their parents or other former carers. In the case of 34 percent of separated
  children, the mothers who were still present in the households said that they had not interacted
  with anyone to discuss their children’s situation, while in 43 percent of cases the mothers stated
  that they had interacted with someone from the DGASPC, and in 51 percent of cases, the mothers
  had interacted with a social worker from the municipality (Annex 6 Table 73). Among the
  separated children whose mothers had spoken with somebody from the DGASPC or a social
  worker, only about 40 percent of them had not interacted at all with their parents or caregivers in
  the previous year, while this percentage is almost doubled when no one in the household had
  talked to anyone about their separated children (Annex 6 Table 74). Even if this association seems
  to indicate the effectiveness of the actions taken by social workers and other representatives of
  the DGASPCs, the causal relationship is not clear. It is possible that these representatives have
  interacted more often with those who were already more likely to contact their separated children.
To test the role played by each of the above characteristics, we used four logistic regression models
predicting whether or not separated children had interacted at all with their mothers or other
caregivers in the year previous to the survey. The base model was the one in which the only predictor
used was the child’s age at the time of the last separation, and we found that children separated when
they were under 2 years old when separated were 4.3 times more likely not to have interacted with
their parents or carers in the previous year than those separated at the age of 6 or over (Annex 6
Table 75).
In the second model, we tested other predictors at the time of the survey and found that the location
of the mother's household and the mother’s type of current relationship were both statistically
significant. The third model added another significant predictor, the type of relationship with a partner
that the mother had at the time of the separation. The fourth model added the variable related to
interactions with a social worker from the municipality or with someone from the DGASPC, which was
proved to be statistically significant even when controlling for all other predictors.
Using the second regression model (which uses only the current characteristics of the household), we
found that the predicted likelihood of contact between children and parents was very different
depending on the characteristics of the children and their mothers. For instance, if a child was under
the age of 2 when he or she was separated and has a mother living in a marginalized community, with
four grades of education at most and not in a stable relationship with a partner, the probability of the
child not interacting with his or her family in the previous year is over 80 percent (Table 63). On the
other hand, if the child was separated at a young age but the household is not located in a
marginalized community and the mother has more than four grades of education and a stable
relationship, the predicted percentage of no interaction decreases to 54. Even with this low number of


                                                                                                          347
variables, we can notice a profile of those children who are less likely to get in touch with their family -
children who were separated at older ages and come from households not located in marginalized
communities, with mothers with more than four grades of education and in a stable relationship have
an estimated probability of only 27 percent of not having interacted with their families at all in the
previous year.

Beyond the frequency of interaction between separated children and their families, it is important to
see to what extent mothers or other former carers want to take the children back. In the case of 64
percent of separated children from the source communities, parents or other carers said they did not
want to take the children back, while for another 21 percent, the carers said they would like to have
them back but could not do so at present (Table 64).
As might be expected, if the mother is still present in the household, the percentage of separated
children whose mothers or carers refuse to take them back is slightly lower, but the difference is not
great (8 percentage points).

The variables that predicted the frequency of mothers’ and carers’ interactions with the child also
predict their desire to take the child back home, but the most important predictor is the frequency
with which mothers contact their separated children. Most of the previously identified predictors also
apply to the desire to get the child back, for example the age at which the children were separated,
the number of years since the last separation, the household income level, whether the mother is in a
stable relationship or not, whether the mother was in a relationship with a man other than the child’s
father at the time of the separation, and whether the mothers had discussed their separated children’s
situation with a representative of the local or county authorities (Annex 6 Table 76). However, the
most important predictor (which cancels out the influence of all of these other characteristics) is the
frequency of interaction between the separated child and the family in the last year. For 40 percent of
children whose mothers interact with them at least a few times a month, the mothers say they would



348
take back the child any time. However, only for 7 percent of the children who have not been contacted
at all by their carers in the last year, their parents stated they would take them back any time.

Fewer than 10 percent of the mothers present in the sampled households believed that they had a
good or very good chance of taking their children back home. Their desire to reintegrate the
separated children does not overlap perfectly with their intention to do so. Even though, for almost 40
percent of the separated children, mothers stated that they would like to take them home (either now
or later), the mothers of only 8 percent of the separated children estimated the chance of this
happening as good or very good, while for another 7 percent, they estimated the chance as average.

Note: Based on answers to the question “In conclusion, how great do you think are your chances of being able to
take the child back?”

When analysing to what degree the chances estimated by the mothers, on the one hand, and their
desire to get the children back in the next period, on the other, overlap/match we obtain an even
worse picture of the reintegration of separated children.
The mothers of 7 percent of the separated children said that, although they would like to take their
children home any time, they thought the chances of this happening in the future were small or very
small (Table 66). Similarly, the mothers of 18 percent of the separated children said they would like to
take their children back at a later date, but they thought that the probability of that happening was
low or very low. The reasons that were most frequently mentioned by the mothers for their low
expectations of reintegration were related to their lack of good housing conditions (62 percent), their
low incomes (49 percent), and the large number of children already living in the household (29
percent) – see Annex 6 Table 77. A significant number of mothers also mentioned the reason that their
separated child would not want to return - a quarter of the cases where the mothers wanted to take
their children back immediately but believed that the chances of that happening were small or very
small.


                                                                                                             349
Only for 7 percent of the separated children, their mothers who were still living in the household said
that they believed there was a good or very good chance of the child being reintegrated and that they
would take them back any time. However, even within this small group who potentially has the best
chance of reintegration, in two-thirds of cases, the mothers could not estimate when they would be
able to take the children home, and in another 7 percent of cases, the mothers said it could take more
than three years until reintegration (Annex 6 Table 78). Only the mothers of 16 percent of these
children (representing less than 1 percent of the whole sample) estimated that they would be able to
take their children home in less than a year.

For another 6 percent of the children (18 cases in the sample), the mothers estimated average, big,
and very big chances of reintegration, but also they said they were unable to take the children home
right at that point. For 14 out of the 18 cases, the mothers could not estimate when they would be
able to take their children back, and only in one case of the 18 did the mother say that she would take
her child home in less than one year.


  CONCLUSIONS

 The findings of this chapter reinforce and complete those of sections 3.3.4 and 3.4.1: children who were
 separated when they were under age 2 are over four times more likely to have had no interactions with their
 parents or carers in the last year than children separated at the age of 6 or over. Beyond the frequency of
 interaction between the separated children and their families, it is important to establish the extent to which
 the mothers or other former carers want to take the children back.
 Although the intention is to reintegrate separated children with their parents, their families’ assessment of the
 likelihood of the reintegration reveals a less optimistic picture. More than half of the separated children had no
 contact with their parents or other former carers after the separation, and the percentage is closer to 70 when
 the analysis focused solely on the previous year (the percentage is high even if the sample includes children
 who have been separated for less than a year).

 The frequency of children’s interactions with their families decreases significantly when the following factors
 are involved: (i) the child was very young at the time of the separation; (ii) the child has been separated for a
 long time; (iii) the mother is not in a stable relationship; (iv) the mother’s low education level; and (v) the
 location of the child’s household of origin in a marginalized community. The more of these factors that apply
 to a given separated child, the lower the chance of that child being reintegrated into the family of origin.

 In the absence of any intervention to change the household circumstances leading to the separation, for 64
 percent of the separated children parents or other carers stated they would no longer take them back home.
 Moreover, for only 8 percent of children do their mothers consider the likelihood of reintegration as being
 high or very high (for another 5 percent, the mothers estimate the chances as average). For the vast majority
 of the children who theoretically stand a good chance of being reintegrated, their mothers either could not
 predict when they would be reintegrated or said that reintegration would not happen for another three years
 or more. For fewer than 1 out of every 100 children from source communities, their mothers estimated that the
 reintegration would occur the following year.

There still are parents who would take back their children even if no
intervention were carried out. These parents should be given all
necessary support with the utmost urgency in order to reintegrate these
children back into their families. Moreover, among the other group of
parents, it is very likely that at least some would take home their children
provided that they were provided with effective support. Consequently,
we underline the urgent need for interventions that would alter the
household circumstances leading to the separation, not only to increase
the chances of reintegrating separated children but also to prevent
separation in the first place by improving the living conditions for all
children in the family.

The goal of this study has been to analyze the current status of the Romanian child protection system
in order to identify priority actions that would improve the quality and increase the effectiveness and
efficiency of public care (special protection) services. These actions would help put into effect the
National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 and the National
Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020 regarding: (i) the transition of the system
from institutional care to community-based services, and (ii) the identification of sustainable solutions
for children separated from their parents. The analysis focused on the children who are temporarily or
permanently separated from their parents and in public care or children who are at risk of being
separated from their family. The study has generated evidence towards creating a good/effective child
protection system.444
This report is based on various quantitative and qualitative data: a study of source communities in
rural areas, case studies of source communities in urban areas, an analysis of the case files of children
in public care, including adoption forms, a survey of case managers, and focus groups with
professionals and children in public care.445
The public child care system (special protection system) in Romania has to cope with multiple and
complex challenges given that it is one of the largest systems in the region and has to provide
adequate care solutions for approximately 60,000 children. However, in terms of the number of
children in public care as a share of the total child population, Romania holds an average position in
the region (with 1,600 to 1,700 children in the state’s care per 100,000 children aged 0 to 17 years
versus an average of 1,850 per 100,000 both in the CEE/CIS region and among the countries in Eastern
Europe and Central Asia).
The study has revealed the many efforts being made to improve Romania’s child protection system
both at the legislative level and in terms of working practices. Nevertheless, many challenges must still
be addressed in order to ensure that the system is truly focused on supporting the rights of children
and their families. As the conclusions in this section emphasize, the current system faces several
internal issues, many of which require both a short-term and a medium-term solution. Yet many
solutions for improvement are to be found outside the child protection system and in its coordination
with other systems such as the social assistance system, the social benefits system, the education
system, the health system, and the labor market. Therefore, the recommendations in this section are
intended not only for professionals within the child protection system at all levels (national, county
and local) but also for those in other social sectors. Only by taking a systematic and coordinated
approach to the conditionalities that exist outside the system will it be possible to substantially
improve the special protection system outcomes for children and their families.

The conclusions and recommendations below are structured according to several themes, which
largely represent the key guiding principles of an effective child protection system. 446 The
implementation of some of these recommendations will require substantial resources, while others will
require fewer resources but more time. Irrespective of the extent and type of the resources required,
there are a series of problems that need urgent resolution or implementation.

Theme 1: Coordinating all interventions at the local level including health, education, social
work, and social benefits to ensure prevention, early identification, and intervention
Social benefits and services and the health and education systems in Romania are currently unable to
prevent the separation of children from their families. The study has revealed that, of all children in
public care with or without a social assessment report in their case file, only 29 percent received any
prevention service. Prevention activities are poorly funded in the social, education, health, and social
work sectors, which tend to be reactive and to focus on effects rather than causes. In order to change
this working philosophy, government policy needs to focus on early identification and intervention by
coordinating all current services at the community level, including developing and introducing a
minimum package of services for children and families. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
In the longer term, it will be necessary to develop integrated services at the community level, which
are much more effective with respect to prevention. At the same time, it will be crucial to find a
sustainable mechanism to finance these interventions from the budgets of the many relevant
ministries and to ensure that these expenditures are fully reflected in the state budget multiannual
programming. For the government to adopt such a policy would be an endorsement of the principle
that “the family is usually the best place for bringing up children and young people.” Only this change
of approach has the potential to substantially reduce new entries into the child protection system.
Preventing children from going into protective care should be deemed a priority and should be
properly funded. The Romanian child protection system is currently unable to prevent child-family
separations and sometimes it wrongfully separates children from their families. However, this is no
surprise in light of the circumstances highlighted in this study.
The study has revealed that the Romanian child protection system allows certain children to enter
public care even though the separation could be avoided, they could grow up within their families if
early and coordinated interventions were available. The child protection system cannot and should not
have to solve the inefficiencies of the social benefits system, fill the gaps in the education and health
care systems, substitute for the poor development of services for people with disabilities or vulnerable
groups, or operate in the absence of policies and investments in social housing. However, at the
present time, the child special protection system seems to be called upon to mitigate all of the
negative effects that these deficiencies in other systems have on children. Thus, one could say that the
public care system is forced to be mainly reactive and focused on solving “emergencies.”
In Romania, the following situations have occurred. Five siblings entered public care because their
parents could not pay their electricity bill and the local authorities/community failed to step in to help.
Three siblings entered the system because their mother was beaten every day by her partner, and her
neighbors, the police, and other locals did not intervene, so she had to run away but had nowhere to
go with her three kids. A baby only a few days old ended up in the system because his mom was
evicted from a squalid social housing room because she failed to pay the rent for the previous three
months. Other babies have ended up in the system because their mothers were accepted into
maternity wards without IDs and they ran away after giving birth. Other babies are admitted to
hospital because their parents say they cannot afford to keep them and then leave. There are children
who enter the system because they need ”a place where they can die in peace, without being kicked
out,”447 while others end up in public care because they cannot attend a school in their community.
There are children who enter the system because their families cannot afford to feed them and
because the municipality, instead of supporting them, calls the DGASPC. Meanwhile, in source

communities and marginalized areas, nobody intervenes because “they are all poor, all of them have
nothing to eat, all of them are jobless and all of them lack electricity”,448 and “the end result would
only be taking the children into public care.”449 This is the current state of the Romanian public child
care system, called upon to find emergency solutions for children who have been let down by the
inadequacy of other systems.
A first step towards ensuring that Romania has a good child protection system450 must be to change
its emphasis from ”emergency response” to ”preventing child-parent separation.” In the context of
such extensive need and given the limited and deficient supply of services currently on offer in
communities, the only realistic and economically reasonable option is to focus on reducing the
number of entries into the system. At the same time, the deinstitutionalization process should be
continued, starting with the traditional institutions (those that have not been modernized), and
suitable family care alternatives should be found as permanent solutions for those children who are in
or will enter the system.
The only way to shift the system focus onto preventing child-family separations is by increasing the
provision of preventive services, in particular those at the community level. Because these services are
located within the community, they can act as a filter to reduce the number of children entering the
system as well as provide the support needed for the reintegration of children with their families, thus
increasing the number of exits from the system. Unless something changes with regard to community
services, the protection system will be unable to enhance its performance or to provide better
solutions to the problems faced by children and their families.
The change model proposed in this study does not advocate for the need to develop every kind of
service in every remote hamlet in the country. It would be useful to conduct a national assessment of
the existing services and to prioritize the needed services so that the available resources can be
invested in the most efficient way to have the greatest positive impact on the children and as
balanced a geographical distribution as possible.
To enable the system to respond more adequately to the needs of vulnerable children and families, it
is essential that every commune in Romania (especially those in source communities and/or
marginalized areas) has at least one SPAS person with social work responsibilities and higher
education. Ensuring specialized staff within every SPAS is the desired model envisaged in the National
Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020. In addition, what is needed is
for social services at the community level to be integrated, and the World Bank has developed such a
tailored operational model in the implementation plan for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion
and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020, “Develop integrated social services at the community level”.
Mobilizing financial support from the EU could contribute to sustaining this paradigm shift and to
initiating a review of some of the policies designed to prevent child-family separations at community
level. Also, developing a plan for monitoring and evaluating the transition from institutional care to
community care is vital.
The ANPDCA has already made certain steps in this direction, through a project funded under the
Administrative Capacity Development Operational Program. Throughout the project implementation,
the ANPDCA is collaborating with the relevant officers from the MMFPSPV, the ANPD, the Ministry of
National Education and Scientific Research, the Ministry of Health, relevant associations (such as the
Romanian Association of Communes, the Romanian Association of Towns, the Romanian Association
of Municipalities, and the National Federation of Local Action Groups), as well as institutions at the
county level that ensure methodological coordination for the services provided at the local level,451
and NGOs with experience in the field of child protection. The latter have already developed or piloted
projects with high potential for good practices that could be rolled out nationwide. To maximize the

chances of a well-coordinated plan being implemented successfully in the medium and long term, it
must be developed based on a partnership of all relevant stakeholders.
If local authorities are not mobilized, kept informed and involved throughout the process, there is a
high risk that the resulting plan will be implemented in a random and distorted manner, since
according to the child protection specialists consulted for this study: “Preventing child-family
separation is not on the political agenda, nor is it on the agenda of communes.” “There is no local
community initiative.” “Preventing child relinquishment is not important to them. It is not important,
they are not going to spend resources on it, it’s the problem of every family.” ”It is very clear, you will
never find priorities related to these children in need on a mayor’s agenda. They have political
priorities of a different kind: roads, schools, things that generate money.” (Focus group with
professionals, Cluj-Napoca)
With regard to the health system, an adequate response needs to be developed to the problem of
children being relinquished in health units. More than half of the children placed in public care have
entered the system at early ages, especially before reaching the age of 1 year. Specifically, the efforts
related to the relinquishment of children in medical units need to be strengthened by: (i) monitoring
all pregnancies in accordance with clear protocols for active/early identification of mothers at high risk
of relinquishing their babies and for prompt referral to social services; (ii) ensuring that social workers
are employed in all medical units (especially maternity and pediatric wards); (iii) ensuring sustained
enforcement of Government Decision 1103/2014 for approving the methodology for implementing
the responsibilities assigned to the local public authorities, institutions and professionals involved in
preventing and responding in cases of children at risk of relinquishment or relinquished in medical
units; (iv) introducing sexual education and family planning programs targeting risk groups such as
single-mothers and teen parents, particularly in source communities; and (v) strengthening adequate
child protection response services for children aged between 0 and 3 in all counties of the country,
especially for children with disabilities and/or with very low birth weight. In all of these actions, the
role played by community health nurses is essential. In the absence of enough community health
nurses and Roma health mediators, particularly in marginalized areas, source communities, and in the
6 percent localities lacking family physicians, it will not be possible to break the vicious circle that
leads to children being relinquished.
As far as the social assistance system is concerned, first it will be necessary to revise the local level
allocation of benefits and human resources intended for the early identification of at-risk children and
their families. The study has shown that, prior to their entering the system, over 60 percent of all
children in public care452 lived in families who were not receiving any social benefits. This result
contradicts the opinion held by many of the system’s specialists who cite dependence on state aid on
the part of families with children in the protection system as the main reason for all these families’
problems, including the separation from their children. Therefore, the national policies for fighting
poverty as well as the system of social assistance benefits need urgent revision in order to better serve
very poor children and their families and to respond more efficiently to the challenges that they face.
To increase access to social benefits for vulnerable groups, it will be necessary to speed up the
consolidation of means-tested social benefits programs into one single program - the Minimum Social
Insertion Income (MSII) program. This will reduce the time that social workers have to spend on
paperwork, freeing them up to provide the necessary services for families at risk of separation. At the
same time, the MSII will reduce the high exclusion rate of poor families for means-tested social
benefits.
Every child, mother, and family should receive administrative aid at the local level to obtain all
necessary documents, starting with the ID papers. Also, to reduce extreme poverty and the number of
homeless people, social housing should be provided as part of an integrated package of social
services for children at risk of separation and their families. By ensuring access to basic resources such
as water, shelter, heating, electricity, the housing services that are part of an integrated basic package
of services would address issues that affect family and child health and education.

As far as the education system is concerned, it will be necessary to extend the integrated special
education system for children with special educational needs (SEN). Measures enabling one to
continue education or reducing the risk of school dropout, especially for children in rural areas, are
essential. Measures that aim to increase the educational inclusion of children with disabilities and/or
SEN should include: (i) promoting the right of children with disabilities and/or SEN integrated in
mainstream education to a customized training program, support teachers, and other support
services; (ii) developing new resources and teaching materials for pupils with SEN (based on a tailored
curriculum) and facilitating their access to these resources; and (iii) developing national training
programs for teachers in inclusive education, in particular for those currently working in classrooms
that include at least two-three children with disabilities and/or SEN. At least 7 percent of the children
in public care who had a social assessment report in their case files had special educational needs that
had resulted in their institutionalization in the absence of any appropriate educational services at the
community level. Problems related to education start early, with only 49 percent of the children who
entered the system when they were between 4 and 6 years of age having attended pre-school
compared to 86 percent of the general population of children aged 4 to 6. In this case, early
intervention for families at risk of separation could consist of providing their children with access to
early education, for example, by subsidizing kindergarten or nursery tuition fees for families with low
incomes.
Moreover, according to the recommendations set out in the National Strategy for the Protection and
Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020, an integrated system of early screening and comprehensive
evaluation for children with disabilities should be developed to include: (i) full screening programs for
an early identification of disability; and (ii) a simple and low-cost way for the disabled child’s family to
obtain certification for a disability, the school/vocational guidance certificate, and a service plan.
At the same time, the study conducted in the source communities revealed that it is possible to
identify communities with a higher risk of children being separated from their families and that
preventive measures for these communities should be prioritized. In the absence of integrated
preventive interventions in these source communities the system’s response is limited to reacting to
emergencies, most often when children are relinquished in maternity wards or health units. Adequate
budgetary allocations will be required that will allow for flexible and customized service plans/
interventions to meet the specific needs identified in each community.

Theme 2: Supporting families and children involves working directly with them
Contrary to the general opinion that “the large majority of children placed in institutions are not
orphans but have one or even both parents.”453 This is the case for the child protection system in
Romania as well for all children in public care, whether in institutions or in family placements. Child
protection specialists need to work directly with children’s parents and families before the children
enter the system, as a primary preventive measure, while they are in the system, to achieve the PIP
goals, and after they exit the system, to monitor PIP goal achievement outcome. The study
recommendations refer primarily to DGASPC and SPAS professionals but also to specialists in other
social sectors who work directly with the child and family such as family physicians, community health
nurses, and teaching staff.
With regard to families, the study has found that it is essential to work directly with the mothers since
over 90 percent of the children in public care have mothers who are alive and known. Nevertheless,
even in the case of these mothers, there is an issue of unsystematic and incomplete information about
their situation. Information from CMTIS or the children’s case files on the mothers’ civil status, health,
education, and occupational status is scarce and outdated. The available data indicate that
reintegrating children with their families requires substantial efforts and the provision of consistent
support to these mothers by both child protection professionals and other institutions in order to
ensure a family environment that can offer the child real chances at developing properly. Otherwise,
reintegration will only mean sending the child into a highly unstable and unsuitable environment.


453
      Eurochild and HHC (2014:3)

358
Moreover, over 18,800 children (37 percent) in public care come from single-mother families, so, for
them, reintegration will be just another word unless their mothers are provided with actual support.
Reintegration should be carried out based on a medium-term plan, which should be prepared with
the input of both the mother and the child.
Over 4,300 children (8 percent) of the children in the protection system have no nuclear or extended
family to return to. These are boys and girls of all ages, of all ethnic groups, with or without disabilities.
For these children, the goal stated in their individualized protection plan should be reviewed to ensure
that, from the moment they leave the system, they have the same chances in life as children with a
family.
Given the dominant profile of parents with children in public care, it is obvious that they will need
parental education and intensive support to be able to fulfill their parental obligations in a responsible
manner. Most specialists emphasize the lack of adequate parenting skills among parents of children in
care, generally as a result of their low education levels and often due to their own past history of
childhood abuse and neglect.454 The study has also revealed that many cases of avoidable entries into
the system are not only the result of poverty and precarious housing but also of a lack of sufficient
support to enable families to overcome their difficult circumstances and keep/take their children
home.
To increase the effectiveness of the special protection system, in addition to providing parental
education services, it will also be necessary to tackle the individual risk factors associated with parental
behavior, which would significantly influence the number of new entries into the system as well as the
“quality” of the exits from the system via family reintegration. Thus, it is recommended to improve
reproductive health medical services and mother and child health and nutrition services, and to
increase the access of vulnerable categories to these services, as well as to strengthen services for
households/families dealing with parental excessive alcohol and/or drug consumption, promiscuous
and/or criminal behavior, disabilities and/or mental health problems, and domestic violence.
Furthermore, the study has found that the current situation in terms of household-social worker
interaction does not offer reasons for optimism. For instance, in households with children out of which
at least one child was in public care at some point, only 15 percent of the people taking care of the
children stated that they had interacted with the SPAS social worker on a monthly basis while another
24 percent stated that they had such interactions only once every two to three months. In households
where the mothers of separated children are still present, these interactions are equally rare, with
shares being slightly higher when mothers live in households with other children. Irrespective of the
type of household involved, no more than 20 percent interacted with social workers every month, and
in approximately a quarter of all cases, social workers never met with any members of the vulnerable
households.
The other factors that influenced the frequency with which respondents interacted with the SPAS staff
with social assistance duties were the education level of the social worker, the characteristics of the
communities, the number of children in the household, and the location of the household within the
village. If the mother lives in a poor quality dwelling on the outskirts of a village or commune, the
likelihood of her having any interaction with the social worker drops dramatically. Yet, there is an even
greater drop when the social worker lacks higher education (especially when it comes to households
with children present or with children who were separated at older ages).455
The recommendations associated with this theme need to be viewed together with those related to
Theme 7: Improving and systematizing working practices, particularly regarding the inter-institutional
collaboration between the DGASPCs, the SPAS, and the Community Consultative Structures (SCC). The
study has revealed that no family member could be found at the address recorded in the CMTIS for

454
   This deficit of parenting skills is even more noticeable in the case of children with special needs, such as infants in
their first months of life, children with disabilities (especially with severe ones), and teenagers with behavioral problems.
455
    It is of concern that, when a mother has a low level of education and does not live with any other child, the
probability of having frequent interactions with a social worker decreases to no more than 44 percent, even when the
social worker has higher education and children were separated at older ages.

                                                                                                                        359
almost 40 percent of the mothers of children in public care from rural source communities. Given the
geographical dispersion of the families of children in public care and the intensive effort that their
coverage entails, if only in terms of keeping accurate records of them, it is obvious that this effort
cannot be made by case managers alone. Their responsibilities need to be shared with the social
workers who are the closest to these families and who are in the best position to monitor their
situation.
In line with provisions of the National Strategy for the Protection and Promotion of Children’s Rights
2014-2010 and the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-2020, we
recommend the introduction of a minimum package of interventions to be implemented compulsorily
in each rural and urban community.456 This minimum package should include the following child- and
family-relevant interventions: (i) outreach activities, key to identifying potential beneficiaries and
carrying out early intervention services; (ii) an assessment of the needs of vulnerable or at-risk
communities, households, and individuals and the planning of the necessary services that are focused
on the family and the individual; (iii) information and counselling services targeted to vulnerable
groups, those exposed to social risks, people who have experienced domestic violence or neglect,
drug consumers, former convicts, single-parent families with low incomes, and young people in risky
situations (such as young delinquents, school dropouts, and children from families with low incomes);
(iv) administrative support (such as helping clients to fill in the application forms for benefits of any
type) as well as social, health, and legal assistance; (v) referral to specialized services; and (vi)
monitoring of and home visits to all people in vulnerable situations within each community.

Theme 3: Youths and children have rights, including the right to participate in decisions that
affect them
Children’s voices are still insufficiently taken into account in the activities or decisions concerning
them. For two-thirds of children in care aged 10 and older, there is no mention or statement in the
case file about their opinions of the quality of the services they received and their level of satisfaction.
In other words, two out of three children in the child protection system are not consulted about their
opinions and preferences. The one third who were consulted generally expressed positive opinions.
Out of all of the needs that children have, the most important is the need to have their voice heard, to
have somebody they can talk to, a person to whom they can tell anything and whom they can trust.
Intense communication with the child should be one of the key tasks carried out by the staff working
with children in public care. They should spend time with children on a daily basis, when they should
listen to their stories, dissatisfactions, joys, opinions, needs, and desires. Children should also be
consulted and actively involved in planning daily activities, in the preparation of their intervention
plans, and in all aspects of their lives, such as education, health, and leisure. In order to develop the
skills needed to live an independent life, it is very important that these children learn to make
decisions (including about issues that seem of little importance to children living in a family) and to
manage their lives.
To increase children’s participation in the protection system, besides formal rules, procedures, and
guidelines, it will be necessary to build the communication skills of the staff working directly with
children and enhance their knowledge of participative processes. The training programs should focus
more on encouraging children to participate in the decisions that affect them rather than on listening
to their views in order to make decisions about them. Also, to overcome organisational barriers, it will
be necessary to ensure that case management is carried out in a way that is much friendlier to
children.

   MDRAP (2014). Enhancing the administrative capacity to ensure access to quality public services is one of the overall
goals of the Strategy for Strengthening the Public Administration 2014-2020 (Goal IV, Annex 1:83-85). The Strategy
recommends the development of quality and cost standards for all public services in order to improve their efficiency
and quality. It also proposes the development of a minimum package of public services that every territorial
administrative unit should supply, as well as an optional package of services that should be provided by the more

Theme 4: The system needs to provide solutions which are tailored to children’s different needs
and situations
The diversity of children’s needs was reflected in the case files both in terms of their initial
circumstances and of the reasons for separating them from their families. Therefore, it is vital to carry
out a thorough analysis of each child’s situation because the needs of children vary significantly
depending on their age, gender, area of residence, and health. This means that the child protection
system needs to offer an equally wide range of services in response to such needs. Specifically, the
social assistance, education and health systems need to offer adequate prevention responses in order
to decrease the number of new entries into the system and to improve the range of services available
at the local level to increase the number of children in public care who are successfully reintegrated
into their families.
The analysis of the causes of child-family separation has revealed that the case files of over two-thirds
(65 percent) of the children in public care mentioned a multitude of vulnerabilities that these children
and their families faced prior to their entering the system. The categories of children with a higher
than average risk of being institutionalized were: (i) children who had disabilities when they entered
the system; (ii) children with developmental delays when they entered the system; (iii) children
between 6 and 17 years of age with special educational needs when they entered the system; (iv)
children between 7 and 17 years of age with behavioral disorders when they entered the system; and
(v) infants between 0 and 12 months born prematurely and/or underweight.
Overall, the case files indicated that 76 percent of the children in public care had more than one
reason for being separated from their families, including unfortunate events (one or both parents’
death or institutionalization), neglect, abuse, or exploitation, child relinquishment, and/or the parents
being deprived of their parental rights. The other 24 percent of the children represent avoidable
entries, whose case files explain the entry into the system either on the basis of parental risk factors457
(12 percent), or of the child’s belonging to one of the groups with special needs (5 percent), or of
structural factors458 (7 percent). In total, avoidable entries represent approximately a quarter of all
entries, irrespective of the year of reference. A decrease in avoidable entries into the child protection
system is a good indicator of the effectiveness of prevention measures.
Children in public care, whether in institutions or family-type care, are boys and girls of all ages
between 0 and 26 (and sometimes older). Most of the children placed in the care of child protection
services are between 10 and 17 years of age. This age group represents more than half of the children
in public care (56 percent), and their total number and share have constantly increased in the past four
years. Children with disabilities represent a significant share (almost 29 percent) of all children in
public care. The share of people with disabilities increases gradually from approximately 6 percent of
children under 1 year of age to over 43 percent of young people between 18 and 26+ years of age.
With regard to the types of services provided by the system, thorough analyses are necessary of
chil’ren's placements with relatives or with other families or individuals.
For children placed with relatives for social reasons only (related to poverty and precarious housing),
the government should consider replacing this social protection measure with a special social benefit
managed by the SPAS, possibly as part of the Minimum Social Insertion Income (MSII), which is
expected to become operational soon. This new benefit would be a preventive measure that would: (i)
benefit both the child and the family; (ii) increase coverage of such cases; and (iii) be uniformly applied
nationwide. Of course, such an initiative would have to be well thought out and designed to minimize
fraud and errors, serve the best interests of the child, and ensure that children and the families caring
for them receive adequate support within the community.


457
   The individual risk factors analyzed in this study are: parents who leave to work abroad, dysfunctional families,
adolescent mothers, parents’ excessive alcohol and/or drug consumption, domestic violence, and parents with
disabilities and/or mental health problems.
458
   The structural risk factors analyzed in this study are: poverty/low socioeconomic status, dependence on social
benefits, no stable dwelling, homeless families, evictions, vagrancy, characteristics of source communities, lack of
services within the community, and attitudes and values that do not support the prevention of child-family separations.

                                                                                                                  361
For the time being, placements with other individuals or families, regardless of the purpose for which
they were initially created, are not a solution that can be targeted either to a specific group of children
or to specific types of difficult situations that the children may go through. It will also be necessary to
clarify the relation between placements with other families or individuals and the adoption process
since our research has shown that, in most cases, the adoptive parents wanted to adopt the child who
had already been placed with them.
Most DGASPC specialists distinguish two specific groups of children with special needs in public care:
children with behavioral disorders and children with disabilities. None of the PIP goals are appropriate
for these two groups of children. Children with behavioral disorders are not provided, either outside or
within the system, with the most effective services to enable them to prepare for an independent life
or to be reintegrated in their families. With regard to children with disabilities, particularly those with
severe disabilities, it should be acknowledged that they will need long-term placements. Therefore,
the methodological norms for the Individualized Protection Plan (PIP) and the specific intervention
plans (PIS) should be revised to take the long-term needs of these groups of children into account. On
the other hand, it is also important for the system to provide a wide range of services in order to
enable the setting of more effective goals and intervention plans for each child in care. Of course, too
many norms and regulations can result in child protection specialists having to spend too much time
on paperwork and not enough time on working directly with the children. Nevertheless, there needs
to be a balance between gathering the necessary information on the children and their circumstances
on the one hand and spending time doing right by children on the other.
The study revealed that adoption is a solution open to very few children in public care. The children
who enter the adoption process are children with a range of very different characteristics, but those
significantly more likely to complete the process are toddlers (between 0 and 2 years old), girls,
children with no siblings in the system, and children with no disabilities and/or developmental delays.
An adoptable child’s actual chances of being adopted depend to a large extent on the number and
the outlook of the potential adoptive parents. Since many prospective adoptive parents want to adopt
a particular child, often the one who had already been placed with them, the actual number of parents
who are open to adoption is in fact much smaller. Therefore, it will be vital to increase the number of
prospective adoptive parents in order to increase the chances of successful theoretical and practical
matches between the adoptable child and the potential adoptive family. It will also be necessary to
increase the effectiveness of the courses attended by those individuals and families who want to
adopt a child as well as to improve the professional training of the DGASPC specialists on how to
communicate with potential adoptive parents, particularly with regard to the needs of children with
disabilities. At the same time, there is a need for education and communication campaigns at the
community level that not only foster a positive attitude towards adoption and adopted children but
also discourage the rejection and undervaluation of children, irrespective of their gender, age, ethnic
origin, health condition, or parents.

Theme 5: The success of a child protection system is determined by the effectiveness of the
actual support children receive
Many children end up in public care when they are younger than 3 years, often under 1 year old, and
thus face a real risk of becoming “children of the system.” Moreover, the absence of any interaction
with their family since their separation only increases the chances that these children will spend most
of their life in the system until they reach the legal age to leave. Children who were separated when
they were less than 2 years old are more than four times more likely not to have interacted at all with
their parents or other caregivers in the previous year than children separated at the age of 6 or older.
Besides the frequency of interaction between separated children and their families, it is also important
to establish to what extent their mothers or other former caretakers want to take their children back.
Although the system’s intention is usually to reintegrate children into their families, the study’s
findings regarding their families’ views on their reintegration present a less optimistic picture. More
than half of all separated children have never had any contact with their parents since the separation,
and close to 70 percent of them have had no contact in the previous year (the percentage is similarly
high even if the sample includes children who have been separated for less than a year).

362
The parents of 64 percent of the separated children say they do not want to take them back home.
Furthermore, according to the mothers who were interviewed for this study, the chances of being
reintegrated were high or very high for only 8 percent of all children in care (while for another 5
percent, the chances were rated as average). Also, for the majority of these children with chances of
being reintegrated, the mothers were not able to estimate when the reintegration was likely to take
place or they said that it was unlikely to take place for at least another three years. For fewer than 1 in
every 100 children in public care from the source communities, their mothers estimated that their
reintegration would take place in the following year. This shows the urgent need for interventions that
would improve the circumstances of the source families not only to increase the chances of the child
being reintegrated into the family but also to prevent any future separation.
On average, children spend 7.5 years in the Romanian child protection system. However, there are
many children who stay in the system much longer than the average, and more than 13,000 of them
have spent their entire lives so far in public care. One in every five children aged between 15 and 26
who are now in public care have spent their entire lives in the system, and almost one in every three
children has spent 90 percent of their lives there. This means that there is a pressing need to develop
exit paths that would offer these children real chances for the future. Because they entered public care
15 to 26 years ago, they are likely to have gone through many centers, but the “system” is the only
family they know. Their integration in society or socio-professional integration will be nothing but
words on paper if, once these young adults reach the age when they have to leave, the “system”
simply withdraws just as their parents disappeared when they were little, leaving them with no skills to
live an independent life, no solid education to enable them to earn their living, and with no housing
choices.
The system should address this risk by creating two distinctive institutional paths to prepare children
for a life after being in care. The first path, for an independent life, would comprise not only family-
type alternative care in smaller communities but also social housing or sheltered houses for children
when they come of age (18 to 26 years old). The other path should be for children with severe
disabilities who are unable to manage on their own. In the absence of these paths, the child protection
system provides childhood care, but, despite its aim to make all necessary efforts to keep children
with their families, it failes to fulfil its long-term objective for the thousands of young people leaving
the system each year with no support from their families. For children with disabilities, especially with
severe disabilities, experts acknowledge that long-term placement solutions are needed. If no other
permanent solution is possible when they become adults, then they should be able to continue living
in the small group homes in which they are currently living as children.
There is a special need for support services for young people with disabilities who live in their
communities. First, it will be necessary to remove any attitudinal and environmental obstacles to the
habilitation and social reintegration of children with disabilities. Second, it will be necessary to provide
a basic package of integrated social services, including all basic health and education services as well
as habilitation/rehabilitation services, that are friendly and accessible to children with disabilities and
their families. Specialized mobile support teams should also be established to service those children
who live in areas in which it is not feasible to develop habilitation/rehabilitation services. In addition to
such support services as home help for people with complex dependencies or assistance in
performing daily household activities and personal care, there is a wide range of needs that is specific
to young people that should be addressed. These include: (i) the need to obtain and keep an
affordable dwelling, to live independently, and, in some cases, to manage financial and personal
goods; (ii) the need for habilitation and rehabilitation adapted to their specific needs and provided in
the context of an independent life; (iii) the need for professional training, education, professional
mentoring, and assistance in finding employment (all of which must be capable of being tailored to
the needs of people at various ages and at various stages of the professional cycle); (iv) the need to
access other community services (such as health care, legal services, outdoor activities, cultural
activities, and leisure centers); and (v) the need to have a balanced family life (which implies, for
example, family counselling and sexual education). The services that enable independent living
represent a distinctive and important category of support that must be developed in the next few

years, especially in the context of the post-institutionalization social integration of young people with
disabilities as well as of the system’s transition from residential care to community services.

Theme 6: Improving and systematizing working practices
At the time of the study, the practices of DGASPC professionals were found to be unstandardized and
not sufficiently or not at all based on reliable data regarding the history of children and/or their
families. As has been shown several times in this report, the practices of social workers or people with
social assistance duties, as well as of professionals at the local level are also inconsistent and largely
depending on circumstances that should not affect one’s work. Therefore, working practices need to
be improved across all three stages of the child’s journey through the protection system - prior to the
child’s entry (understanding the causes leading to the child’s separation from the family), within public
care (drafting, implementing, and monitoring the Individualized Protection Plan), and upon exiting the
system (monitoring the child and family’s welfare after he or she leaves the system).
This study has revealed that the practices used by professionals to select and record the cause of
child-family separation are generally based on the factual data contained in the child’s case file.
However, DGASPC specialists tend to overuse “poverty” as a cause of separation even when there is
evidence of child neglect or abuse or the death of the child’s parents, for example. This overuse of
“poverty” as a cause of separation is encouraged by it being listed among eligible justifications, unlike
child relinquishment. Also, it will be essential to improve the way in which neglect, abuse, and other
forms of exploitation of children are understood and recorded in order to ensure that relevant long-
term, post-separation individualized protection plans can be drawn up for each child in this situation.
Also in the stage prior to the child’s entry into public care, it would be useful to develop a stricter
procedure governing children entering the system at the family’s request, especially based on a
decision of the Child Protection Commission. This should start with the proper case documentation
and introduce an obligation that requires the authorities to follow all the steps that precede the
placement of a child in public care. The procedure should be applied consistently throughout the
country, and it should involve the DGASPC multidisciplinary teams (for the initial case assessment),
together with SPAS representatives, the Community Consultative Structures, and local authorities.
At the stage when a child enters the system, a comprehensive initial child-focused assessment is
essential. In the absence of such an assessment for every child who enters the system, it is impossible
to carry out a transparent monitoring of the outcomes of the child protection system.
Even though prevention services focus on offering multiple alternatives in order to avoid new entries
in the system, there will still be cases where it will be in a child’s best interest to make an urgent
intervention with protection measures. Professionals have emphasized the need to make these
interventions more quickly in cases of relinquishment or abuse because “two months of delay in
making decisions in the best interests of a child or young person equates to 1 percent of childhood
that cannot be restored.”459
The recommendations related to this theme are closely connected with Theme 7: Developing a high
performance management information system. A work methodology based on an information system
would significantly increase the transparency and accountability of the public care system. As a result
of using such a methodology, the need to develop services targeting both a decrease in the number
of entries into the system and an increase in the number of exists from the system would become
measurable. At the same time, by listing types of services or activities not available (and requiring
development) in specific communities, it would enable specialists to justify any apparently “avoidable”
entries into the system. This methodology would also allow for an enhancement of the
interinstitutional collaboration between the DGASPC specialists and the SPAS or SCC staff.
This study has found that the frequency with which a family of a child in public care interacts directly
with a SPAS social worker/staff with social assistance duties depends not so much on the social
worker’s type of specialization as on whether he or she has a higher education or not. Therefore, to

364
improve the performance of the protection system, it is vital that all communes in Romania (especially
those that include source communities and/or marginalized areas) employ within their SPAS at least
one person with social assistance duties who has a higher education. Ideally, such a person would be a
professional social worker. At the same time, for the efficient implementation of the minimum
intervention package recommended under Theme 1, professionals (especially those from universities,
service providers, and the National College of Social Workers in Romania) should develop child- and
family-centerd tools and methodologies for the adoption, assessment, planning, design,
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of social services.

Theme 7: Developing a high performance management information system
The structural design and use of the current Child Monitoring and Tracking Information System
(CMTIS) does not make it possible to extract relevant data regarding the status of children in public
care, data that would inform the working practices of professionals, or the assessment of general
system outcomes for children and their families. Only about 20 counties use the CMTIS in their daily
activities, while the other DGASPCs have developed alternative ICT systems (which are not
interconnected and differ from one county to another).460 According to the survey of case managers
that was conducted for this study, 26 percent of all case managers have no knowledge of CMTIS, and
only 27 percent reported having used the system during 2010-2015. In addition, there is no clear
procedure to ensure the accuracy of the local data entered in the CMTIS.
Second, the information in the CMTIS is not updated. The fact that the study team could not find a
high percentage of the households of children in public care from the source communities and that a
high percentage of mothers were not present in the selected localities raises a question mark about
the quality of the entire information system as such. Even though case managers updated the
information “on paper” in the children’s case files, it is difficult to access this information and use it in
an efficient and integrated way in the absence of a system that is constantly updated in real time both
by case managers and by social workers.
Third, the CMTIS is not compatible with other public databases that contain information on families
and children and that could be used to identify families at high risk of separation or that could provide
rapid alerts in real time about events in the life of families and children that are likely to increase the
risk of separation. The World Bank’s proposed model of integrated social services developed as part of
the implementation plan for the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction 2015-
2020 (“Develop integrated social services at the community level”), recommends creating a
management information system (MIS) based on the interoperability of public databases.
Identifying the causes for child-family separation and providing early intervention are key to an
effective performance of the child protection system. Specific regulations – such as Government
Decision 691/2015461 whose enforcement needs to be supported – should also include a management
information system based on one IT program available to both DGASPC specialists and SPAS
representatives, using lessons learnt in previous projects. A management information system would
help child protection specialists by reducing bureaucracy, while enabling: (i) the use of a consistent
approach nationwide, (ii) real-time coordination between the SPAS and DGASPC specialists, (iii)
monitoring of the activities carried out by all relevant stakeholders, and (iv) supplying the ANPDCA
with sufficient evidence to allow for rapid adjustments to any legislation, programs or measures where
necessary.
Moreover, the analysis of existing services (particularly deficient/scarce ones) that would be facilitated
by the use of a MIS would become available to local authorities, and, once aggregated at the county
and national levels, could be shared with the relevant county and central authorities. In this way, the

institutions.

need for more services that would reduce the number of children entering the system and increase
the number of children leaving the system would become more visible and measurable.
Therefore, it will be necessary to develop a nationwide child-centerd MIS to substantially increase the
current level of data accuracy and consistency at local and national level. This MIS should be a daily
working instrument for all local professionals, as well as for case managers and specialists from the
public child care system. The data entered into this MIS should reflect each child’s full history and
should contain enough information to enable child protection professionals to provide efficient
support to children in public care and their families/relatives. This theme is connected to all the other
six themes because in the absence of reliable and comprehensive data about the child and their family,
all child protection system interventions meant to serve the child’s best interest will fail.

Reorganizing the System around the Needs of the Children/Young People and their Families
In light of the themes discussed above, this study has identified a few key problems that require
urgent solutions, but most of all the political will to completely reform the current configuration of the
child protection system, of social assistance and social benefits, and of education, health, social
housing, and jobs. Some of the reform objectives that we proposed here are already being undertaken
as part of the implementation of two strategic documents – the National Strategy for the Protection
and Promotion of Children’s Rights 2014-2020 and the National Strategy on Social Inclusion and
Poverty Reduction 2015-2020. However, the implementation of a number of them will require a longer
time horizon and most likely a substantial financial support. In many cases, this financial support will
not necessarily mean an increase in the volume of resources but rather a retargeting of budget
allocations, for example, from institutional care to prevention services that should substantially reduce
the number of new entries and enable more children to grow up within their families.
Other steps will be necessary to complement all of these recommendations, as described in the
previous themes, iso as to demonstrate a long-term vision according to which children and young
people are viewed as “an asset” instead of “a problem” as highlighted by one of the specialists
interviewed in the qualitative study:
        “[...] so, in my opinion, in our country, children are not valued as they should be. We don’t have
        long-term thinking, so everyone tries to solve crisis situations, urgently, hastily, like putting out a
        fire, and we do not have a long-term vision of what will happen to that child in the future; what
        matters is for the local authority or the family or whoever has the “problem” child to be rid of it,
        “problem” in a manner of speaking, because, most often, these children are perfectly healthy, and
        a huge asset, but nobody sees that value anymore.” (Focus group with professionals, Cluj-
        Napoca)

Annex 1. Household Survey in
Rural Source Communities
A 1.1. Methodology
The Survey of Households with Children in Public Care in Rural Source Communities was based on a
sample of mothers identified using the available data in the CMTIS. Among the households living at
the addresses given in the CMTIS, only 61 percent still comprised either the mother or another person
who had cared for one or more children now in public care. The other 39 percent of the households
no longer lived in the commune.462 Moreover, in the source communities of the 60 communes under
analysis, an additional 139 families with children in public care were identified who were not
registered in the CMTIS, as shown in Table below. The analysis of this data will be presented in the
sections of this chapter.

                                the Rural Source Communities

    Only two mothers refused to participate in the survey, and there were eight cases in which households were present
but no longer included either the biological mother or any other person who had cared for one or more of the
institutionalized children prior to their entering the system.

    The Sampling Sheet refers both to the main sample and to the reserve samples. It means that the received sample
    is checked in its entirety.
    In the database, SAT appears with NUMESAT and SIRINF.

    The village in the Sampling Sheet does not necessarily represent the address where the mother can be effectively
    found. In this table, one can find the de facto address of the mother.

    For households that are no longer in the commune, household forms only with the first page can be prepared.
    In this table, we included 10 cases. Only in 4 communes of the sample, the Sampling Sheet has between 31 and
    37 cases.

study conducted for UNICEF, aimed at analysing the wellbeing of children and their families, with a
special focus on children in public care and children at risk of being deprived of parental care.

anything that comes to mind about one topic or another.
To start with, please briefly introduce yourself: name, position, seniority, and your main duties within
the institution.


DESCRIPTION OF THE SOURCE COMMUNITY
From what you have seen, is there an area in your locality where most children in public care come
from – a source community? Where is this area located (street, neighborhood, etc.)? Are there any
other areas with an increased risk for families placing their children in public care? Please specify
(street, neighborhood, etc.).
What are the characteristics of the source community (SPONTANEOUS ANSWER. Answers such as
“poverty” shall be detailed as much as possible)? What is the difference between this community and
other communities with a high risk for children to end up in public care, but where these children’s
share is still comparatively low (i.e. other communities with a high risk, but which are the source of a
lower number of child entries in the protection system)?


CAUSES OF SEPARATION
In the identified source community, what would you say are the main causes leading to child-family
separation? (Answers such as “poverty” need to be detailed as much as possible) Please detail.

•       Alcoholism
•       Violence in the community, membership in delinquent groups
•       One parent is missing – abroad for work


DESCRIPTION OF STANDARDS AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES – prevention
What activities are carried out in the concerned source community to prevent the separation of the
child from his/her family? Who is targeted by these activities (the parents/the children/the community,
etc.)? Who (institution, NGO, individual, etc.) is responsible for carrying out these activities? How
efficient are the activities, in your opinion? Why do you say that? What could be done to increase their
efficiency? What other activities/measures could be implemented to prevent the separation (including
measures/activities which had good results in communities with high risk)?


DESCRIPTION OF STANDARDS AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES – taking the child
In the source community, who made the referrals to have the children taken from their families
(parents/relatives, social workers/judges)? What situations are most common?
What are the stages of the process upon which a child enters the protection system? What is your and
your institution’s role in this process? Who decides that a child is going to be institutionalized? What
criteria underlie this decision? How clear/interpretable are these criteria, in your opinion? Examples!

What is the role of each individual? And in case of children with disabilities? How is the cooperation
between these various individuals, in your opinion?
How are things in the case of the Individualized Protection Plan, in your opinion? What aspects work
well? And those which could be improved? To what extent are the activities stipulated in the
Individualized Protection Plan implemented? What are the main obstacles in their implementation?
What improvements do you consider necessary?


DESCRIPTION OF STANDARDS AND OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES – the child/youth leaves the system
In your locality, what are the most frequent ways in which children leave the protection system
(returning to their families, adoption, coming of age, etc.)? Are there cases of children who should leave
the system because they have come of age, but are still in the system? Why are they still in the
system? What should be done for them? Who should do it?
What activities are carried out to support the child’s exit from the system? What
institutions/individuals are responsible for these activities? To what extent are these activities efficient,
in your opinion? Explain.
To what extent does the children’s reintegration in their biological families succeed as a result of the
activities carried out? Please detail! What are the main obstacles?

protection, in your opinion? Please explain and provide examples! What standards or legislative
procedures need improvement? How should these be improved? (INCLUDE WHAT IS SPECIFIC TO
YOUR FIELD)
As far as you know, are there differences at the national level regarding the standards and procedures
applied to child protection? / The same rules apply in all counties or are the rules different? The
existence of these differences is something positive or negative, in your opinion? Please detail. (Could
you also identify positive/negative aspects determined by the mentioned differences?)
Can you provide examples of counties where, in your opinion, things work well in the field of child
protection? What are you referring to when you say things work well? Why do you think things work
better in these counties? / What is the difference compared to other counties?

INTRODUCTION
Thank you for responding to our invitation to take part in this discussion. As we have told you, this is a
study conducted for UNICEF, aimed at analysing the wellbeing of children and their families, with a
special focus on children in public care and children at risk of being deprived of parental care.
Because everything we discuss here is very important to us, we ask for your permission to make an
audio recording of our discussion, in order to make it easier for us to remember the details later on
when we draw up the final report and decide on the next best steps.
This is a free discussion based on an interview topic guide; we point out that your answers will not be
assessed as good or bad, right or wrong! They are important for us, which is why we invite you to say
anything that comes to mind about one topic or another.
To start with, please briefly introduce yourself: name, position, seniority, and your main dutiese within
the NGO.


NGO DESCRIPTION AND MISSION
Please describe the NGO you represent (mission, objectives, experience, size, etc.).
What are the main projects/activities you have carried out in the field of child protection? What were
they about? What were the results of the project? What support did these projects provide to the
households (parents, children, etc.) having or at risk of having children in public care?
Do you think the projects/services you provide overlap with or are additional to the services provided
by the public authorities (DAS, DGASPC, etc.)? What overlaps? / What is additional? Why do you think
the public authorities fail to meet these needs and the NGOs have to step in?


DESCRIPTION OF THE SOURCE COMMUNITY
From what you have seen, is there an area in your locality where most children in public care come
from? Where is this area located (street, neighborhood, etc.)?
What are the characteristics of such a community? (SPONTANEOUS ANSWER) What are the
differences between this community and other communities with a high risk for children to end up in
public care, but where these children’s share is still comparatively low (i.e. other communities with a
high risk, but which are the source of a lower number of child entries in the protection system)?


CAUSES OF SEPARATION
From your experience, what are the main causes leading to child-family separation in the identified
community? Please detail.
What do you think should be done in that community to reduce the risk of child-family separation?
What institutions should be responsible?


428
In your opinion, what is the role of the non-governmental sector in the endeavour to reduce the
separation of children from their biological families? What more should be done? What are the
obstacles encountered?


ASSESSMENT OF THE PUBLIC CHILD PROTECTION SYSTEM
How would you assess the public child protection system in your locality? Which aspects work well, in
your opinion? Which aspects don’t work well in the system? How do you think they could be
improved?
What is your opinion of the results/outcomes achieved by the public institutions in your locality in the
child protection process?


POTENTIAL FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE NON-
GOVERNMENTAL SECTOR IN THE CHILD PROTECTION PROCESS
To what extent was the cooperation between public institutions and various non-governmental
organizations or associations attempted in the child protection process so far?
If it was: What was the cooperation about? What activities/projects have been carried out? What were
the outcomes?
What are the main obstacles in trying to cooperate with the public institutions in the field of child
protection? How could they be overcome?
What would be the advantages of a cooperation between the public institutions and various
non-governmental organizations/associations in the field of child protection? And the disadvantages?


RECOMMENDATIONS
What main actions would you suggest should be carried out in order to reduce the risk of separation
of the children from their biological families? (at all possible levels: family, involved institutions, etc.)
What main actions or measures would you suggest should be undertaken for a better reintegration of
the children from the system into their biological families? And for a better community insertion of the
young people leaving the protection system? And for a better labor market insertion of the young
people leaving the protection system?
If there are any other important aspects related to child protection, which we didn’t address, please
detail them.
Thank you!

THE CHILD IN PUBLIC CARE


 ENTRIES INTO AND EXITS FROM THE SYSTEM



In this section, we list all the entries - exits and re-entries (returns) of the selected child.
 We consider the actual exits form the system, for instance, those through reintegration or integration,
    upon termination of the protection measure. Short leaves of absence or IVAs are not deemed exits.
 If a child has a single entry into the system, fill in only the last line of the table below entering 1 in the No.
    column and the entry date. The exit date is already filled in with “Child currently in the system (November
    2014)”.
 If a child has 2 entries, fill in the first line (No. 1), the entry and exit date, and then enter 2 in the No. column
    on the last line and the entry date. The exit date on the last line is already filled in with “Child currently in the
    system (November 2014)”.
 If a child has several returns in the system, fill in the first line (No. 1), enter 2 in the No. column on the
    second line as well as the entry and exit date on that line, and continue down to the last (most recent) entry, for
    which you enter on the last line the entry number in the No. column and the entry date, as the exit date is
    already filled in with “Child currently in the system (November 2014)”.

INTRODUCTION
Thank you for responding to our invitation to take part in this discussion. As we have told you, this is a
study conducted for UNICEF aimed at analysing the wellbeing of children and their families, with a
special focus on children in public care and children at risk of being deprived of parental care.
Because everything we discuss here is very important to us, we ask for your permission to make an
audio recording of our discussion, in order to make it easier for us to remember the details later on
when we draw up the final report and decide on the next best steps.
This is a free discussion based on an interview topic guide; we point out that your answers will not be
assessed as good or bad, right or wrong! They are important for us, which is why we invite you to say
anything that comes to mind about one topic or another.
To start with, please briefly introduce yourself: name, position, seniority, and your main duties
regarding child protection.

Public Care

                                             Focus Group
                              Children in the public protection system


We are conducting a study about children like you, to find out how they live and what they feel. We
have invited you here to talk with some of you. Nobody will find out the answers you give. There are
no right or wrong answers. All we are interested in is your opinion.
Grown-ups want to understand what place is better for children like you, i.e. children whose families
have troubles and cannot raise their own children during certain periods of time. Please explain where
you think it would be better for you: at the center or in your own family.


INTRODUCTION
To start with, please introduce yourself: name, age, school grade you are in, the things you like to do
in your spare time.
How long have you been in this center? Do you remember why you had to come here? To whom did
you talk about this?


LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE CENTER
We would like to know how you feel here, in the center. Tell me about this place where you live. What
do you like/don’t like in the center, in terms of the space, the building (room, bathrooms,
playgrounds)?
How satisfied are you with: the food, cleaning, play time, the help received?
How do you help out with the food, cleaning, order?
We would like to know if you feel safe – when you play, when you sleep. Is anybody bothering you?
What do you do if somebody doesn’t let you sleep or see to your business? Who do you ask for help?


CHILD EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND RELATIONSHIPS
How do you get along with the other children in the home you live in? How about your schoolmates?
Do you have close friends? Who are they (children in the same home, schoolmates, etc.)?
Do you trust the people working in the center? If yes, why do you? If not, why not?
On a scale from 1 to 10, how happy would you say you are?
What should happen to determine you to change your rating to a higher one? What exactly makes
you feel happy? What makes you unhappy?
Have you gone through anything that made you feel that people, in general, treat you differently than
the rest of the children? What was it?
When you are sad, as all children are sometimes, to whom do you talk about it (director, teacher,
social worker, class master, psychologist)? When did you last talk to this person? Did you talk several
times with this person? Are these discussions helpful in any way?

We would like to understand a few things about your school situation.
What are the main difficulties you encounter in school and learning? Are there any others that come
to mind?
Where do you prepare for school? At the after-school program, or at the center? Do you prepare in
your room or do you have a common room? Who and what helps you with your homework (silence,
books, internet, computer)?
Do you believe you know as much and about the same things as the other children in your school?
Why do you say that?
What do you think about the teaching staff in your school? Do you think they treat you differently
than the rest of the children? Tell me about such a situation!
And the other pupils/students, do they treat you differently than the rest of the children? Tell me
about such a situation!


SOCIALIZATION
How much time do you spend with the children outside the center? What kinds of things do you do
together?
When was the last time you went on a hike or on vacation outside the center? Where did you go?
How often are such activities carried out?
What other kinds of activities do you participate in outside the center? With whom?
What other things would you like to do outside the center?


CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY. INVOLVEMENT OF THE CHILD IN THE DECISIONS ABOUT SEPARATION
FROM AND REINTEGRATION INTO THE FAMILY
Do you maintain contact with your biological family? Who in the family did you interact with? When
was the last time you met? When was the last time you went home for a visit?
When you were sent to the center you live in now, did anybody talk to you about what was
happening? Who (parents, social workers, judge, etc.)? What did they ask you? To what extent did they
take into account what you said?
What nice things did you use to do with your family before coming to the center?
What things happened in your family that you wouldn’t like to see happening again if you went back
there?
What do you think about the chance of going back to your biological family? Would you like that?
Why would you/not? Did you talk to somebody about your wish? What did they tell you?
Please fill in the following sentence: I would like to go back to my family, because …
Before going back to my family, I would like to know that ....
What are the things that matter to you, the children in the centers, that we, grown-ups, should know
about? What should we do for you to feel better?

Notes: *Only parents who are alive and known are considered. **Data about the father are not available.
***Mother lived in the same dwelling with other person(s) (usually, the grandmother) who took care of the child.
****Generally multigenerational households in which the grandparents or other relatives took care of the child,
although the parents were present. The route Maternity ward --> Family: Single mother institutionalized --> SPS
is included in the category "other routes" due to the small number of cases. The age category 18-26 years
includes youths aged over 26 who were still in the system at the time when the research was conducted.

Source: Survey of the Case Files of Children in Public Care (November-December 2014). Data are weighted.
Notes: *Only parents who are alive and known are considered. **Data about the father are not available.
***Mother lived in the same dwelling with other person(s) (usually, the grandmother) who took care of the child.
****Generally multigenerational households in which the grandparents or other relatives took care of the child,
although the parents were present. Only 22 percent of all children in public care have any data about their birth
weight in their files. Most of those are children who arrived in the system after being relinquished in health
facilities. The age category 18-26 years includes youths aged over 26 who were still in the system at the time
when the research was conducted.

Annex 6 Box 1: The Social Worker’s Role and Responsibilities in the Protection and Promotion
                                    of Children’s Rights

Any family may go, at a certain point, through difficult times because of losing a job, small income, ageing or
illness. Social workers have to support the family, providing it with all available facilities and services, using all
the community’s resources, in order to help keeping the children within their families. In principle, the best
place for a child is together with his/her parents, although, sometimes, the parents may face difficulties. In
cases like this, it is very important to support the family in raising the children, so as to avoid separation and its
impact on the children’s development.
Social workers should not only be aware of all the resources and services available in their community, but also
take proactive action, notifying the local authorities (mayor and to local council) of the various needs of the
community (nurseries, kindergartens, day care, school transportation, medical practice or even utilities, such as
electricity or running water etc.) and requesting them to take the necessary measures.
If the family faces more serious problems, such as drug or alcohol consumption, domestic violence or
behaviour disorder, the social workers within SPAS shall have to identify such situations and intervene as soon
as possible in order to prevent such problems from aggravating. Through the service plan, they shall aim at
keeping the child together with his/her parents, granting all necessary services, including counselling and
therapy.
Only when it is clear that the support provided does not have the expected results and that the child’s
development is endangered within the family, additional measures shall have to be taken into account. In such
cases, SPAS shall notify DGASPC immediately.

Not even in this case shall separation of the child from his/her parents be automatically recommended.
DGASPC shall make its own assessments and shall be able to recommend the provision of specialized services.
However, if it is necessary that the child be placed outside the family, the social workers shall continue to
cooperate with DGASPC during such placement, in order to help maintain the relations between the child and
the parents or other persons with whom the child enjoyed family life, in so far as this is not contrary to his/her
higher interest. Also, the social workers shall offer support to the parents, in order to help them reintegrate the
child within the family.
Many children feel that they are responsible for what happened and they are worried about how their parents
manage the situation. Maintaining the relationship with the parents may reduce the feeling of guilt and
responsibility of the child and help them form a more realistic idea of the reasons for which they were “put in a
foster home”. This connection may also contribute to building a bridge between the past and the future, which
is important in order to ensure continuity and development of the child, as well as between the child and
his/her parents. Even if they are unable to provide for his/her care on a permanent basis, they may develop
their capacities. In his/her turn, the child may better understand the situation and will not feel “abandoned”.
