WAVES - Global Partnership for Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services
Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services (WAVES) is a global partnership led by the World Bank
that aims to promote sustainable development by mainstreaming natural capital in development planning and
national economic accounting systems, based on the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA). The
WAVES global partnership (www.wavespartnership.org) brings together a broad coalition of governments, United
Nations agencies, nongovernment organizations and academics for this purpose. WAVES core implementing
countries include developing countries—Botswana, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Indonesia, Madagascar, the
Philippines and Rwanda—all working to establish natural capital accounts. WAVES also partners with UN agencies—
UNEP, UNDP, and the UN Statistical Commission—that are helping to implement natural capital accounting. WAVES is
funded by a multi-donor trust fund and is overseen by a steering committee. WAVES donors include—Denmark, the
European Commission, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

                             EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Mangroves and other coastal ecosystems act as natural defenses that protect people and
property from storms, ﬂoods, erosion, and other coastal hazards, reducing coastal risk.
Mangroves protect coastlines by decreasing the risk of ﬂooding and erosion. The roots of
mangroves retain sediments and prevent erosion, while the prop roots, trunks and canopy
reduce the force of incoming wind and waves and reduce ﬂooding. Yet the value of these
ecosystems is often not fully accounted for in policy and management decisions, and thus they
continue to be lost at alarming rates, increasing the risk faced by coastal communities. Between
1980-2005, the world lost 19% of its mangroves. The Philippines has lost hundreds of thousands
of hectares of mangroves in the last century. When mangroves are degraded or destroyed, the
coast line becomes more exposed to the destructive impacts of waves and storm surge, and
coastal communities have greater risks from the impacts of storms, ﬂoods, and sea level rise.

The Philippines is at high risk from coastal hazards and natural defenses can help reduce these
risks. Between 2005 to 2015, 2,754 natural hazards aﬀected the Philippines: 56% of property
damage was caused by typhoons and storms, and another 29% was caused by ﬂoods. Due to a
recognition of these increasing risks, and of the potential role of natural defenses to reduce
these risks, the Government of the Philippines has committed to restoring mangroves as part of
its risk reduction strategy, and the Philippines WAVES program on natural capital accounting is
helping the Philippines incorporate the value of mangroves into their national accounts.

This Technical Report, and its accompanying Policy Brief, provide a social and economic
valuation of the ﬂood protection beneﬁts from mangroves in the Philippines. This work aims to
support decisions across development, aid, risk reduction and conservation sectors as they
seek to identify sustainable and cost-eﬀective approaches for risk reduction.

This Technical Report applies the Expected Damage Function approach recommended by the
World Bank to quantify the risk reduction beneﬁts from mangroves in the Philippines. Using
high-resolution ﬂooding models, the Report examines the ﬂooding that would occur with and
without mangroves under diﬀerent storm conditions throughout the Philippines, and estimates
the annual expected beneﬁts of mangroves for protecting people and property in social and
economic terms. The report examines ﬂooding under regular storms and under extreme
conditions (e.g. typhoon) and compares the people and property damaged under 3 diﬀerent
scenarios of mangrove cover: historical mangrove cover (1950), current mangrove cover (2010),
and no mangrove cover. The protection services of mangroves are valued nationally across the
Philippines using national models. The values obtained from these national models are
compared to values from sensitivity analyses in a few locations (i.e., Pagbilao and Busuanga)
calculated with very high-resolution data and models, so that the results of the national models
may be veriﬁed.

In summary, the key ﬁndings are:

   •   In the Philippines, if the current mangroves (data from 2010) were lost, 24% more people
       would be ﬂooded annually, i.e., an additional 613,000 more people many of whom live in
       poverty.

   •   Damages to residential and industrial property would increase by 28% to more than US
       $1 billion annually; and 766 km of roads would be ﬂooded.

   •   One hectare of mangroves in the Philippines provides on average more than US $3200/
       year of direct ﬂood reduction beneﬁts.

   •   Based on the Philippines’s current population, the mangroves lost between 1950 and
       2010 have resulted in increases in ﬂooding to more than 267,000 people every year.
       Restoring these mangroves would bring more than US $450 million/year in ﬂood
       protection beneﬁts.

   •   Mangroves provide the most protection for frequent lower intensity storms (for example,
       1-in-10 year storm events). For more catastrophic events, such as the 1-in-25 year storm,
       they provide more than US $1.6 billion in averted damages throughout the Philippines.
       When combined with built infrastructure, mangroves provide an eﬀective defense
       against storms and coastal ﬂooding.

   •   The results are presented in maps that show the spatial variation in the ﬂood reduction
       beneﬁts provided by mangroves to identify the places where mangrove management
       may yield the greatest returns.

Incorporating the value of these ecosystem services into a country’s system of natural capital
accounts can ensure that these ecosystems are accounted for in policy and management
decisions. Currently, only a subset of the beneﬁts provided by ecosystems is valued, usually
extractive services such as ﬁsh and timber harvests. Many critical services that rely on keeping
ecosystems intact, such as ﬂood protection and climate mitigation, are rarely valued. This
encourages short-term over-exploitation and reduces the quantity and quality of the goods and
services provided by natural capital. Better valuations of the protection services of coastal
habitats may halt the loss of our natural capital and ensure the provision of ecosystem services-
what gets measured, gets managed.

Mangrove conservation and restoration can be an important part of the solution for reducing
coastal risks. By valuing these coastal protection beneﬁts in terms used by ﬁnance and
development decision-makers (e.g., annual expected beneﬁts), these results can be readily used
alongside common metrics of national economic accounting, and can inform risk reduction,
development and environmental conservation decisions in the Philippines.

      2010 (LandCover) scenarios.

   3. Coral reef coverage (Millenium Reef

The high computational eﬀort required to
analyze the propagation of waves over the
ecosystems of such a huge number of
proﬁles forced us to reduce the number of
proﬁles to a few representative ‘families’ of
proﬁles. We used a clustering technique, K-
MEANS, to group or classify the proﬁles into
250 representative families of proﬁles in the
Philippines. To build these families, we
considered the water depth along the whole
proﬁle for every kilometer (resulting in 20
water depth values), and the type of bottom
cover for every kilometer for three types of
bottoms: sand, coral reef, and mangrove
(resulting in 20 bottom cover values).

K-MEANS is a clustering method which aims
to partition ‘n’ observations (171,888 proﬁles
deﬁned by their water depth and bottom
type) into ‘k’ clusters (250 representative
proﬁles, also deﬁned by their water depth
and bottom cover) in which each observation
belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
Although this is a challenging computational
problem, there are eﬃcient heuristic
algorithms that converge quickly to a local
optimum via an iterative reﬁnement
approach.

Three diﬀerent K-MEANS classiﬁcations are
performed, for the 3 mangrove coverage
scenarios, resulting in 750 families of coastal
transects proﬁles (3 scenarios x 250 proﬁles/
scenario).

The FLOW module has been implemented to calculate the contribution of the storm surge and
astronomical tide to the Total Water Level. It has been externally forced with the oﬀshore water
level calculated at the beginning of each proﬁle (oﬀshore water level is the linear summation of
oﬀshore storm surge and astronomical tide). The FLOW module assumes shallow water
Boussinesq approach to solve the Navier Stokes equations for incompressible ﬂuid (depth
average continuity equations and momentum equations are simultaneously solved in 2D mode).
WAVE module has been implemented to calculate wave set-up contribution to the Total Water
Level in the coast. Wave radiation stresses and their gradients are computed and shared to the
hydro dynamic model on the same mesh used in the hydrodynamic simulation. A wide range of
validation cases (explained in the following sections), support Delft3D model.
In this project, ﬂow and waves are simultaneously simulated by coupling SWAN model (waves)
with DELFT 3D (ﬂow). The wave computation uses ﬂow characteristics from a completed
Delft3D-FLOW computation, so that the eﬀect of ﬂow on waves is accounted for.
Coupled Delft 3D model (ﬂow+wave) account for the following physics:

   -   Wave refraction over a bottom of variable depth and/or a spatially varying ambient
       current
   -   Depth and current-induced shoaling

   -   Wave generation by wind

   -   Wave dissipation by white capping

   -   Dissipation by depth-induced breaking

   -   Dissipation due to bottom friction (three diﬀerent formulations)

   -   Nonlinear wave-wave interactions (both quadruplets and triads)

   -   Wave blocking by ﬂow

   -   Transmission through, blockage by or reﬂection against obstacles
   -   Diﬀraction

The governing three-dimensional equations describing free-surface ﬂows can be derived from
the Navier-Stokes equations after averaging over turbulence time-scales (Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes equations). Such equations express the physical principle of conservation of
volume, mass and momentum.
 In this section, we describe the shallow water equations, for which the depth is assumed to be
much smaller than the horizontal length scales of ﬂow and bathymetry. Under the further
assumption that the vertical accelerations are small compared to the horizontal ones the
shallow water assumption is valid. This means that the vertical momentum equation is reduced
to the hydrostatic pressure relation. The equations in case of a non-hydrostatic pressure are
described in a separate section. In the latter case, non-hydrostatic pressure terms are added to
the shallow water equations, which make the equations practically equivalent to the

incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This means that in Delft3D-FLOW the user has the
possibility to either apply a hydrostatic or a non-hydrostatic pressure model.
The three-dimensional hydrostatic shallow water equations, which for convenience of
presentation are given in Cartesian rectangular coordinates in the horizontal and V-coordinates
in the vertical, are described by:

                                                                    (5.1)


                                                                    (5.2)



                                                                    (5.3)

Where are the three directional components of velocity, is the local water depth, is the water
level oscillation with respect the mean water level, is the coriolis coeﬃcient, is the total water
depth (), are the local source and sink per unit volume and is the hydrostatic pressure.
The vertical velocities Z in the V-coordinate system are computed from the continuity equation,
where the global source or sink per unit area and are the depth-average velociety in x-direction
and y-direction.



                                                                    (5.4)

velocity w in the x-y-z Cartesian coordinate system can be expressed in the horizontal
velocities, water depths, water levels and vertical velocities according to:

Annex 3 | Computational Cost and Hard Disk Memory
Required

An additional analysis of DELFT 3D was carried out, consisting in measuring the computational
cost and the memory required to save results under diﬀerent forcing conditions. The test case
characteristics are the following:

   -   4 days length Tropical Cyclone (Haiyan)

   -   56 control points with time records every minute

   -   Time records every hour in the whole mesh (302x352 =106304 cells)
