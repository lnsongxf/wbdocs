   1. Introduction

The vast majority of credit utilized by the global poor is from informal sources such as
moneylenders, friends, or merchants (Banerjee and Duflo, 2007). Interest rates on these informal
loans are typically high, particularly for the poorest, who borrow lower amounts and have little
collateral to offer. A host of institutions, ranging from large commercial enterprises to small non-
governmental organizations, have entered rural credit markets in recent years with the aim of
providing lower-cost credit to the poor. While the impact of this so-called microfinance revolution
on household-level outcomes has now been well documented through a number of experimental
and non-experimental studies, its effect on informal credit markets, which continue to supply the
lion’s share of credit in these settings, has received far less attention. We address this gap through
an RCT based on the randomized roll-out of Jeevika, a government-led self-help group (SHG)
program in the state of Bihar, India, which offered loans to SHG members.

According to government sources, 33.2% of all loans in rural India are from traditional
moneylenders (GoI, 2014). Reliance on informal credit is even more pronounced in the state of
Bihar, where 47.7% of outstanding debt held by farm households is from informal sources (RBI,
2007). Traditional moneylenders charge between 12 and 150 percent annual interest, compared to
typical rates of 6 to 20 percent offered by formal banks on larger loans (RBI, 2011). In this context,
the public, for-profit, and non-governmental sectors have all invested heavily in rural credit
markets since the early 2000s (RBI, 2007; Galab and Rao, 2003, Brishti and Chowdhury, 2013).

The impact of these efforts depends, to a large extent, on how the entry of a new creditor affects
interest rates charged by incumbent informal lenders. As noted by Besley (1994), rural credit
markets are likely to be characterized by multiple constraints and potential market failures, making
the impact of external intervention unclear. One of the motivations for public investment in micro-
lending was an anticipated negative impact on informal sector rates through competitive pressure
(Hoff and Stiglitz, 1990). The fact that high informal lending rates have continued to exist
alongside far lower-cost institutional credit has generated an extensive theoretical literature
exploring the interaction between formal and informal credit markets. Informal lenders are often
modeled as engaging in monopolistic competition (Hoff and Stiglitz, 1998). This allows room for
competition to bring down lending rates, but due largely to the information asymmetries that
characterize credit markets, the opposite result may also obtain.

An increase in lending rates could potentially arise through a number of channels. First, as noted
by Hoff and Stiglitz (1998) and echoed by Jain (1999), scale economies in lending could be eroded
by competition. A second possibility is that access to an outside lending option leads to moral
hazard among borrowers, increasing default risk and thus lending rates (Hoff and Stiglitz, 1998;
Kahn and Mookherjee, 2998; McIntosh and Wyndick, 2005). A third channel is through
composition of the pool of borrowers. If the new entrant is particularly good at identifying
borrowers with a low likelihood of default, one of the commonly assumed advantages of the joint
liability lending model used by SHGs and many other microfinance institutions (MFIs) (Ghatak,
1999), its entry could segment the market, driving up the average default risk of borrowers it does
not serve and thus rates in the rest of the market (Bose, 1998; Demont, 2016).1 Even if, as
suggested by the empirical findings of Maitra et al. (2014), borrowers facing higher informal rates
are more likely to take up a joint liability lending contract, Mookherjee and Motta (2016) show
how selection according to other observable borrower characteristics could lead to even higher
informal interest rates.

The mechanisms described above all require that informal and formal credit are substitutes. It is
also possible that due to differences in the terms of loans offered by traditional informal lenders
and new entrants, credit from these two sources could in fact be complements. Jain and Mansuri
(2003) develop a model in which the rigid repayment schedules imposed by MFIs lead households
to use loans from informal lenders to service these debts, potentially increases demand for informal
credit, and puts upward pressure on informal interest rates. On the other hand, if the loans offered
through the new entrant into the credit market provide borrowers facing repayment difficulties
with a way to service their informal debt, this could bring down the costs of debt collection (Aleem
1990), potentially reducing lending rates.

While the potential impacts have been extensively described in the theoretical literature, empirical
evidence on the impact of new lender entry on informal credit markets is comparatively thin. Three
previous studies have used the approach of instrumenting for MFI entry, either using
                                       																
																																								
1
 	While some prospective borrowers are actively screened out by MFIs and SHGs, capacity constraints may also limit
the number who can be covered through such programs. This implies that while average default risk among the pool
of borrowers from the informal market increases, there remain many low-risk borrowers within this pool.	
administrative targeting variables (Kaboski and Townsend, 2012) or the error structure of a
predictive model of entry (Mallick, 2012; Berg, Emran and Shilpi, 2015). Two of these studies,
both based on data from Bangladesh, find a positive impact of MFI entry on informal lending rates
(Mallick; Berg, Emran and Shilpi), though in the latter the effect is only significant when MFI
coverage rates are high. Kaboski and Townsend, using data from Thailand, find no statistically
significant impact on lending rates, but a small positive effect on the probability of default on other
loans. A fourth study uses panel data from the Indian state of Jharkhand, and finds an inverse U-
shaped relationship between SHG coverage and the rates charged by moneylenders, consistent
with a model in which the SHG lender has superior information on borrowers’ creditworthiness
and serves those with lower risk of default (Demont, 2016).

The identification of causal impacts in these studies relies on the assumption that community
characteristics associated with the entry of new lenders do not affect informal credit rates directly.
Given the multiple objectives of MFIs, which may include profit (or at least cost-recovery) as well
as a social mission to assist the poor, it is impossible to sign the direction of potential bias in
estimates from observational studies. The use of random assignment to a credit market intervention
permits causal inference based on a much weaker set of assumptions. However, previous
randomized evaluations of microcredit programs have not reported impacts on interest rates,
presumably due to a lack of power on this outcome. The present study, which is based on the
randomized roll-out of a government-led SHG program that offered microcredit and credit
linkages to formal banks to the poor across 179 panchayats2 in rural Bihar, overcomes this
limitation.

Critical to the identification strategy, the SHG intervention had a strong direct effect on household
use of informal credit. Just over two years after program initiation, households in panchayats
selected for early roll-out were 51 percentage points more likely to include a member who
belonged to an SHG than those in control areas. While borrowing from all sources increased
overall during the study period, new borrowing from informal lenders was 18% lower in program
panchayats compared to control areas, where households instead took advantage of the lower-
interest loans offered by SHGs. We find that this exogenous shock to informal credit markets


                                       																
																																								
2
    Village government units typically consisting of between two and four villages.
brought on by randomized SHG entry led to a fall of 3.8 percentage points in the average annual
informal borrowing rate on a base of 68.8 percent.

Program impacts are generally more pronounced for landless households than for those that own
land. Members of landless households were more likely to join an SHG and to take on more debt
through the program, and the decline in lending rates is driven by a reduction in the rates faced by
these households.

In addition to its unique contribution to understanding how the entry of a new lending institution
can affect informal credit markets, this study also contributes to the substantial recent literature
estimating household-level impacts of access to group-based lending (Desai and Joshi, 2014;
Angelucci et al, 2015; Attanasio et al., 2015; Banerjee et al., 2015; Crépon et al., 2015; Datta,
2015; Khanna, Kocchar and Palaniswamy, 2015). In general, this literature shows that even when
an expansion in access to credit results in households taking on more overall debt, impacts can be
quite limited in the short to medium run (Banerjee, Karlan and Zinman, 2015). While it is common
to see shifts in livelihood activities, typically away from wage labor and toward self-employment,
total household income is not generally affected. Similarly, impacts on overall consumption are
rare, while reallocation away from “discretionary” spending (temptation goods, entertainment, and
celebrations) is more commonly observed. Finally, there is scant evidence from RCTs that these
programs affect indicators of female empowerment.3

Given previous findings, it is not surprising that, in the short-run, Jeevika, which did not have a
significant impact on total borrowing, also did not lead to significant impacts on consumption
levels or on women’s economic or decision-making roles or capabilities. In the high-indebtedness
environment of rural Bihar, the primary impacts of the program were to shift a portion of
households’ debt burden from high-cost loans on which monthly rates averaged over 5 percent per
month, to much lower-cost SHG loans and to reduce the cost of borrowing from the informal
sector. The estimated impact of Jeevika on households’ debt servicing costs is economically
significant, but a longer time horizon may be required before this translates into measurable
changes in the consumption or asset positions of households, or in the empowerment of women

 	Non-experimental evidence based on regression discontinuity designs or propensity score matching have also not
shown any impact on income or consumption, but have shown substantial effects on women’s empowerment
(Khanna, Kocchar and Palaniswamy, 2015; Datta, 2015; Desai and Joshi 2014).	
(Sanyal, Rao and Majumdar, 2015).

      2. Setting and intervention

At the time the program was initiated, Bihar was home to 32 million people living below the
poverty line, and 66% of the rural population was landless (GoI, 2011). Rural Bihar had extremely
low rates of participation in microcredit through Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) or Self Help
Groups (SHGs) (World Bank, 2007). This prompted the Government of Bihar, with funding from
the World Bank, to implement the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project, also known as Jeevika, the
Hindi word for livelihood. The primary aim of Jeevika is to provide disadvantaged groups, in
particular the landless and members of Scheduled Castes, access to (relatively) low-cost credit.
When Jeevika enters a new village, Community Mobilizers employed through the program target
households living in particularly poor areas, and encourage the women in these households to form
self-help groups (SHGs) of 10 to 15 members. These groups then meet weekly, initially with a
Community Mobilizer, who leads members through a curriculum on women’s empowerment and
provides basic literacy and numeracy training.4 Members are required to contribute a minimum
of 2 rupees ($0.035 USD)5 each week toward a personal savings account held by the SHG. After
several weeks of demonstrating consistent savings, an SHG is eligible to join the local Village
Organization (VO), through which its members may access up to Rs. 50,000 (875 USD) in lending
capital. SHGs can borrow these funds from the VO at a non-compounding interest rate of 1% per
month, and SHG members may borrow at 2% per month. The mean credit available per SHG
member is approximately Rs. 4,000, assuming the average group size is halfway between the
allowable minimum and maximum number of members. VOs are further federated into Cluster
Level Federations (above the panchayat level), which then establish linkages to the formal banking
sector. Over the longer term, Jeevika is also meant to deliver other development interventions and
livelihoods training to SHG members, however these activities were not implemented in the study
area during the period spanned by data collection.

 USD equivalents are calculated using the average exchange rate from initiation of the program to the end of data
collection.
3.1 Experimental design

In order to evaluate the impacts of Jeevika, the rollout of the project was randomized across 180
panchayats, randomly selected from within 16 blocks in seven districts where Jeevika was
planning to scale up. In each of the study panchayats, one or two villages were then randomly
selected for data collection.

Since the intervention was targeted to poorer households, within each of the study villages, hamlets
in which the majority of the population belonged to a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe were
identified. Households were then randomly selected from these hamlets to be interviewed. A
baseline survey was administered during July to October of 2011 to 8,988 households across 333
villages in 179 panchayats.6 Following the baseline survey, panchayats were randomly assigned
to an early rollout group or a late rollout group, after stratifying the sample on administrative block
and the panchayat-level mean of outstanding high cost (monthly interest rate of 4% or higher) debt
held by households at baseline. The project began in the early rollout panchayats between January
and April 2012, and the follow-up survey was completed between July and September 2014.
Implementation in late rollout areas began after the 2014 round of data collection. Baseline and
follow-up surveys included detailed questions on debt, asset holdings, consumption expenditures,
livelihood activities, and women’s mobility, role in household decisions, and aspirations. In
addition, in each village, a focus group discussion was conducted, through which data were
collected on village-level attributes such as local sources of credit, interest rates from each source,
local wage rates, and the presence of or distance to markets and other institutions and amenities.

3.2 Analysis

The SHG intervention is expected to lead to a series of potential impacts, which we classify as
direct, indirect and downstream. One or more direct impacts (increased SHG membership;
increased utilization of credit though SHGs) is a necessary but insufficient condition for the
intervention to lead to indirect effects on informal credit markets. Changes in downstream
outcomes (wealth, consumption level, women’s empowerment) may follow from either direct or
indirect impacts.

    One of the selected Panchayats could not be surveyed due to political instability.
Based on the registered pre-analysis plan,7 we estimate the following ANCOVA specification to
test the reduced-form, intent-to-treat impact of Jeevika on each group of outcomes:

    !"#$%&'( = 	 +& + +' -../012$ + +% !"#$%&'' + +3 4"#$ + +( 5$ + 	 6"#$                                          (1)

         	
where !"#$7 is the outcome of interest for household 8 in village 9 in panchayat : in year ;,
-../012$ is random assignment of the panchayat to early (2012) rollout of the intervention, 4"#$
is a vector of pre-specified baseline controls used in the primary specification, 5$ represents the
vector of stratification dummies, and 6"#$ is a random individual-level error (notation constant
across specifications for simplicity). In addition, to test for heterogeneous treatment effects on

households that were landless at baseline, we estimate specification (2):8

    !"#$%&'( = 	 <& + <' -../012$ + <% =="#$ + <3 =="#$ ∗ -../012$ + <( !"#$%&''                                     (2)

                    + <? 4"#$ + <@ 5$ + 	 6"#$

        	
where <' represents the treatment effect on land holding households, <% is the difference in

outcome ! between landed and landless households in control areas at follow-up, <' + 	 <3 is the

treatment effect on landless households, and <% + 	 <3 is the difference in the outcome between the

landed and landless at follow-up in the presence of the intervention.


Specifications (3) and (4) below mirror those above aside from the omission of non-stratification

baseline controls, and are used to test for balance on key outcomes and demographic variables at

baseline.


    !"#$%&'' = 	 A& + A' -../012$ + A% 5$ + 	 6"#$                                                                        (3)

 Analysis of heterogeneous effects based on both baseline landholdings and caste was specified in the pre-analysis
plan for this study. There is significant overlap between the landless and SC/ST populations in the sample, and impacts
on SC/ST households are very similar to impacts on the landless.
 !"#$%&'' = 	 B& + B' -../012$ + B% =="#$ + B3 =="#$ ∗ -../012$ + B( !"#$%&'' + B? 5$                   (4)

Huber-White clustering of standard errors at the panchayat level is employed in all specifications.
Since we test multiple hypotheses, many of which are closely related, we follow the earlier
literature and include regressions of indices for each family of outcomes (as in Kling, Liebman,
and Katz, 2007).9 P-values for these regressions are calculated using the step-down procedure in
Hochberg (1988), which controls the family-wise error rate across all indices.




        4. Results

4.1 Baseline credit access by landholding status

We begin the analysis with a description of credit use and costs, assets, and welfare indicators by
landholding status at baseline. As shown in Table 1, landless households are more likely to hold
any debt than those with land. They also have a larger number of loans than landowning
households, but a lower mean level of outstanding debt, implying a smaller average loan size. This
pattern echoes Banerjee and Duflo’s (2010) discussion of the high administrative cost of lending
to the poor. Indeed, the debt held by landless households is more expensive. Despite a lower overall
level of indebtedness, landless households hold slightly more debt on which the monthly interest
rate is 4% or higher, defined by Jeevika as “high-cost debt”. The mean (simple) monthly interest
rate paid by the landless is half a percentage point higher than that paid by landholding households,
indicating an annual difference of 6 percentage points.10 Given the mean level of indebtedness,
this difference implies an additional debt servicing cost of 569 Rs per annum, equivalent to 61.5%
of the mean monthly consumption expenditure among the landless.

We also see that landless households have fewer interest-free loans. This suggests that informal

                                       																
																																								
9	
     See, for example, Banerjee et al. (2015).	
10
      Interest rates are generally non-compounding in this setting.
risk-sharing mechanisms (which typically operate through gift giving or interest-free loans) are
less available to landless households than to other households. Finally, the last four rows of Table
1 show that landless households are also economically disadvantaged in terms of their ownership
of productive assets aside from land, and have lower material well-being in terms of ownership of
durable consumption goods, housing quality, and consumption expenditures.

4.2 Balance at baseline

In order to establish the validity of the randomized assignment to early rollout, we test for pre-
treatment balance across treatment and control groups in the primary outcomes of interest, as
specified in the pre-analysis plan, and other important household characteristics. Differences in
means for each variable are estimated through linear regressions in which controls for stratification
variables are included and standard errors are clustered at the panchayat level. Results, shown in
table A1 (column 1), indicate that households in treatment areas are 2 percentage points more
likely to include an SHG member. This difference, while small, is significantly different from zero
at the 5% level. Relatedly, the mean outstanding SHG debt is also higher in treatment areas at the
5% level, though the difference is small in economic terms (50 rupees). Monthly interest rates
measured at the household level are higher in treatment areas, and this appears to be driven by
informal lending rates. Informal lending rates measured in the FGD data, on the other hand, are
well balanced. An index of productive assets, constructed according to the method proposed in
Filmer and Pritchett (2001), is 0.1 points lower (0.06 of a standard deviation) in treatment areas as
well. We also test for differences among landless and landed households in treatment versus
control areas (columns 2 and 3). Again, we find small differences in SHG enrollment and debt,
and in asset holdings across treatment and control groups. The difference in interest rates reported
at the household level appears to be driven by landless households. Attrition, at 3%, is low given
the three-year interval between surveys, and does not differ between treatment and control areas.

4.3 Direct impacts: SHG membership and borrowing

Table 2 presents estimates of the impact of access to Jeevika on SHG membership and outstanding
debt to SHGs; overall loans taken, amount borrowed and interest rates. Results shown in columns
1 and 2 of Panel A indicate that over 60% of households in treatment areas had at least one member
in a self-help group by follow-up, compared to 10% of households in control areas. Given the
higher interest rates and lower use of credit among the landless at baseline, landless households
had the most to gain through participation in Jeevika. Consistent with this, we find that take-up of
the program is more pronounced among these households, who were 11 percentage points more
likely to belong to an SHG than landowning households in program areas (Panel B).

While the program appears to have had a slight negative impact (Rs. 860, p<0.1) on the total
amount of outstanding household debt (column 3), we see a significant increase of close to Rs.
2,000 in the value of debt owed to SHGs (column 4), and an offsetting decrease in loans from
informal sources of credit (Table 3, column 2).11 Scaling the increase in SHG debt by program-
induced SHG membership, this result implies that 96% of the lending capital initially transferred
to groups through Jeevika had been extended as credit to households by the time of the follow-up
survey.

The magnitude of first-order program effects differs by landholding status. The increase in SHG
debt is higher among the landless than the landed by Rs. 390. In contrast, the negative impact of
the program on new informal debt is twice as large among land-owning households (Table 3,
column 3, panel B), reflecting lower baseline borrowing among the landless. The large decrease
in informal borrowing among landholding households exceeds the expansion in loans taken
through SHGs by these households, resulting in a marginally significant negative estimate of the
program effect on overall indebtedness for this subsample (Table 2, column 3), and a significant
decrease in overall borrowing over the past year (column 7). For landless households, on the other
hand, the expansion in SHG borrowing exceeds the decline in informal borrowing, resulting in a
positive (but not significant) point estimate on total new borrowing. The lack of an impact on total
borrowing overall suggests that on average, the study population was not credit constrained prior
to the intervention.

The substitution of credit source from informal moneylenders to Jeevika results in a marked
decline in the average interest rate on households’ outstanding debt, and in the amount of debt for
which the monthly rate is 4% per month or higher. On average, such “high cost” debt is Rs. 1,880

  Informal sources include moneylenders, shopkeepers, neighbors, friends, relatives, chit funds, casual employers,
casual employees and village temples. We exclude interest free loans, which likely reflect informal risk-sharing
mechanisms rather than the informal credit market.
lower in treatment areas by the endline, a 14.5% reduction relative to control panchayats. Credit
was offered through Jeevika SHGs at a monthly rate of 2%, less than half the mean baseline
informal lending rate. Together with the high levels of loan take-up through the program, this
implies a strong direct impact on the average interest rate paid by households on recent loans.
Mean monthly rates paid on all loans taken within the past 12 months were a close to a full
percentage point lower in program areas, a reduction of 16.5% compared to control panchayats.12
The impact on interest rates is especially pronounced for landless households, who faced higher
rates at baseline. Jeevika reduces the difference in average borrowing rates on new loans faced by
landholding and landless households by 73% (Table 2, panel B, column 6).

We also see in column 2 that access to Jeevika resulted in a 4 percentage point increase in the
number of households borrowing at all, indicating impacts on the extensive margin apart from the
intensive margin discussed above. This is consistent with findings in Mexico by Karlan,
Mullainathan and Zinman (2009), that price reductions lead to more borrowers as well as larger
loan sizes.

4.4 Indirect impacts: Informal credit markets

Despite the significant resources made available for household borrowing through Jeevika, and the
high take-up of the program, even in program areas 65% of the increase in outstanding debt
between the baseline and follow-up surveys was from informal lenders. This underscores the
importance of understanding the impact of this and other microcredit interventions on the informal
credit market.

As seen in Table 3 (column 4), our results indicate that Jeevika led to a reduction of 0.12 in the
average monthly lending rate paid by households on loans taken from informal lenders over the
past year (p<0.1). This impact is driven entirely by the program’s effect on landless households,
for which the estimated impact is a reduction of 0.19% per month (p<0.05). This reduction
represents 40% of the gap in informal monthly borrowing rates between landless and landholding
households in non-program areas.

The estimated impact of Jeevika on informal interest rates using household-level data includes

                                       																
																																								
12
     The household average interest rate excludes any interest free loans.
effects of the program on the composition or assumed composition of borrowers. If, as posited by
Demont, the lowest-risk borrowers are able to obtain loans through Jeevika, informal lenders are
left with a higher-risk pool of clients, pushing up average informal lending rates. The interest rate
paid on informal loans at baseline is uncorrelated with take-up of SHG credit by endline among
landless households in our data, after controlling for the same set of baseline controls used in the
estimation of treatment effects (coefficient = -0.003, p-value = 0.960). However, we cannot rule
out the possibility that lenders’ assumptions about prospective borrowers could be affected by
Jeevika’s entry. Indeed, splitting the sample by ‘repeat borrowers’ – those who had taken out a
loan in the year prior to the baseline survey, versus new borrowers, we see that the negative impact
on rates was entirely due to the impact on repeat borrowers (Table 3, column 5). This finding is
consistent with lenders treating unknown borrowers with greater suspicion when joint-liability
loans are widely available.

Village-level focus group discussions were used to elicit the publicly known ‘going rate’ for
informal credit, and are thus expected to be less affected by the composition of borrowers. The
point estimate of the intervention’s impact on interest rates using these village-level data is indeed
larger than that obtained using household reports, and is significant at the 10 percent level despite
reduced power to detect impacts at the village level (Table 3, column 7, Panel A).13 The effect on
rates is concentrated among those charged by professional moneylenders (as opposed to friends
and relatives), though restricting loans to this group reduces number of observations and the effect
is no longer statistically significant (column 8). The number of informal credit sources listed in
the village-level survey shows a decline in Jeevika areas (Panel B, column 7). This is driven by
fewer friends and relatives listed as sources of credit (column 8); there is no significant impact on
the number of professional moneylenders or shopkeepers (column 9).

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of monthly informal lender rates reported at the village level
by treatment group pre- and post-intervention. The 2% lending rate offered by Jeevika is barely
represented, providing confidence that the estimated impact of the program on this outcome is not
driven by misclassification of SHG loans as informal loans.


                                       																
																																								
13
  Controls in this case are village-level means of the household-level baseline variables included in the models with
household-level outcomes. For villages with no rate recorded at baseline, the mean rate at the panchayat (16
observations) or district (2 observations) level is used. 	
Two of the potential mechanisms described above are consistent with the combination of reduced
demand for informal credit and lower interest rates: a decrease in the administrative costs
associated with lending due to the use of SHG credit to service informal debt, and increased
competitive pressure in the context of a market in which lenders exercise market power.14
Household data on use of loans at endline indicate that only 2.8% of SHG loans in treatment areas,
and 2.4% in control areas, were used for debt service, casting doubt that this mechanism plays a
major role, and leaving a reduction in market power as the most convincing explanation.

4.5 Downstream impacts: Assets, consumption and women’s empowerment

While Jeevika had immediate and dramatic effects on credit markets in targeted villages, we see
more limited short-term impacts on household asset possession, material well-being or various
measures of women’s economic and social empowerment (Tables 4 and 5). We do see significant
positive effects of the program on asset holdings among landless households (Table 4).
Consumption assets, productive assets, and housing quality are all significantly affected within
this sub-group.

The program’s effect on women’s empowerment is less clear. We see a positive impact on an index
of collective action, but a negative impact on women’s role in decision-making within the
household (both p<0.1). These two effects cancel each other out in the aggregated index for this
family of outcomes, resulting in an estimated family-wise treatment effect of zero.

4.6 Robustness tests

In the presence of a baseline difference in outcomes, the ANCOVA estimator is generally less
biased than either the simple difference or difference-in-difference estimators, which tend to
under- or over- correct for the baseline difference respectively (Frison and Pocock, 1992). We
present these two alternative estimators as upper and lower bounds of the true effect in Tables A2
through A5. Treatment effects are similar in magnitude and significance under these alternative


                                       																
																																								
14
  A third potential mechanism is that the cost of informal lending falls as demand shrinks due to increasing
marginal costs. This however is at odds with evidence about the cost structure of informal lending, which is
characterized by large fixed costs and not generally limited by availability of lending capital (Aleem, 1990). The fact
that demand for informal credit falls most dramatically among landowners, but the decrease in interest rates is
driven by landless households, provides additional evidence against this mechanism.
specifications. The results from the simple difference estimators (A3, panels A and B, column 4)
provide reassurance in particular for the validity of the interest rate results, since baseline rates are
imbalanced at baseline in the opposite direction as the estimated treatment effect.

5. Discussion

Chronic indebtedness and exploitative moneylenders are well-established tropes in the fictional
and cinematic accounts of poverty in rural India. Several studies, including an important recent
survey by the National Sample Survey (NSS, 2014) and technical papers by the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI 2007, RBI 2011) have documented the widespread reliance of rural households on
high-cost debt from the informal sector at rates of up to 150 percent per annum. Over the past two
decades, micro-finance institutions have rapidly expanded into markets previously served almost
exclusively by traditional moneylenders. One would expect this influx of competition to affect
existing credit markets, but the nature of these impacts is not obvious ex ante.

The limited empirical literature on this question consists of observational studies and finds zero or
positive impacts on lending rates charged by informal sector lenders. Despite the existence of a
large literature on the impact of micro-credit programs, no randomized impact evaluation to date
has documented a significant effect on interest rates. This is the first study to do so. The
randomized roll-out evaluated in this study, conducted in seven of the 38 districts of Bihar,
increased self-help group (SHG) membership by 50 percentage points. Those who joined a Jeevika
SHG shifted almost 30% of their household debt from high-interest informal sources to Jeevika,
on average. The massive influx of relatively low-cost credit extended through Jeevika allows us
to detect, for the first time, the impact of a micro-finance intervention on informal credit markets
through a randomized evaluation.

At baseline, annual informal interest rates paid by landless households were an average of 6.1
percentage points per year higher than those paid by the landed. SHG entry caused a shift in the
informal lending rate offered to these households that reduced this gap by approximately 40%,
while the point estimate of the impact on rates paid by landowning households is close to zero and
not statistically significant. The fact that the impact on lending rates is limited to the economically
marginalized is indicative of the segmented nature of credit markets in this context.
Using the impact on the overall informal interest rate based on the focus group data (-0.32% per
month), and assuming that households’ informal debt can eventually be refinanced at the lower
prevailing rate, we estimate that Jeevika will reduce the average cost of servicing debt to informal
creditors by Rs. 624, equivalent to 90% of the mean monthly reported consumption expenditure
in this sample. The magnitude of this effect is comparable to the direct average annual savings of
Rs. 886 achieved by shifting a portion of household debt out of the high-cost informal sector to
lower-cost SHG loans.

Two years after initiation of the program, a significant impact on the asset position of landless
households was already observed. No impact on consumption expenditures was seen, and only
weak and conflicting effects on various measures of women’s empowerment were seen. Given that
the intervention reduced debt servicing costs substantially, it is possible that asset impacts will
strengthen with time, and that other downstream impacts may still arise.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the panchayat level shown in parentheses. Coefficients are from an ANCOVA specification - linear regressions of each outcome on its value at baseline, and an
indicator of treatment status; panel B has linear regressions of each outcome on indicators of treatment status, landessness, and their interaction. Stratification dummies and baseline controls († in
Table A1) are included in all specifications. Landless status is landlessness at the time of the baseline survey.

Columns 9 presents coefficients in a regression of z-scores of the outcome variables in this "family" - SHG membership, any loans taken, all outstanding debt, outstanding SHG debt, outstanding
High-cost debt, interest rates, total amount borrowed last year, SHG amount borrowed last year - following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). p-values for these regressions are reported using
Hochberg's step-down method to control the FWER across all index outcomes.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the panchayat level shown in parentheses. Coefficients are from an ANCOVA specification - linear regressions of each outcome on its value at baseline, and an indicator of treatment status;
panel B has linear regressions of each outcome on indicators of treatment status, landessness, and their interaction. Stratification dummies and baseline controls († in Table A1) are included in all specifications. Landless status is
landlessness at the time of the baseline survey. Village level regressions are from a separate village focus group discussion dataset.

Column 6 presents coefficients in a regression of z-scores of the outcome variables in this "family" - any loans taken, outstanding debt, new loans, interest rates - following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). p-values for these
regressions are reported using Hochberg's step-down method to control the FWER across all index outcomes.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the panchayat level are shown in parentheses. Coefficients are from an ANCOVA specification - linear regressions of each
outcome on its value at baseline, and an indicator of treatment status (plus an indicator of landessness at baseline and its interaction with treatment status in
Panel B). Stratification dummies and baseline controls († in Table A1) are included in all specifications.


Columns 6 presents coefficients in a regression of z-scores of the outcome variables in this "family" - consumption assets, productive assets, housing quality,
access to entitlements, real consumption per adult equivalent - following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). p-values for these regressions are reported using
Hochberg's step-down method to control the FWER across all index outcomes.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the panchayat level shown in parentheses. Coefficients are from an ANCOVA specification - linear regressions of each
outcome on its value at baseline, and an indicator of treatment status; panel B has linear regressions of each outcome on indicators of treatment status,
landessness, and their interaction. All specifications control for block dummies and mean high cost debt at the panchayat level at baseline. Additional
controls († in Table 1) are included in even-numbered columns. Landless status is landlessness at the time of the baseline survey.

Column 6 presents coefficients in a regression of z-scores of the outcome variables in this "family" - working women, decision making, collective action,
mobility, aspirations - following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). p-values for these regressions are reported using Hochberg's step-down method to control
the FWER across all index outcomes.

Notes: Adjusted differences in means across treatment groups and their standard errors (clustered at the panchayat level) are from separate linear regressions of each baseline variable on
an indicator of treatment status, with controls for stratification variables (block dummies and panchayat mean high cost debt). The result for outstanding high cost debt is from a
regression with the same specification as described previously, excluding the control for baseline panchayat high cost debt in order to avoid over-fitting. Outcomes marked with † are
primary outcomes of interest according to the pre-analysis plan, and are used as controls in later regressions as specified in the plan. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05; *** p<0.01

Notes: Adjusted differences in means across treatment groups and their standard errors (clustered at the panchayat level) are from separate linear regressions of each baseline
variable on an indicator of treatment status, with controls for stratification variables (block dummies and panchayat mean high cost debt). The result for outstanding high cost debt
is from a regression with the same specification as described previously, excluding the control for baseline panchayat high cost debt in order to avoid over-fitting. Outcomes marked
with † are primary outcomes of interest according to the pre-analysis plan, and are used as controls in later regressions as specified in the plan. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05; *** p<0.01

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the panchayat level are shown in parentheses. Coefficients are from an ANCOVA specification - linear regressions of each
outcome on its value at baseline, and an indicator of treatment status (plus an indicator of landessness at baseline and its interaction with treatment status in Panel B).
Stratification dummies are included in all specifications.

Columns 9 presents coefficients in a regression of z-scores of the outcome variables in this "family" - SHG membership, any loans taken, all outstanding debt,
outstanding SHG debt, outstanding High-cost debt, interest rates, total amount borrowed last year, SHG amount borrowed last year - following Kling, Liebman, and
Katz (2007). p-values for these regressions are reported using Hochberg's step-down method to control the FWER across all index outcomes.

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the panchayat level are shown in parentheses. Coefficients are from an ANCOVA specification - linear regressions
of each outcome on its value at baseline, and an indicator of treatment status (plus an indicator of landessness at baseline and its interaction with
treatment status in Panel B). Stratification dummies are included in all specifications.

Column 6 presents coefficients in a regression of z-scores of the outcome variables in this "family" - working women, decision making, collective
action, mobility, aspirations - following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). p-values for these regressions are reported using Hochberg's step-down
method to control the FWER across all index outcomes.
