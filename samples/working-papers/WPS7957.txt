Recent developments in the oil market are nothing short of spectacular. The West
Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price has fallen from over $100 per barrel in mid-
2014 to around $30 per barrel in February 2016. Since then, it has recovered to
around $50 a barrel as of December 2016 (Figure 1). No one knows if we have seen
the bottom of oil prices, or this recovery is only temporary.

A concerning observation in financial markets is that recently, stock prices and oil
price tend to rise and fall together. Conventional wisdom suggests that a cheaper
oil price benefits oil-importing economies, such as the U.S., because of lower
production costs for industries and lower fuel costs for households. However, lower
oil prices could hurt the oil and gas sector and transmit to financial markets, which
could then propagate damages to the real economy via finance-macro linkages
(Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997; Bernanke et al, 1999). Thus, it is possible for the
negative effects of lower oil prices to outweigh their benefits. Indeed, many policy
makers are concerned about potential systemic risk that the recent declines in oil
prices may cause (for example, see IMF, 2015 and Bernanke, 2016).

In this paper, we investigate the causal impact of oil price fluctuations on U.S. and
international financial markets from January 2014 until October 2016. Quantifying
the causal impacts of oil prices on the financial markets is not straightforward. We
do not know if oil prices affect stock prices, stock prices affect oil prices, or both
are driven by a third factor such as the expectation about future economic growth.
To overcome the issue of endogeneity, we use a heteroscedasticity-based event
study approach, following Rigobon (2003) and Rigobon and Sack (2004).
Specifically, we instrument for changes in oil prices with exogenous shocks that
mainly affect oil supply. The window for our event study is one day. The detailed
description of the events is discussed in section II.

There are three main findings. First, for the U.S. financial markets, we find that a
lower WTI oil price hurts risky assets (stocks and high-yield bonds), lifts safe assets
(investment grade bonds and long term Treasury bonds), and raises the market’s
future volatility (the VIX index). A 10% decline in the WTI oil price lowers the
U.S. stock market index by about 1.2% and high-yield corporate bonds by 0.41%.
The same decline raises investment-grade bonds by 0.31%, long-term Treasury
bonds by 1.2%, and the VIX index by 9.1%. Second, a 10% decrease in oil price
boosts the value of the U.S. dollar by 0.41% and hurts equity markets in emerging
countries by 1.32%. Third, we examine the impact of oil price fluctuations on
different sectors. As expected, lower oil prices adversely affect the energy sector.
Remarkably, the declines in oil prices hurt basic materials, transport and industrials,
sectors that supposedly benefit from lower oil prices.

Our paper complements the empirical literature on the impact of oil prices on
financial markets and on oil-exporting countries. The existing literature finds either
a positive2 or a non-significant impact of oil price declines on advanced countries’

stock markets.3 Additionally, some studies find that oil price declines hurt the oil
and gas sector and oil exporting countries.4 The vast majority of the empirical
literature uses different VAR frameworks with various identification assumptions.

Our study’s contribution is twofold. First, instead of using the traditional VAR
approach, we use a heteroscedasticity-based event study approach, developed by
Rigobon (2003). This event-study approach helps mitigate the concern about
omitted variables and reverse causality. Second, we examine the recent episode of
oil’s steep decline (January 2014 to October 2016). We find that the declines in oil
prices during this period have systemic negative impacts on financial markets, a
finding not seen in the existing literature.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II explains the identification
strategy and oil-supply events. Section III describes data sources. Section IV
presents the results for the U.S. financial market. Section V presents the results for
emerging markets. Section VI discusses potential channels of the transmission.
Section VII concludes.

    Hammoudeh et al. (2004) find none of the daily oil industry stock indices can explain the daily
future movements of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures prices. Kilian and Park
(2009) find that oil supply shocks have no significant effect on the U.S. stock market. Apergis and
Miller (2009) find that international stock market returns do not respond significantly to oil price
shocks. Kilian (2009) decomposes shocks to oil prices to oil supply shocks, global demand shocks
and crude oil specific demand shocks. He finds that the surge in oil prices between 2003-2007 was
caused by global demand shocks and hence did not cause a major recession in the U.S.

    Park and Ratti (2008) find that while oil price increases have a negative impact on stock returns in
the US and in 12 European countries, they have positive impacts on the stock market in Norway, an
oil-exporting country. Boyer and Filion (2007) show that increases in the price of oil affect the stock
returns of Canadian oil and gas companies positively. El-Sharif et al. (2005) reach a similar
conclusion for oil and gas returns in the UK.

                                   II.        Methodology

We identify the effect of changes in oil prices on prices of various asset classes
through a heteroscedasticity-based identification strategy, following Rigobon
(2003) as well as Rigobon and Sack (2004). Consider the following system of
equations:

                        ∆        ∆                                   (1)
                        ∆        ∆                                   (2)
where ∆      is the change in oil prices, ∆        the change in asset price, and    a set of
common factors that could affect both oil prices and stock prices (such as interest
rates, news about global growth or other demand-side factors).                represents oil
shocks that only directly affect oil prices.          captures events that affect oil supply,
such as a North Sea storm that forces oil firms to evacuate platforms. Similarly,
are the idiosyncratic shocks that only directly affect stock prices. Our goal is to
estimate the value of : the causal impacts of changes in oil prices on changes in
stock prices. Note that in this framework, the effects of oil price increases or
decreases are symmetric.

We divide the days in our sample into two types of days, event (E) and non-event
(N) days. We identify 28 days between 01/01/2014 to 10/15/2016 with important
announcements and developments about oil supply as event days. A useful feature
of the approach is that it does not require the complete absence of common shocks
during event days. This strategy instead relies on the identifying assumption that
the variances of the common shocks             and financial shocks         are the same on
non-event days and event days, whereas the variance of oil supply shocks                  	is
higher on event days than non-event days: 	

                                     ,         ,        (3)
                                     ,            ,     (4)
                                     ,         ,        (5)




                                              6
 
These assumptions imply that the “importance” of oil supply-side announcements
increases on event days (E). Again, it is important to note that demand factors can
take place on event days, as long as the influence of demand factors is similar to
that on non-event days. As argued by Rigobon and Sack (2004), these assumptions
are much weaker than those required in traditional event-study approach.

Under such assumptions, we can identify parameter                                               by comparing the covariance
matrices of stock price and oil price changes on event days and non-event days. In
particular, for each of the two types of days                                              ∈      ,     , we can estimate the
covariance matrix of ∆ , ∆                                     , denoted Ω :

                                                             ∆                          ∆ ,∆
                                  Ω                                                                           (6)
                                            		          ∆ ,∆                             ∆

Rigobon and Sack (2004) show that the difference in the covariance matrices on
event and non-event days as ∆Ω=Ω                                               Ω :

                                                        ,          ,
                                         ∆Ω =	                         	                                (7)
                                                                                    1
From (7),               can be estimated as
                                                         ∆Ω ,
                                                                                                 (8)5
                                                         ∆Ω ,

which from (6), (8) can be written as:
                                                                       ∆ ,∆                    ∆ ,∆
                                                                          ∆                    ∆

The numerator captures the difference between the covariance of oil prices and
stock prices for event days and non-event days. If the covariance for event days is
the same as that for non-event days, the relationship between oil prices and stock

                                                            
                            ∆Ω ,                               ∆Ω ,
5
     We choose                       instead of                        because the latter estimate is problematic. Under the null
                            ∆Ω ,                               ∆Ω ,
hypothesis of                 0, both the numerator ∆Ω                     ,   and the denominator ∆Ω    ,    are zero. In other words,
                                                            ∆Ω ,
under the null hypothesis, the ratio                               	is undetermined.  
                                                            ∆Ω ,




                                                                                7
 
prices is driven only by common shocks,                  . Hence, the causal impact of oil price
on stock price, , would be zero.

Empirically, the approach can be implemented through an instrumental variable
estimation technique. As such, we define vectors ∆                      and ∆     with size     1 to
contain the log changes in asset prices and oil prices on the event days, and vectors
∆       and ∆      with size       1 to contain the log changes in asset prices and oil
prices on the non-event days. We then combine the two subsamples into two (
    	       1 vectors that contain the log changes in asset prices and oil prices in our
sample, ∆           ∆ 			∆     and ∆          ∆        			∆     ′	.

Consider the following instrument:

                                   ∆   			                       ∆
                                             																                ′	

where        is the number of explanatory variables.                  can be estimated by regressing
the log change in asset prices ∆ on the log change in oil prices over the sample
period using the standard instrumental variable approach, with the instrument                     :

                                               ∆                ∆

Simple algebra shows that the estimated value of                       is asymptotically identical to
the following:

The regression equation is therefore as follows:

where ∆         is the log change in asset prices (i.e. stock prices and bond prices);
        ∆     is the log change in the WTI oil price, instrumented by w; and ∆                   and

We present regular standard errors in our main results section, and bootstrap

                                                   Identifying oil-supply events

Identifying oil-supply events is challenging. There is not a fixed calendar for oil-
supply events, so one has to screen these days from financial news. Since there are
multiple events that could happen in those days, it is not certain that oil supply news
drives oil prices.

We employ several rounds of screening to identify oil-supply events. In the first
round, we use the Seeking Alpha news portal (www.seekingalpha.com).7 Seeking
Alpha records all surprising events and announcements that arguably affect the oil
supply. They range from surprising announcements by OPEC officials and OPEC
member countries to unexpected developments in key oil exporters. From 1/1/2014
to 10/15/2016, we record 29 events. The window for our event study is one day.
For announcements that happen after trading hours, we examine the change in
financial markets on the following trading day. These dates are shown in Table A1
in the Appendix, along with links to in-depth financial news discussing the events.

There could be concerns with this list. The first potential problem is that recorded
events could reflect ad-hoc ex-post explanations of the analysts. For example, an
analyst could see oil prices drop during the day and look for news about oil supply

  Seeking Alpha is a community-based platform for investment research, with broad coverage of
stocks, asset classes, ETFs and investment strategy. In contrast to other equity research platforms,
insight is provided by investors and industry experts rather than sell-side analysts. Seeking Alpha
has 4M registered users (48% YOY growth). Over 18.5% of the audience are financial
professionals. 




                                                                 9
 
that could explain that event. This would be a problem if oil prices drop because of
demand factors but the analysts interpret this as supply driven.

We minimize this possibility by not considering the days that have important
demand announcements recorded by Seeking Alpha analysts. We also do not
consider announcements about U.S. oil inventories because oil inventories could
reflect both supply and demand factors. Furthermore, we also cross check with
independent economic calendars to see if there are important surprising demand
announcements in the 29 event days. We removed 4/12/2015 as there were
numerous Fed speeches (Harker, Dudley, Bullard, Kocherlakota spoke at the “The
New Normal for the U.S. Economy” forum hosted by the Philadelphia Fed), as well
as the one by ECB President. Thus, we have 28 event dates.

To increase our confidence that these 28 days are primarily supply events, we also
use U.S. news coverage to provide a check. We use www.newslibrary.com to count
how many articles with the words “economy” or “economic growth” appear in 526
U.S. national news outlets. The number of the articles represents how intensively
news about the economy, or “demand news”, is covered. The assumption is that the
higher the count for a day, the more significant demand news is for that day. We
collect article counts for all the days since 1/1/2014. We check econometrically if
the average article count for those 28 event days is higher or lower than that for the
non-event days. Table 2.1 shows that the average count is marginally smaller on
the event days than the non-event days, indicating that demand factors are
marginally smaller in the events days.

The second potential problem is that OPEC announcements could reflect worries
about oil demand by OPEC. For example, an announcement that OPEC countries
will be meeting to cut production could reflect their worry that demand for oil is
low. Should we treat this announcement as an event about oil supply cut or oil
demand decline? The reaction of oil prices in the market could help us answer this
question. An oil demand decline shifts the demand curve for oil to the left, reducing
its price. A cut in oil production shifts the supply curve for oil to the left, raising its
price. The equilibrium price depends on how much the demand and supply curves
shift and the relative magnitude of price elasticity of demand and supply. According
to Kilian and Murphy (2014) and Hamilton (2009), the price elasticity of oil
demand in the short run ranges from -0.26 to 0, and the price elasticity of oil supply
in the short run is nearly 0. Thus, the magnitude of the short-run price elasticity of
supply is not greater than that of demand for oil. This implies that a rise in oil prices
following an event OPEC announcement to cut production should reflect a supply
shock. Let us take an extreme example where the supply curve for oil is almost
vertical and the demand curve for oil is almost horizontal. In this case, if we see an
increase in oil prices, the supply curve must shift to the left much more than the
demand curve, indicating that people perceive the news about the production cut




                                            11
 
by OPEC as a supply event. In our 28 events, the reactions to the WTI oil price all
indicate that the events are supply driven.

The third concern is that some of the geopolitical events (such as ISIS making
advances in Iraq) could generate uncertainty, which is a demand factor. We argue
that demand factors, if any, are weaker than the supply factors, by observing the
price action. Take the example of ISIS making advances in Iraq: uncertainty would
cause oil prices to go down, while the negative supply shock associated with the
ISIS disruptions would cause oil prices to go up. In the equilibrium, we observe an
increase in oil prices. Following the same logic about the shifts in demand and
supply and the price elasticity of demand and supply for oils in the short run, we
argue that oil supply shocks dominate demand shocks in these types of events.

For the heteroskedastic-based strategy to work, the changes in oil price on event
days have to be larger than the changes on non-event days.8 Table 2.2 shows the
results of several test statistics to confirm that the variance of the log change in the
WTI oil price for the event days is larger than that for the non-event days.

Our period of analysis spans 1/1/2014 to 10/15/2016. Overall, we have 700 trading
days, and hence 699 observations. We obtain daily the WTI crude oil price from
the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The WTI crude is chosen instead of
Brent because WTI is the main benchmark for oil consumed in the United States.
The WTI refers to oil extracted from wells in the U.S. and sent via pipelines to
Cushing, Oklahoma10.

We use the Dow Jones U.S. Market Index (DJUS), which represents about 95% of
the U.S. market, to capture U.S. equity. We use the Bloomberg bond indices for
bond prices. Daily historical Dow Jones U.S. Market indices, Bloomberg High-
Yield Bond Indices and Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Indices (investment
grade) are obtained from Bloomberg. The 10 sectoral stock indices from Dow Jones
are Basic Materials, Consumer Goods, Consumer Services, Financials, Healthcare,
Industrials, Energy, Tech, Telecom, and Utilities.11 These 10 indices together make
up the Dow Jones U.S. Market Index. In addition, we also examine two important
subsectors: transportation and airlines.12 The S&P 500 and its sectoral indices serve
as a robustness check.

The Bloomberg investment-grade corporate bonds are the aggregate index,
Healthcare, Tech, Materials, Financials, Communication, Consumer Discretionary,
Utilities, Industrials, Consumer Services and Energy.13 Similarly, the Bloomberg
high-yield corporate bond indices are the aggregate high-yield corporate bond

days on average are larger than those in non-event days. For example, the standard
deviation of the log change in WTI oil price in event days is 0.0441, about twice as
much for that in non-event days (0.0255). We formally tested for this difference in
Table 2.2.

This section presents the effects of oil price fluctuations in the US market. Note
that in this setup, the impacts of oil increases or decreases on financial markets are
symmetric. Hence, we could interpret the coefficients as the impacts of either an
oil price increase or decline. Here, for brevity, we choose to interpret the
coefficients as the impacts of oil price declines. Table 4.1 shows that the decline in
WTI oil price hurts U.S. risky assets, measured by overall stock and the high-yield
bond indices, while benefiting safe assets, specifically, investment-grade bond and
long-term 20+ year Treasury bonds (TLT). A 10% decrease in oil price leads to a
1.2% decrease in the Dow Jones U.S. market index. We find a similar result when
using S&P 500 index as an alternative broad-based stock index. In addition, a 10%
decrease in WTI oil price leads to a 0.41% decrease in the high-yield bond index.
At the same time, investment-grade corporate bonds increase by 0.31%, and TLT
increases by 1.19%.

Table 4.2 reports the persistence of the impact of the oil shocks. We consider the
log change in the stock and bond indices one, two and three days after the event
days. We find that oil price declines still affect high-yield bonds three days after
the events. However, we find no evidence for the persistent impact of oil prices on
stocks, investment-grade bonds, and Treasury bonds.

To address the potential concern about the small sample of event days, we do two
things. First, we test for the normality of the regression residuals and second, we
apply bootstrapping to the baseline regressions. We find that the results remain

unchanged: lower oil prices hurt stock and high-yield bond indices, and help
investment-grade and long-term Treasury bonds. The details of the bootstrapped
regressions are shown in Appendix B.

                                     On volatility

This section examines the impacts of oil price fluctuations on uncertainty, proxied
by the log of the VIX index. VIX is a popular measure of the market’s expectation
of stock volatility over the next 30-day period. Table 4.3 reveals that volatility hiked 
by 9.09% for every 10% decline in WTI oil price. This finding reinforces the
argument that oil price declines, although driven by exogenous supply shocks, can
create uncertainty, flight to safety, and a deterioration of the stock market.

             The US Market: Breakdown by sector and asset class

Table 4.4 presents the impact of oil price fluctuations on different asset classes
(stocks, high-yield bonds, and investment-grade bonds) of different sectors. In each
asset class, the sectors are sorted by the magnitude of the impacts.

About half of the sectoral stock indices are negatively affected by oil price declines.
As expected, the energy sector is hit the hardest as the WTI oil price decreases.
Focusing on column 4 (regressions with lags), a 10% decline in the WTI oil price




                                           19
 
causes the Energy stock index to drop by 5.04%. The decline in the energy sector
is expected because lower oil prices squeeze energy companies’ profit and put
pressure on their credit-worthiness. The Basic Materials sector is also very sensitive
to oil price fluctuations: when WTI oil price decreases by 10%, the stock index of
Basic Materials decreases by 2.91%. Technology, consumer services, consumer
goods, telecommunication, healthcare and utilities do not seem affected by oil price
declines.

Interestingly, some sectoral stock indices that are expected to benefit from oil price
declines—Industrials, Basic Materials, and Transport Services – also witness the
value of their indices drop with oil price. In addition, the valuation of airlines,
another sector that supposedly benefits from oil price declines, remains unchanged
when the WTI oil price goes down. This suggests that other channels, such as
uncertainty-driven demand reduction for industrial products or transport services
and air travel, might be at play.

The Financial sector is widely expected to be affected by the spillovers from the
Energy sector. Economists and policy makers are concerned that distressed energy
companies, driven by lower oil prices, could default on their loans to banks,
adversely impacting banks’ balance sheets. We find that while the stock index of
Financial sector is negatively affected by a lower WTI oil price, the magnitude of
1.75% is not relatively large compared to other sectors.

We see similar trends among the high-yield bond indices. Focusing on column 4
(regressions with lags), we find that the Bloomberg Energy high-yield bond index
stands out as the most affected high-yield sector. A 10% decline in WTI oil price
causes the Energy high-yield bond index to drop by 0.90%. Interestingly, high-yield
bonds of most other sectors also suffer, ranging from Materials (0.51%) to
Industrials (0.18%).

Cheap oil improves investment-grade corporate bonds, except those in Energy and
Materials sectors. The signs for almost all sectors are negative, implying a negative
relationship between oil prices and the investment-grade corporate bonds’ indices:
when oil prices are lower, the corporate bond indices are higher. However, we do
not find evidence for a negative relationship between cheap oil and prices of
investment grade bonds in the Energy or Basic Materials sectors. This suggests that




                                            22
 
investors are reluctant to invest in the Energy and Basic Materials’ corporate bonds,
even when they are of higher ratings. The sectors whose investment grade bonds
benefit the most are relatively less cyclical: Utilities, Industrials, Healthcare and
Communications. For a 10% decline in the WTI oil price, the indices for these
sectors’ investment-grade bond indices increase from 0.32% to 0.56%.

This section considers the impact of oil price declines to emerging markets. Table
5.1 shows that oil price declines hurt the dollar-denominated MSCI Emerging
market index. For every 10% decline in WTI oil price, the dollar value of MSCI
Emerging Market index drops by 1.32%. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
consists of 21 emerging countries,15 most of them are not oil exporters.
Nevertheless, we still see the declines in these markets. This reinforces the concern
that this time, lower oil price could carry global systemic risk.

The effect can be broken to two components: the decline in the stock markets of
emerging markets, and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Indeed, as the WTI oil
price declines, the dollar index appreciates in value (Table 5.2). A 10% decline in
the WTI oil price leads to 0.41% increase in the U.S. dollar. We use the trade-
weighted dollar index that the U.S. has against its major trade partners.16 The
appreciation of the U.S. dollar is usually a worrying sign to emerging markets
(Shin, 2016).

Focusing the impact of oil price fluctuations on oil exporters, Table 5.3 examines
the impacts of oil price fluctuations on the dollar-denominated MSCI Gulf States
Index. The impact here reflects the reactions of oil-exporters’ stock markets to
changes in oil prices. Quite surprisingly, a lower WTI oil price hurts the dollar value
of the Gulf States’ stock markets but the impact is statistically insignificant: every
10% decline in WTI oil price, MSCI Gulf State index drops by 0.55%. The
magnitude is relatively small and not statistically different to zero. Conventional

wisdom suggests that lower oil prices should affect the Gulf States more severely
than the overall emerging markets. The finding that Gulf States’ index is less
affected than the overall emerging market index suggests that other channels, above
and beyond the lower oil revenue channel, might be at play.

To investigate the possibility further, we examine the impacts of lower oil prices
on individual important oil-exporting emerging markets. Key emerging oil
exporters - Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the Russian Federation - show
tremendous sensitivity to the declines in oil prices. The coefficients are much larger
than the overall MSCI Emerging Market Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Market
Index. In particular, a 10% decline in the WTI oil price reduces the stock index of
Brazil by 3.01%, Colombia by 4.13%, Mexico by 2.21% and Russia by 4.57%. The
declines here suggest heavy capital flight of investors from these markets when
they see oil prices drop. Since these countries are large and likely systemically
important, the magnitude of the impacts is concerning. The indices of many smaller
Gulf States, however, are not significantly affected by lower oil prices. This finding
is consistent with the results in table 5.4 and reinforces the possibility that other
channels beyond the oil revenue channel could affect emerging markets.

                       VI.      Discussion on potential channels

At least three potential channels could explain the negative impact of lower oil
prices on financial markets and the economy. The first one is the demand channel.
Lower oil prices imply that many energy firms might have to scale down
production. Since the sector buys many goods and services from other sectors (for
example, electricity generation relies on a range of inputs such as construction and
IT services), a decline in the sector reduces demand from the rest of the economy
(usually referred to as the ‘indirect effect’). In addition, laid-off workers from the




                                          26
 
energy sector also reduce consumption in local services and tradable goods (the
‘induced effect’).

The second channel works through the financial sector. As energy firms scale down
their operation or become bankrupt, they would have difficulties repaying their
debts. This would hit the financial sector, who in turn would have to scale down
lending to the rest of the economy. The energy sector-led credit crunch could cause
other sectors in the economy to reduce investment and production.

The third channel that could transmit the negative impacts of lower oil prices to the
rest of the economy is uncertainty. Relentless declines in oil prices raise
uncertainty,17 which we confirm via the corresponding increase in the VIX index
in table 4.2. When economic agents are uncertain about the economic prospect and
direction of financial markets, they tend to move their investment to safer and less
cyclical assets. This is precisely what we observe in the data: investment-grade and
long-term Treasury bonds appreciate at the cost of equity and high-yield bonds.

 

                                                               VII Conclusion

Lower oil prices are traditionally thought to be good for oil-importing economies,
such as the U.S. Indeed, the existing literature tends to find statistically insignificant
to positive impacts of lower oil prices on U.S. stock markets. However, swift and
dramatic recent declines in oil prices and the accompanying movements in financial
markets are concerning. Do lower oil prices carry systemic risk this time? This
paper tries to shed light on the issue by examining the causal impacts of oil price

                                                            
17
   This direction is different to the view postulated in Rey (2015) and Miranda-Agrippino and Rey
(2015). These papers show that the VIX acts like a common factor behind the prices of risky assets
as well as commodity prices around the world. The positive co-movement between oil prices and
risky asset prices is driven by the VIX, which itself is driven by underlying fundamentals such as
U.S. monetary policy. In our paper, we show that there is a direct causal link from lower oil prices
to higher VIX.




                                                                   27
 
declines on financial markets. The findings suggest that they do. A lower WTI oil
price negatively affects risky assets (stocks and high-yield bonds) in many sectors
in the U.S. financial market. Quite strikingly, sectors that supposedly benefit from
lower prices, such as Basic Materials, Industrials and Transport Services, also
suffer. Similarly, equities in emerging countries deteriorate, more so for large oil-
exporting countries and, interestingly, less so for smaller oil-exporting Gulf States.
Safer assets, such as investment-grade bonds, and particularly, long-term Treasury
bonds, are boosted when oil prices drop. Overall, the findings suggest capital flight
to safety when oil prices drop: capital moves out of stocks and high-yield bonds,
and flocks to investment-grade corporate bonds and risk-free long-term T-bonds.
These phenomena are typically observed during bad times.

An interesting direction of future research would be to examine in detail the
channels via which the transmission from lower oil prices to the real economy could
operate: does the impact work through the demand channel, the financial channel,
or the conventional oil input channel? Using firm-level data, one could investigate
to what extent stock prices of firms in demand-sensitive sectors, credit-sensitive
sectors, or oil-intensive sectors reacted to oil price fluctuations in the last two years.

                Appendix B: Dealing with the small sample problem



To alleviate the concern that we have a small sample problem (28 events days), we
(a) test for the normality of the error terms in event days, and (b) use bootstrap
standard errors.

       a) Test for the normality of the error terms

In this section, we test for whether different indices are normally distributed. We
have 28 event days, which might raise some concerns about the small sample
problem. However, we can still use the t-distribution for hypothesis tests, even
when our sample is small, as long as the data are normally distributed.

Results of Shapiro-Wilk test for the normality of the baseline regressions’ residuals
in Table B.1 show that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the error terms of
the baseline regressions for stock prices, investment grade bonds and TLT are
normally distributed. We reject the null hypothesis that the error terms of high-yield
bonds are normally distributed. Thus, we are more confident when using the regular
inference method for hypothesis tests of stocks, investment-grade bonds, and
Treasury bonds. We are less confident using the regular inference method for high-
yield bonds. As a result, we will present our bootstrap confidence intervals in part
(b).

       b) Bootstrapping

Following Hébert and Schreger (2016), we implement the bootstrap procedure by
Horowitz (2001) to calculate confidence intervals. This robustness check is
especially important for the results of high-yield bonds because they are not
normally distributed, as shown in part (a). In this section, we find that our
confidence intervals for our coefficients are similar to confidence intervals
constructed under normal approximations

From our original data, we resample 2000 bootstrap samples with replacements
from event and non-event days, separately. Each bootstrap sample contains 28
event days and 671 non-event days, except stock (with 670 non-event days). In each

bootstrap sample, we compute                , where   is the point estimate from our

original data,              is the point estimate in the 	              bootstrap sample, and           is the
heteroskedasticity-robust standard error of the                         bootstrap sample. We calculate
the 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile of	                  in the bootstrap replications, denoted
    .   and         .   , respectively. We then report 95% confidence interval for                 :[    .

         ,      .               ], where s is the heteroskedasticity-robust standard error from
our original data sample.
