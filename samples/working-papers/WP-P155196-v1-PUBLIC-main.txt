W
               ater-related diseases are a major health burden for populations, especially the poor. Meeting global
               aspirations for poverty reduction will require addressing the global water and sanitation challenge.
               This discussion paper provides an overview of the poverty-related impacts of inadequate water sup-
ply and sanitation services, and highlights the new policy challenges that have emerged in a more populated,
polluted, and urbanized world with finite water resources. New approaches that assure sustained changes in
individual behavior, more equitable access to services, and incentives for improved water resource stewardship
are needed.

      Box 1.   Cholera Afflicts 2.9 Million People a Year


      Cholera causes severe diarrhea and kills about 95,000 people a year, most of them children. An estimated
      2.9 million cases of cholera occur each year in over one-third of countries worldwide where the disease is
      endemic (Ali et al. 2015).

      The fecal contamination of water or food transmits cholera. Clean water and sanitation are critical to
      preventing it from spreading. A promising oral cholera vaccine has enormous potential to protect those at
      risk, but this does not diminish the central importance of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene as long-term
      weapons in the fight against cholera.

      A coordinated approach is being taken, for instance, in the World Bank’s $50 million investment targeting
      cholera hotspots in Haiti. The project will provide 300,000 people with improved water sources and
      sanitation facilities. It will also strengthen the national cholera control program through support
      to epidemiological surveillance; joint training for water, sanitation, and health actors; and improve
      coordination with the Ministry of Health and Population (MSPP). These investments recognize that
      cholera control requires the effective integration of health and water and sanitation interventions, as
      well as an integrated approach to treatment at the health facility-level, provision of water treatment
      products, and community-level education and prevention campaigns.

      Box 2.   Two Bengals—One Taller, One Shorter


      Children in West Bengal, India and in Bangladesh likely share the same genetic height potential, on average.
      Per capita incomes are higher in West Bengal than in Bangladesh, but Bangladesh has lower infant mortality,
      reflecting successful social investments. In West Bengal, higher wealth is reflected in a child population that
      is taller, on average. However, at each level of income or wealth, an average child in Bangladesh is taller
      than a counterpart in West Bengal.

      Why might this be so?

      Statistical evidence suggests that the differences in open defecation, controlling for wealth, can account for
      the differences in height. In Bangladesh, more than 80 percent of the population use latrines, while in West
      Bengal, the share is only about 50 percent. The height gap at any given level of wealth can be statistically
      “explained” by the open defecation gap (Ghosh et al. 2015).

      Box 3. Sesame Street—Showing Children How to Wash Can Shift Mindsets, Behaviors,
      and Social Norms


      Sesame Street’s first Global Health Ambassador, Raya, was created to show kids, families, and communities
      about proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) routines like handwashing with soap and wearing
      footwear in the latrine. Sesame Street has learned that when children have the tools and information,
      they go from being just passive recipients of health information to active participants in their own health
      and well-being. Now, through the help of Raya, messages about the importance of WASH reach the most
      vulnerable kids in Bangladesh, India, and Nigeria.

      Identifying champions for children like Sesame Street’s popular characters, the Muppets, can thus be pivotal
      role. Complementing it with child-facing education through mass media and multiplatform community
      approaches creates unparalleled opportunities to shift mindsets, behaviors, and social norms.
