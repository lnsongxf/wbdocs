                              Environmental Activities in
                               Europe and Central Asia
Overview
The Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region comprises 28 countries, with all but Turkey in
various stages of transition from centrally planned economies. Eight countries shortly will be
joining the EU, while others still have a large unfinished reform agenda that encompasses
profound and far reaching economic and social changes. Region-wide, the number of people
living in poverty1 is about one in five, or roughly 90 million, with rates varying significantly,
from below 10 percent in countries in Central Europe to 68 percent in Tajikistan. Civil conflicts,
natural disasters, refugees and ethnic problems are major complicating factors in Central Asia, the
Balkans, and the Caucasus. Nonetheless, in most of the region, growth has resumed and a market-
oriented framework has taken hold. The economic recovery is set to continue into 2003 and
beyond, making the region one of the most economically dynamic in the world.




The transformation from plan to market has played a key role in the past twelve years and has
improved environmental management over the past decade. Progress has been made in tackling
the legacy of environmental pollution created by the inefficiencies of the output-focused
command economy that existed in the Soviet Union. Where substantial progress in industrial
restructuring and realigning the public and private sectors to a market-based economy has
occurred, pollution intensity has been reduced as industry modernizes, incorporates abatement
techniques, and shifts to less-polluting sectors.

Reforms have also resulted in the development of new ways to better safeguard the environment.
Such reforms include the use of incentives to promote more efficient use of energy, water and
sewerage services to broader policy changes such as freer trade, reducing agricultural subsidies,
and promoting land reform and property rights since people take more care to ensure the
sustainability of their own assets. Thus, in many countries in the region, economic growth already
is accompanied by a heightened recognition that environmental considerations are critical to the

health and prosperity of people. Yet some serious environmental problems persist and concerted
action is needed to ensure that the economic recovery now underway does not lead to a revival of
the old environmental threats.

Regional Differences
The ECA region represents 17% of the world’s land area, 8 % of the world population (about
500 million people, with 35 percent living in rural areas), 19% of the world’s arable land, 23% of
the world’s forests and 12% of renewable freshwater resources.

Protecting the environment depends to a large extent on the existence of strong legal and
regulatory institutions, and management capacity. As such, one way to highlight regional
environmental differences is by comparing the strength of institutions across countries. Based on
this table, countries in ECA can be grouped into the following sub-regions in terms of their
environmental performance:

EU Accession Countries
At the forefront of reform and change within the region are the eight EU accession countries
(Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic and Slovenia),
which have finalized negotiations with respect to the EU Environmental Acquis. These countries
are working hard to harmonize their legal and regulatory framework with those of EU
environmental directives. New entrants will need help paying for the expensive environmental
investments that the Accession process requires. Indeed, meeting these directives will cost the EU
candidates, together with Bulgaria and Romania, about $100 billion over twenty years.

South Eastern Europe and the Balkans
After the EU accession countries, South Eastern European countries are performing the best in
terms of environmental management, with Croatia in the forefront of reform. Areas for
improvement include: strengthening capacity to enforce regulations and reaching agreement
among government officials on the importance and urgency of environmental issues.

Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine
The Western CIS countries and Russia have made significant improvements in environmental
management but there is still substantial scope for improvement and some danger of backsliding.
Environmental laws and monitoring systems are in place and Ministries of Environment function
fairly well. Enforcement of laws is inconsistent however, and there is a need for increased
transparency and more meaningful public and civil society involvement in the environmental
decision-making process. Greater cooperation between environmental authorities and other core
ministries whose actions directly impact the environment (such as energy, water and transport)
would also be useful.

Central Asia and the Caucasus
Central Asian countries, especially Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, rank the lowest in terms of
environmental management capacity. These countries are the slower reformers and some of the
poorest in the ECA region. A major effort will be needed to achieve the institutional reforms
necessary for environmental sustainability. Areas for action include: improved monitoring and
collection of environmental data and its use for decision-making; strengthening the Ministry of
Environment’s capacity for policy design and its ability to influence and work with other
Ministries; setting up a modern, cost effective regulatory framework that relies on market
incentives to promote compliance; facilitating the financing of environmental investments from

public and private sources and from financial institutions; and improving public access to
information, including greater participation in key environmental decisions.

The countries in the Caucasus, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan are somewhat more
advanced. Reasonable monitoring and many laws are in place or under discussion, but
unenforceable. The environmental ministries tend to have professional staff but modest budgets.


Key Environmental Challenges
Most countries in ECA face common environmental issues, with some important sub-regional
differences, such as in Central Asia, an arid region where the availability of water to support
energy, irrigation and drinking needs remains a serious problem. Other environmental problems
unique to certain countries include: war-related pollution hotspots in the Balkans and the high
costs of meeting EU environmental directives for the accession countries. Globally, Russia
particularly stands out: it is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide and has 22% of the
world’s forests. The following are some of the most pressing environmental challenges facing
countries ECA-wide:

Access to high quality water supply and sanitation, particularly in rural areas
ECA countries show high (91%) access to sources of improved water supply according to 2000
official data (World Development Indicators), comparable to other lower and middle income
countries, and near the Millennium Development target indicator of 93%. However, there is a
serious issue of water quality, which constitutes a major threat to health. Rural water supply is of
particular concern. In Moldova’s countryside, for example, 60% of samples do not meet water
quality standards. For non-piped water, the range is 25% in Ukraine to 65% for Moldova.
Moreover, it is poor people who most often lack access to adequate water supply and sanitation.
For example, the lowest quintile in Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan, have
virtually no access to piped water or flush toilets. In urban areas, sustainability of access is
endangered by the deteriorating financial condition of municipal water and wastewater utilities,
particularly in secondary towns.

Energy efficiency
Despite an increase of 21% in energy efficiency since 1992, the ECA region remains the least
energy efficient in the world in terms of GDP per unit of energy used. An increase of 58% in
efficiency is needed if the ECA region is to reach the same energy efficiency as other countries at
similar levels of development in terms of PPP GDP per kg of oil equivalent. Russia and
Kazakhstan in particular have tremendous scope for improving efficiency.

Carbon dioxide and other emissions
Carbon dioxide emissions in ECA represent 13% of global emissions although they have declined
by 28% since 1992. Compared to the rest of the world, however, emissions are still high. A
decrease of 174% is needed if the ECA region is to reach the same level of CO2 per capita
emissions as other countries at a similar level of development. Reductions in fossil fuel use, the
main source of CO2, and improvements in energy efficiency would also help to reduce other air
pollutants such as SO2, NOx , Total Suspended Particles (TSPs) and heavy metals, which pose a
threat to health in some urban areas in ECA.




                                                                                                   3
Hazardous and industrial pollution hotspots
Environmental challenges from past liabilities remain an issue in highly polluting industries such
as chemicals, petrochemicals, and metallurgy in many ECA countries. Potential oil spills and gas
leaks from poorly maintained pipelines and construction of new lines, particularly in Russia and
energy rich Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, are also problematic.

Sustainable forest management
At 40%, ECA has more forested area than the world average of 30%. Furthermore, forest areas
are increasing in absolute numbers in every country except Albania, according to official
statistics. However, the extent of continuous old growth forests and the broad shade provided by
big trees is declining. Illegal logging is also problematic for some countries in the region and the
deposition of nitrogen acids and heavy metals exceeds critical levels in some areas.

Biodiversity
ECA contains nearly 100 distinct eco-regions, on the order of 15,000 vascular plant species and
1,600 vertebrate animal species. Globally significant ecosystems include South East Turkey, the
Mediterranean and the Black Sea, the Volga and Danube delta wetlands, the Caucasus,
Carpathian, Balkan, Altai and Tien Shen mountain ecosystems, the Karst ecosystems of the
Northern Adriatic, the Lake Baikal area and the Russian Far East.

Many of the ECA countries have a strong tradition of protected area management, and some have
also incorporated the concept of landscape conservation into broader management of land, water
and forest resources. However, the first years of transition saw a deterioration in the institutions
and financing mechanisms for conservation management. Increased poverty also led to pressure
on natural resources, particularly from poaching and illegal logging. Since 1990, it is estimated
that Tajikistan and Armenia have both lost 10% of their forest cover and the population of the
endangered Siberian tiger fell to about 200, one third of the level in the 1980s.

Regional Seas
The management of regional seas and rivers is an important challenge for virtually all countries in
the region. In addition to the drying up of a large part of the Aral Sea, the Caspian Sea is
threatened by pollution from the Volga and other rivers, pollution and accidental spills from the
oil industry, uncontrolled poaching of sturgeon and concerns over the impact of the alien species
Mnemiopsis leidyi. Regional agreements on management of the Caspian and the Aral Seas
remain difficult, making Bank-assisted programs hard to implement. The Black Sea has
experienced catastrophic decline in the past thirty years due to increased loads of nutrients from
agricultural run-off and discharges of raw sewage and solid waste from cities, heavy metals and
oil pollution. The experience of the Baltic Sea, where similar problems with pollution and oil
spills are being tackled by regional cooperation, shows potential for development.

Strategic Priorities and Actions
ECA’s Environment Strategy is shaped by the region’s broader priorities to: facilitate EU
accession for the fast-reforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe; reverse poverty and
revive growth in the CIS; help bring peace and prosperity in the Balkans; and foster cooperation
on regional and global environment issues.

The Bank’s regional environmental strategy focuses on addressing existing environmental issues
and improving environmental protection to prevent future pollution and promote sustainable use
of resources. The ultimate vision of the strategy is a region where, through better environmental



                                                                                                   4
management, quality of life is improved, quality of growth is ensured and quality of the global
commons is safeguarded.

As part of its evolving approach, and in fulfillment of this strategy, the Bank firmly believes in
using the seventh United Nations Millennium Development Goal on environmental sustainability
as a framework to measure progress made on achieving its own environmental strategy for the
ECA region. The environmental targets and indicators for MDG7 are shown in Chart 1. To use
the environment MDG to gauge results however, the Bank will help ECA countries collect high
quality baseline data and work with partners to better define the environment MDG indicators.

Bank Lending
As of May 2003, World Bank environmental lending for projects under implementation in the
ECA region (excluding funds from the Global Environment Facility or GEF, which has its
Secretariat housed in the WB) totaled US$ 1.7 billion. As illustrated in Chart 2, most lending has
been in three categories: pollution management (29%), land management (24%) and water
resources management (23%). Projects in the pipeline (2004 to 2006) currently total US$1.4
million.

In addition to the above figures, current GEF lending for projects under implementation totals
US$245.6 million. GEF funding has assisted ECA countries cease production of ozone-depleting
substances, establish geothermal projects, and undertake biodiversity projects. GEF pipeline
lending is currently US$138 million.

There are also a number of planned Prototype Carbon Fund projects in ECA aimed at helping
countries to take advantage of carbon trading mechanisms.

Results on the Ground
Following are examples of environmental advances in ECA due in part to joint actions taken by
governments, in partnership with the World Bank, and in many instances with other donors.

•   Investments in water supply infrastructure are benefiting the population of transition
    countries in ECA . Bank projects in the ECA transition countries under implementation have
    about 12 million direct beneficiaries. About 2.5 million additional people will directly benefit
    through the improved water services supported by Bank projects currently under preparation.

•   Rural communities are becoming owners of their water supply systems and making
    decisions on their water services. 150 communities in rural areas of Kyrgyz Republic are
    taking responsibility for their water supply systems that will be rehabilitated with Bank
    support after a comprehensive reform of the rural water supply sector. About 300,000
    beneficiaries will own, operate and maintain the community water systems.

•   Water supply has served as a mechanism for post-conflict reconciliation. A post-conflict
    Bank operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina not only restored water supply services to over
    800,000 people in war afflicted areas, but also reintegrated ethnically divided utilities that are
    now working as professional commercial enterprises.

•   Safe drinking water has been brought to rural areas in Uzbekistan. Some 2 million rural
    people in the western part of the country (Karakalpakstan and Khorezm) now have safe and
    reliable water thanks to a US$75 million loan that financed additional trunkmains and
    household connections.

•   The management of over 1 million hectares of land is being improved through ongoing
    forestry and biodiversity projects in the ECA region.


                                                                                                    6
•   The Turkey Eastern Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project, completed in 2002,
    resulted in the rehabilitation of 88 micro-catchments in 11 provinces, planting of 27,000 ha
    of trees for soil conservation purposes, restoration of about 20,000 ha of degraded rangeland
    and forest land with vegetation cover to support sustainable livestock production,
    development of over 14,000 ha of rainfed horticulture; and creation of over 12,000 hectares
    of small scale irrigation, reducing water conveyance losses.

•   The Danube Delta Biodiversity Conservation Project has been successful in strengthening
    and enabling local institutions to monitor and manage protected areas effectively, by working
    with local community groups to ensure a sustainable use of resources and restore some
    wetlands to their original condition. Over 7,000 ha of abandoned polders have been
    ecologically restored, which is internationally recognized as the largest area ever successfully
    restored to its original condition.

•   Improvements in farming practices achieved by the Poland Rural Environmental
    Protection project have led to less water pollution from manure. A total of 950 small and
    medium-sized sustainable farms were equipped with tanks for proper storage and handling of
    manure. Nutrient Management Plans were developed for 17,000 hectares of farmland, in
    addition to 370 Farm Management Plans.

•   Progress is being made to clean up oil contaminated sites in Azerbaijan using
    bioremediation technology. The Urgent Environmental Investment Project has also assisted
    the Government to reorganize its environmental management system, and a number of
    regulations have been piloted to test institutional capacity. The project will also cleanup a
    site contaminated with mercury and address the problem of declining sturgeon stocks by
    constructing a new fingerling hatchery.

•   Aral Sea. The GEF Aral Sea Water and Environment Project finances investments in
    wetland restoration, dam safety and water flow monitoring and the preparation of National
    and Regional Water and Salt Management Strategies. The studies are nearly completed,
    which will provide the technical and analytical basis for optimizing water, salt and energy
    management in the Aral Sea Basin. Pilot projects in dam and reservoir safety have been
    completed and work has begun on a study of how the Syr Darya river's cascades can be
    operated as an integrated system to minimize flood risks. Equipment and training have been
    given to the Kyrgyz Republic for carrying out hydrographic surveys and estimating
    sedimentation rates for reservoirs. Seventeen new transboundary water monitoring stations
    are operational and others are nearing completion.

•   Progress has been made in strengthening environmental institutions . A World Bank
    administered Institutional Development Fund grant in Albania supported institutional
    capacity building for the Butrint National Park, a recently designated UNESCO world
    heritage site, containing one of the Mediterranean coast’s greatest classical archeological and
    natural environmental sites. Butrint is now one of the country’s largest tourist destinations.

Analytical and Advisory Activities
The aim of analytical and advisory services is to support policy reform dialogue on environmental
issues in ECA and to ensure the development of sound sector strategies, and the formulation and
implementation of effective lending programs.

Over the past year, the Bank has completed a number of important reports analyzing
environmental issues in the ECA region, including:
• A Review of Environmental Assessment Systems: Russian and International Experience
• Belarus Environment Sector Strategy
• Coping with the Cold: Heating Strategies for Eastern Europe and Central Asia’s Urban Poor
• Environmental Impact Assessment Systems in ECA Countries
• Irrigation in Central Asia: Social, Economic and Environmental Considerations
• Meeting the Environment Millennium Development Goal in Europe and Central Asia
• Meeting the EU Environmental Acquis: Cost Estimates for Accession Candidates
• Serbia and Montenegro Country Environmental Analysis
• Ukraine’s Road to Effective Environmental Management: An Environmental Public
    Expenditure Review
• Water Resources Strategy for the Europe and Central Asia Region
• Biodiversity Strategy for the Europe and Central Asia Region

In addition to preparing reports, the Bank has also been taking the initiative to ensure that
environmental issues receive greater consideration during PRSP and CAS discussions. Efforts
will continue in this area since environmental issues are not always given adequate attention
when designing CAS and PRSP documents.
