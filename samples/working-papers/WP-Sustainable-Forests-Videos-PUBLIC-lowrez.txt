    a video series
    Africa’s forests, landscapes, and ecosystems produce many economic and social benefits for development.
    They contribute directly to the well-being and food security of poor people. Per the World Bank Forest
    Action Plan, the impact of forests on poverty is greatest in Africa, with forest-related income lifting 11
    percent of rural households out of extreme poverty. Forests also supply critical raw materials needed to

                                                       Forests play critical roles in the lives of poor Ghanaians, by supporting agriculture,

                                                       Ghana has lost over 60 percent of its forest cover and is suffering from high rates
                                                       of deforestation, especially in the cocoa-forest landscape of the High Forest Zone.
                                                       Key drivers of forest loss include conversion to agriculture, legal and illegal timber

              Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in the Sahel region in West Africa. It is characterized
              by arid and semi-arid ecosystems that represent a significant potential for carbon
              sequestration. Its wooded areas and forests (including fallow land, wooded savannah
              and wooded steppes) cover almost 13 million hectares (43 percent of the country). The
              population is mainly composed of smallholder farmers who depend heavily on the
              sustainable management of lands to secure their livelihoods.

              Traditionally, the forests and wooded areas provide a large income for the neighboring
              communities, through either woodworking, hunting, non-timber forest products (such as
              shea and nuts) or tree planting. Households use plants and animals from natural forests and
              woodlands as well as planted trees for food, energy, medicine, fodder, housing, furniture
              and baskets. The forests and wooded areas also preserve agricultural sustainability, by
              providing windbreaks against erosion and desertification, restoring soil fertility, pollinating
              crops, and maintaining water quality.

              DRC has the second largest intact block of rainforest in the world. It covers more than half
              of the remaining rainforest in the Congo Basin. Forests cover around 152 million hectares
              or two-thirds of the country. About 60 million people across Cameroon, Central African
              Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, and the Democratic Republic of
              the Congo depend on the Congo basin forests for their livelihoods. These forests represent
              20 percent of the world’s remaining primary tropical forests and play a globally important
              role in climate regulation and biodiversity protection. The Congo Basin forest hosts more
              than 10,000 species of plants, 400 species of mammals, 1,100 bird species, and 400 species
              of fish, comprising one of the most important and diverse ecosystems on earth.

              About 35 million people reside in or are dependent on DRC’s forests, which provide food,
              employment, building material (timber), energy (fuelwood and charcoal), shelter, medicine,
              cultural values and environmental services of local and national importance. The country’s
              Indigenous Peoples known as Pygmies have specific needs and rely almost entirely on
