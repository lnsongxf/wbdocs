Global growth is weak. It slowed down to 2.2 percent in the first half of 2016. While the Brexit vote has had
a limited impact on global growth so far, growth in Advanced Economies (AE) has been disappointing. In the
U.S., following a particularly subdued first half of the year, growth recovered in the third quarter but
continued to be held back by weak investment. In the
Euro area, the economy lost momentum given falling Figure 1: Global growth continued to slow down

domestic demand and exports. Growth in Emerging
Markets and Developing Economies (EMDE) also
remained subdued because of the weak performance of
commodity exporters, although many commodity
importers showed robust growth; an important
exception to this robust growth of commodity importers
was China, whose economy continued to decelerate
given its rebalancing from manufacturing to services.
2016 has also seen a stagnation in global trade – the
slowest it has been since 2013 – although external
financing conditions for emerging economies remained
strong in general. In terms of oil, there was little change Source: World Bank.

averaging $44.7/ per barrel (bbl) (Figure 1).
Amidst external headwinds, the recession continues

the first half of 2016. However, supported by the
government’s policy response package, the pace of the       Source: Rosstat, Central Bank, World Bank staff
recession has now declined substantially: real GDP          calculations.
shrank by just 0.9 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the
first half of 2016 compared to -3.7 percent in 2015 (Figure 2).
After a prolonged recessionary period, headline economic and financial trends and indicators are now
picking up. Inflation in January - October 2016 was 7.4 percent – less than half of the 15.9 percent in the same
period in 2015. The banking sector has also now largely stabilized. The consolidated budget of regional
governments even registered a surplus in the first eight months of 2016. And in May, for the first time since
                                                                                                               6
2013, the government successfully issued US$1.75 billion 10-year Eurobonds with an effective rate of 4.75
percent. The balance of payments remains stable. At 5.6 percent, unemployment is at near minimum levels
(Figure 3). Nuances and details matter though: the reduction in inflation, for example, is partly due to the
base effect while inflation expectations remain elevated (Figure 4). The banking sector, though stable,
remains vulnerable to macroeconomic risks of low growth and weak demand. Low unemployment has been
maintained -- not by easy entry or exit in the labor market -- but mostly through flexible wages. Though the
regions registered a fiscal surplus, they are expected to be in deficit by the end of 2016. Moreover, averages
mask variations, and over two thirds of the regions have a fiscal deficit and many are experiencing growing
debt. And the Reserve Fund, expected to be depleted in 2017, is now under severe pressure. We discuss these
important nuances and details in the report but the overall storyline that emerges is, arguably, a positive one
-- of Russian institutions dealing ably with multiple shocks, albeit reactively.

The fiscal deficit worsened in 2016. Although expenditure cuts were undertaken since the beginning of 2016,
the federal budget deficit widened in the first nine months of 2016. As Table 1 shows, it currently stands at
2.6 percent (compared to 1.1 percent in the first nine months of 2015). This is because expenditure cuts only
partly compensated for the revenue shortfall from the oil price shock. And as expenditures outpace revenues
even further in the last three months of 2016, the end of the year deficit is expected to grow to 3.7 percent.

Adherence to the proposed medium term fiscal framework envisages fiscal consolidation in the 2017 – 2019
period. A draft law on the federal budget (which assumes a conservative oil price of US$ 40/bbl) and the
associated medium-term expenditure framework for 2017 – 2019 are currently with the Duma (Table 2). This
framework envisions consolidation mainly through expenditure cuts and some revenue mobilization efforts
(with the exception of changes in most non-oil tax related rates which are postponed until 2019, thereby
postponing the uncertainty around the overall tax regime). Expenditures would decrease by 3.7 percent of
GDP over this three year period, with the three biggest cuts to occur in national defence (-1.8 percent of GDP);
social policy (-0.5 percent of GDP); and national security (-0.4 percent of GDP). And revenues would be
mobilized predominantly from transfer of dividends of the state controlled companies and increasing tax
revenue from the energy sector (Table 2).

Fiscal tightening at the federal level may also adversely affect the performance of some regions. Fiscal
constraints can lead to a cut in transfers to subnational governments, affecting two-thirds of Russian regions
where federal transfers constitute 15 to 50 percent of revenue. Concerns about debt levels will make it
difficult for many local governments to support expenditures.
In 2016, poverty decreased slightly but vulnerability remains at higher levels than before (Figure 5). Despite
a continued contraction of disposable incomes – by 5.8 percent – the poverty rate slightly decreased. In the
first half of 2016, 21.4 million people, or 14.6 percent of the population, had incomes below the national
                                                                                                                           8
poverty line. This was 0.5 percentage points lower than a year ago – a slight decrease. This decrease is because
the poor consume more food as a fraction of their income, and food inflation was lower than non-food
inflation in the first two quarters of 2016. However, many people in the bottom 40 percent and in the middle
of the income distribution experienced a significant decline of their real incomes in 2015. That led to an 8
percentage points increase in the share of the vulnerable population with per capita incomes below 10
USD/day (in 2005 PPP) – a significant increase, reverting many of shared prosperity gains of recent years.
Given tightening budget constraints, it becomes important to ensure such gains are not lost and underscores
the progressive role fiscal policy plays in Russia – the focus of the special topic.

Russia’s fiscal policy is more redistributive than the United States’ but less so than the EU’s . Since the crisis
in 2009, fiscal transfers—mostly due to increases in pensions—have played a much more critical role than
rising labor incomes in sustaining income growth for households. The good news is that when it comes to
reducing inequality, Russia’s fiscal policy performs better than in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Turkey, and the
United States. But with a similar budget size (as measured by government expenditure as share of GDP), many
EU countries achieve a much higher reduction in inequality. Russia can achieve more redistribution for its
current level of government spending and revenues (Figure 6).

Against these dynamics, we expect the economy to inch towards growth. For 2016, we project growth of
the Russian economy at -0.6 percent, an improvement from our earlier June forecast of -1.2 percent. And as
oil and gas prices are projected to continue recovering to US$55.2/bbl in 2017 and US$59.9/bbl in 2018 and
positively affect domestic demand, we forecast the economy to start inching towards growth of 1.5 percent
in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018 (Figure 7).
This growth upsurge, however, is unlikely to turn the Figure 7: The economy is expected to inch towards
tide in terms of building a more diversified economy.            growth in 2017 and 2018 (real GDP growth,
                                                                                    percent)
Risks stemming from commodity price volatility and
structural constraints remain. All else being equal, a 15
percent increase [decrease] in oil prices changes our
2017 growth forecast of 1.5 percent to 2.1 percent
[0.7 percent], underscoring the sensitivity of the
economy to fluctuations in commodity prices. Indeed,
while exports have expanded in some non-oil sectors,
such as textiles, wood processing, metals and metal
goods, and agriculture, which grew at 1.5 percent in                     Source: World Bank staff estimates.
the first half of 2016, the total value of non-oil exports
of goods decreased by 13.4 percent in the first nine months of 2016. And sectors, constituting slightly more
than half of non-oil exports, registered contraction in the first half of 2016. Overall, import substitution seems
to have a limited impact on growth and redistribution of production factors so far. The partial cyclical recovery
on the back of rising oil prices is unlikely to go hand in hand with a reallocation to higher value added non-oil
activities. The diversification process advances slowly due to a relatively low level of spare capacity in most
tradable sectors and limited availability of labor, including structural and institutional constraints that need
to be lifted first.

What can help turn the tide? While a detailed analyses of structural issues is beyond the scope of this
particular report, bolstering investor sentiment towards Russia by reducing policy uncertainty will help. One
important step forward, particularly in light of eroding fiscal buffers with the Reserve Fund expected to be
depleted in 2017, is a return of the medium-term fiscal framework. Also, to its credit, over recent years, Russia
has accomplished many positive changes across multiple areas of business regulation, helping improve its
investment climate. These are necessary though not sufficient – despite the substantial changes in the role of
the state in recent decades, the ownership of productive assets has become even more concentrated,
reducing competition and impairing corporate governance. And as was analyzed in the thirty fourth edition
of the Russia Economic Report, there are complex socio-economic issues of an aging society. Addressing such
issues is ultimately what will help turn the tide.

1.1 Growth: The recession continued in Russia, albeit the pace of GDP
          decline has slowed down


Global economic trends

There continues to be a slowdown in global growth in 2016. In the first half of the year, global growth slowed
to 2.2 percent (Figure 8). While the Brexit vote has had a limited impact on growth so far, growth in Advanced
Economies (AE) has been disappointing. In the US, following a particularly subdued first half of the year,
growth recovered in the third quarter, but continued to be held back by weak investment. In the Euro area,
the economy also lost momentum given falling domestic demand and exports. Growth in Emerging Market
and Developing Economies (EMDE) also remained subdued because of the weak performance of commodity
exporters, although many commodity importers showed robust growth; an important exception was China,
whose economy continued to decelerate, given its rebalancing from manufacturing to services, and its shifting
from private investment to public investment and consumption.
2016 has also seen a stagnation in global trade, although external financing conditions for emerging
economies remained strong. In the first half of 2016, global trade growth was the slowest it has been since
2013; this was due to weak aggregate demand in advanced economies, low commodity prices, and more
domestically-oriented growth in China. The slower pace of trade liberalization and global value chain
integration compounded the temporary factors. On the other hand, global long-term interest rates have been
at historically low levels amid weak growth prospects in advanced economies and accommodative monetary
policies. Combined with stabilized oil prices, low interest rates led to search-for-yield capital flows to
emerging markets. Currencies and equities in the emerging markets rebounded, and the sovereign bond
spread narrowed (Figure 9). These rebounds were most pronounced for commodity exporters.

Global oil market developments

There was little change in crude prices in the third quarter of the year, with prices averaging $44.7/ per
barrel (bbl). Prices were, however, volatile, falling from a high of $50/bbl in early June to below $40/bbl in
early August due to weak demand and recovering supply from earlier outages, notably in Canada. As supply
disruptions were resolved, production again exceeded consumption in the third quarter. Upon reports of a
possible production freeze among major oil producers, and following an OPEC agreement to limit output,
prices later rebounded, rising above $50/bbl in early October.
OECD total oil inventories remain high, particularly in the United States, but stocks started to decline in
August. U.S. crude oil inventories have fallen seasonally for the past four months, but product inventories
continue to rise, in part because of slowing demand.
OPEC supply continued to increase to record highs, up 1million barrels per day (mb/d) over the first nine
months, with higher output from Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. At a meeting in late September, OPEC agreed
to set a new production target of 32.5-33 mb/d, but the details and timing were deferred to its November
meeting. The spread between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent spot crude oil prices narrowed
significantly in September, tipping into a small premium for WTI. Declines in U.S. stocks helped boost WTI
prices, while additional supplies from Libya and Nigeria tended to put downward pressures on Brent prices.
Futures prices, several years down the line, show the WTI discount to Brent widening to more than $3/bbl as
the U.S. is expected to remain a large oil importer and crude exports are expected to be limited, despite the
removal of the export ban in late 2015.
Recent economic developments in Russia
In the first half of 2016, Russia continued its adjustment to lower oil prices in the environment of sluggish
global demand and economic sanctions, imposed in July 2014. A sustained fall in real incomes kept domestic
demand depressed, while the recession, which started in the third quarter of 2014, persisted in the first half of
2016. However, supported by the return of growth momentum in the non-tradable sectors, the pace of the
recession declined substantially.
Domestic demand remained depressed in the first half of 2016. Real GDP shrank by 0.9 percent year-on-year
(y-o-y) in the first half of 2016, while domestic demand shrank by 2 percent y-o-y. A sustained contraction in
real incomes kept consumer demand depressed, with household consumption being the largest negative drag
on GDP growth. Public consumption also decelerated as the government pursued expenditure consolidation
in the new norm of low oil prices. Investment demand was revived in the first half of 2016, adding one
percentage point to GDP growth, compared to -5.3 percentage points in the same period last year. This was
mainly the result of a lower scale of destocking, compared to the high base of the first half of 2015, and this
contributed positively to investment demand. Meanwhile, on the back of persistent economic policy
uncertainty, depressed consumer demand, and high credit costs, fixed capital investment registered a
contraction of 7.1 percent y-o-y, compared to a fall of 6.8 percent y-o-y in the same period last year.1 Exports

  This negative development partly reflects higher budgetary military expenditures in the first quarter of 2015, which are
recorded as fixed capital investment according to the SNA 2008 methodology. High frequency indicators for the first half
of 2016 suggest more plausible dynamics of fixed capital investment: -4.3 percent y-o-y compared to -7.3 percent y-o-y
in the first half of 2015.

1.2 Balance of Payments: Capital outflows subsided due to lower debt
          payments and increased confidence in the ruble
The balance of payments remained stable despite adverse terms-of-trade conditions in the first half of 2016
and restricted access to international capital markets. From January – September 2016, the current account
surplus dropped to US$15.6 billion (1.8 percent of GDP) from US$54.4 billion (5.5 percent of GDP) last year as


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             14
the trade balance weakened. Net capital outflows moderated due to lower debt repayments in the banking
sector and increased confidence in the ruble.
Lower commodity prices reduced the trade balance, weakening the current account. The fall in oil prices,
which started in August 2015, ended in February 2016, and the average oil price has been gradually increasing
in the first half of 2016. Yet, on an annual basis, in all three quarters of 2016, and especially in the first half of
2016, average oil prices were lower than last year. As a result, oil and gas export proceeds dropped by 30.5
percent y-o-y in the first nine months of 2016 to US$107.6 billion. The value of non-oil exports of goods
decreased by 13.4 percent y-o-y in the first nine months of 2016 as prices for other commodities exported by
Russia were at low levels and as the diversification process advances slowly.
The flexible exchange rate enabled the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) to depreciate by 8.6 percent in
the first half of 2016, prompting a fast downward adjustment in import demand. In the first six months of
2016, the value of imports of goods decreased by 9 percent y-o-y. Nonetheless, the decline in imports was
much less severe than in the first half of 2015 when the REER depreciated by 17.4 percent and GDP contracted
by 3.5 percent y-o-y (Figure 13).
The continued ban on certain food imports, introduced in July 2014, and the ban on certain food imports from
Turkey, in place since January 2016, added to the contraction in imports of goods. In the third quarter of 2016,
when oil prices were close to last year’s levels, export contraction was not as profound as in the first half of
2016, supporting the trade balance. Overall, in the first nine months of 2016, the contraction in the value of
imports of goods could not compensate for lower export proceeds, and the trade balance almost halved to
US$63.1 billion (7.1 percent of GDP) from US$118.2 billion (11.8 percent of GDP) last year (Figure 14). The
negative balance of services improved mainly on the back of subsiding tourist imports due to lower real
incomes and restricted flights to Turkey and Egypt. A substantial reduction in net external liabilities in 2015
reduced outbound interest and dividend payments in the first nine months of 2016, improving the investment
income deficit. Overall, improvement in services, investment income, and labor income accounts deficits
could not compensate for the worsening trade balance and the current account surplus decreased to US$15.6
billion (1.8 percent of GDP) from US$54.4 billion (5.5 percent of GDP) last year (Table 3). The non-oil current
account deficit increased in nominal terms to US$92 billion and weakened in relative terms from 10.1 percent
of GDP to 10.4 percent of GDP, increasing vulnerability of the economy to terms of trade shocks.

The financial account strengthened from negative US$49.3 (5 percent of GDP)2 to negative US$19.7 (2.2
percent of GDP) as net capital outflows moderated on the back of lower debt payments in the banking
sector and increased confidence in the ruble. In the first nine months of 2016, private sector net capital
outflows moderated to US$21.8 billion from US$37.9 billion in the same period last year. While net capital
outflows in the non-banking sector moderately increased by US$3 billion to US$13.7 billion, net capital
outflows in the banking sector dropped from US$27.2 billion to US$8.1 billion. In January – September 2016,
on the back of lower debt payments. As in 2015, FDI inflows stayed modest in the first half of 2016 and
consisted largely of firms’ profits, which were not channeled abroad. Meanwhile, confidence in the ruble
strengthened, as oil prices recovered. Foreign-currency acquisition by households and non-financial firms
declined by US$3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2016 in addition to US$19.7 billion in 2015.
While the Central Bank of Russia refrained from intervening in foreign-currency markets, international
reserves increased from US$368.4 billion (15.7 months of imports) at the end of 2015 to US$395.2 billion
(18.1 months of imports) at the end of September 2016. This increase reflected exchange rate movements
and repayments of foreign currency loans by large banks. These loans were originated by the Central Bank in
2015 to support large banks’ external debt payments under the imposed sanctions regime.

Russia’s external debt, adjusted for exchange rate movements, decreased by 1.4 percent in the first half of
2016 compared to the end of 2015, as the corporate sector continued deleveraging (Figure 15). In relative
terms however, the external debt burden grew quite substantially, rising from 29.2 percent of GDP (end of
2014) to 38.9 percent of GDP (end of 2015) and 42.7 percent of GDP (end of June 2016), or 12.8, 15.8, and
18.6 months of exports, respectively. The extension of the economic sanctions regime, coupled with low oil
prices, and negative GDP growth in the first six months of 2016 has kept external borrowing costs elevated
for Russian firms. Even though Russia’s five-year credit-default swap (CDS) spread went down from 390 basis
points (bps) in early 2016 to 220 bps in June 2016, this is still higher than the 170 basis points in early 2014
(Figure 16). The sanctions regime, higher borrowing costs, and limited growth prospects led to continued
deleveraging in the corporate sector, especially for banks. Meanwhile, the external debt of the government
increased as the federal budget deficit expanded. In May, the government issued US$1.75 billion 10-year
Eurobonds with an effective rate of 4.75 percent for the first time since 2013. The ruble part of the
government’s external debt increased due to purchases of ruble government bonds by non-residents.

1.3 Labor Market & Poverty Trends: Unemployment remains low and
          poverty rates have decreased slightly
There has been an improvement in the situation of the labor market in Russia. Real wages stopped contracting
while unemployment remains stable at low levels. However, other sources of disposable income are still
declining in real terms. Pensions and income from self-employment and informal activities that are particularly
important for people at the bottom of the distribution contracted the most. Although the poverty rate
decreased, its level remains elevated, and other indicators of shared prosperity are still at risk.
Despite the continued economic stagnation, employment rates are at near maximum levels. Absolute
numbers of the economically active and employed population were almost unchanged in the first eight
months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This is partly explained by the specific position of the
Russian labor market, which mostly reacts through wages, but not employment. Other reasons include the

hours worked is declining slowly. The structure
of unemployment remains the same, with the gaps between male/female and rural/urban unemployment
remaining stable, and most of unemployment still being long term (30 percent of unemployed were looking
for a job over one year). Due to low labor mobility, unemployment by regions remains unequal.
Disposable income continues to decline in real terms. It contracted by 5.8 percent in the first eight months
of 2016. With the slowdown of inflation and moderate growth of nominal wages in most sectors, real wages
decreased just marginally by 0.3 percent in first eight months of 2016 (Figure 18). On the back of ongoing
fiscal consolidation, the slowest wage growth was in the public sector: in public administration, nominal
wages increased by only 2 percent, while in education and health they increased by 4 and 5 percent,
respectively, much below the average inflation of 8 percent. Pensions were indexed by only 4 percent in the
beginning of the year, therefore declining in real terms by 3.7 percent in January-August 2016. However, the
contraction of real pensions was not uniform. For the bottom decile, they even increased due to the design
of the pensions system in Russia, which guarantees the subsistence minimum level of income to each
pensioner. The most affected were vulnerable pensioners in the bottom 40 percent of the distribution, but
not those in the first decile. The highest negative contribution to disposable income dynamics was from
incomes that are not directly registered by statistics – self-employment, wages in small business, and in the
informal sector (Figure 19). These sources of income are particularly important for people in the bottom of
the distribution.

1.4 Monetary Policy: Monetary easing took a measured approach
The Central Bank of Russia continued its careful management of monetary conditions, which led to a further
slowdown of inflation. Consumer price inflation more than halved to 6.1 percent in October 2016 compared
to 15.6 percent in October last year.

10.6 percent y-o-y in October 2016. However, as inflation decelerated, real interest rates turned positive,
keeping monetary conditions relatively tight.
Important factors such as strong base effect, weak domestic demand, and fiscal consolidation helped ease
inflation pressures. In January - October 2016, annual consumer inflation decelerated to 7.4 percent
compared to 15.9 percent in the same period of 2015. The inflation slowdown was largely due to the sharp
deceleration of food inflation from 19.9 percent in January – October 2015 to 6.3 percent in the same period
this year (Figure 23). The high base in 2015 - largely attributed to restrictions on food imports and the pass-
through effect from the ruble depreciation – was the main reason behind the deceleration in food inflation.
Inflationary pressures subsided, especially in the third quarter of 2016, partly supported by the stronger ruble.
This was reflected in the dynamics of core inflation, which dropped to 6.4 percent in October 2016 compared
to 10.7 percent in January 2016 and 16.4 percent in October 2015.
In 2016, the oil price remained the key driver of the ruble exchange rate, while the impact of geopolitical
factors diminished (Figure 24). The sharp fall in oil prices from September to January, led the ruble exchange
rate to depreciate to its record low of 83.6 RUB/USD. The sustained recovery in oil prices since March 2016
supported the ruble, which by September gained 9 percent against the US dollar. The relatively stable oil
prices in June – October 2016 facilitated demand for ruble denominated financial assets, which offered
attractive returns. At the same time, the impact of geopolitical factors on the exchange rate appeared to have

1.5 The Financial Sector:                        More      stable       but       still      vulnerable       to
macroeconomic risks
The banking system has largely stabilized due to the government’s substantial support program to the
financial sector in 2015, but it remains vulnerable to macroeconomic risks: the ongoing economic recession,
depressed consumer demand, and interest rate uncertainty. In 2016, credit growth remained negligible, the
quality of bank portfolios continued to deteriorate, and the overall sector performance was weak although it
showed some improvement in comparison to 2015.
The weak economic environment continued to negatively affect the banking sector’s performance.
Corporate loans have grown in low single digits, driven mainly by refinancing of large companies and the
obligation by banks recapitalized by the government to increase their exposure by 1 percent a month for 3
years in certain strategic sectors. In the retail segment, loan growth was negative due to weak consumer and
auto segments, with the exception of mortgage lending, which was boosted by the government ’s interest-
rate subsidies program. Given declining inflation and the falling Central Bank key rate (which was lowered
twice in 2016), new lending rates are expected to decrease over the medium-term, and encourage demand
for new loans.
Even though banks have reduced their risk appetite in new lending, a drop in the real disposable incomes
of the population and the weaker debt servicing capacity of the corporate borrowers contributed to
additional pressure on the quality of bank portfolios. As a result, credit quality continued to worsen:
reported Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) reached 9.8 percent of total loans in the first eight months of 2016
(up from 8.3 percent at the end of 2015). Despite worsening credit quality, the banking sector’s capitalization
remained stable this year with an aggregate capital adequacy ratio of 12.5 percent (above the regulatory
minimum of 8 percent) as of September 1, 2016 (Figure 25 and Figure 26).

1.6 Government Budget: Fiscal consolidation is planned to 2017 and
beyond
The federal budget deficit weakened in the first nine months of 2016 as lower expenditures did not compensate
for lower oil revenues. Despite expenditure cuts in January – September 2016, primary expenditures are
expected to increase by the end of the year. This will result in an overall expansionary fiscal policy in 2016,
with consolidation planned for 2017 - 2019. The anticipated reintroduction of a medium-term fiscal framework
for 2017 – 2019, focused primarily on expenditure cuts, is expected to guide this consolidation.
The government tightened its spending in the first nine months of 2016. In January – September 2016,
federal government revenues dropped to 15.3 percent of GDP from 17.5 percent of GDP last year (Figure 27).
The ruble’s depreciation only partly compensated for a drop in oil prices from US$ 54.4/bbl (Urals) to US$
39.9/bbl, and oil and gas revenues slumped from 7.8 percent of GDP last year to 5.6 percent of GDP in the
                                                                                                        22
first nine months of 2016. Non-oil revenues remained at 9.7 percent of GDP in 2016. Meanwhile, the federal
government’s primary spending decreased by 0.8 percent of GDP to 17.1 percent of GDP in the first nine
months of 2016. The government consolidated federal budget spending by means of a freeze on civil servant
salaries, indexation of pensions lower than the inflation rate, and a freeze on the saving pillar of the pension
system. At the beginning of 2016, when the government was faced with oil prices that were much lower than
stipulated in the federal budget law for 2016, it decided on an additional 10 percent across-the-board
expenditure cut for all categories except defence and social spending. In the first nine months of 2016,
government spending on national defence (- 0.7 percent of GDP), national security (- 0.2 percent of GDP),
national economy (-0.2 percent of GDP), and sport (-0.1 percent of GDP) decreased. Expenditures on housing
and communal services, education, and intergovernmental transfers remained roughly at the same level as a
share of GDP but decreased in nominal terms. Even though the government indexed the majority of pensions
below inflation, at a rate of 4.5 percent, government spending on social policy increased by 0.5 percent of
GDP. Decreases in expenditures could not compensate for a fall in revenues, and the federal budget primary
deficit widened from 0.4 percent of GDP last year to 1.8 percent of GDP this year. However, lower spending
brought about an improvement in the non-oil fiscal deficit from 8.9 percent of GDP to 8.2 percent.

Despite tightening of the budget spending in the first nine months of 2016, expenditures will increase by
the end of the year because of increased national defence and social policy spending. Overall primary
expenditures would increase from 18.7 percent of GDP in 2015 to 19 percent (
Table 5). Compared to spending in 2015, government expenditures would increase for national defence (+0.8
percent of GDP) and social policy (+0.3 percent of GDP). Meanwhile, government expenditures would decline
for the majority of other expenditure categories: state management (-0.1 percent of GDP), national security
(-0.1 percent of GDP), national economy (-0.3 percent of GDP), housing and communal services (-0.1 percent
of GDP), education (-0.1 percent of GDP), health (-0.1 percent of GDP), and intergovernmental transfers (-0.1
percent of GDP). Due to higher non-oil revenues, the non-oil and gas primary deficit would improve by 0.3
percent of GDP to 8.7 percent of GDP.
Federal budget revenues are expected to drop by 0.8 percent of GDP mainly on the back of lower oil and gas

With the financing of the deficit mainly from the Reserve Fund, federal government debt is expected to
increase to 14.2 percent of GDP (upper limit 16.2 percent of GDP) in 2016 from 13.6 percent of GDP in 2015,
partly due to increase of Rub 500 billion (upper limit 2.5 trillion rubles) in domestic guarantees.
The consolidated budget of regional governments registered a surplus in the first eight months of 2016. In
January – August 2016, consolidated regional primary expenditures as well as revenues stayed at about the
same level in relative terms as last year: 11.0 percent of GDP and 12.1 percent of GDP respectively (Figure
29). The primary consolidated regional budget surplus totaled 1.1 percent of GDP, and the regional budget
debt stayed at 2.9 percent of GDP in the first half of 2016, the same level as the end of 2015. As in 2015, the
government provided budget loans to regions with interest rate of 0.1 percent per year, to substitute for
commercial loans and reduce regional interest

Despite the widening fiscal deficit, the general government’s non-oil and gas primary deficit improved to 6.4
percent of GDP from 8.7 percent of GDP last year. By the end of 2016, the general government expenditures
are projected to increase to 36.3 percent of GDP from 36.0 percent of GDP last year, mainly due to increase
in federal spending. General government deficit is projected to increase to 4 percent of GDP from 3.5 percent
in 2015.
In the new context of low oil prices, the government will strive for fiscal consolidation in the medium-term
mainly through expenditure cuts and some revenue mobilization efforts. In 2016, the government
suspended the fiscal rule and the medium-term fiscal framework, which it plans to reintroduce in 2017.
Currently, the government submitted the draft law on the federal budget 2017 – 2019 to the Duma. The draft
law assumes a conservative oil price of US$ 40/bbl for 2017 – 2019. The government strives for consolidation
mainly through expenditure cuts: expenditures would decrease by 3.6 percent of GDP, almost evenly
distributed across three years. Government expenditures were calculated in the framework of the new fiscal
rule. The biggest expenditure cuts in the next three years would occur in national defence (-1.8 percent of
GDP), social policy (-0.5 percent of GDP), national security (-0.4 percent of GDP), national economy (- 0.4
percent of GDP), and health (-0.2 percent of GDP)4. Federal government revenues are expected to decrease
from 16.1 percent of GDP in 2016 to 15 percent of GDP in 2018 due to decreasing oil and gas revenues in the

  As for the whole budget system, major expenditure cuts would occur in national defence (-1.8 percent of GDP), national
economy (- 0.6 percent of GDP), social policy (-0.5 percent of GDP), national security (-0.5 percent of GDP), and education
(-0.2 percent of GDP).

will also be supported by revenue mobilization efforts: the government projects to raise 1.1 percent of GDP
in 2017 – 2019 predominantly from transfer of dividends of the state controlled companies and increasing
tax revenue from the energy sector (Table 6).

Fiscal buffers are expected to decrease from 7 percent of GDP at the end of 2016 to 3.1 percent of GDP at
the end of 2019, increasing fiscal sustainability risk (Figure 30). In 2017 – 2018, the government plans to rely
heavily on oil funds for deficit financing. With the Reserve Fund likely to be depleted in 2017, the government
expects to already tap into its National Welfare Fund in 2017 and even more so in 2018. Domestic borrowing
will be another major source for federal budget deficit financing (Figure 31). In 2017 – 2019, net domestic
borrowing would double compared to 2016.

Fiscal tightening at the federal level may also adversely affect the performance of some regions. Fiscal
constraints can lead to a cut in transfers to subnational governments, affecting two-thirds of Russian regions
where federal transfers constitute 15 to 50 percent of revenue. Concerns about debt levels will make it
difficult for many local governments to support expenditures.

                        Part 2. The Outlook Over Three Years

2.1 Growth & Poverty Outlook: Russia expected to inch towards growth with
a slight decrease in the poverty rate
Russia’s economic prospects have improved due to more favorable terms of trade than earlier assumed. The
economy is projected to contract by 0.6 percent in 2016 (an improvement from our earlier June forecast of -
1.2 percent). As hydrocarbon prices are projected to continue recovering and positively affect domestic
demand, the economy is expected to experience bottoming-out during the second half of 2016 and grow by a
modest 1.5 and 1.7 percent in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We expect the poverty rate to decrease on the
back of decelerating inflation and a recovery in private incomes and consumption.
Global growth is expected to recover over the medium-term, but divergences will remain. Global growth is
projected to grow by a disappointing 2.4 percent in 2016 due to deceleration in advanced economies, owing
to both cyclical and structural factors. Over the medium-term, however, economic activity is projected to pick
up to about 2.9 percent in 2017-2018, although the recovery may be slower than previously anticipated
because of uncertainty related to the impact of Brexit. Divergences between commodity exporters and
importers will persist. Commodity exporters are expected to see a turning point in growth patterns in the
second half of 2016 or in early 2017 as commodity prices are projected to continue recovering. Meanwhile,
commodity importers are expected to continue benefitting from relatively low energy prices, improving their
growth prospects; the exception, however, is China, which will continue to rebalance its economy and grow
slower.
Russia’s external environment will remain challenging as economic sanctions have been extended and the
prospects of its main trading partners have deteriorated. The extension of the U.S. and EU sanctions (initially
introduced during the 2014 Ukraine crisis) will continue limiting access of Russian financial institutions to
international capital markets. Meanwhile, economic prospects for major advanced and emerging economies
have deteriorated amidst weak global trade and manufacturing activity. Bleak economic prospects facing
Russia’s key trading partners mean they will be unable to contribute positively to the required recovery of
external demand. Growth in the EU, the main destination of Russia’s commodity goods, was slower than
earlier anticipated and is expected to remain modest over the medium-term. China, the second largest export
market for Russia, continues its gradual slowdown and rebalancing as the economy transitions to a new
development model. Growth of the U.S. economy slowed in 2016 and is expected to be slower than before,
diminishing its role as one of major export destinations for Russian goods and services.
So far, import substitution has had a limited impact on growth and redistribution of production factors,
implying a slow process of diversification. As expected, the relative price adjustment facilitated the import
substitution process (Figure 32), supporting production in several sectors. However, this impact was limited
due to a relatively low level of spare capacity (the capacity utilization level remained at historically high levels
in most tradable sectors) and limited availability of labor. As a result, the positive impact of import
substitution was not enough to compensate for the overall contraction in manufacturing of 1.7 percent y-o-y
in the first half of 2016; manufacturing contributed -0.2 pp to GDP growth during this period. Meanwhile,
there were sectors that demonstrated positive dynamics in manufacturing: food products, rubber, textiles,
leather, wood processing, chemicals, and machines and equipment (Figure 33). Another sector that

benefitted from relative price adjustment and counter sanctions was agriculture, exhibiting growth of 1.5
percent in the first half of 2016.

The limited diversification is also reflected in sluggish investment activities and limited growth in non-oil
exports. Only a few sectors reported investment growth in the first half of 2016 while others continued to
cut capital investment despite improved access to finance and high profits. For example, investment
contraction in manufacturing continued in the first half of 2016, which suggests further deterioration in the
capital base and a potentially negative impact on future productivity growth. The aggregate data shows
relatively slow export growth in 2015 and a contraction in Russia’s exports of goods and services in the first
half of 2016. While energy exports continued to be robust, slightly more than half of non-oil exports registered
contraction. In the first half of 2016, exports expanded in food products, wood products, textiles, and metals.
Crude oil prices are projected to average $43/bbl in 2016, a decline of 15 percent from last year, and
average $55/bbl in 2017. Consumption is expected to start exceeding production in 2017, particularly in the
second half of the year, and this will help reduce the large inventories. The forecast assumes OPEC will
succeed in limiting global production and that U.S. production will flatten out next year. However, there are
significant risks to the forecast, especially given uncertainties about the implementation of OPEC’s agreement
and the trajectory of inventories. Upside risks include a larger-than-expected OPEC cut and further outages
in some oil exporters (e.g., Libya, Nigeria, and Venezuela). Downside risks to prices center on weak demand,
earlier-than-expected return of lost production, and failure of OPEC to implement a meaningful reduction in
output.

We expect the economy to hit bottom during the second half of 2016 and then start recovering from 2017
onwards (Figure 34). Our estimates suggest that annual real GDP will contract by 0.6 percent in 2016, which
is smaller than our June 2016 forecast of -1.2 percent (upgraded from -1.9 percent forecasted in April). We
revised the growth estimate upwards because of more favorable terms of trade that began stimulating
domestic demand, even as external demand weakened (Table 7). The positive terms of trade effect, coupled
with more stable macroeconomic conditions, are expected to positively influence consumer and investor
sentiment, leading to a recovery of domestic demand and modest economic growth in 2017-18.

growth are expected to mostly benefit non-tradable
sectors, in particular the retail trade and financial sector, which in 2017-2018 are projected to become the
main contributors to growth on the production side. At the same time, the impact on tradable manufacturing
sectors (which produce consumer goods) could be limited due to the expected higher competition from
imports.
Aggregate investment demand is projected to be the second major growth driver, predominantly due to
inventory restocking starting in 2017 and continuing through 2018. The projected improvement in
household demand during 2017-2018 is expected to reverse the long-lasting cycle of inventory destocking,
with major producers already starting to replenish their stocks in 2017. This could boost overall investment
demand, supporting growth momentum in tradable manufacturing while also leading to higher imports.
Meanwhile, in the environment of sluggish global demand and remaining policy uncertainty, fixed capital
investment is projected to recover modestly by 2 percent y-o-y in 2017. Fixed investment growth will
accelerate to 4 percent y-o-y in 2018 when policy uncertainty subsides and external demand improves. The
lower cost of credit will also support the growth of fixed investment in 2018.
The contribution of net exports to growth will be negative in 2017 and 2018. Imports are expected to start
recovering in 2017 on a very low base and supported by an improvement in domestic demand, particularly
inventory restocking. As a result, the contribution of imports to growth will turn negative and is projected to
outweigh the positive contribution from exports, thus leading to an overall negative contribution of net
exports to GDP growth in both 2017 and 2018.
Moreover, fiscal consolidation measures are expected to narrow the consolidated deficit from 4.2 percent of
GDP in 2016 to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and 0.6 percent of GDP in 2018. The planned fiscal consolidation
will limit government capacity to support consumption through real increases in public sector wages. The

In terms of the poverty outlook, the poverty rate is expected to decrease because of lower inflation and a
recovery in private incomes. Despite the projected contraction of private consumption, the poverty rate is
likely to go down in 2016 to a level of 13 percent compared to 13.3 percent in 2015 (Figure 35). Nominal
incomes for the majority of the population will grow faster than the poverty line, bringing more people out
of poverty. Prices of products are expected to grow at a much slower pace in 2016 given the jump in prices in
early 2015. And we expect the poverty rate to continue decreasing in 2017 and 2018 to 12.2 and 11.8 percent
respectively. Lower inflation and higher wage growth (as the economy recovers) are contributing factors.

Vulnerability of the economy to external shocks requires the authorities to focus more on deepening
structural reforms. A variation in oil prices – 15 percent from the forecast, other things being equal—
produces the following growth paths for the economy: 0.7 percent for 2017 and 1.5 percent for 2018 for the
downward variation vs. 2.1 percent for 2017 and 1.7 percent for 2018 for the upward variation, underscoring
the sensitivity of the economy to fluctuations in oil prices. The current downturn should be used as an
opportunity for accelerating structural reforms, the pace of which has been slowed in the environment of
previously high commodity prices. Reducing the role of the state in the economy and intensifying institutional

reforms may help in fostering private-led growth that is paramount for more diversified and sustainable
development. Protecting property rights and ensuring the rule of law may bolster investor sentiment towards
Russia and provide an additional impetus to growth. Improving the regulatory framework and promoting fair
competition may improve the business environment for domestic and foreign investors and create a more
even playing field for doing business in Russia. The new norm of low oil prices leaves little room for delaying
efforts to transform Russia from a resource-dependent state to a more diversified private-sector-driven
economy.



    Part 3. Distributional Impact of Fiscal Policy over the Boom and
                               Downturn

Government spending played a large role in the reduction of poverty and in increasing the incomes of the
less well-off in Russia, particularly after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. While income growth was
driven primarily by rising labor income up to the crisis, fiscal transfers—mostly due to increases in pensions—
played a much more critical role after the crisis in sustaining income growth for households. Fiscal
consolidation pressures highlight the policy trade-offs that the country faces in protecting the income gains
achieved in recent years. Pensions and public wages are important sources of income for a large share of the
population. Given the tightening budget constraint, it will be important to make existing spending more
efficient and increase its effectiveness in reducing poverty, particularly given that the indication is that fiscal
consolidation measures have negatively affected the incomes of the less well-off and increased poverty. Russia
could achieve more redistribution for its current level of government spending and revenues. The magnitude
of the reduction of inequality by the fiscal system is similar to that of Japan and Estonia, and Russia performs
somewhat better than the United States, Turkey, Chile, Brazil, or Colombia in reducing inequality, but many
EU countries achieve a much higher reduction in inequality with fiscal policy. More redistribution in Russia
could be accomplished by implementing a broad mix of re-distributional benefits and taxes.5


3.1 Fiscal redistribution mainly takes place through pensions
Pensions make up a large share of government spending in Russia. Contributory pensions accounted for 22.7
percent of total general government spending, or 8.6 percent of GDP, in 2014. Other direct transfers account
for 3.6 percent of GDP and only a small fraction of them are means-tested (0.4 percent of GDP). Spending on
education and health is low: Russia invests less in education—4 percent of GDP—than the OECD average of
5.3 percent (OECD 2015), and there are unmet needs in areas such as the coverage of early childhood
development programs. In terms of the health sector, in 2014, public health spending in Russia was 3.5
percent of GDP, significantly lower than the OECD average of 6.5 percent of GDP (in 2013). This is of particular
concern given the relatively poor health outcomes (such as lower life expectancy, particularly for men) in
Russia compared to countries at its level of development.

The total reduction of inequality through the fiscal system is mainly due to pensions. Inequality of market
incomes, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is 0.48 and this falls to 0.30 (a decrease of 38 percent) after the
impact on incomes of taxes, transfers, and in-kind services in education and health are taken into account
(Table 8). Most of the inequality reduction comes through direct taxes and transfers, mainly pensions, which
reduce the Gini by 0.15 percentage points or 31 percent. Indirect taxes, which are regressive in Russia,
increase inequality slightly. In-kind transfers (i.e., education and health services) are—as is usually the case—
progressive, and in Russia they reduce the Gini by 3.7 percentage points.

Notes: There is a large difference in the redistributive impact of net direct taxes (moving from “market” to “disposable” inc ome)

In Russia, the tax system is much less effective in reducing inequality than government expenditures. Direct
taxes are almost neutral given the flat-rate personal income tax and thus contribute little to the decline in
inequality (Figure 36). Social insurance contributions additionally have little impact on inequality. As
contributions are paid only by formal workers who tend to earn more than informal workers, social security
contributions are, on average, slightly progressive. Indirect taxes—VAT and excises— which are important
taxes for the average household, are regressive and make up a high share of revenues.

The bottom six deciles are net beneficiaries of the tax-benefit system if in-kind health and education
services are included. The top four deciles are net payers to the system, with their tax contributions being
greater than the benefits they receive. The flat personal income tax system limits the redistribution through
the fiscal system: the richer seventh to tenth deciles pay a similar share of income (around 30 percent) in
personal income tax and social security contributions. Government transfers dominate incomes for the lower

3.2 Government spending has been the main driver of incomes
In the 2010–2014 period, increases in the indexation of pensions and public wages have played an
important role in raising incomes of households across the distribution (Figure 38). The largest contribution
to income came from pensions, which accounted for 3.6 percentage points out of the total of 8.1 percent

                                                                                                                              33
income growth for the bottom four deciles of the income distribution and 3.1 percentage points out of the
total 6.2 percent growth for the top six deciles. Public wages were the second most important source of
income growth, contributing 2.8 and 1.7 percentage points to income growth for the bottom 40 percent and
top 60 percent of the income distribution, respectively. Private incomes, including wages in the private sector
and income from business and property, only accounted for about one-third of total income growth in the
period 2005–2014.
Income from the government budget became more important for both the poorer and richer population
groups over time. Before the 2008–2009 financial crisis, pensions accounted for almost 9 percentage points
of the 16 percent rise in incomes of households in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. However,
pensions only contributed marginally to the incomes of the top 60 percent (Figure 38). By contrast, from 2008-
2010 (during and immediately after the crisis), generous indexation6 moved many households with
pensioners to the middle of the distribution. As a result, the top income deciles benefited from the increase
in pensions in this period, especially the “pensions valorization” that took place in 2010. After 2010, pensions
again became the main driver of incomes of the bottom four income deciles, as other sources of incomes
showed little growth.

Faster growth of pensions and public sector wages, together with the relatively low growth of private
incomes, means households are dependent on the public sector for incomes. The share of incomes from the
public sector (wages in public sector, pensions, and other transfers) was relatively stable and high for
households in the bottom four income deciles over 2008-14 (Figure 39), at around 60 percent. The income
share of the top five deciles coming from the public sector grew due to pension increases. The share of public
wages in overall income remains high and relatively equal across the income distribution, at around 25-30
percent for all deciles. In short, households in all income groups, including the bottom deciles, are very

 During 2008–2009, pensions rose by 10 to 20 percent in real terms. In 2010, a major increase (through valorization
which extended coverage) boosted pensions by 35 percent in real terms.

3.3 Potential for fiscal policy to reduce poverty and inequality
The priority in the short to medium-term is to protect the poor and less well-off from the potential negative
impacts of the fiscal and economic downturn. There is room for re-targeting existing social protection
spending to achieve a larger reduction in poverty and inequality. Fiscal savings could be made by reducing
spending on non-means tested benefits. Budget resources could be re-oriented toward programs aimed at
reducing poverty: the estimated cost of eliminating poverty through a cash transfer to bring everyone in the
population above the subsistence minimum poverty threshold is 0.8 percent of GDP, illustrating that
eliminating poverty in Russia is within reach. The two main caveats to this estimation, however, are (i) it
assumes perfect targeting, and (ii) it also assumes no behavioral change: all workers with a salary below the
subsistence minimum level stay employed. In reality, this program would provide a significant disincentive
for anyone with a salary below the subsistence minimum threshold to work. Additionally, the program could
incentivize workers to enter the informal labor market, and thus be paid in cash while still applying for the
program. Apart from cash benefits, it will be important to monitor what is happening in the broader financing
environment for social sector spending, including spending on education and health.
Advanced economies tend to reduce inequality through fiscal policy to a much greater extent than less rich
countries. Such policies can be justified from a growth perspective (see Ostry et al. 2014 for further
discussion); for instance, high inequality, together with borrowing constraints, can prevent the poor from
investing in physical and human capital, leading to reduced growth potential for an economy (for more on
this argument see Galor and Zeira 1993, and Banerjee and Newman 1993). Achieving more redistribution
would of course have to be done at a minimum cost to economic efficiency. Poorly targeted redistribution
policies are wasteful and create inefficiencies: expensive consumption subsidies targeted at the general
population are an example. But fiscal policies focused on redistribution also have the potential to reduce
inefficiencies in the economy and enhance growth: for example, government support aimed at enhancing
human capital of poorer households can increase the potential for economic growth. When it comes to

                                                                                                              35
putting in place redistributive fiscal tools, it is important to examine the overall cost and their potential for
creating economic efficiency.
While Russia achieves a moderate reduction in inequality through fiscal policy compared to other countries,
over time, the country could achieve a bigger impact through a change in the structure of revenues and
expenditures. The fiscal system of Russia has a similar impact on income inequality as that of Japan and
Estonia, and a larger impact than that of the United States, Turkey, Chile, Brazil, or Colombia (Figure 40).
However, European Union countries such as Belgium, Germany, and Ireland end up with a much lower level
of inequality after fiscal policy. This does not necessarily entail a much larger size of government; for example,
Ireland achieves almost double the reduction in inequality due to fiscal policy compared to Russia with a
similar share of government spending in GDP (Figure 41). Ireland achieves this due to significant spending on
means-tested benefits and redistribution through direct taxes and social security contributions. Benefits and
direct income taxes typically play an important role in countries where fiscal policy substantially reduces
inequality. The structure of taxes and benefits can differ, but where there is a large reduction in inequality
due to fiscal policy, there generally is a broad mix of re-distributional benefits and taxes. Means-tested
benefits are more effective in reducing inequality than non-means tested benefits. Direct taxes can also be a
powerful tool for redistribution.

Shifting tax revenues away from regressive indirect taxes to more progressive direct taxes could improve
progressivity while raising revenues. A restructuring of the tax system could aim to not only increase non-oil
revenues, but also rebalance corporate and personal income taxes to improve equity. Going forward, there
are several directions that a rebalancing of revenues in favor of non-oil sources may take, including continued
improvements in compliance, an examination of the small business tax regime, and exploring options for
increasing revenues from the personal income and corporate income taxes (e.g., through the introduction of
a progressive personal income tax, a tax rebate for low-income workers, and/or a broadening of the corporate
income tax base).
The pensions system has played an important social safety net in Russia but is under fiscal strain. Given
demographic trends, alleviating fiscal pressures from the pension system will require significant reforms
(Onder and Fernandez 2015). Short-run fiscal gains can be obtained through such measures as restricting the
pensions of working pensioners, means-testing the social pension, introducing and expanding deferment for
early retirement, abolishing privileged contribution rates, and broadening the contribution base. In the
medium to long-term, efforts such as raising the retirement age, eliminating privileged regimes, minimizing
early retirement, and introducing a functional disability assessment system can also contribute to the
sustainability of the public pensions system. Policies additionally have to focus on reducing the high growth
in informality that has occurred in Russia; not only would this improve pension sustainability, but it would
also reduce the vulnerability of low-income workers with inadequate social insurance coverage.
