      1       Introduction
      1.1     OVERVIEW OF THE ESMAP PROGRAMME

              ESMAP (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program) is a technical assistance program managed by the
              World Bank and supported by 11 bilateral donors. ESMAP launched in January 2013 an initiative to support the
              efforts of countries to improve the knowledge of renewable energy resources (REN), establish appropriate
              institutional framework for the development of REN and provide "free access" to geospatial resources and data.
              This initiative will also support the IRENA-GlobalAtlas program by improving data availability and quality,
              consulted through an interactive atlas.

              This study "Renewable Energy Resource Mapping: Small Hydro Madagascar", is part of a technical assistance
              project funded by ESMAP, implemented by the World Bank in Madagascar (the "Client"), which aims to support
              mapping resources and geospatial planning for small hydropower. It is conducted in close coordination with the
              Ministry of Energy, the Electricity Regulation Office (ERO), Development Agency of Rural Electrification (DARE)
              and JIRAMA.

      1.2     OBJECTVES, RESULTS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE STUDY

              The objectives of the Study are:

                    To improve the quality and availability of the information related to hydropower resource in Madagascar ;

                    To undertake a detailed review and update of the small hydropower potential (1-20 MW) ;

                    To formulate recommendations regarding where small hydro can be implemented in regards to energy
                     sector planning in the country.

              The expected results of the Study are:

                    A consolidated data in a Geographical Information System (GIS) ;

                    A thematic Atlas on Hydropower in Madagascar with an emphasis on Small Hydro (1-20 MW) ;

                    Recommendations to develop the small hydropower sector in Madagascar.

              The ESMAP Study is divided into three phases:

                    PHASE 1 : Preliminary resource mapping based on spatial analysis and site visits

                    PHASE 2 : Ground-based data collection

                    PHASE 3 : Production of a validated resource Atlas that combines cartographic and ground-based data

              In the specific context of the Small Hydro Resource Mapping Study in Madagascar, those 3 phases have been
              broken down into 4 Activities;

                    Activity 1 : Data collection and production of Hydro Atlas, review and validation of small hydro potential

                    Activity 2 : Small hydro electrification planning

                    Activity 3 : Small hydro prioritization, site visits and workshop

                    Activity 4 : Data collection and final validation (HydroAtlas update / hydrological monitoring campaign /
                     additional geological and environmental field investigations)

      1.3     OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT

              This report is delivered in the context of Phase 2 (Ground based data collection) and aims at providing an
              overview of the hydrological monitoring network set up in the context of this study as well as providing a
              commentary on the hydrological data collected.

              The objective of this activity (Activity 4-B: Data collection and final validation – Hydrological Monitoring) is to carry
              out a hydrological monitoring campaign on 6 rivers considered as being a priority for the development of small
              hydropower projects in Madagascar. Those measurements will substantially improve the hydrological knowledge
              of Madagascar areas that have not been monitored in the past. Hydrological measurements will in particular
              reduce the uncertainties for the two pre-feasibility studies carried out in the framework of Activity 4.

              The selection process of these six rivers took place in the previous phases of the project and has been validated
              during the workshop held on the 11th of March 2015 at the Ministère de l’Energie et des Hydrocarbures in
              Antananarivo.

              The hydrological monitoring campaign does not only include the acquisition and installation of water level
              measuring equipments but also the establishment of preliminary rating curves (the relationship between the water
              level measured and discharge in the river) for each site by gauging operations on the field.

              The flow measurement campaign has covered one hydrological year (12 months from October 2015 to October
              2016) and deliver (i) validated time series of water level measurements with a daily time step (ii) preliminary
              rating curves (relationship between the water level and the discharge in the river) for each of the six monitoring
              sites.

              Finally, knowledge transfer and capacity building to the beneficiary Malagasy institutions has been carried out
              throughout the duration of the activities with dedicated training sessions and the participation to the installation,
              operation and maintenance and gauging field missions.

              The location of the 6 stations is presented in Tableau 1 and Figure 1 below.

      2.1     DEFINITION OF THE FINAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HYDROLOGICAL MONITORING STATIONS AND OF THE
              EQUIPMENT

              The mission was held in Madagascar from the 28th of June to the 10th of
              July 2015. The objective was to accurately locate the sites where the
              hydrological monitoring stations and equipments will be installed. Hence, a
              field visit of each site has been carried out to assess the following criteria:
              access to the gauging site, hydraulic conditions, security,
              representativeness, installation layout and GSM/GPRS network coverage,
              in order to define the most appropriate technology to be used for each site,
              taking into account its particular context.

              During the mission, five sites were visited (access to site SF196 was not
              possible due to unfavorable weather conditions which had led to the                     Figure 2. Experts evaluating the
              closure of the access road (RN24)). For each site, river sections complying           hydraulic conditions of a river reach
              with the criteria of representativeness, ease of access, favorable hydraulic
              conditions, etc were successfully found.

              The decision was made and endorsed by the Direction Générale de la Météo to standardize the equipment and
              layout of the six gauging stations. It is worth mentioning that the standardization of the equipments will benefit
              both the operation and maintenance of the gauging stations.

              The following report has been delivered in the context of that activity: “REPORT ON THE DEFINITION OF THE
              FINAL CHARACTERISTICS OF GAUGING STATIONS AND OF THE EQUIPMENT”. The report has been
              accepted and validated by the World Bank in October 2015.

      2.2     INSTALLATION OF THE EQUIPMENTS

                                                         Upon receipt and clearance of the equipments shipped to Madagascar, the
                                                         installation mission took place from the 16th to the 29th of October 2015
                                                         under the supervision of SHER Ingénieurs-Conseils. The six monitoring
                                                         stations have been installed successfully by two teams working in parallel in
                                                         order to increase the efficiency of the mission and thus reduce the duration
                                                         of the installation period. In order to standardize the installation procedure
                                                         of the six stations, one station has been installed by the two teams together.

                                                         Due to different hydrologic conditions compared to the pre-installation
                                                         mission, the decision had been made to slightly modify the position of the
                                                         staff gauges and sensors in order to ensure the monitoring of the water
                                                         level during extreme low flow periods

              During the installation period, at least one riparian custodian has been selected at
              each site in order to minimize the risk of vandalism to the installed equipment.

              Also, one local operator has been trained to read the water level on the staff
              gauges and record the readings at least twice a day (at 06.00 am and 06.00 pm) in
              a notebook. An example is presented in the right-hand side picture. Those
              readings are useful to validate the automatic measurements recorded by the
              datalogger and will serve as a backup in case of hardware problems.


              The frequency of data recording is as follow: the water level is measured              Figure 6. Water level
              automatically every minute and the averages over the last 15 minutes are stored in readings recorded in the field
              the datalogger. This aims at minimizing the impact of a punctual phenomenon that               book
              would occur only at the time of measurement.

              The table below summarizes the key features of the equipment installed at the various sites. As explained earlier,
              the decision had been made to standardize the equipment and layout of the six gauging stations in order to
              facilitate both the operation and maintenance of the gauging stations.

      2.3     MAINTENANCE MISSIONS

              Field control is an important operation in order to guarantee a proper operation of the
              gauging stations and hence a good quality of the measurements. As planned at the
              design stage of the hydrological monitoring campaign, an average time span between
              two visits of the same site is two months. The objective of those visits is to undertake
              routine maintenance operations and data collection (data download from the memory of
              the data logger and copy of the observed data recorded by the local operator).

              During those visits, basic maintenance operations were carried and data retrieved from
              both the datalogger and the field notebook.                                            Figure 7. Data download and

      2.4     ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRELIMINARY RATING CURVES

              The establishment of a flow rating curve at a specific site is done from flow
              measurements at different moments of the year, representing (ideally) all the
              hydrological conditions met at the measurement site (during both the dry and flood
              seasons). Flow measurement (gauging) is a field operation during which the river
              flow is calculated from the measure of water velocities at different water depths
              along the cross section of the river. Associated with a water level measurement,
              the gauging operation enables the determination of a common point between the
              water level and the river flow at that location (one unique point of the rating curve).   Figure 8. Jaugeage de la

              Sixty (60) gauging operations have been successfully carried out on the 6
              monitored rivers using an ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profile). The measurement principle is based on the
              classical verticals process. With this method, the cross-section of the flow is divided into numerous verticals (the
              number depends on the geometry of the river). At each vertical, the ADCP measures the water depth and the
                                                                       vertical velocity distribution. The data obtained are then
                                                                       used in a mathematical process to calculate the average

                                                                       discharge segment defined in accordance with EN ISO
                                                                       748 (mid section method). The complete discharge is
                                                                       calculated as the sum of all partial discharges after
                                                                       completing the measurement of all verticals. The ADCP
                                                                       is positioned at the vertical to be measured using a cable
                                                                       crossing the river and pulleys installed on the two river

              In addition to this training, a person from the Direction Générale de la Météorologie took part in almost all the
              maintenance missions of the stations as well as in the gauging missions of the rivers. This training on the field
              has enabled a sustainable reinforcement of the capacities as well as the acquisition of the theoretical and
              practical knowledge which will make it possible to contribute to the sustainability of the monitoring network put in
              place.

      2.6     PROVISIONAL COMMISSIONING OF THE INSTALLED EQUIPMENT

              The mission took place in Madagascar from the 27th of January to the 10th of February 2016. The objective was
              to visit the six monitoring sites and establish a detailed record of provisional commissioning of the equipment
              installed.

      2.7     FINAL COMMISSIONING OF THE INSTALLED EQUIPMENT

              As per our terms of references, the sole ownership
              of the equipment has been transferred to the
              Ministère de l’Energie et des Hydrocarbures at the
              end of one year of hydrological monitoring. Hence,
              a final commissioning mission was held in
              Madagascar from the 22nd of October to the 2nd of
              November 2016. The objective was to visit the six
              monitoring sites and establish a detailed record of
              the installed equipment for the transfer of the
              ownership. The reports are presented in Annex 1
              of this report.

              It is worth mentioning that after 8 months of
              continuous monitoring of the six rivers, the     Figure 15. Delivery of keys by the Consultant to the
              decision had been made to keep 4 automatic Representative of the Ministère de l’Energie et des Hydrocarbures
              monitoring stations running while pursuing with                (station on the Namorona)
              daily readings only (by the operator) on the two
              other stations.

              After more than 8 months of hydrological monitoring of the six rivers, SHER drew the attention of the du Ministère
              de l’Energie et des Hydrocarbures and the World Bank on the problems of vandalism and theft on certain stations
              in order to jointly establish a hydrological monitoring system adapted to the needs of the Ministry and which will
              continue beyond the duration of this study.

              From the start of the hydrological monitoring campaign, SHER has put in place the following measures to ensure
              the safety of the installations:

                        construction of enclosures around the facilities;

                        commitment of a custodian and observer from the local population;

                        construction of shelters with padlocks around the box (itself secured by a key locking system) containing
                         the datalogger and the battery;

                        awareness raising of local populations and authorities (Fokontany chiefs, gendarmerie);

                        regular visits of the sites by the project team (with an interval of maximum 2 months between each visit).

              Despite these provisions, the monitoring sites on the Marimbona (twice), the Sandrastriona and the Sahatandra
              have been the subject of acts of vandalism and theft.

              In addition to the very high financial costs, the reinstallation of the equipment after an act of vandalism has shown
              its limits: evidenced by the second vandalism that took place on the Marimbona site a few months after its
              reinstallation. This is confirmed by our past similar experience in other countries.

              Bearing in mind that the ownership of the equipment will be transmitted to the Ministère de l’Energie et des
              Hydrocarbures and its associated agencies at the end of the monitoring campaign and with a view to ensuring
              that the hydrometric measurements continued beyond that date, the campaign has been adapted as follows:

                        The four monitoring stations with automatic water level recording equipement (Fanovana
                         [Sandratsiona], Chute Andriamanjavona [Namorona], SF196 [Besana], Ambohimanga du Sud
                         [Manandriana]) continue to be operated as initially planned.

                        For stations on the Marimbona and Sahatandra rivers, it was decided not to re-install equipment for the
                         automatic acquisition of water levels, but to continue to make water level measurements by the local
                         observer (three times a day) and to continue regular visits to the site to establish the preliminary rating
                         curves in order to be able to use the measurements recorded since the installation of the station.

                        The automatic acquisition equipment provided for these two stations would nevertheless be provided to
                         the Ministère de l’Energie et des Hydrocarbures and its associated agencies and could therefore be
                         installed by them on other rivers of interest or used as spare equipment for the maintenance of
                         operational stations.

              This proposal to maintain 4 automatic monitoring stations, two manual stations and two spare stations is based
              on a discussion conducted with the Direction Générale de la Météorologie, the World Bank and on the basis of
              our experience in other countries. It is part of an objective to strengthen the hydrological monitoring network in
              Madagascar. Indeed, the field constraints in Madagascar (long distances, poor condition of the road network)
              shows that in general, the maintenance and operation of monitored sites is constrained in a context of limited
              human and financial resources. This is especially true for the Fotsialanana sites on the Marimbona,
              Ambatoharanana on the Sandratsiona and Ambohimanga du Sud on the Manandriana whose access is
              particularly difficult, requiring the rental of canoes for some, motorcycles for others, or several days of trekking for
              another. It will be noted that among these sites are the two problematic sites with regard to the acts of vandalism

              et des Hydrocarbures at the end of this study, we do believe that it would be appropriate to keep the automatic
              stations in more accessible locations and to maintain the stations with only an observer for the less accessible
              sites.

      3.1.1 Preliminary Rating Curve

              A preliminary rating curve of the station was established on the basis of 11 gauging performed with the ADCP,
              the details of which are presented in Figure 17 below. These gauging cover a range of streamflows measured
              between 2.44 m³/s and 12.65 m³/s and have been carried out in good conditions. The preliminary rating curve
              covers an interesting range of water level but should be complemented, especially in the water level range above
              0.40m in order to confirm and improve the relationship.

      3.1.2 Comments

              The streamflow calculated using the preliminary rating curve shown in Figure 17 are presented below. Figure 18
              shows the evolution of average daily flows during the hydrological year 2015-2016. It is observed that the winter
              season of 2015-2016 (corresponding to the rainy season and cyclones) is characterized by a late start (mid-
              December), a fairly low amplitude and a lack of flood during the month of February when this one is usually the
              wettest months. The low flow season started late, around the end of July.

              Figure 18 also shows the measured maximum and minimum daily flows. We note that the peaks are generally
              high during the winter, but have a very limited duration in time (a few tens of minutes). Hence, the latter have a
              limited impact on the daily average.

              The monthly hydrograph is shown in Figure 19. It represents the monthly averages of the daily flows shown in
              Figure 18 and Table 2. It shows that the highest daily peaks occurred during January while, on average, the
              streamflow was higher during the month of June 2016. The month of February 2016 is the seventh month (in
              terms of highest streamflow) of the year, confirming the absence of significant floods and rain during this month.

      3.2.1 Preliminary Rating Curve

              A preliminary rating curve was established based on 11 ADCP gauging, the details of which are shown in Figure
              21 below. These gauging cover a range of streamflow measured between 7.25 m³/s and 44.83 m³/s and have
              been carried out under good conditions. The preliminary rating curve covers an interesting range of water level
              but should be complemented over the entire water level range in order to confirm and improve the relationship
              which presents some deviations from the gauging.

      3.2.2 Comments

              The streamflow calculated using the preliminary rating curve shown in Figure 21 are presented below. Figure 22
              shows the evolution of average daily streamflows during the hydrological year 2015-2016. It is observed that the
              winter of 2015-2016 is also characterized by a lack of flood during the period from mid-January to mid-February
              when this period is generally the wettest. The low-flow season started late, around mid-July.

              Figure 22 shows the measured daily maximum and minimum flows. It is noted that the peaks of flood are
              generally high during the winter, but have a very limited duration in time (a few tens of minutes). Indeed, the latter
              have a limited impact on the daily average.

      3.3     BESANA RIVER AT MAHATSARA

      3.3.1 Preliminary Rating Curve

              A preliminary rating curve of the station was established on the basis of 11 gauging performed with the ADCP,
              the details of which are presented in Figure 25 below. These gauging cover a range of streamflows measured
              between 1.08 m³/s and 10.627 m³/s and were carried out under good conditions. The preliminary rating curve
              covers a interesting range of water level but has gaps in the range of water levels above 0.30m. Indeed, few
              floods occurred in 2015-2016 on the Besana River, and the seasonal variability of its water level was very low
              during this hydrological year, as shown in Figure 26. Additional gauges will be necessary in order to improve the
              quality of this relationship.

      3.3.2 Comments

              The streamflows calculated using the preliminary rating curve shown in Figure 25 are presented below. Figure 26
              shows the evolution of average daily streamflows during the hydrological year 2015-2016. It is observed that
              winter 2015-2016 is characterized by some small floods between November and February, absence of floods in
              April and May, and some small floods in May and June. The winter season is therefore very limited on the
              Besana River during the hydrological year 2015-2016.

              The graph in Figure 26 also shows the measured daily maximum and minimum flows. It is noted that the peaks of
              flood are generally high, but have a very limited duration in time (a few tens of minutes). Indeed, the latter have a
              limited impact on the daily average.

              The monthly hydrograph is shown in Figure 27. It represents the monthly averages of the daily flows shown in
              Figure 26 and Table 4. It shows that the highest daily peaks occurred during the month of March, corresponding
              with the month for which the streamflow was on average the largest. It is also noticed that the seasonality of flows
              is very small for the hydrological year 2015-2016.

      3.4.1 Preliminary Rating Curve

              A preliminary rating curve of the station was established on the basis of 10 gauging performed with the ADCP,
              the details of which are presented in Figure 29 below. These gauging cover a range of streamflows measured
              between 4.21 m³/s and 12.68 m³/s and have been produced in good conditions. The preliminary rating curve
              shows gaps in the measured water level range and extrapolations were required for the calculation of stramflow
              above 13 m³/s and the results presented in the following sections are therefore to be considered with caution.
              Additional gauges will be needed to improve the quality of this relationship.

      3.4.2 Comments

              The streamflow calculated using the preliminary rating curve shown in Figure 29 are presented below. It also
              highlights the daily maximum and minimum flows measured. It is noted that the peaks of flood are generally high,
              but have a very limited duration in time (a few tens of minutes). Indeed, the latter have a limited impact on the
              daily average.

              Figure 30 shows the evolution of average daily flows during the hydrological year 2015-2016. As mentioned in
              the previous paragraph, these streamflow values should be considered with caution given the reduced quality of
              the preliminary rating curve. It is observed that the winter of 2015-2016 is characterized by a lack of flood during
              the end of January 2016 and the first part of February 2016 whereas this period is generally the wettest. The low-
              flow season started late, around mid-July, although the frequency of floods has decreased sharply since the end
              of March.

              level but should be supplemented in order to improve the quality and reduce the observed variability.

      3.5.2 Comments

              The streamflow calculated using the preliminary rating curve shown in Figure 33 are shown below. Figure 34
              shows the evolution of average daily streamflows during the hydrological year 2015-2016. It is observed that the
              winter 2015-2016 is characterized by a very dry period during the months of November and December. The
              beginning of the rainy season is well marked at the end of December with significant floods during the month of
              January and the first half of February. Secondly, floods are less intense and their frequency decreases.

              Figure 34 also shows the measured maximum and minimum daily flows. It is noted that the peak floods are
              generally high and unlike the previous sites, have a significant duration and therefore have a significant impact on
              the daily average. This is due, among other things, to the size of the watershed, which is significantly larger than
              the other watersheds studied in the previous sections.

              The monthly hydrograph is shown in Figure 35. It represents the monthly averages of the daily streamflows
              shown in Figure 34 and Table 6. It shows that the highest daily peaks occurred during January and that the
              Sandratsiona River has a sustained flow throughout the year.

      3.6     MARIMBONA RIVER AT FOTSIALANANA

      3.6.1 Preliminary note

              The hydrological monitoring station on the Marimbona River encountered several difficulties that did not allow us
              to obtain measurements during a complete hydrological year. Despite of the provisions made to minimize the risk
              of data losses (see previous chapter and conclusions below), this site has been the subject of several acts of
              vandalism, with total loss of equipment twice. Also, we faced difficulties to find a reliable observer. Hence, did not
              manage to obtain reliable measurements beyond the month of June 2016.

              Given all the difficulties encountered on this monitoring site, we recommend that you do not continue the
              measurements at that location.

      3.6.2 Preliminary Rating Curve

              A preliminary rating curve of the station was established on the basis of 10 gauging performed with the ADCP,
              the details of which are shown in Figure 37 below. These gauging cover a range of stramflows measured
              between 34.54 m³/s and 94.98 m³/s and were carried out for the most part in good conditions. The preliminary
              rating curve covers a good range of water level but should be complemented in order to improve the quality and
              reduce the variability observed, particularly for high flows. Flood flows greater than 95 m³/s were calculated on
              the basis of an extrapolation of the preliminary rating curve.

      3.6.3 Comments

              The streamflow calculated using the preliminary rating curve shown in Figure 37 are presented below. Figure 38
              shows the evolution of average daily flows during the hydrological year 2015-2016. It is observed that the winter
              2015-2016 is characterized by a very dry period during the months of November and December (prolonged low
              and late start of the rainy season). The beginning of the rainy season is well marked early January with significant
              floods during the month of January and the first half of February. Secondly, floods are less intense and their
              frequency decreases.

              Figure 38 also shows the measured daily maximum and minimum flows. It is noted that the peak floods are
              generally high and unlike the previous sites, have a significant duration and therefore have a significant impact on
              the daily average. This is due to the size of the watershed, which is much larger than the other watersheds
              studied in the previous sections (the same situation as the Sandratsiona watershed).

              The results obtained over the measurement period are presented in the following figures but the analysis cannot
              be carried out over the whole hydrological year for the reasons explained in section 3.6.1. For these same
              reasons, a flow duration curve could not be established for this site.

      3.7     COMMENTS ON THE HYDROLOGICAL YEAR 2015-2016

              El Niño is a natural phenomenon characterized by the abnormal warming of sea surface temperatures (SST) in
              the central and eastern regions along the equatorial Pacific Ocean. On average, it occurs every 2 to 7 years and
              can last up to 18 months. El Niño has significant environmental and climate impacts at the global scale. In some
              areas, this can lead to reduced rainfall and drought, while other areas are subject to intense rainfall and flooding.
              Climatologists have announced that the event El Niño 2015-2016 could be the most severe ever recorded.

              In Madagascar, an extreme drought hit the south of the country directly affecting agriculture production and
              access to water, which led to severe problems on human health and nutrition. Four southern districts recorded
              below-average precipitation that occurs statistically every 20 years prior to April 2016 and precipitation since April
              2016 in two districts arrived too late for the June crop harvest. The northern part of the country has been affected
              by extreme precipitation, causing numerous floods.

              The map below (Figure 40) shows the differences in precipitation that occurred between October 2015 and
              February 2016 compared to the 1982-2011 average. It is observed that the watersheds studied in this
              hydrological monitoring campaign are all in the zone where precipitation deficits are more or less severe.

      4       Conclusions and recommendations
              Six hydrometric stations have been successfully installed on the selected six rivers of Madagascar which have
              allowed the monitoring of the water level and the establishment of the preliminary rating curves of those rivers.

              Those records cover one complete hydrological year, from October 2015 to October 2016 which appears to be
              particularly dry. Hence, it is important to continue the monitoring of the rivers in order to obtain a better
              understanding of the dynamics of the rivers during normal and wet years. It is indeed only with long periods of
              records (over 20 years) that hydrological information is most valuable for the design of infrastructure such as
              hydropower scheme.

              As mentioned earlier, the rating curves that have been established in the context of this study are preliminary
              results. Indeed, flow duration curves are dynamics and can evolve over time due to for instance the modification
              of the geometry of the river bed. The establishment of a good rating curve spans over several years in order to
              have a good understanding of the measurement site given the observed hydrological conditions. It is therefore
              highly recommended that gauging of the rivers continues beyond the duration of this study in order to confirm the
              preliminary results and reduce the uncertainties associated with those measurements.

              It is strongly recommended that the Government of Madagascar set up a hydrological monitoring network for its
              rivers with high hydropower potential in order to better understand the available water resources and thus
              promote the development of hydroelectric projects across the country. It is only in a context of reduced
              uncertainties through reliable, recent and long-term records (more than 20 years) that technical parameters and
              economic and financial analyzes of hydroelectric developments can be defined accurately, enabling optimization
              of their design and their flood control infrastructure (temporary and permanent).

              However, we appreciate that the Malagasy Institutions have very limited resources, from both financial and
              equipment perspectives, to undertake the required maintenance, operation and gauging of the rivers which may
              jeopardize the sustainability of the hydrological monitoring network.

              Based on a 12 months period of continuous monitoring of the water level of 6 rivers, the major challenges that
              have been encountered are summarized in the Table below alongside with the responses adopted by SHER
              Ingénieurs-Conseils.

                                                      1) Capacity building to the Malagasy institutions:

                                                       Formal training sessions like the one described in the previous chapter
                                                        ;
                                                       Hands-on training during all phases of the monitoring campaign
                                                        through the active attendance to the installation of the equipments,

                                                          be extremely challenging due to the extremely poor conditions of the
                                                          secondary roads network (tracks). The situation is exacerbated during
                                                          the wet season.

                                                        from a world leading provider of equipments.


                                                     1) Awareness raising to the riparians and local authorities;
                                                     2) Presence of custodians and local observers to watch the equipments;
                                                     3) Regular site visits by the Project Team;
                                                     4) Building of dissuasive physical means against vandalism (fences and

                                                        Antananarivo in order to quickly reinstall site that would be vandalized.
                                                     6) Local presence (Artelia Madagascar) that allow us to quickly mobilize a

                                                     Despite the awareness raising carried out during the pre-installation and
                                                     installation missions, the presence of local custodians and dissuasive

                                                     gauging stations: Marimbona in November 2015 and Sanatanora in March
                                                     2016.

                                                     Despite the lack of mobile network coverage, the project team has been
                                                     informed very quickly by the custodians (within a few days) and has been
                                                     mobilized quickly to establish an official report with the local authorities

              the equipments after a flood event.    The preventive measure of having written daily readings of the staff
                                                     gauges has minimized the impact of those acts of vandalism on the
                                                     continuous monitoring of the water level.

                                                     Following the acts of vandalism, we have reinforced the security of the
                                                     sites by building light constructions (see pictures below) to protect the box
