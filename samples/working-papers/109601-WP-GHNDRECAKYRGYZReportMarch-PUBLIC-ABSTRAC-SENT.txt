KEY MESSAGES
To accelerate progress toward achieving Kyrgyz Republic’s national HIV targets, the
effectiveness of the HIV response could be enhanced through four measures:

1. The coverage of ART should be increased substantially and investment in ART
   increased approximately four-fold because fully achieving national targets will require
   an increase from 13 percent of PLHIV covered in 2013 to 79 percent covered in 2020.
2. Coverage of programs for PWID needs to be further increased, needle-syringe
   programs (NSP) further expanded using HIV resources, and opioid substitution therapy
   (OST) expanded with cofinancing from other sectors.
3. Programs for FSW and PMTCT need to be sustained by at least approximately current
   coverage, and MSM programs need to be scaled up. Considering unit costs from other
   countries, reducing unit cost in these programs without compromising quality should be
   possible and is necessary for these programs to be cost effective.
4. Additional technical efficiency analysis is required to review the 56 percent of HIV
   spending going into management and other costs. These costs could not be included in the
   optimization analysis because their impact on incidence and deaths is indirect or not
   quantifiable.
Optimized allocation of current resources (US$12.6 million) would avert 28 percent of new
infections and 53 percent of deaths over 2015–20. Optimized allocation to achieve national
targets (with reduced management cost (US$16 million) would avert 65 percent of new
infections and 63 percent of deaths, translating to 4,200 new infections and 2,300 deaths
averted between 2015 and 2020.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
An HIV allocative efficiency (AE) analysis was conducted to inform strategic investment in the
Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV response.

The Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV epidemic is transitioning from an early concentrated epidemic
among people who inject drugs (PWID) into an advanced concentrated HIV epidemic1
with continued transmission among PWID, but an increasing share of sexual
transmission to female partners of PWID and among men who have sex with men (MSM). The
Optima model projects that, with current spending, the estimated 1,000 annual new infections
in 2014 will increase to 1,100, and estimated deaths from 400 in 2014 to 600 deaths per year
on average, over 2015–20. The total number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is projected to
increase from 8,400 in 2014 to 10,200 by 2020.

Optimizing allocations of the level of resources available in 2013 would substantially
reduce new HIV infections by 28 percent and deaths by 53 percent by 2020. Optimization
analysis suggests that this additional impact would be achieved primarily by reallocating
resources to 2 program areas: a 300 percent increase in investment in antiretroviral
therapy (ART) and a moderate increase in coverage of prevention programs for PWID,
particularly needle-exchange programs. Nevertheless, despite the large efficiency gains
through reallocations, the national targets to reduce both deaths and new infections by 50
percent by 2020 cannot be fully achieved with current resources.

The top priority in the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV response is to substantially increase the
allocation to, and coverage of, ART. In 2013, only 7 percent of the total national HIV
spending was allocated to ART, covering 13 percent of the total estimated PLHIV. With
optimized allocations to fully achieve national targets, investment in ART would quadruple––
from US$0.9 million to US$3.7 million––accompanied by increased investment in HTC from
US$0.8 million to US$1.3 million. This level of spending would cover 6,700 PLHIV on ART,
which translates to coverage of over 75 percent of all PLHIV and averting 2,300 deaths over
2015–20.

The second priority in the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV epidemic is to sustain and expand
coverage of programs for PWID. Although the share of new infections due to needle-sharing
has declined to less than 50 percent of all infections, programs for this group remain critical
due to the large potential for epidemic growth among PWID in the absence of programs.

According to the limited data available, HIV transmission among MSM is a small, but also
the fastest growing, segment of the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV epidemic. Focused, technically

1
    “Advanced concentrated HIV epidemic” here describes an epidemic in which HIV transmission remains related to
    key populations but in which shifts in the mode of transmission within key populations have occurred. In several
    countries of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Region (ECA), initially, the largest mode of HIV transmission
    among PWID was needle sharing. More recently, the proportion of sexual transmission has grown. However,
    because sexual transmission remains concentrated among key populations and their sexual partners, these
    epidemics are not generalized.

xii                                                                             Optimizing investments in the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV response



              efficient programs for MSM should expand their coverage to achieve national targets. Although
              female sex workers (FSW) and their clients contribute to less 5 percent of new infections in the
              Kyrgyz Republic, FSW remain a group that should continue to be reached. To fully achieve the
              target of reducing sexual transmission by 50 percent, programs for FSW would need to be
              sustained at current levels of investment but at a reduced unit cost. Because the national
              strategy includes an exclusive MTCT target, PMTCT remains part of the optimized mix to
              achieve national targets. Allocations to achieve national targets are defined as allocations to
              reduce incidence and deaths by 50 percent by 2020.

              Achieving national targets in the Kyrgyz Republic would avert 2,300 deaths and 4,200
              new infections by 2020. The amount needed to achieve these results depends heavily on the
              critical choices that the Kyrgyz Republic needs to make. With business as usual (current
              allocations, current unit costs), the cost will be US$43 million. The amount to achieve national
              targets with optimized allocations is US$24 million, which could be substantially reduced to
              US$16 million through reduced management cost; and, potentially, reduced further through
              exploring technical efficiency gains. With additional potential efficiency gains through unit cost
              reductions in FSW, MSM, and PMTCT programs as identified by the country experts, the cost
              could be reduced to US$15 million. The optimized allocation to achieve national targets also
              would reduce the total estimated number of PLHIV in 2020 from 10,200 to 8,500 and, thereby,
              the future costs of the HIV response.

              Technical efficiency analysis of core programs would be particularly beneficial in the
              Kyrgyz Republic because the current cost profile differs from those of other countries
              and varies among and within programs. Benchmarks for unit costs for key service packages
              could be set and tracked. It also is essential to critically examine and study the implementation
              efficiency of the large portion of HIV spending (56 percent), which is allocated to management
              and other costs.

              Compared to overall funding of health programs in the Kyrgyz Republic, of which 60 percent
              are government funded, 71 percent of HIV expenditures in 2012 was externally funded, thus
              calling for increasing the share of domestic financing of the HIV response.
1.       INTRODUCTION: WHY ALLOCATIVE
         EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS NOW?
1.1      Necessity for allocative efficiency
Current HIV programs are faced with the need to scale up prevention and provide treatment to
a larger number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) than ever before. In the current
environment of increasingly limited resources for HIV responses, focused design and efficiency
in program delivery are essential to ensure that programs can do more with less.

In the 2011 United Nations Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, countries agreed to reduce
sexual and injection-related transmission by 50 percent, virtually eliminate mother-to-child-
transmission, initiate 80 percent of eligible PLHIV on treatment, and end HIV-related
discrimination by 2015 (UNGASS 2011). UNAIDS’ 2014 Gap Report illustrated that, in most
countries, substantial additional efforts will be required to achieve these targets. Against this
background, UNAIDS globally defined a Fast-Track strategy to achieve the goal of Ending AIDS
by 2030 (UNAIDS 2014b). One core element of the Fast-Track approach are the 90-90-90
targets, which set out to achieve that 90 percent of all PLHIV are diagnosed; 90 percent of
diagnosed PLHIV are on ART; and 90 percent of PLHIV on ART are virally suppressed (UNAIDS
2014d). The Fast-Track approach also emphasizes the need to focus on the geographic areas
and communities most affected by HIV and recommends that resources be concentrated on the
programs that make the greatest impact.

In this context, UNAIDS and cosponsors are promoting a shift toward investment thinking in
the design of HIV responses globally to maximize the impact of program investment and best
realize the long-term health and economic benefits of HIV programs. A number of countries
are developing investment cases to understand HIV epidemics as well as to design, deliver, and
sustain effective HIV responses. To support HIV investment cases, a group of countries in the
ECA Region conducted allocative efficiency (AE) analyses. In 2014–15, AE analyses were
carried out by Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova,
Tajikistan, Ukraine, and a number of countries outside the ECA Region.2 This report
summarizes the results of the analysis for the Kyrgyz Republic. The investment case is
complemented with a human rights-based approach to health care.

The concept of allocative efficiency refers to the maximization of health outcomes, with the
least costly mix of health interventions.3 HIV allocative efficiency studies generally try to
answer the question, “How can HIV funding be optimally allocated to the combination of HIV
response interventions that will yield the highest impact?”



2   For published study reports see for example Republic of Tajikistan 2014 and Fraser and others 2014.
3   Technically, allocative efficiency can be done within a fixed budget envelope (maximize impact with given
    amount of money); or within defined impact targets (minimize cost to achieve a given impact).


                                                         1
2                                                    Optimizing investments in the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV response



    There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many settings with a given
    amount of HIV funding; or that given outcomes could be achieved with less HIV funding if
    resources are distributed optimally or if resources are used in the most efficient ways.
    Mathematical modelling is one way to determine optimized HIV resource allocation.

    1.2 The Kyrgyz Republic’s burden of disease: HIV in the
    context of wider health issues
    The Kyrgyz Republic’s overall burden of disease is characterized by a high contribution of
    neonatal and child mortality in comparison to other countries in the ECA Region––together
    with a mix of other causes of disease.
    Figure 1.1   Years of life lost (YLL) due to different causes by age, 2010




    Source: University of Washington 2014.
    Note: LRI = lower respiratory infection; NTD = neglected tropical diseases.

    In the population aged 50 and above, noncommunicable diseases, particularly cardio- and
    circulatory diseases followed by cancer are the dominant causes of years of life lost. In the
    population of reproductive age (15–49), there are several main causes of disease including
    injuries, noncommunicable diseases, and HIV/tuberculosis (TB), which in combination have a
    similar disease burden as all cancers in this age group. HIV and TB account for 4.6 percent of
    years of life lost (YLL) for all ages and for 11.1 percent of the YLL in the 15–49 age group. HIV
    alone accounts for 6.1 percent of the YLL in the 15–49 age group (University of Washington
    2014). The bulk of this HIV disease burden is concentrated among key populations. HIV
    prevalence in key populations (FSW, MSM, and PWID including those in prisons) is 10 to 100
    times higher than in the general population (Table 1.1). In this context, in addition to the key
    priorities of neonatal and child health, injuries, and noncommunicable diseases, HIV
    prevention and treatment that focuses on key populations remains an important component of
    health service delivery.

1.3      Financing of HIV in the context of health care financing
From 2000 to 2012, overall spending on health in the Kyrgyz Republic saw a 7-fold increase in
absolute numbers, and an increased proportion of GDP from 4.7 percent to 7.1 percent. Table
1.1 provides a summary of health spending in the Kyrgyz Republic.

From 1995 to 2012, the level of government expenditure on health in the Kyrgyz Republic
ranged from 10.0 percent to15.0 percent of general government expenditure. After peaking in
2006, government health expenditure was approximately 12.0 percent of general government
expenditure from 2010 onward (Figure 1.2). In 2012, the proportion of government
expenditure used for health was slightly above the global average of 11.7 percent.

    In the Kyrgyz Republic, in 2012 government incurred 60.1 percent of health expenditure.
    Private out-of-pocket expenses accounted for 34.8 percent. The contribution of nonprofit
    organizations increased since the early 2000s and covered 5.1 percent of total health spending
    in 2012. AsHealth spending increased substantially in absolute numbers from US$89 million to
    US$462 million from 1995 to 2012 (Figure 1.3) but also increased moderately in percent of
    GDP from 6.0 percent in 1995 to 7.1 percent in 2012.

    External assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic increased since the early 2000s and peaked in 2011
    at US$477 million (Figure 1.4). Health, population policies, and HIV/AIDS together accounted
    for approximately 10.0 percent of all external assistance over the past decade and reached 8.7
    percent in 2012, while HIV/AIDS alone accounted for 1.7 percent of all external assistance.

1.4      Financing of the HIV response in the Kyrgyz Republic
The majority of HIV funding is provided by international partners, which accounted for 71
percent of expenditure on HIV/AIDS in 2012 (Figure 1.5). Twenty-nine percent of all HIV
spending was financed by government. In other words, compared to overall funding of health
programs in the Kyrgyz Republic, of which 60 percent are government funded, a relatively
larger proportion of HIV expenditure is externally funded. Unlike for general health spending,
private spending on HIV is assumed to play a smaller role, but exact figures are not available. It
can be assumed that there are out-of-pocket expenses for items including condoms and
needles in pharmacies as well as for services by private doctors. The Global Fund is the major
external funding partner for the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV response, accounting for over 80.0
percent of external support. In 2012, 83.7 percent was provided by the Global Fund; another
4.6 percent by the US Government; and 11.7 percent by other partners (Figure 1.6).

    Note: These are disbursements, which may differ from annual expenditures recorded in NASA reports for
    some years and funding sources. This comment applies particularly to Global Fund disbursements and actual
    expenditure, which according to the National AIDS Spending Assessment was not 0 in 2009, but rather US$5.0
    million (including funds disbursed earlier).

    The economic crisis in North America and Western Europe and the stabilization of
    international funding for HIV have reduced the prospect of increasing international funding for
    national HIV responses in the ECA Region. Given the current eligibility and cofinancing
    requirements under the new funding model of the Global Fund, the primary funding partner
    for HIV programs in the Kyrgyz Republic, external HIV funding is likely to decline. This
    likelihood causes concern about the sustainability of the long-term national HIV response and
    increases the need for domestic financing.
2.     WHAT ARE THE KEY QUESTIONS AND HOW
       WILL THIS REPORT ANSWER THEM?
This section outlines the main steps taken and tools applied to carry out the analyses
presented in this report. Additional details are is available in the appendixes.

To support the national strategy priorities and assist the Kyrgyz Republic in meeting its set
targets, this report answers the following questions:

1. How can the Kyrgyz Republic optimize the allocation of its current HIV funding?
2. What might be gained from increased investment in HIV programming?
3. What is the minimum spending required to meet national targets and how should funds be
   allocated to achieve the targets?
Each of these questions is the subject of an analytical module described in more detail in
appendix D. Additional more detailed questions on epidemiology and cost-effectiveness also

To carry out the analyses, the team used Optima, a mathematical model of HIV transmission
and disease progression integrated with an economic and program analysis framework.
Optima uses HIV epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates evidence on biological
transmission probabilities, detailed infection progression, sexual mixing patterns, and drug
injection behaviors. In consultation with the Kyrgyz Republic experts, Optima was calibrated
to HIV prevalence data points available for the different subpopulations (including female sex
workers, injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men), as well as to data points on
the number of people on ART.

To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and determine an
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships among the cost of HIV
intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs, and the resulting
outcomes (Table 2.1). These relationships are specific to the country, population, and
prevention program being considered.

Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome in combination with Optima’s
epidemic module, it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in the level of funding
allocated to each program will impact on overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a
mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine an optimized allocation of
funding across different HIV programs. Additional details about Optima are in appendix A.

    2.2     Analytical framework
    The study was conceptualized by a Regional steering group involving the Global Fund, UNAIDS,
    UNDP, and convened by the World Bank. A national technical group convened by UNAIDS in
    collaboration with the government was formed. Country-specific objectives of the analysis and
    parameters were outlined in a Scope of Work document. Epidemiological, program, and cost
    data were collected by in-country experts with technical support from international partners
    using an adapted MS-Excel-based Optima data entry spreadsheet. In November 2014, a
    regional mathematical modelling workshop was conducted in Yerevan, Armenia. In this
    workshop, national experts and specialists from international partners worked together with
    UNSW mathematical modelers to carry out modelling analyses using the Matlab software
    package. This Regional process also aimed at data comparison, exchange, quality assurance,
    and development of capacities in HIV epidemic and response analysis using mathematical
    modelling techniques. The team then consulted with government experts and other in-country
    partners on the preliminary results and summarized them in this report.

Note: A comprehensive four-pronged approach to PMTCT includes other elements such as the provision of
contraception. Because the primary purpose of contraception for the vast majority of women in this
concentrated epidemic setting is not PMTCT but pregnancy prevention, contraception cost was not included in
this analysis (apart from the cost for condom promotion to key populations covered in FSW, MSM, and PWID
programs). The same logic applies to other related services.

Table 2.2 describes the populations and programs included in the analysis as well the relevant
time frames. “Direct programs” with a proven and quantifiable effect on HIV incidence and/or
deaths are included in the mathematical optimization analysis; management and other costs
(“indirect programs”) are treated as fixed costs. Within direct programs, some service
packages target specific key populations (FSW, MSM, and PWID); others (HTC, ART, PMTCT)
cut across all populations, including key populations.

Note: Table 2.2 reflects how costs were categorized by countries for this analysis. The analysis is not based on
detailed matching of classification of inputs, but on how countries classified expenses using the detailed
available guidance for NASA and GARPR reports. Although this guidance is detailed and specific, differences
cannot be ruled out, particularly when regarding cross-cutting costs such as HR costs. In addition, even if costs
are classified consistently, the comprehensiveness of service packages may differ; a = Program management
cost and human resources are not included in the program cost; b = Total program cost divided by the number
of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving ARV prophylaxis/ART.

Based on program spending per person reached, cost-coverage outcome relations were
developed. Calibrations and cost-coverage outcome relations were produced in collaboration
with the Kyrgyz Republic experts and are shown in appendixes B and C.

Costs per person reached derived from service output information and total spending on
programs are presented in Table 2.2. These are not unit costs, and definitions of program
coverage vary among countries. It also is important to note that the Kyrgyz Republic and
Kazakhstan used a different approach of accounting for human resource expenses and
management cost of specific programs. In these two countries, such costs were included in the
general management cost. Therefore, for them, management costs were higher than in the
other countries, while program costs were reduced. Costs per person reached in the Kyrgyz

     Republic appear to be higher than in neighboring Kazakhstan for prevention programs, but
     lower for treatment. Detailed analysis of program packages, unit costs, and service delivery
     modalities goes beyond the scope of this report. However, the magnitude of the differences in
     costs per person reached warrants additional attention, potentially through a technical
     efficiency analysis.

     2.3      National targets and how they were translated into Optima
     Analyses were informed by national priorities. The Kyrgyz Republic has set the priorities for
     its HIV response in the State Programme on Stabilization of the HIV Epidemic in the Kyrgyz
     Republic for 2012–164 including key coverage, outcome, and impact targets:

     Strategy 1. Decreasing the vulnerability of PWID to HIV

         Fewer than 20 percent of PWID are infected with HIV by 2016 (impact)
         At least 60 percent of PWID are covered by HIV prevention by 2016 (coverage)
         Fewer than 15 percent of prisoners are infected by HIV by 2016 (impact)
     Strategy 2. Preventing sexual HIV transmission

         Fewer than 1 percent of youth in age 15–24 (pregnant women) are infected with HIV by
          2016 (impact)
         Fewer than 5 percent of sex workers and MSM are infected by HIV by 2016 (impact)
         At least 60 percent of sex workers and 30 percent of MSM are covered by HIV prevention
          by 2016 (coverage)
     Strategy 3. Providing access to treatment care and support to PLHIV

         40 percent of all estimated adults and children living with HIV will get ART by 2016
          (coverage/outcome)
         At least 85 percent of HIV positive adults and children will be on treatment after 12
          months by 2016 (outcome/ impact)
         Fewer than 25 percent of HIV deaths would be connected with TB deaths by 2016 (impact)
         More than 90 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women will get ART for decreasing mother-
          to-child HIV transmission by 2016 (outcome)
         Fewer than 3 percent of infants born to HIV-positive mothers are infected by HIV by 2016
          (impact).
     The country also has set out that, by 2020, the targets of the 2011 Political Declaration would
     be achieved, particularly the following:

         Sexual HIV transmission is decreased by 50 percent.
         HIV transmission through unsterile injections is decreased by 50 percent.
         TB-related deaths are decreased by 50 percent.
         Eighty percent of eligible PLHIV are receiving ARV treatment.
         Mother-to-child-transmission is eliminated.
         HIV-related stigma and discrimination will be decreased by 90 percent.

For the purpose of modelling, these national targets had to be simplified. Simplification was
necessary because many national targets had been set as HIV prevalence targets. They are not
suitable for optimization analysis because new infections increase prevalence while deaths
reduce it. Therefore, the targets and commitments were translated into 2 sets of key impacts
targets summarized in Table 2.3.

2.4        Limitations of the analyses
Similar to any mathematical modelling analysis, this study is based on a number of
assumptions, which necessarily imply specific limitations:

      As for other countries with concentrated epidemics, there are some gaps in data,
       particularly for the general population. As in other models, estimates of HIV prevalence in
       the general population were derived from data in pregnant women used as a proxy for
       prevalence in the general population.
      For this analysis, standard classification of cost data in line with National AIDS Spending
       Assessments (NASA) was used, but differences in program packages among countries limit
       the comparability of findings.
      To determine overall cost per person reached, the analysis used past ratios of expenditure
       to coverage rather than unit costs from a costing of future programs. This approach of
       using past cost and coverage has a number of advantages over using projected costs from
       plans and budgets, which ultimately are predictions of future cost. The approach also has a
       disadvantage: there may be future increases or decreases in cost in relation to new
       approaches, implementation arrangements, or technologies.
      The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost-effectiveness among programs
       includes assumptions concerning the impact of increases or decreases in funding for
       programs. These assumptions are based on costs per person reached and observed
       ecological relationships among outcomes of program coverage or risk behavior and the
       amount of money spent on programs in the past. Another assumption was some saturation
       in the possible effects of programs caused by increased spending.
      The analysis did not determine the technical efficiency of programs. Gains in technical
       efficiency would lead to different unit costs so would affect resource allocation.
      Modelling the optimization of allocative efficiencies depends critically on the availability of

         may vary in specific countries and populations depending on various factors, particularly
         the levels of adherence to interventions. All programs and spending categories, for which
         such parameters cannot be obtained, such as enablers and synergies, could not be included
         in the mathematical optimization. Because they still have important functions in the HIV
         response, they were treated as fixed costs and, in some specific scenarios, adjusted with
         specific justifications.
        Effects outside the HIV endpoints are complex to consider (such as non-health benefits of
         OST, effects of needle exchange on hepatitis, effects of condoms on contraception, and
         STIs). Given that the majority of OST benefits occur beyond HIV outcomes, specific
         consideration was given to the non-HIV benefits of OST (appendix A). Given the complexity
         of interactions among interventions and their non-HIV benefits, this approach was applied
         only for OST. Similarly, the model does not seek to quantify human rights; stigma and
         discrimination; and ethical, legal, or psychosocial implications; but acknowledges that they
         are important aspects to be considered.
3.      WHAT ARE THE EXPECTED TRENDS IN THE
        EPIDEMIC IF CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE
        MAINTAINED?
Chapter 3 summarizes the current HIV status in the Kyrgyz Republic based on key national
data and the epidemic trends generated by Optima. The model assumed that current
conditions would continue until 2020.

3.1     Summary of key national data on the HIV epidemic
Table 3.1 provides key national HIV-related data in the Kyrgyz Republic including data on new
HIV diagnoses, registered deaths due to AIDS, prevalence in key populations, coverage of key
services, and self-reported modes of HIV transmission.

 By the end of 2013, the Kyrgyz Republic had registered over 5,100 persons diagnosed with
HIV, of whom over 3,900 were still registered and alive in 2013. The cumulative number of
registered deaths due to AIDS was below 300 at the end of 2013. This means that
approximately one fifth of diagnosed PLHIV are neither represented in the number of
currently registered PLHIV nor included in the registered deaths. This difference suggests that
some PLHIV were lost to follow up, died from other causes or died from AIDS, but were not
registered as AIDS deaths. ART coverage is relatively low with less than 20 percent of the total
estimated PLHIV population and less than 33 percent of the registered PLHIV are currently on
ART.

 In 1 decade, new HIV diagnoses increased sharply from fewer than 20 per year in 2000 to over
500 per year after 2010. Self-reported data on the likely source of transmission suggest a
reduced share of infections due to drug-injecting behavior and an increase in sexual
transmission, which, for the first time, in 2013, accounted for over 50 percent of new
diagnoses.

3.2      Epidemic trends projected in Optima
Optima projections were made assuming that current trends in transmission-related behaviors
would be maintained. As mentioned above, appendixes A and B describe the process and some
of the data used to generate these estimations and projections.

Table 3.2 shows some key estimates for 2014 and 2020 from Optima. The estimated number of
PLHIV in 2014 is very similar to the 2013 estimate of 8,000 PLHIV generated using Spectrum. 6
The Optima-generated estimates of new infections and deaths also are within the confidence
bounds of global estimates, suggesting that there were fewer than 1,300 new infections and
fewer than 500 deaths in 2013.

The model-predicted evolution of annual HIV incidence (2000–20) in each subpopulation is
shown in Figure 3.3. Men and women who inject drugs continue to account for nearly half of
the estimated 1,000 new infections, but the number of new infections in this group has
stabilized. New HIV infections in other groups are projected to increase moderately from 2015
on, particularly among MSM.

     Source: Populated Optima model for the Kyrgyz Republic.
     The stabilization of the number of new infections estimated in Optima approximately in 2010
     is consistent with a stabilization of new HIV diagnoses in National AIDS Center HTC records
     around the same time.7 The shift in modes of transmission from drug-injection-related
     transmission to sexual transmission, which can be observed in National AIDS Center records,
     also is seen in Optima projections. The fact that the proportion of drug-injection-related
     transmission is slightly lower in the self-reported data in 2013 could indicate a trend.
     However, because the value was for a single year, this possible trend will require additional
     data points. Therefore, it will be important for the country to continue tracking modes of
     transmission both through self-reported sources of transmission reported during HTC and
     through modelling projections based on HIV prevalence data.

     On its current trajectory, HIV prevalence in the Kyrgyz Republic is expected to increase for two
     reasons. The first is the moderate increase in HIV incidence. Second, the number of new
     infections still exceeds the number of deaths, despite the fact that deaths also are projected to
     increase. As a result of high HIV prevalence in male PWID and increasing prevalence among
     MSM and FSW clients, continued sexual transmission to female partners is projected to lead to
     moderate increases in HIV prevalence among female adults.

     The model projects an increase in the number of PLHIV from 8,400 to approximately
     10,200 by 2020, assuming current spending will be maintained. This projected increase in
     PLHIV also implies an increase in the need for treatment, which by 2020 and applying the 90-
     90-90 targets, is projected to be 3,800 (CD<350), 4,800 (CD4<500), and approximately 8,100.

     In summary, the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV epidemic has grown substantially over the past decade.
     Under current conditions, the epidemic is projected to continue to grow moderately, which
     could widen the coverage gap for key HIV services.




     7   This comparison is limited by the delay between infection and diagnosis.
4.       WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS OF CURRENT
         SPENDING?
This chapter describes the programmatic focus of HIV spending in the Kyrgyz Republic and the
corresponding epidemiological outcomes.

4.1      Focus of current HIV programs in the Kyrgyz Republic
Figure 4.1 summarizes 2013 expenditure on HIV in the Kyrgyz Republic by program area
based on data from the national GARPR financial reporting tables.8 Less than 10 percent of the
country’s HIV spending goes to ART. Thus, the proportion of expenditure going to treatment is
lower than in most other countries in the Regional allocative efficiency analysis. Conversely,
the share of costs classified as management and other costs is 56 percent, which is high in
Regional comparison and is explained in part by the country’s classification of program-related
human resource cost as management cost. The result is that the Kyrgyz Republic’s overall HIV
investment per capita and per person living with HIV has the appearance of being relatively
high in Regional comparison.9

     4.2 Without current programs, the increases in new
     infections, deaths, and PLHIV would be substantially more
     pronounced
     The impacts of current spending can be assessed by comparing projected epidemic trends
     under current conditions and under zero spending. As described in the previous chapter,
     under current spending, HIV prevalence and deaths are projected to increase. At the same
     time, incidence initially would stabilize but then would increase moderately over time.

     The effect of stopping current programs up to 2020 was projected and in this scenario zero
     coverage assumptions were used for all programs and compared to a scenario, in which
     current spending levels and patterns are sustained (Table 4.1). The projection suggests that,
     with no programs, by 2020 5,600 AIDS related deaths would occur, 47 percent more than with
     current programs. However, even maintaining the current, relatively low ART coverage would
     lead to increasing deaths – a pattern, which is consistent with a growing HIV epidemic, in
     which the proportion of PLHIV in advanced stages of disease and the need for ART would
     increase over time. Maintaining 2014 coverage of ART would imply that deaths would rise
     from 430 in 2014 to more than 600 per year on average between 2015-20 and that,
     cumulatively, approximately 3,800 AIDS-related deaths would be incurred over the same
     period.

     New infections would be 27,200 with no programs which is more than four times higher than
     6,500 new infections expected with current program spending continued between 2015-20. In
     line with the spending pattern, which focuses on prevention including for key populations, this

projection suggests that sustaining the 2013 spending levels and patterns prevents 20,700
new infections by 2020 compared to no programs. In the absence of programs, a sharp rise in
new infections would be driven in part by increased needle-sharing.

With no current programs, as a consequence of sharply rising new infections, the number of
PLHIV is projected to increase from 8,400 in 2014 to 28,100. Adult HIV prevalence would rise
to 0.46 percent with no programs compared to 0.17 percent with programs.

5.      HOW WILL OUTCOMES IMPROVE BY
        OPTIMIZING ALLOCATIONS UNDER THE
        CURRENT LEVEL OF FUNDING?
An optimization analysis was conducted comparing the impacts that can be achieved in future
with the same level of funding that was available in 2013 ($12.6 million). Figure 5.1 shows the
current allocation and 2 optimized allocations for the same level of funding.

spending levels, 2015–20

For this analysis, the national strategy targets were interpreted as a 50 percent reduction in
both new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths from 2013 levels by 2020, and the virtual
elimination of MTCT. Allocation A represents 2013 spending allocations in the Kyrgyz
Republic. Allocation B represents the optimized redistribution of the 2013 budget to get as
close as possible to the national strategy targets. Allocation C shows a very similar scenario.
However, in this case, the distribution of resources to “management and other costs” is
reduced by 20 percent and is redirected to the direct HIV programs considered in the
mathematical optimization analysis.

The optimized allocations suggest that, with current funding, impact on new infections and
deaths could be increased most substantially through a combination of scaling up ART and
sustaining levels of investment in programs for PWID including NSP and OST as well as HTC. If
management and other costs could be reduced (Allocation C), additional funding for further
ART scale-up and FSW programs would become available.

     Although optimization led to substantial reductions in new infections and deaths, national
     targets could not be fully achieved with the given level of funding and the cost-coverage-
     outcome assumptions. Figure 5.2 and Table 5.1 illustrate the health outcomes of implementing
     such an allocation. Figure 5.2 illustrates that Allocation B (optimized allocations with current
     management cost) could substantially reduce overall new infections by 28 percent and deaths
     by 53 percent. These percents translate to 1,800 new infections and 2,000 deaths averted.
     Optima suggests that Allocation B would focus funds on the programs that showed the highest
     impact on incidence and deaths: ART and PWID programs. Although this combination would
     increase the MTCT rates, the effects on deaths and injection-related infections would be so
     strong that this combination of investment would increase overall impact.

     possible to national targets by 2020 with current (2013) levels of funding, 2015–20

     In line with the global elimination targets for MTCT, “breastfed MTCT cases” and “non-
     breastfed MTCT cases” are defined here as the proportion of HIV-positive women who
     transmit HIV to their babies disaggregated by the women’s breastfeeding status. Because
     MTCT accounts for approximately 2 percent of new infections, the optimization prioritized
     achieving reductions in new sexual and injection-related infections, each of which accounts for
     approximately 50 percent of all HIV infections. PMTCT programs remain critical from a child
     rights perspective. However, for to be cost-effective in a context of limited resources, PMTCT
     programs would need to be implemented with reduced unit costs. Another dimension to
     consider in the cost of PMTCT programming is geographical disparity. HIV prevalence among
     pregnant women ranged between 1.6 per 10,000 women (0.016 percent) in Naryn Oblast
     (province) to 12.1 per 10,000 women (0.12 percent) in Bishkek City. The levels of HIV
     prevalence among key populations (2.2 percent among FSW, 6.3 percent among MSM, and 12.4
     percent among PWID) are more than 100 times higher than HIV prevalence among pregnant
     women in rural oblasts. Clearly, high HIV testing followed by initiation of ART among key
     populations and their sexual partners must be of highest priority in the Kyrgyz Republic.

     Figure 5.2 also shows how close Allocation C (optimized allocations with reduced management
     cost) comes to achieve the national targets by 2020. The analyses suggest that Allocation C
     would be the most strategic use of current resources with current funding and current unit

costs. In addition to reducing injection-related infections and deaths by 50 percent (which
would imply reaching the 2020 target), Allocation C reduces sexual transmission by 25
percent. For the same reasons cited above, no funding would be allocated to PMTCT so MTCT
would rise. Nevertheless, because MTCT accounts for less than 2 percent of new infections, it
would not influence allocations.

Note: a = As explained in the narrative, these programs remain important from an epidemiological point of
view and should continue to be provided, which could be achieved either by increasing overall funding for the
HIV response or by reducing unit costs of these programs; b = As explained in the narrative in more detail,
pregnant women should continue to be covered with ART as part of the increased ART budget. In practice,
continued access to ART for pregnant women, also would require continued HIV testing and counselling for
pregnant women, which could be funded out of the general HTC program, or out of maternal health budgets.

At the same time, since eliminating MTCT is regarded as a separate national target and since
sexual transmission declined only moderately, Allocation C would not fully achieve the
national targets, which are further explored in chapter 7. If the HIV response budget cannot be
increased to fully achieve national targets, as explored in chapter 7, either PMTCT unit cost
would need to be reduced, or costs for HIV prevention among pregnant women could be
covered from maternal health budgets.

6.        WHAT MIGHT BE GAINED FROM
          INCREASED FUNDING AND WHAT SHOULD
          BE PRIORITIZED WITH REDUCED FUNDING?
This analysis considers what could be gained by increasing the HIV budget from the 2013
levels and which programs would have the largest impact if less funding were available and
the response would need to be further prioritized. Optimized allocations to programs and
corresponding impact for different levels of funding ranging from 0 percent of 2013 spending
to 200 percent of 2013 spending are compared in this analysis.

Although the likelihood is small that the country will immediately move to 0 percent or 200
percent of funding, this analysis is helpful in understanding an epidemic’s dynamics in
relationship to the level of programmatic investments. First, it shows which services are the
most essential in case of crisis. Second, it shows to what extent the same impact could be
achieved with less funding. Third, it illustrates whether additional investment would lead to
saturation of impact or whether large additional gains could be made with additional
investment. Finally, scenarios in which higher coverage and impact are achieved with more
funding also are useful as a starting point for discussing implementation efficiency: how to
achieve the same coverage and impact with less funding.

This optimization analysis was conducted for minimizing both HIV incidence and AIDS-related
deaths by 2020 and the same weight was given to a new infection and a death averted.10 Figure
6.1 shows optimized allocations and the corresponding combined effect on new infections and
deaths. In optimized allocations with very low levels of funding, programs for PWID are the
focus of investment. In contrast, with reduced funding at the level 80 percent of current
spending and with increased funding, ART moves into the focus of additional investment. In
practical terms, retaining everyone who already is on ART and OST also would be a critical
priority and factored in for any allocation scenario. With levels of investment of 140 percent
and above, more HTC is required for increasing ART coverage and additional prevention
investment for PWID and MSM gets prioritized.




10   An allocation that attempts to minimize incidence and deaths simultaneously with equal weights and a fixed
     amount of money would be influenced by the country-specific cost for treatment and prevention programs. More
     commonly, cost for averting new infections is lower than cost for averting death. Hence, in these cases,
     optimization will avert more new infections than deaths. However, the dual effect of ART on new infections and
     deaths reduces this potential bias. Conversely, minimizing DALYs is likely to be more biased toward reducing
     deaths as a death implies a DALY of 1, while a person living with HIV has a DALY of 0.221, rising to 0.547 in the
     AIDS stage.

     Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3 track the effects of these allocations on new infections and deaths
     separately. The effects of allocating current spending were discussed in the previous chapter.
     Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3 illustrate that, with optimized allocations for 80 percent of current
     spending, new infections and deaths both would remain below current levels. In terms of
     reducing HIV incidence (Figure 6.2), there is a particularly large effect of sustaining at least
     minimal investment into prevention programs for PWID, particularly NSP, in the absence of
     which new infections would rise dramatically. Optimized allocations up to 140 percent of
     current spending would decrease HIV incidence by approximately 60 percent as compared to
     current allocations. For minimizing deaths, optimized allocations for 120 percent of current
     spending already would reduce deaths by nearly 67 percent.

7.        HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO ACHIEVE THE
          TARGETS OF THE NATIONAL HIV
          STRATEGIC PLAN?
This analysis identifies the minimum resource requirements to fully achieve the national
strategy targets. The analyses in chapter 5 assumed fixed amounts of available funding and
explored an optimized allocation of those funds to minimize new infections and deaths with
the current budget. In chapter 6, the analyses explored the likely gains from increased and
reduced investment in the HIV response. In contrast, the analysis in chapter 7 aims for the full
achievement of the national strategy targets, and determines the minimum budget required
to achieve those goals. This analysis assesses the gap in funding required to achieve the
national strategy targets.

7.1 Exploring technical efficiency to reduce the cost to
achieve national targets
The estimated cost to achieve national targets with current costs per person reached and the
current proportion of costs going to management and other costs would be $24 million
(appendix D) and thereby would nearly double the HIV investment. Since such a high level of
investment might not be realistic to achieve in a resource-constrained environment with many
competing health priorities, the potential contribution of other efficiency gains was explored.

Figure 7.1 shows the total cost to achieve national targets by 2020 with 2 scenarios. They
combine allocative efficiency analysis with specific technical efficiency assumptions applied to
the allocation to fully achieve national targets.

Allocation B shows current allocations. Allocation E1, shows the optimized distribution of
funding to achieve national targets, assuming that management and other costs are not
increased proportionately but rather are reduced by 20 percent.11 A 20 percent cost reduction
was used as an estimate that could be achieved through technical efficiencies while
maintaining core management functions and enablers. Allocation E2 represents the optimized
allocation to achieve national targets (50 percent reduction in HIV incidence and deaths by
2020). Allocation E2 assumes technical efficiency gains in 3 programs, which are needed to
fully achieve national targets but have not been cost effective in allocation scenarios that use
current funding. These are programs for FSW, MSM, and PMTCT. For them, costs per person
reached in the Kyrgyz Republic also were substantially above the median cost in other
countries of the Region. Therefore, 50 percent reductions in costs for FSW and PMTCT

11   20 percent was used as an estimate for a reduction in costs excluded from optimization, which could be achieved
     through efficiencies without putting at risk major management functions and synergies. The potential reduction
     by 20 percent is roughly equivalent to the level of allocative efficiency gains for programs included in the
     mathematical optimization, because at 80 percent of 2013 funding results would not be compromised if
     resources are allocated optimally. As elaborated above (chapter 6, optimized allocation with 80 percent of
     current budgets), optimization was able to compensate for a 20 percent reduction in program resources.

     programs were assumed, and a 75 percent reduction in cost per person reached in MSM
     programs. These reductions may appear very high, particularly for MSM programs. However,
     even with a 75 percent reduction, the cost per person reached in MSM programs (US$449
     reduced to US$112) would remain above the median cost of the other 6 countries included in
     the analysis.

     reduce the cost for achieving national targets

     With the assumed reductions in management and other cost, national targets could be
     achieved with approximately $16 million. This amount could be reduced further to
     approximately US$15 million with the proposed reductions in unit costs for FSW, MSM, and
     PMTCT programs. By exploring technical efficiencies in other programs, it might be possible to
     reduce further the cost for achieving national targets.

     allocation scenarios.

        The gray line shows effects for maintaining current spending and distribution of resources
         among programs (US$12.6 million).
        The blue line shows effects for conservative targets: no increase in incidence and deaths
         (US$13.3 million).
        The turquoise line shows the effect of current spending optimized toward national targets
         (US$12.6 million).
        The yellow line shows the effect of current spending optimized toward national targets
         with 20 percent reduction in management costs. (US$12.6 million).
        The brown line represents the key result: optimized allocations to achieve national
         targets. (US$24 million at current unit and management costs, $16 million with reduced
         management cost, US$15 million with specific additional technical efficiencies).

     Achieving the national targets would translate to averting 4,200 (65 percent) new infections
     and 2,300 (62 percent) deaths.12

     7.3       Cost-effectiveness of allocation scenarios
     The cost-effectiveness calculations discussed in this section compare to a baseline of zero
     spending from 2015 on. In the zero spending scenario from 2015 to 2020, an estimated 27,200
     cumulative new HIV infections and 5,600 cumulative AIDS-related deaths would occur in the
     Kyrgyz Republic. Under zero spending from 2015 to 2030, the epidemic is projected to
     increase such that an estimated 94,500 cumulative new HIV infections and 37,000 cumulative
     AIDS-related deaths occur.

     Under a scenario of maintaining current spending and distribution to programs, an estimated
     20,700 of the 27,200 new infections could be averted by 2020, and 1,800 of the 5,600 AIDS-
     related deaths could be averted. By 2030, maintaining current spending could avert 75,000 of
     the 94,500 new infections and 25,100 of the 37,000 AIDS-related deaths.

     When current funding is maintained, the program costs (excluding management) between
     2015 and 2020 total $33,810,554. This total implies that the cost per infection averted in

     12   Achieving all 3 targets for reducing new sexual infections by 50 percent, new injecting infections by 50 percent,
          and virtually eliminating MTCT cumulatively leads to higher overall reductions in new infections and deaths. The
          reason is that the effects of individual interventions such as ART required to achieve one target have additional
          effects on others.
How much will it cost to achieve the targets of the National HIV Strategic Plan?                               35



maintaining the current spending scenario would be $1,634 and the cost per death averted
would be $18,420. When considering maintaining current funding for the longer 2015–30 time
frame, compared to the baseline scenario of zero spending, the cost per infection averted
would be $1,229 and the cost per AIDS-related death averted would be $3,665.

By achieving 20 percent efficiencies in “management and other costs” activities and
reallocating all program funds toward achieving the national targets (Allocation E of Figure E.2
Optimizing spending toward national targets and to achieve national targets by 2020 ), when
compared to the zero-spend baseline, 23,300 new infections and 4,000 AIDS-related deaths
could be averted by 2020 (Table 7.2). Compared to the maintaining current spending
projection, the optimized spending would equate to averting an additional 2,600 new
infections and, significantly, 2,200 AIDS-related deaths by 2020. By 2030, optimally
redistributing current funding levels toward the national strategic targets while achieving 20
percent efficiencies in “management and other costs” activities could avert an estimated
85,400 new infections and 27,600 deaths––that is, 10,500 infections and 2,500 deaths fewer
than the maintaining current spending scenario.
By optimally allocating toward national targets while achieving 20 percent efficiencies in
“management and other costs” activities, the cost per infection averted by 2020 is $1,868, and
the cost per death averted is $10,751. The cost per AIDS-related death averted in this scenario
is $7,729 less than in the scenario of maintaining current spending.
In all the different scenarios for 2020 and 2030, the HIV response remains highly cost effective.
Further expanding coverage––although it would imply covering more hard-to-reach segments
within key populations––still would be cost effective, particularly with the longer 2030
horizon.

Note: * = It could appear counter-intuitive that the cost per new infection averted is lower for maintaining
2013 spending compared to optimized allocations. Two factors explain this: First, compared to zero spending,
the first new infections could be averted at lower cost through relatively low-cost programs such as NSP.
Extending the coverage of other programs comes at additional cost and makes averting new infections more
expensive. Second, only direct program costs were included here. In other words, even though the 20%
reduction in management cost would increase the proportion of money going into programs, that reduction
was not part of the numerator (total cost to be divided by deaths/new infections averted).

8.     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The range of analyses both suggests a number of common trends and has different
implications for understanding the epidemic, policies, and program implementation. The main
conclusions and recommendations arising from the findings of this study are presented below.



1
       HIV in the Kyrgyz Republic is transitioning from an early concentrated epidemic
       among PWID into an advanced concentrated epidemic characterized by continued
       transmission among PWID but an increasing share of sexual transmission to
female partners of PWID and among MSM. Optima projects, from 2015–20, transmission
just below 50 percent and MTCT at approximately 2 percent, assuming current coverage and
behavior. Under current conditions, the estimated average annual 1,000 new infections in
2014 are projected to increase to 1,100, and average annual deaths to rise from 400 in 2014 to
600 in 2015–20. The total estimated number of PLHIV would increase from 8,400 to 10,200.
This projected increase suggests that there is continued need to scale up programs as specified
in recommendations III to VIII.



2
       Investment in HIV programs in the Kyrgyz Republic is substantial, and current
       programs prevent a large expansion of the epidemic. With a total of US$12.6 million
       in 2013, HIV spending in the Kyrgyz Republic equates to approximately US$1,500 per
PLHIV, one of the highest values in the Region. An analysis comparing the effect of current
programs to a scenario of zero HIV spending revealed that current programs would avert
20,700 new infections and 1,800 deaths. This analysis clearly suggests that harm reduction
focused on PWID in combination with other current programs continues to prevent more
rapid spread of HIV among PWID. In the absence of programs, this spread is projected to occur
in large numbers through increased needle-sharing. The prospect of a more than three-fold
growth in the PLHIV population by 2020 in the absence of any HIV programs suggests that HIV
investment needs to be extended to 2020 and beyond to 2030 to contain the epidemic and to
meet national targets and international commitments.



3
       Optimizing allocations of currently available resources would substantially
       reduce new HIV infections by 28 percent and deaths by 53 percent from 2015–20.
       Optimization analysis suggests that this additional impact would be achieved mainly by
reallocating resources to 2 program areas: a 3-fold increase in investment in ART accompanied
by sustained HTC and a moderate increase in prevention programs for PWID, particularly
needle-exchange programs. Despite the large efficiency gains through reallocations, national
targets cannot be fully achieved with current resources at current unit costs.

The following recommendations focus on the prioritization required to achieve national
targets: reducing sexual transmission by 50 percent, reducing drug-injection-related
transmission by 50 percent, virtually eliminating MTCT by 2020, and reducing AIDS-related
deaths by 50 percent.

     4
           The top priority in the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV response is to substantially increase
           the allocation to and coverage of antiretroviral therapy. In 2013 only 7 percent of
           total national HIV spending was allocated to ART. Coverage of 1,074 PLHIV on ART was
     achieved in 2013, which is approximately 13 percent of the total estimated PLHIV, or 43
     percent of the PLHIV eligible for ART at the time. With optimized allocations to fully achieve
     national targets, investment in ART would increase from US$0.9 million to US$3.7 million
     accompanied by increased investment in HTC from US$0.8 million to US$1.3 million, totaling
     $5.0 million, or 31 percent of all HIV spending. This level of spending would extend ART
     coverage to 6,700 PLHIV, or 79 percent of all PLHIV.13 Compared to current spending, this
     coverage would dramatically reduce deaths by 62 percent (avert 2,300 deaths) over 2015–20.



     5
             The second priority in the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV epidemic is sustaining and
             expanding coverage of programs for PWID. The share of new infections due to
             needle-sharing is declining and accounts for slightly less than 50 percent of new
     infections. However, programs for this group remain critical due to the large potential for
     epidemic growth among PWID in the absence of programs. Optimization analysis suggests that,
     if resources were reduced, PWID programs should be a focus of the HIV response. With
     allocations optimized to achieve national targets, programs for PWID would receive 20 percent
     of all funding, or US$3.2million (up from US$2.0 million), compared to current allocations. In
     practical terms, it will be critical to review unit costs of NSP and OST programs for savings to
     increase not only NSP coverage as suggested by optimization, but also OST program coverage.
     OST programs have multiple health and social benefits, and current coverage of 4 percent is
     insufficient to realize them. It, therefore, will be essential for the Kyrgyz Republic to identify
     non-HIV resources from health and social sector budgets to cofinance the scale-up of OST.



     6
           HIV transmission among MSM is a small, but also the fastest growing, segment of
           the Kyrgyz Republic’s HIV epidemic. Consequently, to achieve national targets,
           focused technically efficient programs for MSM should continue to be provided. At
     current unit cost, to virtually double coverage, an increase in budgets from US$0.6 million to
     US$1.2 million would be required. However, the exceptionally high cost per person reached
     (US$449) suggests that there may be large potential for technical efficiency gains. Considering
     the cost of other programs with similar packages and programs in other countries, a 65
     percent to 85 percent reduction might be realistic and should be explored further through
     technical efficiency analysis.



     7
            Female sex workers and their clients contribute to fewer than 1 in 20 new
            infections in the Kyrgyz Republic. In this context, technical efficiency of programs
            should be reviewed to enhance their cost-effectiveness. If current or reduced
     funding is available, at current unit cost, FSW programs would not be part of the optimized mix
     of programs. However, if full funding to achieve national targets by 2020 were available, to
     fully achieve the target of reducing sexual transmission by half, programs for FSW would need
     to be sustained at current levels of coverage. The estimated allocation to achieve national
     targets of US$0.3 million (2 percent of the total allocation) could be reduced by exploring
     technical efficiency gains. Comparing Kyrgyz’ cost per person reached to that of other
     countries, substantial reductions by up to 50 percent could be feasible. This reduction also
     could be achieved by doubling coverage without increasing total FSW program cost, which
     likely would require a strong focus on key locations so that economies of scale could be
     achieved in these settings.




     13   With optimized allocations to achieve national targets, the projected number of PLHIV in 2020 would be 8,500.
Conclusions and recommendations                                                                     39

       HTC and ART should remain available to pregnant women to reduce MTCT but at
       the lowest possible cost. Just as with FSW and MSM programs, PMTCT programs
       would not be part of the optimized mix of programs at current unit cost for current
levels of spending. Moreover, MTCT accounts for approximately only 2 percent of new
infections. Because the national strategy includes an exclusive MTCT target, the optimized
allocation includes an amount of US$1.0 million for PMTCT, but additional technical
efficiencies should be explored.



9
       It is essential to critically study the large portion of HIV spending (56 percent)
       allocated to management and other costs because reallocating 20 percent of these
       costs to core treatment and prevention programs would avert additional new
infections and deaths. Even though blood safety and STI management were excluded from
the analysis, management, and other costs still accounted for 56 percent of HIV spending.
Because this expenditure could not be reviewed in the optimization analysis, other methods of
technical efficiency analysis should be applied to explore potential savings.



10
             The minimum amount to achieve national targets with optimized
             allocations is US$24 million, which could be substantially reduced to US$16
             million through reducing management cost, and further through exploring
technical efficiency gains. Achieving national targets in the Kyrgyz Republic would avert
2,300 deaths and 4,200 new infections. The amount needed to achieve these targets depends
heavily on critical choices that the Kyrgyz Republic needs to make. With business as usual
(current allocations, current unit costs), it would cost US$43 million annually. If management
and other costs grow proportionately to direct program costs, with optimized allocations, the
amount can be reduced to US$24 million. If management and other costs do not grow but could
be cut by 20 percent compared to 2013, the cost to achieve national targets would be US$16
million. With additional potential efficiency gains in FSW, MSM, and PMTCT programs, as
identified by country experts (and described in section 7.1), the amount could be reduced to
US$15 million. Technical efficiency of core programs should be studied.



11
               A robust national process to review technical efficiency, costing, and
               financing of the national HIV response could result in a detailed plan to
               close the financing gap and achieve national targets. This costed plan could
outline how to realize allocative and technical efficiency gains and mobilize domestic
resources for the response. Regional comparison of cost per person reached suggests that, in
virtually all programs, there may be additional technical efficiencies in the range of 20 percent
to 50 percent that would bring the estimated cost to achieve national targets closer to the
US$12.6 million available in 2013. The relatively large differences in cost over different years
and by program suggest that setting benchmarks for unit costs and strengthening monitoring
of cost-efficiency in delivery are key priorities in the management of the national HIV
response.

APPENDIXES
APPENDIX A.                 TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. A more detailed summary of the
model and methods is provided elsewhere (Kerr and others 2015). Optima is based on a
dynamic, population-based HIV model. Figure A.1a summarizes the populations and mixing
patterns used in Optima. Figure A.1b shows the disease progression implemented in the
model. Optima tracks the entire population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across 5 stages
of CD4 count. These CD4 count stages are aligned with the progression of the World Health
Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines, namely, acute HIV infection, >500, 350–500, 200–
350, 50–200, and 50 cells per microliter. Key aspects of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
service delivery cascade are included: from infection to diagnosis, ART initiation on first-line
therapy, treatment failure, subsequent lines of therapy, and HIV/AIDS-related or other death.

The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
PLHIV among HIV health states. The full set of equations is provided in the supplementary
material to a summary paper on the Optima model. The overall population is partitioned in
two ways: by population group and by HIV health state. Individuals are assigned to a given
population group based on their dominant risk.14 HIV infections occur through the interactions
among different populations by regular, casual, or commercial (including transactional) sexual
partnerships; through sharing of injecting equipment; or through mother-to-child
transmission. The force-of-infection is the rate at which uninfected individuals become
infected. The rate depends on the number and type of risk events to which individuals are
exposed in a given period (either within their population groups or through interaction with
other population groups) and the infection probability of each event. Mathematically, the force
of- infection has the general form:



where λ is the force-of-infection, β is the transmission probability of each event, and n is the
effective number of at-risk events (that is, n gives the average number of interaction events
with HIV-infected people through which HIV transmission may occur). The value of the

14   However, to capture important cross-modal types of transmission, relevant behavioral parameters can be set to
     non-zero values (for example, males who inject drugs may engage in commercial sex; some MSM may have
     female sexual partners).

     transmission probability β varies across CD4 count compartments (indirectly reflecting the
     high viral load at early and late stages of infection); differs for different modes of transmission
     (intravenous drug injection with a contaminated needle-syringe, penile-vaginal or penile-anal
     intercourse, and mother-to-child); and may be reduced by behavioral interventions (for
     example, condom use), biological interventions (for example, male circumcision), or ART.
     There is one force-of-infection term for each type of interaction, for example, casual sexual
     relationships between male sex workers and female sex workers (FSW). The force-of-infection
     for a given population will be the sum of all interaction types.15 In addition to the force-of-
     infection rate, which is the number of individuals who become infected with HIV per year,
     there are seven other ways by which individuals can change health states.16 The change in the
     number of people in each compartment is determined by the sum over the relevant rates
     described above multiplied by the population size of the compartments on which they act.17




     15   For sexual transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in partner populations
             Average number of casual, regular, and commercial homosexual and heterosexual acts per person per year
             Proportion of these acts in which condoms are used
             Proportion of men who are circumcised
             Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (which can increase HIV transmission probability)
             Proportion of acts that are covered by pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis
             Proportion of partners on antiretroviral treatment (art)
             Efficacies of condoms, male circumcision, post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and art at
              preventing HIV transmission.
          For injecting-related transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in populations of people who use a syringe and then share it
             Number of injections per person per year
             Proportion of injections made with shared equipment
             Fraction of people who inject drugs on opioid substitution therapy and its efficacy in reducing injecting
              behavior.
          For mother-to-child transmission, the number of-infections is determined by:
             Birth rate among women living with HIV
             Proportion of women with HIV who breastfeed
             Probability of perinatal HIV transmission in the absence of intervention
             Proportion of women receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), including ART.
     16   First, individuals may die, either because of an average background death rate for that population (which is
          greater for older populations or for people who inject drugs) or because of HIV/AIDS (which depends on CD4
          count). Second, in the absence of treatment, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4 counts. Third,
          individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which depends on
          CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms or primary HIV infection may have a higher testing rate)
          and population type (for example, FSW may test more frequently than males in the general population). Fourth,
          diagnosed individuals may commence ART at a rate depending on CD4 count. Fifth, individuals may experience
          treatment failure due to lack of adherence to therapy or development of drug resistance. Sixth, people may
          initiate second and subsequent lines of treatment after treatment failure. Finally, while on successful first- or
          second-line treatment (that is, effective viral suppressive therapy), individuals may progress from lower to
          higher CD4 counts.
     17   For example, the change in the number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–350
          cells per microliter is:




          where UFSW2002350 is the current number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–
          350 cells per microliter; UFSW3502500 is the same population but with higher CD4 count (350–500 cells/mL); t
          is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count (where 1/t is the average time to lose 150 CD4 cells/mL);
          m is the death rate; and h is the HIV testing rate. (Note: This example does not consider movement among
          populations, such as FSW returning to the general female population and vice versa—something which is
          included in Optima.)

Note: Each compartment represents a single population group with the specified health state. Each arrow
represents the movement of numbers of individuals among health states. All compartments except for
“susceptible” represent individuals living with HIV. Death includes all causes of death.

Each compartment (Figure A.1b, boxes) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
model, and each rate (Figure A.1b, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table
A.1 lists the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of
infection. The analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian
terms as previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior
distributions of the model parameter values so+ that the model generates accurate estimates
of HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that
are available (such as HIV-related deaths). The calibration can be performed automatically,
manually, or a combination. Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
consultation with governments in the countries in which the model is being applied.

     HIV Resource Optimization and Program Coverage Targets
     A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
     address one or more HIV-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s
     HIV national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
     achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform HIV strategic planning and the
     determination of program coverage levels. The key assumptions of resource optimization are
     the relationships among (1) the cost of HIV programs for specific target populations, (2) the
     resulting coverage levels of targeted populations with these HIV programs, and (3) how these
     coverage levels of HIV programs for targeted populations influence behavioral and clinical
     outcomes. Such relationships are required to understand how incremental changes in
     spending (marginal costs) affect HIV epidemics.18 Logistic functions can incorporate initial
     start-up costs and enable changes in behavior to saturate at high spending levels, thus better
     reflecting program reality. The logistic function has the form:




     where L(x) relates spending to coverage; x is the amount of funding for the program; A is the
     lower asymptote value (adjusted to match the value of L when there is no spending on a
     program); B is the upper asymptote value (for very high spending); C is the midpoint; and D is
     the steepness of the transition from A to B. For its fits, the team typically chose saturation
     values of the coverage to match behavioral data in countries with heavily funded HIV

     18   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
          coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established ART program that no
          longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for condom promotion and
          behavior change communication programs. Most HIV programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a
          more effective scale-up with increased funding. However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects
          because these high levels require increased incremental costs due to generating demand and related activities for
          the most difficult-to-reach groups. Optima uses a logistic function fitted to available input data to model cost–
          coverage curves (Appendix 2).
Appendix A                                                                                                                45



responses.19 To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm
called Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent (BALLSD). BALLSD is similar to
simulated annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an
initial starting point. However, unlike simulated annealing, BALLSD chooses future step sizes
and directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of optimization
problems, the team has shown that BALLSD can determine optimized solutions with fewer
function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent and
simulated annealing.

While all HIV interventions have some direct or indirect non-HIV benefits, some programs
including opiate substitution therapy (OST) or conditional cash transfers, have multiple
substantial proven benefits across different sectors. Such additional benefits were reflected by
using the approach of a cross-sectoral financing model to effectively distribute the costs in
accordance with the benefits. By adapting standard techniques from welfare economics to
attribute the benefits of OST programs across the benefiting sectors, it was estimated that
average HIV-related benefits are approximately only 10 percent of the overall health and social
benefits of OST. Therefore, only 10 percent of the OST cost was included in the optimization
analysis.

Uncertainty Analyses
Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves. To incorporate uncertainty in these curves,
users define upper and lower limits for both coverage and behavior for no spending and for
very high spending.20




19   Program coverage for zero spending, or behavioral outcomes for zero coverage of formal programs, is inferred
     using data from early on in the epidemic or just before significant investment in HIV programs. Practically, the
     team also discussed the zero and high spending cases with local experts, who could advise on private sector HIV
     service delivery outside the governments’ expenditure tracking systems. For each HIV program, the team derived
     one set of logistic curves that related funding to program coverage levels and another set of curves (generally,
     linear relationships) that related coverage levels to clinical or behavioral outcomes (the impacts that HIV
     strategies aim to achieve).
20   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
     experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
     ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
     analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological,
     behavioral, and biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty
     estimates.
      APPENDIX B.               MODEL CALIBRATION FIGURES
      A key stage in the Optima modelling process is “calibration.” Calibration aims to align the
      Optima-projected trends with the historically observed trends in HIV prevalence in different
      population groups in a given context. Given the challenges inherent in fitting epidemiological
      and behavioral data, the calibration for the Kyrgyz Republic was performed manually (by
      varying relevant model parameters to achieve a best-fit between model-projected and historic
      HIV prevalence) and in close collaboration with in-country stakeholders.

      Black dots represent available data for HIV prevalence. Lines attached to these discs represent
      uncertainty bounds. The solid curve is the best fitted estimation of HIV prevalence in each
      subpopulation.

      For treatment, black discs represent available data for the number of people on ART. Lines
      attached to these discs represent uncertainty bounds. The solid curve is the best fitting
      simulation of total ART patient numbers.

APPENDIX C.             COST-COVERAGE-OUTCOME CURVES
To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and thus determine the
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships among the cost of HIV
intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs, and the resulting
outcomes. These relationships are specific to the country, population, and program being
considered.

Using the relationships among cost, coverage, and outcome―in combination with Optima’s
epidemic module―it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in funding allocated to
each program, will impact overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a mathematical
optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine the optimized allocation of funding across
different HIV programs.

The relationship between program spending and coverage is shown in the left panel of Figure
C. 1. This relationship describes the level of output (availability of a service to a specific
proportion of the target population) achieved with a specific level of financial input (cost in
US$). For example, this relationship describes how many female sex workers could be
provided with a standard package of services with an investment of US$0–US$1,000,000. The
relationship between coverage levels and outcome is shown in the right panel. This
relationship describes the proportion of people who would adopt a specific behavior (such as
condom use or needle-sharing). These relationships were produced in collaboration with the
Kyrgyz Republic experts.

Black discs represent available spending, coverage data, and associated behaviors. The solid
curves are the best fitting or assumed relationship.

APPENDIX D. DETAILED RESEARCH QUESTIONS
PRIORITIZED IN THIS ANALYSIS
Analysis 1: How can the Republic of Kyrygyz optimize the allocation of HIV
funding, and will optimization meet the stated targets?
This analysis compares the trajectory of the epidemic and key outcomes under the current
allocation of resources against an optimized allocation of resources. For this analysis, funding
levels are not varied, only the way that funding is spent. The aim is to determine how the
Kyrgyz Republic can allocate available resources to achieve maximum impact, and how close
that maximum impact will be to the national strategy targets described.

Analysis 1 asks 2 questions:

1. What will be the expected annual levels of HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, and AIDS-related
   deaths if current funding allocations are maintained? The results of this analysis are
   described in chapter 3 and explored in chapter 4.
2. If funding is kept at the same level, but resources are allocated in an optimized way, what
   will be the expected annual levels of HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, and AIDS-related
   deaths?
The results of this analysis are described in chapter 5.

Analysis 2: What might be gained from increased investment in HIV programs?
This analysis explores what could be achieved with an increase in the available budget. The
previous analysis assumed fixed amounts of available funding and explored an optimized
allocation of those funds to see how close it is possible to get to the national targets with the
current budget. In contrast, Analysis 2 aims for the maximum possible reduction of new deaths
and infections. The results are presented in chapter 6.

Analysis 3: What is the minimum spend required to meet the national strategy
targets?
This analysis identifies the minimum resource requirements to achieve the national strategy
targets. Analysis 3 also assesses the gap in funding required to achieve these targets. The
results are presented in chapter 7.

and 2020.

Allocations to achieve national strategy targets
Figure E.2 presents optimized allocations to achieve national targets. Allocation B represents
the 2014 level of spending and allocations. Allocation C is the optimized allocation to achieve
conservative targets, which were defined as no increase in new HIV infections and deaths.
These could be achieved with optimized allocation of $13.3 million per year, similar to the
amount available in 2013. For the sake of completeness and comparison, optimized
allocations at current level of spending (D and E) are included in Figure E.2.

D and E are allocations to get as close as possible to national targets, but they do not achieve
national targets. Allocation F shows that approximately $24 million would be required to
achieve national targets (50 percent reduction of HIV incidence and deaths by 2020), assuming
that current unit costs are valid and that management cost would grow proportionately with
current allocations. Allocation G shows the amount that would be required to achieve national
targets if the distribution of resources across programs remained at its 2014 level of
approximately US$43 million. The difference in spending (US$19 million) between Allocations
F and G is the estimated amount that could be saved annually by optimizing allocation of
spending to achieve national targets. Additional savings on other costs will be explored further
in Figure E.3.

Figure E.3 illustrates the health outcomes on the national targets of implementing the different
allocations and should be viewed in association with Figure E.2. The bars presented in Figure
E.3 show the projected national health outcomes in 2020 under each of the scenarios
represented in Figure E.2. The first bar in each of the subplots shows the estimated 2014
values of the respective health outcome indicator. The bars that represent Allocation C––the
minimal amount of money required to achieve conservative targets––illustrate that Allocation
C is estimated to lead to no increase in either new infections (sexual or injecting) or deaths
from 2014 levels by 2020. Similarly, Allocations D and E show that, by redistributing current
resources, decreases in infections and deaths can be achieved by 2020 compared to 2014
levels. These compare favorably to the projection under the Allocation B scenario, which
shows the estimated health outcomes if current funding distribution is maintained. Indeed,

     under the assumption that current funding distributions will be maintained, the number of
     new infections and AIDS-related deaths is expected to increase from 2014 levels by 2020. The
     bars that represent Allocation F show that the national targets of 50 percent reductions in
     incidence and deaths from 2014 levels and the elimination of MTCT are expected to be
     achieved by 2020.

     Optimization results up to 2030
     Figures E.4 and E.5 show the optimized allocations for the same targets defined in chapter 7
     but for 2015–30. The results are similar to those obtained in the previous chapters However,
     these results for the longer time frame have a slight emphasis toward prevention programs
     and away from treatment programs. This shift perhaps is not surprising because preventing an
     infection in the short term means that resources will not have to be used to treat the individual
     in the longer term. Interestingly, the estimated minimal amount of annual funding required to
     achieve the conservative targets by 2030 is slightly larger when compared to the resources
     required to achieve this goal by 2020. This result highlights that achieving the long-term
     control of an epidemic may be just as challenging as achieving the short-term control.

APPENDIX F              GLOSSARY
Allocative efficiency    Within a defined resource envelope, AE of health or HIV-specific
(AE)                     interventions provides the right intervention to the right people at the right
                         place in the correct way to maximize targeted health outcomes.
Behavioral               Discourages risky behaviors and reinforces protective ones, typically by
intervention             addressing knowledge, attitudes, norms, and skills.
Biomedical               Biomedical HIV intervention strategies use medical and public health
intervention             approaches to block infection, decrease infectiousness, and reduce
                         susceptibility.
Bottom-up costing        Costing method that identifies all of the resources that are used to provide a
                         service and assigns a value to each of them. These values then are summed
                         and linked to a unit of activity to derive a total unit cost.
Cost-effectiveness       Form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes
analysis (CEA)           (effects) of two or more courses of action.
Effectiveness            Degree of achievement of a (health) outcome in a real-world
                         implementation setting.
Efficiency               Achievement of an output with the lowest possible input without
                         compromising quality.
Financial                Ability of government and its partners to continue spending on a health or
sustainability           HIV outcome for the required duration and to meet any cost of borrowing
                         without compromising the government’s, household’s, or other funding
                         partner’s financial position.
HIV incidence            Estimated total number (or rate) of new (total number of diagnosed and
                         undiagnosed) HIV infections in a given period.
HIV prevalence           Percentage of people who are infected with HIV at a given point in time.
Implementation           Set of measures to ensure that programs are implemented in a way that
efficiency               achieves outputs with the lowest input of resources. In practical terms,
                         improving implementation efficiency means identifying better delivery
                         solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service delivery
                         models, and assessing and addressing service delivery “roadblocks.”
                         Implementation efficiency will improve the scale, coverage, and quality of
                         programs.
Incremental cost-        Equation commonly used in health economics to provide a practical
effectiveness ratio      approach to decision making regarding health interventions. ICER is the
(ICER)                   ratio of the change in costs to incremental benefits of a therapeutic
                         intervention or treatment.
Model                    Computer system designed to demonstrate the probable effect of two or
                         more variables that might be brought to bear on an outcome. Such models
                         can reduce the effort required to manipulate these factors and present the
                         results in an accessible format.
Opioid substitution      Medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a
therapy (OST)            longer acting but less euphoric opioid. Methadone or buprenorphine
                         typically are used, and the drug is taken under medical supervision.

Opportunistic infection   Treatment given to PLHIV to prevent either a first episode of an OI
under medical             (primary prophylaxis) or the recurrence of infection (secondary
(OI prophylaxis)          prophylaxis).
Pre-exposure              Method for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of
prophylaxis (PrEP)        acquiring it to prevent HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug.
Program effectiveness     Program effectiveness incorporates evaluations to establish what works
                          and impacts disease and/or transmission intensity, disseminating
                          proven practice, and improving the public health results of programs.
Program sustainability    Ability to maintain the institutions, management, human resources,
                          service delivery, and demand generation components of a national
                          response until impact goals have been achieved and maintained over
                          time as intended by the strategy.
Return on investments     Performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment
(ROI)                     or to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. To
                          calculate ROI, the benefit (return) of an investment is divided by the cost
                          of the investment; the result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
Saturation                Maximum level of coverage that a program can achieve.
Technical efficiency      Delivery of a (health) service in a way that produces maximum output at
                          the lowest possible unit cost while according with operational quality
                          standards.
Top-down costing          Costing method that divides total expenditure (quantum of funding
                          available) for a given area or policy by total units of activity (such as
                          patients served) to derive a unit cost.
Universal health          Universal health coverage (UC), is defined as ensuring that all people
coverage (UC)             have access to the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and
                          palliative health services that they need, of sufficient quality to be
                          effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose
                          the user to financial hardship.
