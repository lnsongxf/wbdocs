    A. Introduction

    Among the many oil-rich countries in the world, some have done far better in terms of improving
the standards of living of their citizens than others. Why has this been so? This paper attempts to
answer this question using long run changes in two aspects of the standard of living, the child mortality
rate and the secondary education enrollment rate.1

    Does performance with respect to these indicators vary among oil rich countries? Consider Figure 1
below that shows a fractional-polynomial regression of the change in child mortality rates (number of
deaths among children under 5 years of age per 1,000 births) during 1970-2010 on the initial child
mortality rates prevailing in each country circa 1970. To show the diversity in performance among oil
rich countries, we have labeled all oil rich countries from the Middle East and North African (MENA)
region as well as all oil rich countries from the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region. All the MENA countries
(except Iraq) are located above the regression line while all the SSA countries are below the line. In
other words, all the MENA countries (save Iraq) achieved larger changes over time than predicted by
their initial levels of child mortality while the SSA countries achieved smaller ones.

    Figure 2 shows a similar, though less pronounced pattern, using changes in gross secondary school
enrollment rates as an alternative measure of development performance. All MENA countries (except
Iraq) are seen to have achieved gains that are higher than would have been predicted by their initial
levels in 1970. Oman shows exceptionally good performance. Among the African countries, four
(Angola, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea and the Republic of Congo) are below the fitted regression curve
while one (Nigeria) is above the line.

    Clearly, there is diversity in performance between these two groups of oil rich countries. One
reason for this may lie simply in differences in wealth. Higher wealth among the MENA countries
compared to the SSA ones (clearly true for the GCC group of MENA countries) may have provided the
resources with which to improve health and education indicators at a faster rate. We will investigate
this connection rigorously in this paper, in particular, by examining the effect of public spending on
health and education outcomes. Meanwhile, the link between incomes and development performance

  We use these two measures because they are considered such important policy objectives that they were
included in the Millennium Development Goals adopted by the international development community for the
period 2000-2015 and have now been included as well among the Sustainable Development Goals for the next
decade and a half. We do not use income per capita or growth of income per capita as measures of performance
because, for oil rich counties, these are likely to be mechanically related to the amount of oil resources they
possess and to exogenous changes in the price of oil over time.

                                                                                                                  2

improvement (between 1970 and 2010) in child mortality rates on the Y-axis and the 2010 level of GDP
per capita (measured in 2011 PPP dollars) on the X-axis.

                                          The results show that, even after controlling for income per capita, the MENA countries have
achieved better child mortality outcomes (all but Iraq are located above the bivariate regression curve)
over the past 40 years or so than the African countries (all located below the regression curve). This
suggests that differences in performance are due to more than just differences in income per capita.
This should not be surprising since countries with similar levels of resources may make different budget
allocations to different priorities and with different degrees of effectiveness.

                                          The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We proceed in Section B to a literature survey that
helps identify plausible determinants of progress over time in child mortality and school enrollment. In
Section C, we develop the empirical strategy to assess the importance of these determinants of cross-
country variations in human development outcomes. The results of our econometric analyses are
reported in Section D together with robustness checks of the basic model. In Section E, we explore two
extensions of the model that delve deeper into oil-wealth effects. In Section F, we report and discuss
some country-specific results of the empirical model that answer the question in the title of the paper in
a nuanced fashion. Concluding remarks follow in Section G.

    B. Literature review

  Two strands of literature have a bearing on our proposed investigation. The first consists of studies
of the determinants of performance in the health and education area. The second consists of studies of
policy and institutional characteristics of oil-rich countries often referred to as the “resource curse”. We
review these two strands below by first identifying the important determinants of health and education
performance and then considering how “resource curse” aspects may accentuate or attenuate these
determinants.
  Public spending on health and education facilities and personnel is perhaps the most prominent policy
tool used by governments to improve health and education indicators. This is especially the case with
the MENA oil countries where the model of publicly financed delivery of health and education services
was adopted early in their histories as independent nation-states, even to the extent of being
considered a basic right of citizens in some countries (Kronfol, 2012). The public sector in resource rich
countries tends to be generously endowed with revenues and thus one would expect public spending to
be especially important to the supply of health and education facilities there. A number of studies have
found public spending to be associated with improvements in health and education indicators (Gupta et
al., 2002; Baldacci et al., 2008) in developing countries. However, others have found public spending to
have a negligible effect (Filmer and Pritchett, 1999; McGuire, 2005) and have argued that this is likely
because of leakages that affect public spending in countries with weak governance.
  The quality of governance is important to health and education outcomes in several ways. In corrupt
environments, public resources could be misappropriated and misspent. The lack of accountability
mechanisms could affect the extent to which health and education personnel (doctors, nurses, teachers
and school administrators) shirk from their duties. There is, by now, a fairly extensive literature showing
that developing countries suffer from high levels of absenteeism among service providers (Chaudhury,
et al., 2006). Where the rule of law is weak, it may be difficult to enforce corrective actions even when
malfeasance is detected. The empirical literature tends to confirm a link between weak governance and
poor outcomes from public spending (Rajkumar and Swaroop, 2008).
  The “resource curse” literature notes the tendency for resource-rich countries to have especially
weak governance arrangements. The availability of natural resources presents numerous opportunities
for private gain through such means as getting exclusive licenses to exploit the resources or obtaining
contracts to sell goods and services to governments. Such “rent-seeking” activities generate corruption.
This connection between resource dependence and corruption has been empirically documented in
many studies (see, for example, Mauro, 1995 and Bhattacharya and Hodler, 2010). The connection is

                                                                                                            5
even stronger in non-democracies where accountability mechanisms (or checks and balances) are less
strong (Ross, 2001). If so, this would make the governance issue even more important for the MENA
and African oil rich countries since many of them happen to be authoritarian and non-democratic in
practice.
  Private spending may also be an important determinant, especially in contexts where private clinics
and schools are widely available. However, direct information on private spending on health and
education is not available for most developing countries. Some studies use income per capita as a proxy
for private spending and find a positive and significant role for it: see Filmer and Pritchett (1999) for the
case of child mortality and Gupta et al., (2002) and Baldacci et al., (2008) for the case of education
attainment. Indeed, Filmer and Pritchett (1999) argue that income levels are by far the predominant
determinant of child mortality improvements. Other studies (see Iqbal and Kiendrebeogo, 2015) use the
growth rate of income as a proxy, arguing that income per capita is unsuitable because it is often highly
collinear with other included variables such as public spending.
  In addition to direct spending on health and education, other targets of public spending may also be
relevant to improving health and education indicators. For example, spending on infrastructure (such as
water supply and sanitation) and social assistance (such as food subsidies) may have this effect.
The connection between clean water supply and child mortality rates is well documented, as is that
between child nutrition and child mortality (Pelletier and Frongillo, 2003). Resource-rich countries
generally tend to spend a lot on infrastructure (this can also be thought of as a way to distribute rents in
discretionary ways) as well as to have generous social assistance arrangements. The latter is a
particularly distinctive characteristic of MENA countries (including those without much by way of oil
wealth) which have had generous food and fuel subsidies for many years (Iqbal, 2006). Food sufficiency
is likely to be an important determinant of health and education outcomes for inter-related reasons.
Adequacy of food among mothers is known to lead to higher baby weight and higher levels of milk
production and thus breastfeeding, all of which lead in turn to improved chances for infant and child
survival. Likewise, adequacy of food among children leads to reduced susceptibility to disease, again
leading to better child survival rates. As far as education is concerned, better food intake is likely to lead
to better health among children who are then less likely to miss days at school and drop out at lower
ages.
   Population density could be another important variable. For mortality, the link could go either way.
Higher population densities could mean that a given health facility would cover more people and thus
provide economies of scale to public spending. On the other hand, higher population densities have

                                                                                                            6
also been associated in many areas with higher probabilities of disease incidence and spread. Rising
mortality accompanied urbanization in Europe and North America in the first half of the nineteenth
century in many cities (Cutler et al., 2006). In the case of education, however, the link is more likely to
be one-way: population density is likely to lead to greater productivity in public spending as each school
covers more students.
    C. Modeling Considerations

   A typical empirical model linking an education or health indicator to its determinants takes the
following general form:

(1) M i  f ( Z i )

where the subscript i denotes country, M refers to the education or health indicator adopted as the
dependent variable, and Z refers to a vector of socioeconomic variables such as those discussed in the
literature survey above.

   Our interest, however, is in explaining changes in the education or health measure over time. An
empirical model for this may be written in the following general form:

(2) LogM i ( t  n )  LogM it  f ( LogM it , Z iavg )

where the left hand side refers to the log-change in M over a n -year interval from year t to year t  n
and, on the right hand side, Mit refers to the initial value of M at time t ; and the subscript avg refers

to the average value of the independent variables over the n year interval.

   This empirical model differs in three main respects from the conventional approach: (a) it defines the
dependent variable as the growth rate of the indicator over time rather than its level at a point in time;
(b) it introduces the initial level of the indicator as an independent variable and (c) it uses average values
over past intervals for the independent variables rather than contemporary values. These three aspects
are discussed further below.

   Formulation of the dependent variable. Most studies use the level of education attainment or child
mortality at a given point in time as the dependent variable. Some (see Wang, 2002 and Baldaccci et al.,
2008) average the indicator over five-year periods to reduce measurement errors. Since our interest is
in explaining changes over time, we define our dependent variable as the log-change in indicator levels
between 1980 and 2014 for each country in our sample. This is analogous to what is done in the


                                                                                                              7
“empirics of growth” literature where the growth rate of income over time is the object of explanation
rather than its level at any given point in time. This formulation is used in Goldin and Katz (1997) and
Iqbal and Kiendrebeogo (2015) for education attainment and Pritchett and Summers (1996) and Iqbal
and Kiendrebeogo (2014) for child mortality reduction. The log-change formulation is central to the
Iqbal and Kiendrebeogo studies but somewhat incidental to the other studies where it is mixed in with
level formulations.

  Use of initial level of indicator as independent variable. Many empirical formulations of the well-
known Solow (1956) growth model use as an independent variable the initial level of income for the
year from which growth is being measured. This allows one to determine the presence of convergence,
whereby countries with low initial per capita incomes tend to grow faster than those with higher initial
incomes (Sala-i-Martin, 1996). Our formulation allows us to check for convergence over time in the
levels of health and education outcomes as well.

  That convergence very likely characterizes the pattern of change in health and education indicators
may be seen from Figures 1 and 2. These show how the initial level of the relevant indicator is linked to
subsequent changes in it. Figure 2 is especially notable in tracing out a hyperbolic arc showing that
countries with low school enrollment rates in 1970 have much bigger increases in enrollment over the
next 40 years than countries with high enrollment rates in 1970. Why is this the case? Consider, for
example, a country with close to 100% enrollment. In this case, most of the children who are unenrolled
are likely to be the difficult cases who may be living in remote locations or constrained by individual
health or disability problems or influenced by family-specific beliefs or culture. Meanwhile, at the
opposite extreme of very low enrollment rates, small investments in school buildings and teachers may
elicit large gains in enrollment from the relatively large population with unmet educational demand. In
such a case, one would expect convergence over time as countries with lower initial rates move faster
and catch up with the ones with higher initial rates.

   A similar “economies of scale” case can be made for child mortality improvements. One would
expect that, all other things being equal, the application of public and private resources should have a
bigger impact in countries that had high rates of child mortality to begin with since the resources would
be applied to larger pools of potentially treatable cases. Roughly speaking, the same fixed cost
(reflected in medical facilities and personnel) can be used to tackle a larger number of cases in high
initial mortality environments than in low mortality environments.



                                                                                                            8
  Using past average values for independent variables. Using past average values for each independent
variable is consistent with the idea that it takes time for spending to have an impact on health or
education performance as facilities need to be built and personnel need to be trained. Furthermore, the
same facilities and personnel, once in place, can continue to have impact over many years. Some
studies (see Baldacci et al., 2008) have attempted to incorporate these aspects by using five-year
averages for their measure of public spending. Taking averages over past values also serves to mitigate
concerns about measurement errors and endogeneity. While measurement errors could be large with
respect to data for any given year, by the law of large numbers, averaging over a large number of years
reduces the scope for such errors. Lacking any theoretical or empirical guidance on the exact duration
of the interval over which spending and other independent variables affect health and education
indicators, we simply use the average value of these variables over the period for which data are
available.

  Based on the above considerations, we estimate two equations, one each for changes in child
mortality and gross secondary school enrollment, which take the following general form:

Equation (3)

| LnYi 2014  LnYi1980 |    0 LnYi1980  1 LnPublicSpendingiavg   2Undernourishmentiavg 
                           3Growthiavg   4 PopulationDensityiavg   5CorruptionControli   i

In this equation, Y is the outcome indicator for health (child mortality) or education (school enrollment

and | LnYi 2014  LnYi1980 | is the absolute log-change in Y in country i between 1980 and 2014. We use

absolute values so that higher values of | LnY2014  LnY1980 | are interpreted as “good” development

outcomes. LnPublicSp ending avg is the log of average public spending per capita on health (in the child

mortality regression) or on education (in the school enrollment case). Both measures are averaged over
1980-2014, the period for which relevant data are available. Undernouri shment avg refers to the

proportion of the population whose food intake is insufficient to maintain minimum dietary energy
needs continuously (averaged over 1990-2014). Growthavg is the average annual growth rate of real

GDP per capita over 1980-2014. Corruption control refers to the degree to which corruption is perceived

to be well-controlled in the country and is also averaged over 1980-2014.    i is an error term.
Additional information on the definition and sourcing of these variables is provided in the annex.

    D. Regression Results

Basic model

   Table 1 reports the results of estimating Equation 3 separately for child mortality and school
enrollment. The initial levels of child mortality and school enrollment turn out to be very important in
their respective regressions. They are statistically significant at the 1% level of confidence and they have
the largest standardized coefficients among all independent variables by far.

Notes: Regressions are run on global samples including developing and high-income countries. The
dependent variables are the absolute log changes in child mortality (reduction) and secondary school
enrollment (increase) over the period 1980-2014. Asterisks denote significance levels as follows: ***
p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

     The positive sign on initial child mortality shows that the higher is the initial child mortality in 1980,
the greater is the reduction during 1980-2014. The negative sign on initial school enrollment shows that
the is higher the initial level of secondary school enrollment in 1980, the smaller is the increase over
time. Thus, in both cases, convergence is at work: countries with worse child mortality and education
levels in 1980 improve these indicators at a faster rate over the next three decades than countries with
better initial levels.

                                                                                                            10
      Among policy variables, public spending turns out to be important, both in statistical terms
(significant at 1% level of confidence) and in economic terms (with high values for standardized
coefficients). The greater the amount spent per capita on health and education, the better the
development performance in terms of child mortality and school enrollment. For child mortality
reduction, similar results have been found in some earlier work (see Gupta et al. 2002) but not in other
investigations (see Filmer and Pritchett, 1999). For school enrollment, similar results are reported by
Gupta et al. (2002) and by Baldacci et al. (2008) for developing countries.
    Income growth is significant in both equations. The faster a country has grown, the better is its
performance with respect to reducing child mortality and raising school enrollment.2 This finding is
consistent with Filmer and Pritchett (1999) for child mortality and Baldacci et al. (2008) and Goldin and
Katz (1997) for education. However, as noted earlier, previous studies have used income per capita
rather than growth as the relevant proxy while interpreting this as capturing the effect of private
spending.
     The food or caloric sufficiency variable is significant with a negative sign in both regressions: the
higher the level of undernourishment the smaller the reduction in child mortality and the smaller the
increase in school enrollment. Countries that were better able to ensure food adequacy clearly did
better. Since this result holds even in the presence of an income growth variable, it suggests that
policies directed towards food sufficiency (such as provision of subsidies relating to food items) have
contributed independently to this effect.
    Population density has a significant effect with a positive sign in the child morality equation. This
suggests that areas with higher population density benefit from an economies of scale effect.3 Such
results have been observed before in some studies, using urbanization as an alternative measure of
population density. Population density is not significant in the school enrollment regression.

    The corruption variable is not significant in either the child mortality regression or the school
enrollment regression. This is surprising because the literature suggests that corruption is an important
issue in the delivery of public services in developing countries. Perhaps it is the nature of our sample
that has produced this result: our sample contains higher income OECD countries as well where
corruption is not a big issue in public service delivery. We check for this in the next section.


2
  When we use average GDP per capita instead we also find that countries with higher levels of income per capita
tend to experience faster reductions in child mortality and faster increases in school enrollment.
3
  Alternatively, using urbanization instead of population density provides very similar results but the coefficient on
Health spending per capita is no longer statistically significant at conventional levels.

                                                                                                                    11
  For the education regression, we can think of one other reason for the lack of significance. Let us
assume that corruption results in a lack of books, equipment and qualified teachers and thus low quality
education at public schools. A possible response would be for parents to move their children to better
quality private schools. Of course, many families may not be able to afford this or such schools may not
be available. But even if some pupils do switch from public to private schools, this has no impact on the
measured enrollment rate used in our present analysis because this encompasses both public and
private schools. We do not have information on enrollment rates for private schools separately. If we
did, we would have been better placed to detect a governance effect on education.

Robustness checks

        We employ two robustness checks. First, we run the basic model on a smaller sample of
developing countries only. Second, we attempt a TSLS estimate of the basic model. Table 2 shows the
results of regressions run on a sample of developing countries only. They suggest that our basic model
is robust in the sense that none of the signs and significance levels change when the sample size is
restricted to developing countries only. Four variables remain significant for both health and education
performance: initial level of dependent variable; public spending; income growth and level of
undernourishment. Furthermore, population density remains robust in the child mortality equation
while corruption remains insignificant in both equations.

        The second robustness check accounts for the possibility of an endogenous relationship
between public spending per capita on health or education and the dependent variables as well as for
possible errors in measurement arising from the fact that the empirical data originate in sources that do
not necessarily define public spending in equivalent ways. Adopting a change rather than a level
formulation for the dependent variable, and using past average values for the independent variables,
help us mitigate these concerns somewhat since it is unlikely that the long run change in child mortality
(or education measure) will affect, say, average public spending on health (or education). In addition,
we employ a Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) procedure in which the relevant public spending variables
are entered in instrumented form. In each case, two instrument variables are used: the initial level (in
1980) of public spending and its rate of growth over 1980 and 2014. The results of the TSLS procedure
(see Table 3) also suggest that our basic model is robust. The signs and significance levels do not change
(in the second stage regression) from those in the basic model in either the child mortality or the
secondary school enrollment regression.

Other robustness checks include (i) using alternative measures of heath (infant mortality rate) and
education (average years of schooling) outcomes, (ii) using alternative measures of health/education
spending (measured as a ratio to GDP or as ratio to total spending), (iii) using alternative measures of
nutrition (depth of the food deficit), and (iv) including additional controls such as a proxies for income
inequality (Gini index), income poverty (poverty headcount and poverty gap) and (v) using panel
specifications (yearly data, 5-year and 10-year non-overlapping periods). Our main results, available on
request, are robust to all these sensitivity checks.

    E. Extensions

    We now extend our basic model to get a better sense of its applicability to oil- rich countries. In the
introductory section, we had noted the fact that oil-rich countries in the MENA region tended to
perform much better than predicted by their initial conditions or their income (see Figures 1, 2 and 3).
We explore whether there is a MENA-specific effect by adding a dummy for the MENA region to the


                                                                                                           14
basic model. We also check to see whether oil resources have any effect in addition to whatever is
captured through public and private spending. So we add a dummy variable for oil resources which
takes the value 1 if the country in question is in the top 25 countries ranked by level of oil production
per capita and 0 otherwise. The MENA and oil dummies are introduced separately as well as in
interaction with the public spending variable. The relevant results are reported for the child mortality
case in Table 4 and the school enrollment case in Table 5.

Notes: Regressions are run on global samples including developing and high-income countries. The

        Including a dummy for the MENA region has an effect in the child mortality regression but not in
the school enrollment regression. In the child mortality regression, the dummy variable for MENA is
positive and significant, both by itself and when interacted with the public spending on health variable.
This suggests that the child mortality results for MENA are also affected by some unspecified variables



                                                                                                            15
that are being captured instead by the regional dummy.4 And these variables appear to affect the
impact on child mortality of public spending on health. However, the basic model remains robust in the
presence of the MENA dummy.

         The oil resource dummy does not have an effect in either regression, not by itself and not in
interaction with the public spending variable. This suggests that, once the other variables in the basic
model have been included, whether or not a country is oil-rich does not matter. Most probably, the
effect of oil resources is fully picked up by the public spending and income growth variables.

  When we use the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries instead, we get a stronger effect. The coefficient
increases from 0.370 [s.e=0.123] to 0.554 [s.e.= 0.221]. But this stronger effect is unlikely to be related to oil
resources, given that the coefficient on the Oil-rich dummy is statistically insignificant.

       F. Country-Specific Discussion

       Now that we have a sense of which independent variables are statistically significant we can turn to
a discussion of their relative impacts at the country level. Tables 6 and 7 show the extent to which each
robustly significant independent variable has contributed to the fitted absolute growth rate (as a
deviation from the sample mean) of child mortality and school enrollment for all the hydrocarbon rich
developing countries in our sample.5 This allows us to assess which factors were most important in each
country case.
       Three broad patterns can be discerned from Table 6. First, initial levels of child mortality were the
most important factor for seven countries but in a negative sense, namely, their initial levels of child
mortality in 1980 were so low that they had a big momentum disadvantage relative to other countries.
These countries are Kazakhstan, Trinidad and Tobago, Mexico, Kuwait, Malaysia, the República
Bolivariana de Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates. By contrast, for Nigeria and Angola, initial
levels of child mortality were so high that this became the biggest source of momentum for the country
in reducing child mortality over the succeeding years.

 Oil-rich countries are defined as belonging to the top 20 countries in the distribution of oil production per capita
over 1980-2011. Only countries for which we have data are included in our sample.

                                                                                                                   17
  Notes: Entries are expressed in percentage points. The fitted rate of decline in CM is expressed as a deviation from the
sample mean. CM stands for child mortality. Only the statistically significant regressors are used.

   If we slit the non-high-income OECD sample into quintiles of rate of decline in child mortality, it
appears that four oil-rich countries (Algeria, Azerbaijan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Nigeria) are in
the top quintile and three (the República Bolivariana de Venezuela, United Arab Emirates, and Republic
of Congo) in the bottom quintile. These differences in rates of decline in child mortality illustrate the
extent to which some oil-rich countries performed better than others. These differences are the results
of conditional convergence, undernourishment, public spending on health and, to some extent,
economic growth and population density.
   Second, undernourishment or caloric sufficiency turns out to have played a surprisingly important
role. In several countries, namely, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, the Islamic Republic
of Iran, Mexico, and Algeria, the high degree of caloric sufficiency (low undernourishment) played the
most significant role in reducing child mortality. In another two countries, namely, Angola and Republic
of Congo, the relatively low degree of caloric sufficiency played the most significant role in preventing
the reduction of child mortality.
   Third, high levels of public spending on health were the most important determinant in Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Trinidad & Tobago, the República Bolivariana de Venezuela, Malaysia, and
Algeria. In Indonesia, Nigeria, and the Republic of Congo, by contrast, public spending was so low that it
became the most important factor in retarding the decline of child mortality. The above suggests that
different factors contribute to different degrees in the fitted rate of decline in the child mortality rate (as
a deviation from the sample mean) for the country in question.

Notes: Entries are expressed in percentage points. The fitted rate of growth in SE is expressed as a deviation from the sample
mean. SE stands for school enrollment. Only the statistically significant regressors are used.

   Turning now to the education case, we find a somewhat different pattern than in the case of child
mortality (see Table 7). The biggest difference relates to the role of initial level of enrollment. In the
education case, this is by far the biggest contributor to the gap than any other independent variable for
the majority of oil rich countries (10 of the 14 countries in the table). In all but three cases, the role of
this factor is negative: the initial level of school enrollment was so high for the countries in question in
1980 that it slowed down the rate of subsequent increase in enrollment. However, in the cases of
Angola, Nigeria and Indonesia, the initial enrollment in 1980 was so low that it imparted great
momentum to subsequent increases.
     Initial enrollment was not important in explaining the gap between actual and predicted changes in
the cases of Algeria and Indonesia. In the case of Algeria, public spending on education and
undernourishment were the most important contributing factors whereas in the case of Indonesia,
undernourishment was the single most important determinant in a positive direction. Once again, some
oil-rich countries performed better than others. If we split the non-high-income OECD sample into
quintiles of rate of growth in school enrollment, we find that two oil-rich countries (Nigeria, Angola) are
in the top quintile and five (Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, Congo, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan) in the
bottom quintile. The differences in fitted growth rates of school enrollment across oil-rich countries
were mainly driven by conditional convergence and, to a lesser extent, public spending on education,
undernourishment and economic growth.

     G. Concluding Observations

   We have attempted in this paper to identify the policy and institutional factors that best account for
the differences in development performance, measured in terms of the decline in child mortality and
the increase in school enrollments, among hydrocarbon rich countries. Modeling considerations
introduce a legacy factor into our assessment. This factor is the initial level of child mortality and
secondary school enrollment in 1980 in each country. Our regression analysis suggests that this legacy
factor is a very important determinant in both cases and it operates in a way that confers a momentum

                                                                                                                             19
in countries that have high child mortality rates and low school enrollment rates as initial conditions.
Such countries benefit from a convergence process in which their subsequent improvement, ceteris
paribus, is faster than in countries with relatively advantageous initial conditions, similar to what is
found in growth regressions where countries with initially low incomes tend to grow faster than those
with initially higher incomes.
  When we examine the contribution of different factors to the gap between actual and predicted
changes in child mortality and school enrollment we find initial conditions to be very important as well.
Indeed, in the case of school enrollment, it is the dominant factor in 10 of the 14 oil rich countries for
which calculations could be performed.
  Another broad conclusion is that policy factors worked in different ways in different countries. The
degree of undernourishment (reflecting food subsidy policy most likely) was a surprisingly common
positive factor among many countries (especially those from the Middle East and North Africa) and a
negative factor for African oil rich countries such as Angola and the Republic of Congo. This may be
related to the fact that virtually all MENA countries have operated food subsidy programs for many
years.
  Surprisingly, levels of public spending were not found to be among the most important contributors
to the gap between actual and predicted changes in school enrollment, although they were important in
a few cases for child mortality changes.
