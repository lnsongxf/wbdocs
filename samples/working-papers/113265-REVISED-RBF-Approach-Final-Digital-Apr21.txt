Abstract
This paper outlines the World Bank Group’s approach
to how results-based financing (RBF) can resolve some
of the forthcoming constraints faced by client
countries to achieving the education Sustainable
Development Goal (Goal 4). In sum, the WBG
approach uses RBF as an instrument to strengthen
education systems, by aligning and incentivizing actors
around a set of system results. This stands in contrast
to other approaches whereby RBF is first and foremost
considered as a way to increase value-for-money, or
more generally as a tool for “smarter aid”. The RBF
agenda in education takes a wide lens, consisting of
knowledge activities, convening services, and
financing instruments such as the Program-for-Results
lending instrument, and other financial modalities that
reward the achievement of independently verified
results. The World Bank Group has committed to
doubling its current education portfolio of RBF
operations to US $5 billion by 2020.

SUMMARY
As demand for and interest in results-based financing (RBF) grows,
the World Bank Group (WBG) supports a Results First approach as the
optimal way to implement RBF. Results First means identifying the
desired results and then working backwards to achieve them. This is in
contrast to traditional aid approaches that primarily focus on inputs.
While, in theory, all well-designed projects should include a discussion
around results, Results First prioritizes that conversation and shifts both
country government and development partner attention and effort in a
way that traditional financing currently does not.

This paper presents four theories of change that showcase how RBF can
strengthen education systems for lasting change:

INTRODUCTION
RESULTS-BASED FINANCING captures the essence of how the WBG is implementing its
education strategy “Learning for All”. The strategy emphasizes learning (rather than
just schooling), since that is what leads to economic growth, development, and poverty
reduction. Second, the strategy calls for investing “for all” so as to ensure the equity
dimension behind the SDGs and the Bank’s Twin Goals of reducing poverty and boosting
shared prosperity. These goals can be achieved through strengthening education
systems: elements such as schools, teachers, curricula, materials, as well as policies,
accountability mechanisms, resources and financing, that, when working together,
result in high quality services for children. Crucially, this implies moving beyond
simply providing more inputs, to operating in a way that will bring alignment among
system components, thereby fostering greater results. How resources are mobilized and
managed to flow to — and through — education systems offers one such pathway for
coalescing efforts, providing incentives, bringing attention to results, and making actors
accountable when results aren’t achieved.

                          are clear, consistent with functions, measured, monitored, and supported.

                          It also means establishing a clear feedback cycle between financing (including
                          international aid) and results. Because failures of governance and accountability
                          typically have their severest effects on schools serving disadvantaged groups,

making systems coherent. Making a system work
as a whole requires relationships of accountabil-
ity among and between the parts of the system.
These relationships have four design components:
delegation, finance, information, and motivation
(Pritchett, 2015). This paper largely focuses on
how finance, and RBF specifically, can be used as
a lever to pull education systems into coherence.

This approach is further underscored by the
findings of the Education Finance Commission’s
report for The Learning Generation (2016). The
Education Finance Commission’s report calls for
a Finance Compact between developing coun-
tries and the international community (Education
Finance Commission, 2016). RBF encompasses all
of the four transformations called for: performance,
innovation, inclusion, and finance. Specifically, put-
ting results first (performance), and embracing
results-based approaches to finance (finance) is at
the heart of the WBG approach. The approach also
offers a new way of approaching problems (innova-
tion), and incentivizing results allows for differenti-
ating levels of rewards, in order to favor traditionally
disadvantaged groups, such as rural girls or children
living with disabilities (inclusion).

THE RISE OF RBF
RBF is on the rise, for differing reasons. This section starts with an operating definition
for RBF, and then outlines the competing motivations behind RBF, and places the WBG
approach in that landscape. It traces a brief history of the movement, from standards-
based reforms through to the use of financing as a lever for strengthening systems.

WHY WE BELIEVE IN RBF:
FOUR THEORIES OF CHANGE
Among the many reasons behind the WBG commitment to a Results
First approach, four stand out. First, it flips the policy dialogue,
with external partners and internally within ministries, to focus more
intentionally on what elements in the education system can be improved
upon to generate results. Second, it attracts and retains much needed
attention — from policymakers to parents — to the ultimate results that
are sought. Third, it serves to galvanize and align important (yet often
uninvolved) actors in the pursuit of results, notably ministries of finance.
Finally, it instills a culture of measurement, which can eventually be
institutionalized through strengthening the country’s systems.

             Instead of fixating on single-issue policies such as teacher training or teacher
REPUBLIC
             recruitment or student assessments, the ministry examined the “system” that was in
             place to ensure children received a quality education. The sector is governed by a set
             of institutions with complex relationships: the Ministry of Education and the Ministry
             of Higher Education, Science, and Technology, which are the two primary governing
             ministries of the sector, and the Salomé Ureña Teacher Training Institute, Autonomous
             University of Santo Domingo and National Institute of Education and Training of
             Teachers, the three largest providers of pre-service training. Prior to the project, there
             was no alignment and haphazard division of labor among actors. As part of the RBF
             approach, the Government, with support from the WBG and partners, examined
             how teachers were recruited and trained, and how student assessments were
             administered. While it is always important to recruit and train qualified teachers,
             the question then became, why didn’t this already happen? The greatest binding
             constraint on recruitment of high quality teachers was that there was no mechanism
             in place to screen potential candidates. The Government chose to resolve this by
             introducing a competitive entrance exam, to filter out unqualified candidates. To
             encourage sustained motivation, the exam was tied to a disbursement of funds under
             the World Bank loan that accompanies the implementation of the National Pact.

             When the National Pact planning committee turned to address the issues around
             measuring learning, it became clear that the 8th grade leaving exam served more
             as an ex-post “autopsy” of the poor learning levels of students, rather than an
             ex-ante diagnostic of which students were struggling, and with what parts of the
             curriculum. If they did not pass, they most likely dropped out, and there were no
             other assessments in earlier grades to detect learning gaps or diagnose other learning
             challenges. In other words, there was no data to inform teachers on how to focus
             their efforts. To change this, a DLI was tied to developing a student assessment in
             grade 3, and using that data to improve teacher training programs.

             The Government’s approach to identifying results and bottlenecks allowed for:
             (i) the alignment of actors and actions around results via DLIs and (ii) a shift in the
             policy dialogue that enabled various parts of the system to “talk” to one another, rather
             than piecing together ad-hoc interventions that only addressed parts of the system.

                                     change policy direction easily. If the model used had been more of a traditional one,
                                     the results would have been assessed later down the line, but RBF keeps results at

IN RBF IS NOT               about withholding payment if the agreed results are not achieved. This can be
UNDERSTOOD                  difficult, as there are several examples where donors did not follow through
                            (Clist & Verschoor, 2014). That is why it is crucial that the idea of nonpayment
                            be communicated upfront with recipients, indicating a change in the way things
                            are normally done. If a donor’s funding model is using RBF in some form (be it
                            applied to all of the available funds or just a percentage), then recipients must
                            understand and accept that they may not receive the expected monies if they
                            do not meet agreed targets. In the case of the Girls Education Challenge, though
                            RBF was clearly stated in application documentation, it did not specify how it
                            would look in practice. This led to confusion and frustration among recipient
                            organizations, delaying implementation (Coffey, 2016).

HOW:
A SYSTEMS APPROACH
The WBG “Learning for All” Strategy serves as the guiding vision for a Results First
approach. Launched in 2011, the strategy seeks to achieve “Learning for All” by
promoting country systems strengthening, along with the global evidence base powerful
enough to guide those reforms. This system approach requires clarity on the roles of the
system actors, including students, providers, and institutions, and the laws, rules, and
regulations that connect them. Timely data and information on the performance of each
of these helps identify the most pressing needs and institutional gaps, as well as options
for filling them — including through the use of financial incentives.

                                       can be used to align the education system. When ﬁnancing and results
using RBF Programs                     are tied together, accountability relationships are better deﬁned,
                                       education data is better captured, and inputs are used more efﬁciently.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS MODEL

As demand for RBF in education grows, the WBG business model has and will evolve.
This section establishes the growing trends, outlines the instruments used to meet this
demand, and explores the implications for optimizing the use of the instruments.

CONCLUSIONS
RBF will help accelerate the achievement toward SDG 4. As countries face a triple
challenge of universalizing coverage, pivoting toward quality, and doing these in a
context of likely fiscal contraction, governments will be under even greater pressure
to have education financing deliver greater results. This is best achieved through
strengthening education systems to provide sustained quality services, and RBF
Programs and Interventions offer tools for them to do so.


RBF will strengthen systems through four theo-                                   part of the problems that systems face, in some

THEORIES UNDERPINNING RBF, AND EARLY LESSONS



This annotated bibliography further delves into the theoretical underpinnings on which
RBF rests, according to various viewpoints. It also summarizes some of the early
operational lessons of RBF initiatives in the education sector. Building on the Principal-
Agent foundation presented earlier in this paper, this section discusses contract theory,
and research around accountability, incentives, and motivation.

Coffey (2016) undertook an independent pro-
cess evaluation at midline stage to inform future
funding and to share lessons learned. One of the
main findings is that RBF can drive coherence and
consistency across projects (in line with the WBG
emphasis on systems), as they all aim to achieve
the same goal (which, for the GEC, is very explicitly
stated). Another conclusion is that RBF must be
well understood by both sides upfront, otherwise
agents (grant recipients) do not have the requisite
information about the types of risks they are taking
on, and principals may keep “changing the rules”.

As outlined above, much of the literature around
RBF frames it within economic theory. While there
are good lessons to learn from the Principal-Agent
and Multitask models, they are not always suffi-
cient to understand how RBF changes, or doesn’t
change behaviours in real-life. The Principal-Agent
model assumes that principals (donors) and
agents (recipients) have differing goals and that
the primary way to shift agents’ actions is through
incentives, while the Multitask model does not
always indicate how “distracted” an agent will be
from the pursuit of the desired result. Ultimately, it
is important to take into account the diverse moti-
vations and behaviours of all stakeholders, and to
be cognizant of country contexts.
