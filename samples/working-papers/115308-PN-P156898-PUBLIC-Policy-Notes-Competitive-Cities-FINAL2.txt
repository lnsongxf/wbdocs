Improving City Competitiveness for
Economic Development and Job Creation*

City competiveness can be defined as the ability of city to
support job creation, economic growth and productivity

number of which are outside of control of the city government
and by nature are the prerogative of the national government.
The analysis on this policy note draws on the competitive
city framework which includes four pillars: “institutions and
regulations”, “infrastructure and land”, “skills and innovation”
and “enterprise support and finance.”1 It analyzes factors that                              of BPO wouldn’t have been possible without an enabling

Starting a business in the Philippines is among the most
cumbersome in the world. Doing Business 2016 ranks
the country at 165 out of 189 economies on starting a
business. The average firm spends 29 days securing licenses
required to start a business and spends around PHP 20,000
(equivalent to 16.1 percent of the country’s per capita
income). Up to 18 licenses, permits, and forms have to be
approved before a business can commence. In addition, the
Philippines still requires a relatively high paid-in minimum
capital and a minimum of five incorporators, a practice
that many countries have abolished. In many cases, firms

    Until 2012, the process of renewing the annual
    business permit in Batangas required 31 different
    procedural steps. First, an applicant firm had to first
    visit the City Hall and go through 13 steps (as in the
    chart below).




    Subsequently, the applicant firm had to visit the City
    Treasurer’s Office and complete additional 9 steps

    to complete the remaining 7 steps (chart below).

      Box 3. BPO and Jobs in the Philippines: Opportunities and Challenges from Technological Change
      The information technology (IT) and BPO industry in the Philippines has been a driver of economic growth and job creation in the last
      decade having grown at an average of 24 percent annually. Direct employment reached 1 million full-time employees in August 2014
      from virtually zero in 1999, accounting for around 2.3 percent of the country’s total employment. The industry has a robust voice sector
      (primarily call centers), accounting for 64 percent of the industry’s revenue. Health care information management employment grew by
      47 percent from 2012 to 2013. IT outsourcing revenues also grew by 52 percent from 2012 to 2013, while knowledge process outsourcing
      grew by 18 percent. Earnings and skill requirements vary across these sectors. Industry-specific jobs tend to be higher skilled than those
      that cut across industries (such as human resources business processing), as they require more technical knowledge.

      In 2012, average annual compensation per employee in the industry was around US$8,849, with the highest average compensation
      in software development (US$17,383). It was US$8,301 for contact centers and US$7,687 for other BPOs. High-skilled, high-paid
      occupations—as are most research and development–related jobs in knowledge process outsourcing (such as market research and
      medical transcription), IT outsourcing (such as software and application maintenance), engineering services (such as engineering design
      and digital mapping), and creative processes (such as art production and game testing and support)—are intensive in no routine cognitive
      and interpersonal tasks. Middle-skilled occupations are intensive in routine cognitive tasks, mostly in non-voice BPO (such as back-office
      finance and accounting or human resources), but can also include many of the jobs in voice business processing (such as customer service
      and technical support).

Access to water and electricity is expensive and unreliable.                                                          practically all surveyed firms experienced blackouts (Figure 3).

Major cities are crippled by traffic problems. Metro Manila’s                                            average car commute in Manila is 58 minutes long. This is

    Box 4. Good Practice in Using ICT to Improve Urban Transport: Cases of Manila and Cebu
    Urban transport is a complex system where newly cheap information unlocks possibilities for greater efficiency. A good starting point is with
    the most basic foundation of planning: of the 25 largest low- and lower-middle-income cities, 92 percent do not have complete maps of their
    transit networks. Compiling these maps used to be time-consuming and expensive.

    Recently, though, Manila developed and applied a mobile phone–based application to survey and map routes, using an open-source data
    standard. The map powers a consumer trip-planning app and is being used by city planners to reduce redundant routes and plan a new
    mass transit corridor.

    Cebu, in turn, was able to ingest real-time taxi data to generate speed and congestion maps for the entire city. This reduced the time to
    analyze travel time for a bus corridor from two weeks to two seconds.

      Box 5. What is Innovation? The Role of Governments
      Innovation can be defined as a process of transforming an idea or invention into a new good or a service that creates value to customers and
      helps resolve existing problems. Innovation involves product (good or service), process, marketing and organizational innovation. Each of
      the four types of innovation can be divided into innovation new to the firm or new to the market or a society called technology absorption;
      or innovation new to the world, which represents innovation in the most explicit sense. New-to-the-world innovation shifts a notional
      technological frontier outward, while absorption moves a firm closer to the frontier. Most innovation requires spending on research and
      development (R&D), but can also occur without it. Innovation is thus a broader concept than R&D only.


      Governments play a key role in supporting innovation. The government’s main role is to reduce market failure resulting from the divergence
      in private and social returns on innovation: private investors tend to underinvest in innovation because they receive only a small portion
      of the benefits of a new product or service, while the society at large appropriates the rest of value added through imitation. As a result,
      spending on R&D and innovation is lower than socially optimal.25 The government can also help firms mitigate other market failures such
      as on coordination failures, threshold effects or knowledge spillovers.26 The state can also drive innovation directly by funding critical
      technologies such as the Internet, GPS and other general purpose technologies and taking the lead in adopting new technologies.27

Access to high-risk finance is also limited. High-risk capital
helps to finance start-ups, nascent technologies and new
business models. Business angels, seed funds and venture
capital funds are one of the key driving factors of the success
of Silicon Valley and other leading innovation ecosystems in
the world. However, high-risk financing in the Philippines is
largely missing. While there are no official data, anecdotal
evidence suggests that there are only a few venture capital
funds in the country, with a total annual investment of less
than $20 million dollars, a negligible fraction of the country’s
total banking sector assets and the country’s nominal GDP
of more than $330 billion in 2015.

       Box 6. Assessment of the Philippines’s Research Capacity and Innovation Ecosystem
       In 2014, USAID-funded project assessed the quality of the university research and innovation ecosystem based on a survey of stakeholders.
       It found that there has been an ongoing progress in improving the research ecosystem, but also that there were substantial weaknesses
       that needed to be addressed for the innovation support system to function efficiently and produce results.

       Specifically, assessed across six pillars of the report’s definition of an innovation ecosystem, the Philippines does relatively well on
       general education and human development, but is weak across the remaining five pillars, including intellectual property rights, startup
       environment and social capital (see Figure below).

     Box 7. Examples of Local Business Support Programs: Quezon City
     In 2012, Quezon City a created Business Development and Promotion Office and adopted a Magna Carta for Micro and Small Business
     Enterprises to provide a wide framework of policy and services support for small businesses in the city. QC also created the Sikap Buhay
     Entrepreneurship and Cooperative Office (SBECO). The SBECO conducts business trainings and consultations for city’s small and medium
     enterprises, and assists the city in the development of an SME Roadmap to guide the SME’s plans for growth and expansion.

     SBECO manages an entrepreneurship and micro-finance program known as the Puhunan Pangkabuhayan ng Sikap Buhay (PPSB), which is
     a non-collateral interest loan facility for small entrepreneurs in partnership with several cooperatives. The program has a budget of around
     5 million USD a year and over the last 11 years it has supported more than 64,000 entrepreneurs. SBECO partners with Go Negosyo centers
     to provide additional trainings for micro entrepreneurs. While the headline loan repayment rate of 95% seems impressive, the effectiveness
     of the program and its impact is not clear.

        City hall structure is complex and economic development functions are fragmented. There are 48 departments in the QC city hall, which
        are broken down into 3 clusters (see figure below). Economic development and business support functions are spread across various
        branches without obvious means of coordination. Skills development and MSME support are under alleviating poverty departments;

3. Recommendations
While a number of issues discussed in this chapter are
already being addressed through multiple reforms, the
persistence of the problems indicates that more needs to be
done both at local and national level to improve the business
environment, access to land and markets and upgrading
of infrastructure, strengthening innovation systems and
addressing skills mismatch, improving access to finance
and business support services, and strengthening local
institutions for economic development. In this report the
recommendations focus on areas which are most likely to
offer quick results in terms of improving city competitiveness
and where cities themselves have a very important role

    as a unit of analysis in this report. Oxford Economics data used for descriptive statistics and international benchmarking only includes Cebu City, and excludes Mandaue
    and Lapu-Lapu. For structural analysis of Metro Cebu, PSBI data aggregated from firm level for all three LGUs is used. While the PSBI sample of firms is not representative at
    the LGU level, it is still the best approximation. However the tree LGUs considered combined account for 75% of jobs in the Central Visayas region, for which sampling is
    representative, which limits the possible margin of error.

    Box 11. Business Registration Reform Options: International Best Practice
    There is a wide range of business registration reform options that are available for countries seeking to improve their business registration
    systems. These include:

    1.	     Standardizing incorporation documents. Without standardized registration documents and clear guidance on how to complete them,
            the registration process can be discretionary, cumbersome, and costly and result in high rejection rates. In Estonia in 2006, processing
            time at the registry fell from 15 days to 1 with the introduction of standardized documents. Approximately 65 countries now have
            standardized incorporation forms.

    2.	     Reducing or eliminating minimum capital requirements. Minimum capital requirements generally do not achieve any of their
            underlying objectives. Far from being beneficial, some studies find that minimum capital requirements have counterproductive effects
            on entrepreneurship. Consequently, since 2005, 57 economies have reduced or eliminated this requirement.

    3.	     Making the registration process transparent and accountable. The easier it is to access information about a regulation, the easier it will
            be to comply with the regulation. In more than 90 percent of high-income economies, fee schedules can be obtained from agency
            websites, notice boards, and brochures.

    4.	     Integrating registration systems and introducing unique identification. In most countries, in addition to registering with the business
            registration authority as a business entity, an entrepreneur must also obtain tax and VAT registrations from the tax administration,
            social security or pension authority, or municipal authority. A number of countries have therefore moved toward integrated registration
            systems that allow entrepreneurs to complete one application form for all authorities and introduced a unique identification
            denomination (UID), which is then used for all transactions with the authorities.

    5.	     Creating a one-stop shop. The one-stop shop (OSS) provides a single interface for business start-ups, a mechanism that has gained
            popularity in many economies. Today about 83 economies around the world have some kind of OSS for business registration, including
            53 economies that established or improved their OSS in the past eight years.

    6.	     Introducing ICT. Today, 110 economies use information and communication technology (ICT) for business registration services ranging
            from online name search to online business registration, annual returns filing, and electronic transmission. Use of ICT makes the
            registration system faster and more cost-effective, it also enhances data integrity, information security, transparency of the registration
            services.

        Box 13. Organizing for Economic Development
        Cities around the world have used various institutional structures to develop economic development strategies, pursue a competitiveness
        agenda, engage private sector in policy delivery and facilitate successful implementation.

        Economic Development Agencies
        Economic development agencies (DAs) can be defined as, “legal, non-profit structures, generally owned by the public and private entities
        of the territory”.66 DAs are usually given a range of clearly defined functions that may include branding and international promotion;
        investment attraction and retention; business start-ups and growth; human capital development; real estate, urban and infrastructural
        development; social or green development initiatives and others. DAs are accountable to a group of actors that is broader than the city
        government. DAs help establish economic development at the key objective for the city and attract private sector talent and knowhow to
        carrying out economic development functions. Economic development agencies have proven themselves efficient at delivering trans-
        formative change. Barcelona Activa (the economic development agency of Barcelona Municipality) helps set up over 700 companies
        employing over 1500 a year. New York Economic Development Corporation activities have facilitated $22.9 million of private investment
        in 2008 alone.67

        Delivery Units
        Delivery Units (DUs) are implementation structures established at the center of government in order to drive improvements in perfor-
        mance. DUs have a mandate to use the authority of the chief executive—the center of government—to lead “the political and technical
        coordination of government actions, strategic planning, monitoring of performance and implementation, and communication of the
        government’s decisions and achievements.”68 Such units usually do not have a narrowly defined focus, rather they are given authority to
        deliver on a set of priority targets or indicators. DUs help design clear responsibility and accountability structures, and link different public
        sector interventions to the key development priorities through transparent monitoring and evaluation and improved coordination. DUs
        have a potential to drive innovation and efficiency improvements in policy implementation. Baltimore’s CitiStat has changed the perfor-
        mance paradigm in the city governance by introducing clearer performance objective, a robust monitoring system and a performance
        based budgeting system.

        Public-Private Boards for Economic Development
        Public-private boards serve as a platform for information sharing and consultation, but depending on the context they can have a strong
        influence in defining development priorities and implementation.69 Additionally public-private boards can help surpass the geographic
        or functional limitations of typical local government agencies. Experience of Local Enterprise Partnerships in the UK reveals that while
        this units can be very efficient at leading and coordinating local economic development efforts, in other cases they can fail lack of clearly
        defined purpose, shortage of resources and leadership.70
