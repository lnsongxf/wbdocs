1         Introduction
    Improving ﬁscal management remains critical to address development challenges in
low-income countries. Increasing domestic revenue may not only help countries build
their ﬁscal space to ﬁnance infrastructure projects and improve their stock of physical
capital, but also support government policies to improve human capital development and
social safety nets, including for vulnerable households.
    However, tax collection remains a daunting challenge for developing countries. For
instance, over the past two decades, tax performance (measured by the tax-to-GDP ra-
tio) was about only 12 percent in low-income countries, compared with 32 percent for
advanced economies (see International Monetary Fund (2011), Figure 2: Panel 3). Based
on International Monetary Fund (2011), the main challenges associated with the weak do-
mestic revenue performance in developing countries are the following. First, the presence
of many sectors that are hard to tax (e.g., an extensive informal sector representing on
average 40 to 60 percent of GDP or international services). Second, the lack of suﬃcient
tax planning skills to match the adroitness of multinationals to reduce their tax liabilities
continues to pose challenges to these countries to improve their domestic revenue collec-
tion performance . Third, diﬃculties in dealing with state-owned enterprises that abuse
or ignore the tax system. Finally, the weak revenue administration and the quality of
governance remain critical concerns in low-income countries.
    Recent studies suggest that revenues from natural resources, particularly in Sub-
Saharan Africa, play a signiﬁcant role in improving countries’ tax performance. Keen and
Mansour (2010) ﬁnd that during 1980-2005, resource-rich countries within Sub-Saharan
Africa exhibited better revenue collection performance than their peers without signiﬁ-
cant reserves of natural resources. The stronger tax performance in resource-rich countries
may therefore support the strand of the development literature suggesting a comparative
advantage of resource-rich countries. However, given the ﬁnite nature of natural resources
and the risk of the Dutch disease, this advantage may not be sustainable in the long run.
    Another recent strand of the literature argues that abundance in natural resources is a
curse rather than a blessing. This strand of literature predicts the potential crowding-out
of non-resource revenues as one consequence of resource abundance. There are various
transmission channels of the above-mentioned crowding out eﬀect1 . First, the Dutch dis-
ease could cause the non-resource sector to contract, leading to a decline in the overall non-
resource revenues. Second, a government with signiﬁcant revenue from extractives may
decide to relieve the tax burden on its citizens, which, in turn, could result in the reduction
of the demand for accountability and public service delivery. Third, resource abundance
could be a disincentive for governments to implement tax reforms aimed at broadening
the tax base and collecting more non-resource tax revenue. Several empirical studies have
    1
        An assessment of the role of these transmission channels is left for future work.

examined the eﬀect of resource revenues on countries’ non-resource revenues and have
generally found a crowding-out eﬀect. In a sample of 30 hydrocarbon-producing countries
for the period 1992-2005, Bornhorst, Gupta, and Thornton (2009) ﬁnd that a unit increase
of hydrocarbon revenues is associated with a decline in total non-hydrocarbon revenues
of about 0.2 percentage points of GDP. Crivelli and Gupta (2014) extend the Bornhorst,
Gupta, and Thornton (2009) study to 35 countries for 1992-2009, and analyze the impact
of expanding resource revenues on diﬀerent types of domestic (non-resource) tax revenues.
They ﬁnd that an increase in resource revenues of 1 percentage point of GDP lowers ag-
gregate domestic revenue by 0.3 percentage point of GDP, which is mainly explained by a
decline in revenue from taxes on goods and services. Ossowski and Gonzáles (2012), with
a sample of 15 Latin American and Caribbean countries, also ﬁnd that revenues from non-
renewable resources tend to reduce non-resource revenue performance. Botlhole (2011)
and Thomas and Trevino (2013) ﬁnd similar results for Sub-Saharan African countries.
    Unlike in developed countries where there is enough revenue to deliver adequate pub-
lic services, a critical issue for developing countries, in need of more revenue, is therefore
about how to avoid or reduce the crowding out of non-resource revenue by resource rev-
enue. The critical role that institutional quality plays in tax revenue performance is
explored in recent studies. For instance, El Anshasy and Katsaiti (2013) ﬁnd that natural
resources tend to hinder economic growth when a country has low-quality institutions.
Bhattacharyya and Hodler (2014) ﬁnd that resource revenues tend to hinder ﬁnancial de-
velopment in countries with weak political institutions; this negative eﬀect decreases and
vanishes as the quality of political institutions improves. Bird, Martinez-Vazquez, and
Torgler (2008) and Bird, Martinez-Vazquez, and Torgler (2014) show that beyond tradi-
tional supply factors, the quality of institutions is a signiﬁcant determinant of revenue
mobilization in developing countries as well as in the developed world.
    However, only a few existing studies have focused on the role that a better quality of
institutions could play in avoiding (or at least lessening) the likelihood that tax revenue
from resources (in resource-rich countries) will crowd out existing tax revenues. For in-
stance, Botlhole (2011) shows that institutions are essential for ensuring natural resource
taxes increase overall tax revenue. Their results suggest that more resource revenues im-
pede tax revenue collection only in the absence of good governing institutions. Bornhorst,
Gupta, and Thornton (2009) and Thomas and Trevino (2013) also ﬁnd similar results.
Ross (2013) argues that income from non-resource sources (agriculture, manufacturing
and services) is more beneﬁcial than income derived from the sale of assets such as oil
reserves, which has signiﬁcant political consequences. Rabah and Gylfason (2013) have
argued that the quality of democratic institutions in resource-rich countries could explain
the observed crowding out eﬀect of resource tax revenues. They maintain that authoritar-
ian regimes often deliberately reduce non-resource tax rates to quell the masses when they
protest about not receiving their fair share of the resource rents. Clearly, from the point


                                              2
of view of an authoritarian regime, there is strong economic logic behind the crowding-out
eﬀect mentioned above. This further reinforces the importance of institutional quality in
improving tax revenue performance.
    The above results are problematic for Uganda for three main reasons: (i) the discovery
in 2006 of a signiﬁcant quantity of oil in the Albertine basin, (ii) the country’s challenges
in improving its institutional quality, and (iii) the country?s low tax revenue performance
for over the past decade. While only 40 percent of the country’s potential are explored
so far, Uganda’s total oil reserves are currently estimated at 6.5 billion barrels (of which
about 1.2-1.7 billion barrels are recoverable). It is estimated that recoverable reserves
in Uganda could support production of 100,000 to 200,000 barrels per day for 20 to 40
years, depending on the speed of extraction. Based on the production sharing agreements
already concluded, and assuming a long-term international price of US$90 per barrel,
about 70 percent of the net present value of oil production would go to the government.
The amount of additional public revenue would average US$2.5 billion/year (more than 35
percent of government revenue in 2016)2 . This additional resource revenue could therefore
lead to a crowding-out of non-resource tax revenue in Uganda. Botlhole (2011) suggests
that the likelihood for this oﬀset to occur in a country like Uganda is non-negligible,
given the country?s challenges to close its institutional gap. The laws adopted and the
oversight institutions created to promote good governance and minimize corruption are
very strong on paper, but actual implementation remains limited (World Bank Group
(2015)). According to Global Integrity (2011), Uganda’s implementation of laws scores
only 51 out of 100 on the Global Integrity Scale.
    Uganda’s tax to GDP ratio, which averaged 12.5 percent over 2000-2010, is well below
the East African Community average of 16 percent. This is mainly due to the scope of the
current tax exemptions and the nature of business in Uganda, which is largely dominated
by the informal sector, making it easy for traders to evade taxes. Indeed, although all
sectors except education and health are subject to tax, statistics for 2012/13 suggest
that, agriculture contributed 24 percent to GDP but only comprised 0.3 percent of tax
revenue, construction accounted for 13 percent of GDP but only 2 percent of tax revenue,
and real estate represented 6 percent of GDP but 2 percent of tax revenue. Education
and tourism activities, while accounting for a combined 10 percent of GDP, only provided
about 2 percent of total tax revenue. A crowding out eﬀect of other tax revenues by
resource revenues in Uganda could worsen the country’s already low tax performance
level. As pointed out in Bornhorst, Gupta, and Thornton (2009), while the impact of
the hydrocarbon revenue oﬀset on long-term development prospects is not clear, there is
a risk of a signiﬁcant adjustment costs in moving to a higher level of domestic taxation
once natural resources are depleted.
    Our paper departs from the existing literature in several ways. First, to assess the
  2
      With the current low oil price of below $50, one should expect lower resource revenue.



                                                     3
role of institutional quality, previous studies focused either on one indicator (corruption
for Bornhorst, Gupta, and Thornton (2009) and Thomas and Trevino (2013)), or on an
aggregate index of the quality of institutions (for Botlhole (2011), the Economic Freedom
of the World index, which is a composite of 10 broad factors of economic freedom). In this
paper, we assess individually the role of the six Worldwide Governance Indicators since
using a composite governance indicator (e.g., Economic Freedom) may be misleading for
our purpose, in the sense that the exact institutional weaknesses may not be identiﬁed
adequately. Our goal is therefore two-fold: (i) to identify institutional variables that
could play an important role in reducing the likelihood of occurrence of a non resource tax
revenue crowding out, and (ii) to determine the threshold for these institutional variables,
above which the likelihood of non resource tax revenue crowding out vanishes. This could
help Ugandan authorities understand the level of eﬀort needed to improve the country?s
institutional quality in order to avoid a critical symptom of the natural resource curse.
Second, our econometric methodology also diﬀers from existing studies, which rely mostly
on a linear model. In this paper, we consider a nonlinear probabilistic model to estimate
the likelihood of an improvement of non-resource tax performance. This approach is
convenient for out-of-sample predictions. With a linear model, the marginal eﬀect on the
dependent variable is not country-speciﬁc. Instead, a nonlinear model allows the analysis
of marginal eﬀects using country-speciﬁc characteristics, which is consistent with our goal
of determining the threshold level for governance variables that Uganda needs to meet to
avoid tax revenue crowding out.
    As in previous studies, we ﬁnd that an increase in hydrocarbon revenue induces a
decline in non-resource revenue. Moreover, strengthening the quality of institutions is
critical to reducing the risk of this crowding out eﬀect. These results are robust to
alternative speciﬁcations of both the linear and nonlinear models. In general, regulatory
quality, rule of law, government eﬀectiveness and political stability are the most important
of the six Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)3 . Our results also suggest that for
Uganda, oil exploitation would be less likely to reduce domestic tax performance only if
the levels of its governance indicators are at least around 0.5 for political stability, 1 for
regulatory quality and 1.25 for government eﬀectiveness. In 2012, those indicators were
at -0.89, -0.24 and -0.56 respectively, implying that Uganda’s government would need to
take strong actions to improve its quality of institutions to a level that would avoid the
resource curse.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes some stylized
facts about hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon revenues. Section III presents our empiri-

large number of enterprise, citizen and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing countries.
These data are gathered from a number of survey institutes, think tanks, non-governmental organizations,
international organizations, and private sector ﬁrms. The six aggregate indicators are reported in two
ways: (1) in their standard normal units, ranging from approximately -2.5 to 2.5 with higher values
corresponding to better outcomes, and (2) in percentile rank terms from 0 to 100.

for the linear model and robustness checks. Section V discusses the results under a prob-
abilistic model speciﬁcation. Section VI explores some policy implications for Uganda
while Section VII concludes.


2         Descriptive analysis
    For each country in our sample, Table 1 displays the average GDP share of non-
hydrocarbon revenue and total revenue (including grants). The table also presents the
average share of non-hydrocarbon revenue as a percentage of total revenue.
    Some facts can be drawn from this table: over the period of the study, the median
level of tax revenue is about 30 percent of GDP. Kuwait exhibits the highest level of taxes
(61 percent of GDP), while Chad has the lowest taxes (15 percent of GDP). The table
also shows that non-hydrocarbon sources are a relatively small component of tax revenue
among the sampled nations. The maximum non-hydrocarbon tax revenue is 42 percent of
GDP for Norway, while the median is only around 12 percent. Since the minimum level
of non-hydrocarbon tax revenue is 5.5 percent, non-hydrocarbon tax revenue tends to be
more concentrated on the left tail of the distribution. When we consider non-hydrocarbon
revenue as a share of total revenue, it appears that most countries rely on hydrocarbon
revenue. Indeed, among all countries, only 43 percent have a share of non-hydrocarbon
revenue greater than 50 percent of total revenues.
    Figure 1 displays the pattern of non-hydrocarbon, hydrocarbon and total revenues
expressed as a share of GDP over time. As expected, it appears that total tax revenue
ﬂuctuations are essentially driven by hydrocarbon revenue. The hydrocarbon and total
revenue variables seem to co-move over time with an underlying upward trend. Total tax
revenue increased from about 31 percent in 1992 to about 32 percent in 2012. At the same
time, hydrocarbon revenues have increased from about 14 percent to about 18 percent
of GDP over the same period. Non-hydrocarbon revenues remained relatively stable, at
around 13 percent.
    Preliminary analysis indicates that hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon revenues are
strongly negatively correlated, as shown in Figure 2.4

    Since the main objective of the paper is to inform policy makers on the likelihood of a
crowding out of domestic tax revenue by oil revenue in Uganda, we will later modify this
speciﬁcation and consider a nonlinear probability model that allows the use of informa-
tion from the Ugandan economy for the marginal analysis. Clearly, the idea consists of
estimating a probability model on countries exploiting natural resources and then using
the estimated model to make inference about Uganda through a marginal eﬀects analysis
based on Uganda-speciﬁc data. This model is speciﬁed as follows:
                                

                                                                Y              it−1

                               

    If yit = 1, the country increases its non-hydrocarbon tax revenue relative to the previ-
ous year, whereas if yit = 0, the country’s non-hydrocarbon tax revenues decrease relative
to the previous year. Therefore, we consider the following binary-choice model:

                 yit = 1                RH
                                                                  i = 1, . . . , n, t = 1, . . . , T,       (2)

where F is the cumulative density function of the logistic distribution or the standard
normal distribution. In this last speciﬁcation, only the coeﬃcients’ signs and signiﬁcance
are of interest. For example, if β1 is negative, it simply means that an additional percent-
age point of government revenue from hydrocarbons increases the likelihood of observing
a decline in non-hydrocarbon domestic revenue eﬀort, or equivalently, decreases the like-
lihood of observing an improvement in non-hydrocarbon domestic revenue eﬀort. In this
case, resource revenues have a crowding-out eﬀect on non-resource tax revenue. To ex-
amine how the likelihood of observing crowding out varies with changes in hydrocarbon
revenues, we compute the following marginal eﬀect:

                                                          RH
                                     ∂P yit = 1            Y

                                                    RH
                                                                        = β1 F       αi + γt + β1                         + Xit β2
                                                ∂                                                            Y       it
                                                     Y    it

                                                                                                                                                  RH
   The above formula can then be used to compute marginal eﬀects of changes in                                                                       at

3.2     Choice of control variables
    The choice of control variables is also made according to the literature on tax revenue
eﬀort/performance. However, we include additional controls that may help to better
predict tax revenue performance. We include the following traditional variables in the
analysis: grants as a share of GDP, the log of real GDP per capita expressed in real U.S.
dollars, agriculture as share of GDP and a measure of a country’s degree of openness.
    Grants are expected to cause a decline in non-resource tax revenues. Indeed, an
increase in grants creates a disincentive for governments to collect taxes. Real GDP per
capita is included as measure of a representative household’s income or a country’s level of
development. This variable is expected to cause an increase in non-resource revenues. The
agricultural sector in many developing countries that are resource producers is diﬃcult to
tax. An expansion of the agricultural sector is frequently associated with a decline in a
country’s tax eﬀort. The trade sector still remains an important source of revenues (from
tariﬀs), as trade is not yet fully liberalized in most of these countries. An expansion
of this sector is thus expected to cause an increase in non-resource tax revenues. Due
to a lack of accurate data regarding exports,5 we use imports as a share of GDP as
a measure of openness. We also include manufacturing and value-added services as a
share of GDP in some speciﬁcations. We expect that an expansion in the manufacturing
and service sectors will increase non-hydrocarbon revenues, as these sectors are relatively
less diﬃcult to tax. In addition to these variables, we use the six worldwide governance
indicators (control of corruption, voice and accountability, rule of law, political stability,
government eﬀectiveness and regulatory quality) to examine the importance of the quality
of a country’s institutions on the relationship between non-oil and oil revenues. We also
include government spending as a share of GDP, to account for the size of government.
An increase in government expenditures might be associated with an improvement of a
country’s non-hydrocarbon tax eﬀort. Indeed, when countries embark on an intensive
public spending program, they should increase revenues by collecting more taxes in order
to fund the program.

domestic revenue eﬀort is statistically signiﬁcant and negative in all model speciﬁcations.
                                                                      RH
Moreover, in baseline speciﬁcations (1) and (2), the coeﬃcient for       indicates that an
                                                                       Y
additional percentage point of revenue from hydrocarbons reduces revenues from other
domestic sources by 0.18 percentage point of GDP. Recall that Bornhorst, Gupta, and
Thornton (2009) also found this coeﬃcient to be 0.19 percentage point of GDP. As the
tax-to-GDP ratio tends to be persistent over time, in speciﬁcation (7) we include the
lag of the dependent variable to take into account this dynamic. We used a generalized
method of moments system proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and
Bond (1998) to estimate speciﬁcation (7). Lagged values of hydrocarbon revenues and
the dependent variable (non-resource tax to GDP ratio) are included as instruments.
    Results remain consistent with other speciﬁcations: an increase in resource revenues
causes a decline in non-resource revenues. With regard to control variables, in almost
all the model speciﬁcations, the signs of the coeﬃcients are consistent with our expec-
tations, except for the logarithm of real GDP per capita. Grants as a share of GDP
tend to signiﬁcantly reduce domestic non-resource tax eﬀorts. Although not signiﬁcant,
our ﬁndings also suggest that an expansion of the agriculture sector causes a decline in
non-resources revenues. The manufacturing and service sectors tend to co-move with
non-hydrocarbon revenues, capturing the fact that these sectors are easier to tax than
agriculture. Also, as expected, non-hydrocarbon tax revenues increase with imports and
government expenditures.

4.2    Role of institutional quality
    Do good institutions help to dampen the crowding out of non-resource revenues by
hydrocarbon tax revenues? We depart from speciﬁcation (9) of Table 3 and include an
interaction term between hydrocarbon revenues and the World Bank’s six indicators of
the quality of institutions.6
    Results presented in Table 3 show that once diﬀerent types of governance indicators are
included, the coeﬃcient on real GDP per capita becomes positive, as expected, whereas the
coeﬃcient on agriculture value-added as a share of GDP remains negative and signiﬁcant.
In speciﬁcations (2), (4), (6), (8), (10) and (12), where we control for the level of each
indicator without including an interaction term, four of the six governance indicators tend
to improve the collection of non-resource taxes. In speciﬁcations (3), (5), (7), (9), (11) and
(13), we include the interaction term between each indicator and hydrocarbon revenues.

    To recap, the six governance indicators developed by the World Bank are voice and ac-
countability, political stability and absence of violence, government eﬀectiveness, regulatory
quality, rule of law and control of corruption.       For a deﬁnition of each indicator, visit

rule of law, political stability and regulatory quality indicate that the negative response
of domestic revenue eﬀort to hydrocarbon revenues varies with the quality of institutions.
Clearly, the better the quality of institutions, the less crowding out. Note that although
                                                                                   RH
not statistically signiﬁcant, the coeﬃcients for the interaction terms between          and

control of corruption, government eﬀectiveness, voice and accountability and political
stability are also positive, suggesting that good institutions are important in leveraging
the beneﬁts of resource revenues. This relationship has been discussed extensively in the
resource economics literature.


4.3    Results with the exclusion of outliers
    In Table 4, we report the results of the same experiments but exclude outliers observed
in Figure A1: the Russian Federation, Norway and Kuwait. We reach to the same conclu-
sions about the role of institutional quality. In addition, the coeﬃcient on the interaction
term between resource revenues and control of corruption is now signiﬁcant.

5     Results for the probabilistic model
    Table 5 displays the results for the logit panel model with country ﬁxed eﬀects. We
include traditional control variables (grants, real GDP per capita, share of agriculture,
openness) and the size of government. To assess the role of institutions, we include each
of the governance indicators and its interaction with hydrocarbon revenues. What is
important for the probabilistic model is not the coeﬃcients per se, but the signs and the
signiﬁcance of the parameters.
    Overall, our results are very similar to the linear model. In all speciﬁcations, the prob-
ability of an improvement of domestic tax eﬀort declines with an increase in hydrocarbon
revenues. Along the same line, although not statistically signiﬁcant, the agriculture sector
and grants tend to cause a decline of the targeted probability. In contrast, the probability
of an improvement in domestic tax eﬀort tends to increase with real GDP per capita, open-
ness and the size of government. With respect to governance indicators, the coeﬃcient
associated with the interaction term between each institutional indicator and hydrocarbon
revenues is positive. As in the linear case, these positive coeﬃcients reﬂect the fact that a
high quality of institutions tends to dampen the negative impact of resource revenues on
the probability of non-resource tax eﬀort improvement. Among all indicators, those with
signiﬁcant eﬀects are political stability, government eﬀectiveness and regulatory quality.
Meanwhile, in the linear case (Table 3), governance indicators with signiﬁcant eﬀects are
political stability, regulatory quality and rule of law.
    For robustness checks, we also estimate a logit model with country random eﬀects,
a probit model with country ﬁxed eﬀects (although these are known to deliver biased
estimates) and a probit model with country random eﬀects. The results displayed in the
appendix are not very diﬀerent from those obtained with a logit model with country ﬁxed
eﬀects. However, although all coeﬃcients associated with the interaction terms between
governance indicators and resource revenues are positive, only one (the variable associated
with political stability) remains signiﬁcant.

6     Marginal eﬀects and policy lessons for Uganda
6.1    The linear model
    Results for the linear speciﬁcation show that governance indicators play a central role
in dampening the decline in domestic revenues caused by hydrocarbon revenues. Using
a speciﬁcation that introduces the interaction term between hydrocarbon revenues and a
governance indicator, we ﬁnd that the marginal eﬀect of an increase in resource revenue
on non resource tax revenue changes with the level of the governance indicator, IN ST ,
as indicated in the following equation:

                                 RN H
                             ∂    Y                   Inst
                                         it
                                 RH
                                              = β1 + β2    × IN ST                     (4)
                             ∂    Y     it

   To have a positive marginal eﬀect, there must be a minimum level of institutional
quality:
                                              β1
                                 IN ST ≥ − Inst .
                                             β
Using results presented in Tables 3 and 4, Table 6 displays the minimum level of gover-
nance indicators necessary to have a positive marginal eﬀect. We only show indicators
for which the associated coeﬃcients are statistically signiﬁcant.

             Control of corruption                      -            1.18


   Results from the linear model suggest that to avoid a decline in domestic tax per-
formance caused by increasing resource revenues, any resource-rich country (including
Uganda, which has yet to exploit its discovered resources) should improve its governance
such that the above four indicators exceed a value of one. Countries should also prioritize
the improvement of political stability.
   Since marginal eﬀects in the linear model are not country-speciﬁc, the probabilistic
model is preferable in the sense that it allows the computation of marginal eﬀects using
Uganda’s characteristics.


6.2    The probabilistic model
   The marginal eﬀect of an increase to resource revenues equivalent to one percentage
point of GDP on the probability of seeing tax performance increase, when interaction

terms are included, is given by the following equation:


∂P (yit = 1)             Inst                               RH            Inst                RH
       RH
                 = β1 + β2    × IN ST F          αi + β1               + β2    × IN ST ×                 + Xit β2
  ∂                                                         Y     it
                                                                                              Y     it
        Y   it

    The above formula can be interpreted as follows. Given a level of hydrocarbon re-
sources, the left side of the equation expresses the change in the probability of an im-
provement in non-resource tax eﬀorts associated with a marginal change in resource rev-
enues. For Uganda, we calculate this probability change at diﬀerent values using the
three statistically signiﬁcant governance indicators (political stability, regulatory quality
and rule of law) to determine, for each of the indicators, the thresholds above which the
change in the probability is positive. We set other controls at their average value over
time. Because Uganda is not yet exploiting its oil resources, we set the initial values of
resource revenues at very low levels.7
    Figure 3 below displays, for Uganda, the marginal change in the probability associated
with a slight increase in resource revenues for diﬀerent values of the selected governance
indicators. We have ﬁxed the level of hydrocarbon revenue, from which the derivative is
made, at 1 percent of GDP.
    We observe that the marginal probability is an increasing function of the level of
each governance indicator. This result suggests that an improvement to the quality of
institutions could decrease the likelihood that resource exploitation causes a decline in
non-resource tax performance.
    With regard to the thresholds above which the marginal probability is positive, con-
trary to the linear model, political stability with a threshold around 0.5 seems to be the
least demanding threshold among governance indicators related to the quality of insti-
tutions. The required threshold for regulatory quality is just below one, whereas the
threshold for government eﬀectiveness is 1.25, indicating that the Ugandan authorities
should undertake stronger eﬀorts to improve the latter governance indicators. On this
front, Uganda could learn from the experience of other countries, such as Botswana. In
fact, although the selected governance indicators for Botswana do not currently stand at
the required levels indicated earlier and above which the marginal probability is positive,
Botswana remains a good benchmark for a country such as Uganda, which has a weak
institutional quality. We note that Botswana’s scores on the governance indicators of
political stability, regulatory quality and government eﬀectiveness are 1.11, 0.69 and 0.44
respectively in 2012, compared with -0.89, -0.24 and -0.57 for Uganda. Meanwhile, de-
spite receiving signiﬁcant revenues from minerals (equal to about 10.6 percent of GDP),
Botswana’s non-mineral government revenues amounted to 20.2 percent of GDP in 2012.

     We present the case where initial hydrocarbon revenues are set at 1 percent of GDP. However, results
for the level of initial hydrocarbon revenue equal to 5 percent and 10 percent are available upon request.
Also for each indicator, the threshold is not dependent on the point from which the derivative is made.

7    Conclusion
    This paper examines the relationship between hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon rev-
enues for a sample of 30 countries from 1992-2012. We use two approaches and analyze the
role of institutional quality to provide policy implications for Uganda, a country planning
to exploit its natural resources.
    In the ﬁrst approach, we estimate a linear model of the relationship between non-
hydrocarbon revenue and hydrocarbon revenue, including a set of control variables as is
done in many studies in the literature. Consistent with the empirical literature, we ﬁnd
that an increase in hydrocarbon revenues induces a decline in non-resource revenues. This
result remains robust in all alternative model speciﬁcations. However, this decline in non-
resource revenues is dampened when interaction terms of selected governance indicators
and hydrocarbon revenues are included. In particular, regulatory quality, rule of law and
political stability play a signiﬁcant role. A marginal analysis leads to the conclusion that,
for any country exploiting resources, revenues from these resources will be associated
with an increased domestic tax eﬀort only if the level of the aforementioned governance


                                                                    20
indicators are at least equal to one.
    In the second approach, we examine the relationship between resource and non-
resource revenues by modeling the probability of an improvement in domestic tax revenue
with respect to a change in resource revenues. This approach allows us to draw country-
speciﬁc policy lessons using unique characteristics of countries in the sample. As in the
linear model, we ﬁnd a robust result indicating that an increase in hydrocarbon revenues
leads to a decline in the above probability. Similarly, better institutions tend to dampen
this decline. Oil exploitation in Uganda would be less likely to induce a decline in do-
mestic tax eﬀort only if the levels of governance indicators reach a minimum of 0.5 for
political stability, around 1 for regulatory quality and 1.25 for government eﬀectiveness.
Therefore, stronger actions are needed by Ugandan authorities to improve the country’s
institutional quality to levels that will allow the country to fully reap the beneﬁts of its
oil resources like in Botswana. However, while this paper emphasizes the importance of
selected governance indicators, eﬀorts to improve other Worldwide Governance indicators
are also warranted.
