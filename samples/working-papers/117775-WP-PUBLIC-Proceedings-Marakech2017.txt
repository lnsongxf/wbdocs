Third Development Plan (DP3), an Appropriate response to the Top Priorities in
Meeting Africa’s Transport Challenges

Because of the strong synergies among transport, economic growth, and poverty
reduction, an efficient and well-functioning transport sector is key to Africa's de-
velopment efforts. Despite its past progress, Africa's transport sector continues to
face many challenges that are addressed by the SSATP’s Third Development Plan
(DP3), 2015–18.

This development plan and its three thematic pillars were the centerpiece of
SSATP’s 2017 annual meeting, which was held in Marrakech, February 20–24. This
report describes that meeting and the conclusions reached and recommendations
made by participants. The challenges facing Africa’s transport sector were identi-
fied by the working group asked to prepare a proposal for the United
Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for presentation to its stock-
taking session on “sustainable cities and human settlements, sustainable transport.”
Further work on the contribution of transport to the SDGs identified the
following priority are-as: urban access, rural access, national access and regional
connectivity, road safe-ty, air pollution and human health, and greenhouse gas
emissions. All these areas are covered by the DP3 either directly or indirectly.
The three thematic pillars of the DP3 regional connectivity, urban access, and
road safety were confirmed at the annual meeting through thematic and sectoral
consultations with SSATP stake-holders. The DP3 focuses on strategic priorities
in which SSATP has a comparative advantage. Air pollution, human health, and
greenhouse gas emissions are embed-ded as crosscutting issues within the three
pillars as well. The following sections summarize the three thematic pillars.

Pillar A: Integration, Connectivity, and Cohesion - A Paradigm Shift

Woefully inefficient transport logistic chains have long hampered the pace of inte-
gration of African countries. The poor performance and associated inefficiencies
stem not only from inadequate infrastructure, but notably also from poor govern-
ance, a nonconducive institutional and regulatory environment, and weak institu-
tional capacity at both the policy formulation and implementation levels. The
main issues are cumbersome: lengthy customs and administrative procedures,




                                                                                  ix
numerous barriers along the corridors, and the relatively high transport and logis-
tics costs associated with poor quality of service provision. Accelerating the pace of
integration between economies at the regional and continental levels is important
for African countries if the continent is to overcome the challenges posed by its
small-scale fragmented economies.
The approach taken in the integration, connectivity, and cohesion pillar (or what
is called the regional integration pillar in this report) is broader than the regional
corridors approach because it considers the whole transport logistics chain linking
the rural, national, and regional networks and the geographical economic impacts.
The focus has shifted from only facilitating the transit of international imports and
exports along the regional corridors to integrating in a holistic manner the eco-
nomic development of the areas affected by the corridors. Integrated corridor de-
velopment takes into account the movement of goods that are produced locally in
order to facilitate their trade at the country and regional levels, increase food secu-
rity, and provide local producers with new jobs and business opportunities. This
approach to trade and transport corridors aims to provide comprehensive connec-
tivity among international, national, and rural networks.

In their November 2011 Luanda Declaration, the African ministers of transport
gave top priority to the Africa Infrastructure Development Program (PIDA),
which is the single most important program for interregional and continental in-
tegration. The primary focus of PIDA is to help interconnect transport networks,
especially those serving landlocked and island countries, in order to support the
territorial, economic, and social cohesion of Africa and its global competitiveness.
The Luanda Declaration emphasizes the need to deepen the facilitation of inter-
state transport. Therefore, it calls for harmonizing legislation, simplifying transit
procedures, removing nonphysical barriers, and improving the efficiency and safe-
ty of transport operations. These measures are complemented with a commitment
to strengthening and, where necessary, putting in place institutions responsible for
the management of safety, security, and facilitation in the transport sector. Finally,
the declaration fosters the use of information and communications technology
(ICT) and other technologies in the development of transport infrastructure and
operations.
Developing trade corridors is a key priority of the regional integration agenda of
the African Union, which seeks to establish a continental free trade area (CFTA) in
order to stimulate economic development through trade growth, particularly in-
tra-Africa trade. Using a combination of measures, the Action Plan for Boosting
Intra-Africa Trade (BIAT) addresses the numerous constraints that restrict the




x
growth of such trade. These measures relate to three broad themes: trade policies,
trade facilitation, and trade competitiveness.

Pillar B: Urban Transport and Mobility - Promoting a New Integrated Approach

Because more than half of Africa’s population will soon be living in urban areas,
providing a sustainable response to the demand for mobility for urban dwellers is
an increasingly urgent concern. The urban population of Africa is growing rapidly,
at about 4.5 percent a year, which means that it will double in roughly 15 years.
Most urban areas are facing major development challenges. It is projected that by
2050 Africa will be home to an additional 300 million urban residents, and 60 per-
cent of all Africans will live in urban areas. Currently, the levels of access and mo-
bility in urban Africa are substantially below what is required to meet current and
future demand. Steady economic growth in most African countries will further
accelerate motorization from the current low levels as well as the demand for
transport services in urban areas.

Inefficient urban transport is already hampering the movement of people and
goods in most African cities. This problem is further aggravated by an inadequate
policy framework, fast-growing motorization, a weak capacity to address the envi-
ronmental and social risks of urban transport systems, and lack of enforcement of
the current rules and regulations. There are also issues related to the lack of coor-
dination between land-use planning and transport systems, the high levels of con-
gestion, and the unsatisfied transport demand, in particular for the vulnerable
segments of the population. To sustain the pace of higher economic growth, coun-
tries need to develop transport policies that can ensure expansion and perfor-
mance of the transport sector in a comprehensive and sustained way.

Drawing on its extensive experience in policy formulation, SSATP can effectively
support African countries in developing strategies and policies that will have a
transformational impact. This will help unleash the potentially crucial role that the
urban transport sector can play in sustaining economic development. The devel-
opment objective of Pillar B on urban transport and mobility (UTM) is to provide
tools for developing safe, clean, and affordable urban transport in Africa for sec-
ondary and primary cities. This is in line with SDG 11: “Make cities and human
settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.” The expected outcome of the
pillar is the achievement of secure universal access by sustainable transport for
urban populations by 2030.

The EASI (Enable/Avoid/Shift/Improve) policy framework underpins the activities
of Pillar B. SSATP initiated conceptualization of the EASI framework during its




                                                                                    xi
Second Development Plan (2008 – 2014). The framework provides a structured set
of policy recommendations to help improve accessibility and mobility in urban
areas of Africa. It is an important first step toward helping Africa improve urban
mobility because it represents a comprehensive and clear organization of the high-
er-level approaches (strategies) needed for the development of sound policies and
the implementation of those policies. It also provides a common language for
communications between technical and administrative practitioners. The activities
associated with Pillar B on urban transport and mobility, as part of the Third De-
velopment Plan, are intended to identify specific ways (tactics) to implement this
framework in a demand-driven, implementation-oriented process aimed at lever-
aging the comparative advantages of SSATP and its partner community.
Pillar C: Road Safety - Following the “Safe Systems” Approach

Africa's road safety performance has deteriorated to that point that it is becoming
an obstacle to the continent’s competitiveness and development. Poor road safety
affects the most vulnerable road users and the poor more than any other category
of people. Despite its low motorization rate, with more than 300,000 deaths per
year, Africa has the worst road safety performance in the world, and it is the conti-
nent where one is most likely to die from a vehicle crash. Because Africa’s econom-
ic growth is triggering a rapid increase in motorization and demand for transport
services, it is predicted that the African road safety crisis will continue to worsen.
More specifically, according to the World Health Organization’s Global Status Re-
port on Road Safety 2015, in contrast to all other regions of the world, road fatality
rates in Africa continue to worsen.

The fatality rate in Africa increased from an estimated 24.1 fatalities per 100,000
population in 2010 to 26.6 fatalities per 100,000 in 2013 1. Road trauma in Africa is
projected to worsen further, with fatalities per capita likely to double over the pe-
riod 2015–30. By contrast, HIV/AIDS and malaria fatalities per capita are project-
ed to decline by about 20 percent 2. The 2013 Global Burden of Disease (GBD)
study reveals that between 1990 and 2013 in Africa there was an 89 percent in-
crease in the number of road injury deaths, a 72 percent increase in pedestrian
deaths, a 93 percent increase in motorcycle deaths, and a 73 percent increase in
cyclist deaths. Meanwhile, the ranking of deaths from road traffic injuries com-

pared with other causes of death increased from 14th place to 9th place 3. The ma-
jority of those killed are under the age of 30. The fatality rate for men is almost
twice that for women, which has strong implications for households, because in
Africa men are mainly the breadwinners.

SSATP has worked closely in partnership with the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA) and the African Union Commission (AUC) on
the development of the African Strategy for Road Safety, which underpins the UN
Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 in Africa and the associated action
plan adopted by the African heads of state in January 2012. In addition, the newly
adopted SDG goals have defined targets in the areas of cities and health that specif-
ically address the road safety agenda and are relevant to Pillar C.

The development objective for Pillar C is to enable African countries to achieve the
road safety goals of the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 and the
Africa Road Safety Action Plan 2011–2020. This objective will be met by working
in collaboration with the African Union Commission.

1.       INTRODUCTION


         Context and Objectives

The SSATP annual meeting is a legal requirement that is set forth in the govern-
ance structure of the program. The purpose of this report is to capture the main
conclusions and recommendations of the discussions held at the 2017 SSATP an-
nual meeting and its associated events. In accordance with the reporting require-
ments, the program team was required to present its annual report covering the
period January–December 2016.

Although the primary objective of the annual meeting is to report on the imple-
mentation of SSATP activities and the likelihood of the program achieving the
intended outcomes, it also provides an opportunity for thematic group discus-
sions, as well as learning and sharing experiences. Overall, it offers the SSATP
team a unique platform for receiving feedback from client countries, partners, and
other stakeholders.

         Structure of the Meeting

The agenda of the meeting, held February 20–24 in Marrakech, Morocco, was
structured around four events. The first set of activities, held on February 20, con-
sisted of working group break-out sessions for each of the three pillars of SSATP’s
Third Development Plan (DP3). The objective was to finalize proposed implemen-
tation of the plan for endorsement by the General Assembly.

The next two days, February 21 and 22, were devoted to learning from best prac-
tices and sharing the experiences of SSATP’s member countries and international
partners with the ultimate aim of drawing lessons for Africa.

The third event was the convocation of the 2017 General Assembly on February
23. The objective of the General Assembly was to review and eventually endorse
the annual report and to adopt the implementation plan. This year, because of the
large number of transport ministers and other high-level delegates in attendance,
the annual meeting was exceptionally preceded by the convocation of a high-level
panel on regional integration. The panel was chaired by minister of transport of
Nigeria and moderated by a former director of the United Nations Economic
Commission of Africa (UNECA). The panel included the transport ministers of

of infrastructure of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS);
the director of infrastructure and energy of the African Union Commission
(AUC); the transport and ICT practice manager at the World Bank; the head of
the Transport and ICT Division of the African Development Bank (AfDB); and the
European Commission representative on behalf of SSATP donors. In addition,
because the 2017 annual meeting coincided with SSATP’s 30th anniversary, a vid-
eo reflecting on the 30 years of the program was produced and shared with
participants.

The last round of events on the fifth day included the organization of site visits to
the Port of Safi (Pillar A integration, connectivity, and cohesion group) and the
Marrakech urban transport system (Pillar B Urban Transport and Mobility
group). In parallel, the Pillar C (road safety) group attended a workshop on man-
agement of road safety data for francophone countries.

         Participation in the Meeting

The over 150 participants in the meeting were from 30 countries and represented
high-level officials (eight ministers, four permanent secretaries, 15 senior direc-
tors, and 20 senior executives), two continental institutions (AUC and UNECA),
seven regional economic communities 4, 10 international or regional private organ-
izations 5, and eight international financing institutions and development part-
ners 6. Donors expressed their appreciation for the high level of participation and
the strong team from the World Bank who attended the meeting (three practice
managers and the country director for Morocco).

Participants commended the strong, ongoing relevance of SSATP as a unique plat-
form to discuss transport policies and strategies through a strong partnership and
country ownership–driven approach. Participants also acknowledged that the
three thematic areas of the SSATP’s Third Development Plan(1) integration, con-
nectivity, and cohesion; (2) urban transport and mobility; and (3) road safety were




key priorities for Africa transport challenges and noted that they were well aligned
with the Africa Development Agenda 2063 adopted by the African Union (AU).
They equally embraced the theme of the annual meeting, “Africa Transport Poli-
cies, Aligning with Sustainable Development Goals.”

2.       SSATP GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND OPERATING MODEL


         SSATP Governance Structure

SSATP is an international partnership of 41 African countries, regional economic
communities (RECs), African institutions (African Union Commission and Unit-
ed Nations Economic Commission for Africa), public and private sector organiza-
tions, and international development agencies. Its mission is to facilitate policy
development and related capacity building in Africa's transport sector. The work
of SSATP follows the policy development cycle, starting with knowledge creation
through assessments and case studies, dissemination of knowledge and best prac-
tices, support of knowledge application, reviews of capacity-building needs, and
capacity-building support and advocacy. Since its inception, SSATP has become
well recognized and respected as the foremost policy development forum for the
transport sector in Africa, bringing together key decision makers while developing
networks of specialists (researchers, operators, and consultants) in most transport-
related fields in Africa.

SSATP is financed by the contributions of development partners to a trust fund
administered by the World Bank. Current contributors are the European Com-
mission (EC), the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, the Agence Fran-
çaise de Développement, and the African Development Bank.

The SSATP governance structure is composed of the following institutional
frameworks:

 The General Assembly provides the strategic directions and approves the work
  program. It is also a forum for all stakeholders involved in policy formulation or
  strategy development for land transport in Africa.
 The Executive Committee, comprising representatives of the development part-
  ners, member countries, private sector, and RECs, carries out the executive and
  advisory functions, providing guidance to the SSATP management team.
 The SSATP management team, known as the Secretariat, is responsible for the
  day-to-day management and implementation of SSATP activities, working in
  consultation with three thematic groups, one for each pillar of the DP3. These
  working groups are composed of experts from the member countries.




                                                                                  5
         New Operating Model

In response to a request from its stakeholders, mainly its client countries, the
SSATP’s program management structure has been redesigned to better anchor the
program in Africa. As a result, the implementation team is split in two. The core
technical team comprises the three pillar leaders, who are based in Nairobi, and
the program manager and administrative staff, who are based in Washington. In
this way, the pillar leaders are able to interact and consult more closely with client
countries and regional organizations in order to strengthen the ownership of the
program and its activities, and the program manager is in a position to stay suffi-
ciently connected to the global knowledge platform offered by the World Bank.

Deep rooted policies for ownership and sustainability. The field-based pillar leaders
are well connected with client countries and counterparts from the European Un-
ion, AFD, and AfDB. The team has already closely interacted with the AfDB’s re-
gional offices in Abidjan and Nairobi, as well as with the EC’s office in Nairobi,
both financiers of the program. The ultimate objective is to develop a formal mo-
dus operandi for collaboration. A collaborative platform is envisioned that would
allow task teams from the development partners to rely on SSATP to develop
products and analytical works on policies and strategies, and the SSATP team
would disseminate its knowledge products and provide guidance and support to
operational teams on demand.

Keeping pace with and staying connected to global knowledge. The Transport De-
partment of the World Bank was restructured in 2015 to promote knowledge and
solutions. Global Solutions Groups (GSGs) covering key transport-related sub-
themes were created to ensure that staff and beneficiary countries have access to
cutting-edge global knowledge. The focus areas of three of these GSGs align with
the three SSATP priority areas. Thus the World Bank, with its new GSGs and the
Global Practices structure, is in a much better position to share its global
knowledge, while SSATP ensures adaptation of the relevant global knowledge to
the African context. These efforts, combined with 30 years of SSATP’s engagement
in Africa, have paved the way for enriching its policy formulation and strategy
development. This is particularly important for the cross-fertilization and main-
streaming of crosscutting issues such as climate change, transport-related gender
issues, and the social impacts of transport policy reforms that is, issues for which
Africa could strongly benefit from a global experience.

3.       A PROGRESS REPORT: IMPLEMENTATION OF SSATP’S THIRD
         DEVELOPMENT PLAN (DP3)


         Progress of Overall Program Management

This chapter summarizes the efforts made by the SSATP management team to
better anchor the program in Africa by empowering more SSATP stakeholders to
“own” the program and by fostering partnerships with various partners and initia-
tives. It also describes SSATP’s efforts to achieve sustainability through dissemina-
tion/outreach and replicability of knowledge created and lessons from best prac-
tices / experiences.


Empowering Stakeholders

From September through November 2016, the SSATP team initiated a mission
tour with the objective of connecting with member countries and partners of the
program, including development partners, in order to emphasize its demand-
driven nature. Ownership of the program by country members and early buy-in by
the development partners and other international organizations involved in activi-
ties will be critical to ensuring the downstream implementation of the knowledge
products that SSATP generates an important consideration because SSATP cannot
be involved, as a matter of guiding principle, in the implementation process.

Introducing the SSATP team and maintaining contact with the program’s devel-
opment donors. In early September 2016, the SSATP program manager visited
Morocco and Europe-based development partners: the AFD in Paris, the Europe-
an Commission in Brussels, and SECO in Bern. From October through November
2016, the program manager and the pillar leaders visited the member countries of
Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Senegal and met with their re-
spective transport ministers to, among other things, introduce the SSATP’s Third
Development Plan.
Preparing for the 2017 annual meeting. Two SSATP team missions visited Moroc-
co between September and November 2016 to follow up on the country’s prelimi-
nary expression of interest in organizing the upcoming meeting of the program’s
General Assembly. Thanks to the strong commitment of Morocco’s Ministry of
Transport and support of the World Bank’s country director and the Bank team in




                                                                                   7
Rabat, the Moroccan authorities agreed to host the 2017 SSATP annual meeting.
In addition, to ensure full support for the 2017 annual meeting the government of
Morocco decided to place the meeting under the “High Patronage of His Majesty
King Mohamed VI.”

Reviving collaboration with the African Union Commission. In the course of its
mission to Ethiopia, the SSATP team met with the newly appointed director of the
AUC’s Department for Infrastructure and Energy, who happens to also be a statu-
tory member of the SSATP’s Executive Committee. The main outcome of this
meeting was the director’s unequivocal confirmation of the strategic relevance of
SSATP. He also expressed his conviction that the DP3 orientation, through its
three thematic areas, aligns well with the goals of the AUC’s development agenda.

Advocating for and accepting new members. As part of the efforts to extend
SSATP to the entire African continent, the SSATP team initiated discussions in
2016 with a number of countries, including South Africa and Mauritania. As a
result of this initiative, Mauritania formally submitted a request to become a
member of the program, and that request was approved by the February 2017
General Assembly. Discussions are still under way with South Africa, which could
be a great asset for SSATP in terms of its potential for sharing experiences with
member countries.

Enhancing collaboration with Africa-based academia. To better anchor SSATP’s
knowledge generation in the local context, the team has consulted members of
Africa’s academic community and asked them to support policy formulation with
evidence-based case studies. To that end, meetings were held with the University
of Nairobi, which coordinates a network of East African universities. The objective
of the memorandum of understanding is to develop long-term collaboration be-
tween SSATP and academia to enhance capacity-building programs and to foster
knowledge-based research and studies. The collaboration is aimed at promoting
SSATP’s Third Development Plan across stakeholders and at exploring avenues for
partnership and possible synergy creation for tailor-made regular programs on
sustainable urban transport management training delivery in the subregion. It is
envisioned that, if successful, this pilot experience will be replicated in other sub-
regions (West, Central, and North Africa). The approach would also be extended
to other key transport topics and eventually to other pilot academic institutions in
order to facilitate the emergence of subregional centers of excellence.

Fostering Partnerships

To place DP3 implementation on solid ground and align its work with the SSATP
core principles, the SSATP team also sought partnerships with similar initiatives or
institutions working in the same thematic areas.

Extending partnership within the development partner community. In line with the
objective of harmonizing the interventions of SSATP’s development partners in
the formulation of transport sector policies in Africa, the team established contact
with the director of infrastructure of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and
invited that institution to attend the SSATP annual meeting. That effort was in-
tended to gradually extend SSATP products to all development partners interested
in transport policies and strategies in Africa. The director of infrastructure, ac-
companied by two senior transport colleagues, attended the annual meeting in
Marrakech.

Collaborating with “Mobilize Your City” (MYC). SSATP will join the Technical and
Scientific Committee of MYC. MYC helps local governments in developing coun-
tries to plan sustainable urban mobility in order to develop more inclusive, livea-
ble, and economically efficient cities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With
the support of a coalition of international partners (development agencies, urban
and transport planning agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and develop-
ment banks), MYC provides a methodological framework and capacity-building
and technical assistance, as well as facilitates access to financing at both the local
and national levels.

Echoing Africa’s concerns at the “Transforming Transportation” (TT) Forum.
“Transforming Transportation,” an event jointly organized by the World Bank
and the World Research Institute, is one of the best-known transport learning
events in the world. To ensure that Africa’s perspective was adequately reflected at
the January 12–13, 2017, TT meeting, the organizers offered SSATP an opportuni-
ty to organize and chair a session entitled “Transforming Urban Mobility in Afri-
ca.” The objective of the session was to take stock of where Africa stands on urban
transport policies as well as on the development of an integrated and sustainable
urban transport and mobility management approach. The session emphasized
how a comprehensive, integrated approach to land-use planning and urban acces-
sibility is conducive to viable, efficient, and productive cities. It also highlighted
emerging trends such as the effective use of information and communications
technology to influence urban mobility trends.
Expanding the collaboration to more regional bodies. SSATP already has a strong




                                                                                    9
record of collaboration with the AUC, UNECA, and regional economic communi-
ties, notably the tripartite ones, as well as with the port associations and other re-
gional professional bodies. The team has been working to expand this collabora-
tion across the continent.

Collaborating with the African Road Maintenance Funds Association (ARMFA).
During the SSATP visit to Addis Ababa, the team met with the ARMFA chair and
executive secretary at their secretariat. The chair expressed the association’s will-
ingness to collaborate with SSATP on the development of road maintenance poli-
cies that include road safety provisions as well as its readiness to collaborate with
SSATP in its efforts to mainstream road maintenance issues in the integrated cor-
ridor development approach.

SSATP also participated in ARMFA’s 2016 annual meeting in Abidjan and is col-
laborating with ARMFA in putting in place a memorandum of understanding to
ensure that road safety is mainstreamed into ARMFA’s dialogue with road agen-
cies at the country level.

Collaborating with new initiatives - Safer Africa. SSATP is ensuring complementari-
ty between Safer Africa and its activities and is using the opportunity of this col-
laboration to scale up the work plan proposed under DP3. The €2.5 million Safer
Africa initiative seeks to establish a dialogue platform between Africa and Europe
focused on road safety and traffic management issues. The project activities will be
oriented toward the “Safe System” approach and grouped into four pillars: (1)
road safety knowledge and data; (2) road safety and traffic management capacity
review; (3) capacity building and training; and (4) sharing of good practices. The
platform will work at two levels: decision making and technical. The decision-
making level will base its actions on information provided and activities carried
out at the technical level by established working groups that address specific top-
ics. The technical level will involve government, research institutions, and interna-
tional and stakeholders’ organizations (such as nongovernmental organizations),
with a fair balance between African and European Union partners. SSATP worked
with the Center for Transport Logistics at the University of Rome on organizing
the first African meeting of Safer Africa in Nairobi in March 2017.


Working towards Sustainability through Dissemination / Outreach and
Replicability

In view of SSATP’s limited resources and mandate, learning from experience, dis-
seminating best practices, and promoting replicability are key to ensuring sustain-




10
ability. Whether an activity would result in a best practice that could be dissemi-
nated and used to advocate at a high policy level without major adaptive work is a
critical criterion for the selection of any SSATP-supported activity. Therefore, the
potential of an activity for easy replicability in other countries would be a guiding
principle in the selection of the priority activities under the pillars. The DP3 com-
ponents seek to optimize the replicability of the policies they will promote, not
only through advocacy and related gap analysis, but also through mainstreaming
these policies into projects to be promoted by the development partner communi-
ty. The policies and strategies developed by SSATP will be discussed with senior
policy makers at the country and regional economic community levels.

The dissemination is to be carried out through various channels, including work-
shops, seminars, communities of practice, conferences, and various media such as
the SSATP website and local news publications. The SSATP distribution list, which
includes about 4,000 transport practitioners inside and outside Africa, will also be
instrumental in this effort. In that respect, the SSATP’s Regional Economic Com-
munities Transport Coordination Committee (REC-TCC) stands out as the conti-
nental platform that can facilitate dissemination through advocacy, replicability,
and the coordination of the policies and strategies brought forward under Pillar A
across the various subregions. Moreover, SSATP will share information on its ac-
tivities, their corresponding outputs, and results through websites, through SSATP
donors and partners, and also through its annual meetings. To enhance its infor-
mation dissemination function and update its communications strategy, SSATP is
in the process of hiring a communications specialist.


Progress toward achieving Outcomes: Implementation Status of Activities

In view of the fact that activities under DP3 were launched only in the second se-
mester of 2016, the progress recorded so far in overall program implementation
could be considered satisfactory. Nevertheless, the team is aware that the pace of
implementation should be accelerated in order to not only maintain the current
momentum but also meet the high expectations of development partners and
members. Implementation of Pillar A on regional integration is more advanced,
with four major activities ongoing and two flagship events already conducted.

Pillar B on urban transport and mobility is in the final stage of the procurement
process for the launch of a series of integrated studies in eight pilot African coun-
tries, despite being somewhat behind schedule. As a result, the initial target of hav-
ing the derived policy notes available at the SSATP annual meeting was resched-




                                                                                   11
uled for a future date. The ongoing collaboration with universities and research
centers has not yet resulted in tangible finished products, even though excellent
progress has been made in East and West Africa.

Pillar C on road safety is moving ahead, though at a relatively slower pace than
anticipated, especially in francophone countries because of the unexpected chal-
lenge in finding the required number of qualified French-speaking consultants
with strong knowledge of institutional road safety issues. The team is addressing
this issue through the development of an umbrella contract with the French Insti-
tute of Science and Technology for Transport, Spatial Planning, Development, and
Networks (IFSTTAR), which will allow the mobilization of experts on an as-
needed basis. The collaboration with other institutions and initiatives remains on
track, and it is contributing to complementing and scaling up SSATP activities.

Overall, considering the remaining period for implementation of the program, the
objectives and outcomes are achievable. What follows is a detailed status report on
the implementation of DP3 activities under each pillar.

Progress on Pillar A: Integration, Connectivity, and Cohesion

The purpose of Pillar A is help accelerate the regional integration of African coun-
tries through better connectivity, improved cohesion, and the provision of com-
petitive and efficient logistics services that help achieve the overall development
objective of DP3, including serving as a catalyst for the achievement of a continen-
tal free trade area. To that end, this regional integration pillar of DP3 has focused
on promoting

  Policies and strategies based on strong monitoring and evaluation for evi-
   dence-based decision making
  Appropriate institutional frameworks and institutions with adequate capacity
  The provision and delivery of logistics services based on the appropriate legal
   and regulatory environment.
Under Pillar A, SSATP executes its activities in close cooperation with the REC-
TCC. The REC-TCC is a forum for exchanges of experiences, peer learning, dis-
semination of good practices, as well as coordination of programs and activities. It
also acts as the steering committee for the regional integration pillar work pro-
gram by notably confirming the relevance of the activities selected, monitoring
their implementation, and evaluating the progress achieved. REC-TCC members
are drawn from the RECs, corridor authorities, regional industry (transport, logis-
tics services, shippers) associations, African institutions (AUC and UNECA), and




12
development partners.

Through the REC-TCC, SSATP plays an advocacy role in promoting policy chang-
es and harmonization at the continental, regional, and country levels and a moni-
toring role in their successful implementation. The focus of the pillar on an inclu-
sive policy dialogue, gives prominence to corridor management being viewed here
as a broad concept responding to the objective of integration, connectivity, and
cohesion.

The short-term program (table 3.1) for Pillar A is demand-driven, and it reflects
the needs of stakeholders, who commit themselves to supporting the activity dur-
ing its entire development cycle. Clear identification of a committed stakeholder at
the regional or national level is a determining factor of the success of implementa-
tion of the activity and its capacity to yield measurable results. At the REC-TCC
meeting held in December 2015 in Nairobi, a list of activities arising from the de-
mands by REC-TCC stakeholders constituted the short-term action plan. The se-
lection of activities was based not only on their relevance to the Pillar A strategic
outcome, but also on the areas in which SSATP has a comparative advantage.

Progress on Pillar B: Urban Transport and Mobility (UTM)

UTM policy development and strategic support seek to put in place the enabling
environment needed by urban areas to follow a holistic approach to improving
urban transport and mobility management. Pillar B supports the development of
(1) an integrated urban transport policy and strategies and (2) a capacity-building
program to create awareness, through knowledge creation and dissemination, that
will help countries and municipalities make informed decisions. In this way,
SSATP is helping to build a consensus and to sensitize stakeholders on the rational
objectives of the conceptual elements of the policy framework, as well as imple-
mentation of strategies in the context of primary and secondary cities.

The activities in Pillar B involve working with countries and municipalities to (1)
foster knowledge of how to develop more effective policies and strategies for sus-
tainable mobility and accessibility in urban Africa and (2) expand the capacity of
cities and metropolitan areas to design, adopt, and implement effective policies for
sustainable mobility and accessibility in urban Africa (see table 3.2). The progress
report that follows describes the status of an integrated study aimed at developing
guidelines for sustainable urban transport and mobility and the parallel set of ac-
tivities being implemented to develop capacity through knowledge generation.
Priority engagement areas for sustainable transport intervention are identified
with a focus on the Enable/Avoid/Shift/Improve (EASI) concept framework.
In applying the EASI framework, the integrated approach study focuses on six
priority areas:

  Institutional: strengthening the institutional framework for urban transport
   management
  Financing: creating sources of dedicated funding for urban transport
   management
  Civil society: fostering effective civil society and private sector participation in
   urban transport management
  Multimodal: undertaking planning and operations for city centers (execution
   of nonmotorized transport and traffic management improvement programs)
  Public transport: executing public transport improvement programs (focused
   on paratransit reform)
  Integrated UTM management: organizing and delivering national government
   support for urban transport management, particularly in secondary cities




                                                                                      15
Fostering Knowledge and Institutional Strengthening of Sustainable Urban Transport
and Mobility

Under this sub-pillar, the objective is to apply the concept of an integrated ap-
proach to sustainable urban transport and mobility. The interventions of the EASI
framework will provide specific guidelines that countries would use in developing
urban transport and mobility management plans. Thereafter, the team envisions
adopting strong advocacy in communications with countries and development
partners, but also working in close collaboration with donors to seek support for
applying the guidelines in selected pilot countries.
The general methodology envisioned is to identify successful experience and pro-
mote its replication. A big factor in determining the success of this promotion will
be how effectively countries are convinced to fully participate, which will be based
strongly on the level of ownership. Every step of this methodology will incorporate
actions aimed at cultivating this ownership. To develop country ownership, the
SSATP team has undertaken or will undertake the following steps:
  Case studies of pilot countries are based on a country’s engagement and desire
   to move forward with the approach promoted.
  Based on preliminary findings and policy notes, a consultation workshop will
   be held to create awareness among African government practitioners so they
   can make informed endorsements of the findings and recommendations.
  Each activity will focus on what has already worked in the African context so
   that potential participants can have confidence in the success of the activity.
  The guidelines to be developed as part of each activity will be based on a full
   diagnostic of African context case studies. In that way, the recommendations
   included in the guidelines will be more credible - that is, based on knowledge
   of how things are in Africa instead of being preconceived recommendations
   borrowed directly from other regions.
  Finally, attractive options will be presented, ranging from incremental to ambi-
   tious ways forward
UTM Capacity Building and Knowledge Creation

The study will be complemented by UTM capacity-building support for promot-
ing the urban transport and mobility concept and knowledge-based awareness
creation for decision making. The primary focus will be on partnering with Afri-
can universities and other academic institutions and centers of excellence to devel-
op midcareer training on UTM components and knowledge-based short curricula.




16
           This subpillar will focus primarily on support for capacity-building decision mak-
           ers in the area of sustainable urban transport and mobility management. It will
           also support extended capacity-building programs to sensitize stakeholders
           through advocacy, dissemination of knowledge, and the sharing of best practices.
           SSATP will work toward building a consensus on the rationale and the conceptual
           elements of the policy framework, as well as implementation of strategies in the
           context of primary and secondary cities.

           Dissemination of the pilot project experience, as well as the guidelines updated to
           reflect the lessons learned from these projects, will be critical to promoting wider
           replication of these initiatives. This will allow governments to own the process
           and participants to understand the actual results and specific actions applicable to
           their reality.

Progress on Pillar C: Road Safety

Africa's road safety performance has deteriorated to the point that it is becoming a
major obstacle to the continent’s competitiveness and development. Despite Afri-
ca’s low motorization rate, road safety affects the most vulnerable road users and
the poor more than any other category of people. SSATP thus has an opportunity
to contribute significantly to the initiatives aimed at saving lives on Africa’s roads.
Building on its road safety work under the previous development plan, SSATP will
employ a two-pronged approach to tackle issues in road safety by (1) improving
road safety management in a comprehensive way and (2) introducing bolder
measures to deal with the safety of vulnerable road users.

The Africa Road Safety Action Plan 2011–2020, developed by the African countries
in consensus, identifies specific actions in support of the five pillars of the United
Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 and pinpoints the monitor-
ing indicators to be used for activities and key actors during the period activities
will be carried out. The African Union Conference of Ministers in Charge of
Transport endorsed this plan, and the heads of state adopted it in Luanda in 2012.
The African Road Safety Charter further reinforces the commitment to speed up
implementation of national, regional, and continental road safety programs.

During the Third African Road Safety Conference in July 2016, countries agreed
that the lack of quality data was a challenge and resolved to improve the quality of
their data through collaboration with the International Road Traffic Safety Data
and Analysis (IRTAD) group within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD). The AUC and UNECA have made commitments to
fostering this process.

The success of this approach will be measured by the achievement of the following
objectives/outcomes: (1) enable the AUC and UNECA to encourage countries to
achieve the goals of the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011–2020 and the
Africa Road Safety Action Plan 2011–2020; (2) promote effective policy and strate-
gy formulation and implementation at the country level; (3) stimulate good prac-
tice in road safety management by promoting systematic implementation of the
Africa Road Safety Action Plan; and (4) better integrate road safety policy and pil-
lar-based interventions in locally and externally funded road developments (see
table 3.3).

The four outcomes for the road safety pillar are interrelated, even though each
stands as an outcome on its own merit. For sustainable, effective, and efficient
road safety outcomes that lower the number of deaths and serious injuries from




18
road traffic fatalities, one must have the right data and the ability to manage them
effectively. Yet one also must have strong road safety institutions with the appro-
priate legal and regulatory mandates and adequate financing. In addition, these
institutions must rely on having the right policies and strategies in place. Each out-
come is one of the building blocks that serve the overarching goal of seeing African
countries work together at the local, national, and regional levels to improve the
continent’s abysmal road safety record. Because of the limited resources available
to SSATP for this pillar, it is important that it work strategically with other part-
ners to scale up and provide complementarity on planned activities. Finally, the
establishment of a regional observatory or observatories, the initiation of a dia-
logue platform for dissemination and knowledge transfer, and the creation of re-
gional associations of road safety agencies will also help in the effort to build ca-
pacity across the continent.

Other Receipts

As administrator of the program, the World Bank contributed US$477,176 in 2016
to DP3 to offset the first year set-up and start-up costs, including the salaries of the
program management team, together with all the associated direct and indirect
costs, which included consultant services. This transaction is also addressed in the
disbursement section of this chapter because it was processed as a direct adjust-
ment to the total amount disbursed.

The World Bank also provides an in-kind contribution of staff time through the
process of peer review of concept notes, terms of reference, outputs, and other
technical input to the program deliverables that are not accounted for by the sys-
tem but are reflected in the consultation and review process required to ensure the
quality of program deliverables.

Another source of income and receipts for the MDTF is investment income. The
World Bank invests the undisbursed amounts of cash contributions received from
the financing partners. By December 31, 2016, the total receipts from investment
income applied to the MDTF amounted to US$77,570, and the total receipts in the
MDTF amounted to US$10,941,370.

Statement of Disbursements

The DP3 total disbursement position as of December 31, 2016, was US$1,849,709,
which included the 2 percent administration fee of US$217,276. The administra-
tion fee is set forth in the financing partners’ administration agreement signed
between the donors and the World Bank and is applied to all cash receipts from
the four financing partners involved. It represents the cost recovery of the World
Bank applicable at the time the DP3 Multi-Donor Trust Fund was established.

4.       CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
         ANNUAL MEETING


Conclusions for the Continent

The two days of learning events and experience sharing at the annual meeting were
an excellent opportunity for participants to learn from others and draw lessons for
the continent. Discussions led to a strong consensus on the relevance of each pillar
of the Third Development Plan. What follows are the main takeaways.
Pillar A: Integration, connectivity, and cohesion. Morocco’s Green Logistics Strategy
could be a model to replicate (factoring in local dimensions) in other African
countries. SSATP will disseminate the final draft of the guidelines once complet-
ed. As for trucking industry reforms, a comprehensive toolkit is available, and each
country could pick the reform agenda based on the status of the sector in-country.
For dry ports and inland container depots (ICDs), countries agreed that a needs
assessment should be carried out upfront, but where, when, and how?

Pillar B: Urban transport and mobility. Participants acknowledged that urban
transport and mobility (UTM) are a growing concern in Africa, resulting from an
unprecedentedly high rate of urbanization. They endorsed the EASI (Enable-
Avoid-Shift-Improve) framework as an umbrella to address the issues and chal-
lenges. However, they asked that specific attention be given to the following issues
that are jeopardizing the agenda for structural urban reforms: the poor governance
of UTM management, the weak capacity of existing institutions, and the lack of
political support at the municipal and country levels. Going forward, participants
confirmed that better integration of land-use planning and transport systems is a
must for sustainability; use of information and communications technologies will
improve urban mobility and traffic management and eventually enhance the con-
cept of smart cities; and full ownership and strong championship will be key to
moving the UTM agenda.

Pillar C: Road safety. Participants stressed again that this is a critical issue in Africa
that requires a large coalition and a champion at the highest level of government.
The main conclusions were the following: leadership is instrumental to spurring
actions; data collection is a prerequisite to ensure development of an effective and
efficient strategy, with ICT and big data helping to expedite results; policies and
strategies should provide the solid ground needed for implementation; coordina-




                                                                                       23
tion and partnership are important to see actual results on the ground; and re-
gional observatories could be key to setting and benchmarking performance based
on world-class standards.


Featured Examples

Morocco’s Green Logistics Strategy, a New Approach
Morocco, considered a pioneer in “green energy,” has designed and implemented
a comprehensive Green Logistics Strategy. The strategy is based on the following
components: (1) strengthening institutions, public policies, and regulations to
promote low-carbon modes and operations in the transport sector in Morocco;
(2) developing Greater Casablanca's multiflow logistics area network as a model
project within the framework of the national logistics strategy; and (3) operation-
alizing mitigation measures (such as training in eco-driving, raising awareness of
operators, support for the conformity of vehicles with the Euro 4 standard)
through investments to upgrade the logistics zones within the framework of the
Regional Logistics of Greater Casablanca. This experience could serve as a base for
South-South best practice knowledge exchanges.

Addis-Ababa City Road Safety Strategy, a Good Example

The Addis Ababa Road Safety Strategy is a best practice case study that should be
considered by SSATP member countries and city councils. Because of the high
pedestrian fatality rate in the city (over 80 percent of all fatalities), the strategy is a
pedestrian-centered one, and it lays out seven clear strategic priorities or safety
directions for the city to implement:

  Safety Direction 1: Developing a road traffic safety management system
  Safety Direction 2: Focusing on the main roads, where trauma is the
   most concentrated
  Safety Direction 3: Prioritizing the pedestrian first, second, and third
  Safety Direction 4: Enforcing key safety laws
  Safety Direction 5: Improving crash and injury data management
  Safety Direction 6: Improving the post-crash trauma response
  Safety Direction 7: Demonstrating and scaling up investment
Ethiopia, like any other African country, is facing the challenge of fatalities and
serious injuries stemming from the country’s poor road safety conditions. The city




24
of Addis Ababa is responsible for about 13 percent of all fatalities recorded in
the country, and city authorities have recognized the need to address this critical
challenge.

In 2015/2016, the city of Addis Ababa benefitted from two major interventions
aimed at addressing its road safety issues. The first one, supported by the World
Bank, helped to develop safe infrastructure and build capacity in the Addis Ababa
City authorities and the traffic police. The second concerned the Bloomberg
Global Road Safety initiative, which provided support and capacity building
around advocacy, traffic enforcement, and infrastructure. There was agreement
that these two initiatives, although timely, had a missing link in the form of a
strategy that would tie all interventions together and would sustain the road safety
focus through creating ownership at the city level of further interventions and sus-
tained activity. SSATP supported efforts to address this missing element. In that
respect, a strategy was designed to focus on improving pedestrians’ mobility con-
ditions, and on changing the behaviour of road users. It is a 13-year road safety
strategy, that focuses on pedestrians and drivers and requires cooperation among
all stakeholders.

The process began with stakeholder engagement and on-ground data gathering.
This involved understanding the road safety capacity of the city administration
and included discussions with the units with responsibility for planning urban
form, road and transit development projects, and current initiatives related to the
safety of vulnerable road users such as pedestrians. Discussions also took place
with other key stakeholders outside the city administration such as the police,
public transport operators and regulators, vehicle and driver regulators, as well as
development partners such as the World Bank and AfDB. The findings from the
first citywide road safety status report, indicated that in 2016 about 479 persons
died from road crashes. In addition, 1,925 persons sustained critical physical inju-
ries. Moreover, it highlighted a news piece of the issues which has to do with the
lack of safer road facilities for pedestrians. Indeed, only 14 percent of city roads are
safe for pedestrians. The report also highlights the surprisingly high number of
drivers, including those in public transportation, who operate vehicles under the
influence of alcohol.
To ensure the rapid transfer of knowledge on critical safety issues in cities, input
was sought from stakeholders on how to respond to the issues just outlined. Based
on the findings, a draft strategy was prepared for review by the city team, centered
on broad directions established by stakeholders. After the review, the data were
refined, and additional data were gathered as needed. A stakeholder workshop was




                                                                                     25
held to review the draft strategy document, develop further priorities, and discuss
the key actions required for a comprehensive draft strategy.

Marrakech, a Sustainable Integrated Urban Transport System

The Moroccan experience with integrated urban transport master plans and land-
use planning was considered a key case study to disseminate. Learning and experi-
ence- sharing sessions centered on the current trends in urban mobility challenges,
including poor urban planning and poor street connectivity, and the future pro-
spects for transforming urban mobility through urban planning and ICT.

In most African cities, urban mobility is still characterized by insufficient public
transit (less than 5 percent of the total urban mobility in most Sub-Saharan Afri-
can cities), a high share of the informal sector with minibuses, a very high share of
pedestrians (without adequate sidewalk space allocated to them), and a growing
share of private cars and taxis. At the same time, only limited public space is allo-
cated to street and urban transport infrastructure, which remain the forgotten
economic drivers.

In view of these problems, there is a growing consensus the organic growth of cit-
ies should be planned, incorporating the following elements as a minimum: (1) an
integrated, mixed land use approach that combines high economic, social, and
environmental returns; (2) integrated public policy; (3) coordination with other
sectors; and (4) integration of the development and use of ICT to make cities
smart. ICT and mixed land uses will enable smart mobility (reduction in motor-
ized transport) and lower emissions of greenhouse gases.

The Moroccan experience promoting integrated land use planning and multimod-
al transport system approach is a good example of such an approach. Actually,
Morocco has launched an initiative that aims at developing an integrated urban
transport master plan for its major cities. This effort is an opportunity to both
strengthen institutional capacity and promote green mass transport modes. The
key elements of such a master plan are developing the sector strategy and planning
tools, strengthening the governance structure and creating specialized institutions,
creating important financial instruments, and developing priority urban transport
corridors, including bus rapid transit lines.

Other Presentations and Discussions
Other presentations at the annual meeting included “Smart Mobility in Smart Cit-
ies,” “UN-Habitat’s Approach to Sustainable Urban Mobility Issues and the New
Urban Agenda,” “Urban Transports and Mobility Master Plans for Moroccan Cit-




26
ies,” “Urban Transport Management Authorities: The Case of Dakar (Senegal),”
and “Traffic Impact Assessment Study (TIA).”

Discussions focused on urbanization and urban mobility in Africa, taking into
account the rapid land expansion and the proliferation of slums. Because urbani-
zation is inevitable, participants agreed that the solution is to develop policies and
adequate planning tools for proper urbanization and appropriate city growth. In
fact, mobility is one of the most fundamental and important characteristics of the
economic and social activities that could lay the groundwork for large-scale pro-
duction, increased competition, and higher land values, among other advantages.

The importance of mobility is underscored in many key global agendas (such as
the SDGs, Cop 21 &22, and New Urban Agenda). Smart, sustainable mobility is
essential for environmental protection, economic efficiency, and social progress in
the African context where nearly half a billion of people live in cities and towns.
Meanwhile, it is projected that by 2040, 1 billion Africans will reside in cities and
towns, with many large cities having more than 5 million inhabitants.


Conclusions and Recommendations of the High Level Panel

A high-level panel met on February 23 to discuss how to unleash the regional inte-
gration potential of Africa through transport and trade facilitation. Members of
the high-level panel included Rotimi Amaechi, minister of transport, Nigeria
(chair); Jose Makila Sunmanda, vice premier minister and minister of transport,
Democratic Republic of Congo; Edgar Mebengo’o, minister of transport, Came-
roon; and Michael Madamba, minister of transport, Zimbabwe.

Members of the panel gave a brief account of progress made in various regional
economic communities in furthering the regional integration process. Efforts are
also under way at the African Union level by means of initiatives such as the 2063
Agenda, the Kagame Report, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development
(NEPAD) short-term action plan, the NEPAD Medium to Long Term Strategic
Framework, the AU Infrastructure Master Plan Initiative for Infrastructure Devel-
opment for Africa and the AU-Africa Partnership on Infrastructure Legislations,
Regulations and Technical Standards with the World Bank, the African Develop-
ment Bank, and SSATP.

The panel noted the need to consolidate and accelerate the regional integration
process through the promotion of transborder growth poles across the regional

dors could be powerful polarizing poles with strong multisectoral growth poten-
tial. But they have to be linked to efficient networks of feeding roads, which would
open up landlocked areas and help mainstream rural economies.

The panel noted that progress has been made in promoting transborder transport
corridors for the physical integration of the continent. Indeed, 78 percent of the
missing links along the eight trans-Africa highways have been built, and several
other corridors have opened in eastern and southern Africa, Central Africa, and
West Africa.
Members of the panel further noted that, with the exception of the Union du Ma-
ghreb Arabe, all RECs are equipped with clearly defined soft integration plans with
mechanisms and instruments to implement them as laws.
The key conclusions and recommendations of the panel are the following:

  The current three-pronged regional integration model is a viable economic
   development strategy for Africa: current efforts to establish free trade areas
   and customs unions should be accelerated, taking into account future external
   trade partnerships.
  Supply capacities should be significantly boosted by research and develop-
   ment for diversification and growth.
  The deepening and acceleration of the regional integration process should cut
   across RECs and be planned around growth poles, including development
   corridors.
  Development corridors are a strong multisectoral development engine. They
   facilitate flows of people and goods and usher in integrated systems for agri-
   cultural and industrial development by bringing together factor inputs. They
   link trade, infrastructure, and social development.
  Cross-border development corridors require multisectoral intra / interregion-
   al planning capacities and close consultations and multinational working ar-
   rangements.
  Formal corridor management mechanisms are needed to monitor operations,
   including single windows and joint border post and axel load controls, and
   spearhead the removal of NTBs (nontariff barrier to trade) and abusive
   checkpoints. Strong political will could empower such mechanisms to impose
   the necessary changes in attitude.
  Sizable additional funding is needed for more infrastructure and the renewal
   of rolling stock. Public-private partnerships and soft loans, as well as grants




28
    from development partners, should be pursued.
  Most of these recommendations are addressed to the states, RECs, and other
   shareholders, as well as multilateral technical and financing agencies.
  SSATP has an important role to play in:
     Providing technical assistance to countries, RECs, and their
      planning agencies
     Promoting corridors with an emphasis on “development corridors” by
      helping to build planning and management capacities and providing plan-
      ning teams with advisory services
     Convening and coordinating cross-border planning teams for consulta-
      tions on operational matters
     Certifying corridor effectiveness and efficiency in their operations for
      states, RECs, and funding agencies
     Helping to mobilize resources from bilateral and multilateral financing.


Recommendations of the General Assembly

Program work plans. The General Assembly endorsed the program’s work plans
that emerged from the pillar working groups, which met on February 20. The pil-
lars’ work plans for FY2016/17 and the tentative work plan for FY2017/18 were
finalized and endorsed by the General Assembly on February 23.

2016 Annual Report. The General Assembly approved the 2016 annual report and
commended the program team for the excellent work carried out thus far and for
the excellent organization of the annual meeting, especially the high-value tech-
nical contents. The General Assembly praised the great value of the two-day ses-
sions on experience sharing and learning from good practices. Much appreciated,
for example, were the presentation by Morocco on the Green Logistics Strategy
and the lessons learned on the urban transport, planning, and land use; energy-
friendly transport modes; and strategies for road safety (the case of Addis Ababa).
This experience sharing among member countries should be seen as a tool for
knowledge sharing and building capacity.

Endorsement of new member. Mauritania has been formally accepted as the 41st
member country of SSATP. The AUC’s director of infrastructure and energy is
now back in the program and has resumed his seat as a member of the SSATP Ex-
ecutive Committee. He indicated that the AUC will definitely rely on SSATP as a

key contributor to policy issues related to the Africa priority investment program
and to discussions on the regional integration agenda.


Recommendations of the Executive Committee

During the Executive Committee meeting, the key development partners agreed
after a discussion that coordination was needed on the various initiatives under-
taken in SSATP’s three focus areas. They also agreed that such coordination could
be carried out in two subsequent phases. The first phase could consist of collecting
the initiatives under each SSATP pillar and then mapping initiatives by focus area
and by country/city. The second step could consist of using the occasion of the
annual meeting to organize a 1/1.5/2-day meeting for development partners to
coordinate projects and programs in Africa. The task team leaders of each institu-
tion would attend this side event to discuss project and program pipelines as well
as active portfolios and agree on how to move forward policy recommendations in
close collaboration with SSATP findings.

The timing of the next mid-term review (MTR) and annual meeting was discussed
by the Executive Committee. The Third Development Program cycle covers the
period 2015–18, whereas the program actually got under way in June 2016. Thus
eventually there is a need to go beyond 2018 to achieve the program’s objectives,
and so it was agreed that an extension must be considered. It is likely that the
completion date would be postponed to the end of 2019.

The next annual meeting is scheduled for the second semester of 2018. The MTR
report would be examined at the meeting. The country is not yet known. The team
will review expressions of interests and share them with the Executive Committee
for further consideration.

5.       LOOKING AHEAD: WORKING TOWARD ACHIEVING RESULTS


Going forward, thanks to the following four key achievements in the last year, the
future direction of the SSATP is clear:

     1. Mauritania has been approved as the 41st SSATP member country and the
        third in North Africa, thereby embedding the program as an Africa-wide
        initiative.
     2. The transition period between theDP2 and DP3, as well as between the
        former and new program management teams, is also now complete.
     3. Each pillar leader has been able to identify and connect with the core team
        members of his or her working group.
     4. The SSATP General Assembly has endorsed the work program and ex-
        pressed strong support in the team.
Acting on these achievements, the SSATP program team must direct all its energy
toward achieving the planned objectives and results of the DP3. The team is confi-
dent that with the strong support of the General Assembly, the ongoing guidance
of the Executive Committee, and broadly the ownership and engagement of the
community of stakeholders, the SSATP program will prove successful.

                             Ladies and Gentlemen,
                             Honorable guests,
It is my great honor and pleasure to be with you today for the opening and commence-
ment of work of the various plenary sessions of the Annual Meeting of the Africa
Transport Policy Program (SSATP), under the high patronage of His Majesty the King,
may God help him.

I welcome you to the city of Marrakesh, a place where civilizations have engaged in dia-
logue and on which historic routes toward Africa have converged.

This meeting, organized jointly by the Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport, and Logistics
and the SSATP, has set as its objective to encourage discussion and share good practices
and experiences in relation to the three pillars of the SSATP Third Development Plan
(DP3), namely “Integration, Connectivity and Cohesion,” “Urban Transport and Mobility,”
and “Road safety.”

We are also proud to note that the theme selected for this meeting, “African Transport
Policies, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals,” reflects one of the major chal-
lenges ahead.




                                                                                         33
that we face as Africans and officials responsible for the transport sector, which is to
develop policies and strategies capable of supporting a reliable, safe, green, low-carbon,
and inclusive transport system.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Allow me to reaffirm on this occasion that the SSATP as the main forum for identifying
transport policies for Africa, in which the chief decision-makers and stakeholders partici-
pate, and where networks of specialists in areas related to transport (researchers, opera-
tors, and experts) are forged, constitutes for Morocco an opportunity to share with other
African countries its experiences and achievements in the area of infrastructure and
transport, and to benefit from capacity building in the transport sector.

With respect to the subject that is of concern to us today, the Kingdom of Morocco has
embarked upon a number of major projects with the aim of improving its transport sys-
tem by developing efficient networks and carrying out sweeping reform of the different
modes of transport in order to respond, on the one hand, to the continual increase in
travel and, on the other hand, to improve the efficiency of movements of persons and
goods and to reduce their impact on the environment.

Introducing such notions as sustainable transport, enhanced energy efficiency, and re-
duction of emissions in transport is one of the major challenges that the sector faces. In
this regard, Morocco is putting in place a comprehensive set of political, regulatory, and
financial instruments in order to address these difficulties.

Above and beyond integrating all of these dimensions into a coherent strategy, it bears
noting that working toward sustainable transport requires that we are able to link it to a
more comprehensive approach and to structure it around the issue of development.

To that end, it is important to adopt a broader vision consistent with the overall objec-
tives of transport policy, which seeks to promote the emergence of transport systems
that are more effective in economic and social terms, more reliable, more energy effi-
cient and, lastly, more respectful of mankind and the environment. The aim is to ensure
“a green and inclusive transport system,” in other words, to provide an array of choices
regarding infrastructures and reform of the transport sector that enable us to maximize
our economy’s potential for growth, while taking into account the requirements of “sus-
tainable development” in its economic, social environmental, and cultural aspects.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In shouldering the responsibility, we have toward the citizens and future generations of
our African continent, sustainable development will continue to serve as a beacon light-




34
ing the way as we develop our transport strategies. In that respect I would note that the
current conditions are very favorable to the renewal of our systems.

Against this backdrop, Morocco has taken numerous steps toward establishing a green
and inclusive transport system. Allow me to mention a few examples.

  Planning for 1,500 km of high-speed rail lines to service the Kingdom’s major cities;
   the first of these lines, between Tangier and Casablanca, is expected to commence
   operations in 2017;

  Promotion and development of rail transport, which, as a means of mass transport,
   can play a much greater role in reducing energy consumption and thereby reducing
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;

  Extension of light rail lines linking Rabat and Salé and the Casablanca municipal
   light rail;

  Establishment of a national strategy for developing logistical competitiveness involv-
   ing the creation of multi-flow logistical platforms that will make it possible to man-
   age the flow of goods in a rational manner, ensuring an optimum mix of road and
   rail transport according to the nature of the goods, so as to minimize consumption
   of petroleum products. This strategy is expected to result in a sharp reduction in CO2
   emissions associated with the transport of goods, amounting to an estimated 35
   percent in the medium term.

  Integration of climate change in the national strategy for developing logistical com-
   petitiveness and the establishment of logistical platforms by pursuing the concept of
   “Low-Carbon Logistics”;

  Renewal of the road transport fleet by introducing incentives for junking and replac-
   ing road vehicles for the transport of goods that are more than 15 years old and by
   expanding this program to cover all road transport vehicles;

  Introduction of the principle of eco-driving in basic and advanced training programs
   for professional drivers with the aim of increasing the practice of rational, safe, and
   economical driving;

  Adoption of an emissions standard for new vehicles equal to the Euro 4
   standard; and

  Upgrading of inspection stations by, inter alia, requiring that they be equipped with
   opacimeters and CO testers, which will make for more rigorous testing of vehicles for
   emissions during technical inspections.




                                                                                       35
In spite of such progress, Morocco continues to face many challenges in developing a
sustainable transport system and this meeting provides an excellent opportunity to
compare notes and brainstorm together with a view to contributing to the achievement
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Ladies and Gentlemen,

There can be no doubt that the exchange of views and discussions in the plenary ses-
sions of this Annual Meeting will result in the adoption of pragmatic approaches, sug-
gestions, and recommendations worthy of the objectives set for our continent in the
SSATP Program.

Before concluding my opening remarks, I wish to thank the experts who so kindly trav-
eled to Morocco to share their experience with respect to the three pillars of the SSATP
development plan.

I thank you for your kind attention, and I wish you every success in your deliberations.

I would like to thank the Moroccan Authorities for accepting to host this important
event, for the first time organized in Northern Africa. I also want to appreciate the High
address of His Majesty Mohamed VI, King of Morocco.

                                Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Guests,

                                Members of the SSATP Executive Committee,

                                Representatives of Development Partners,

                                Dear participants,

                                Ladies and Gentlemen,

                                The World Bank is honored to speak during this welcom-
                                ing session of the 2017 Annual Meetings of the Africa
                                Transport Policy Program, known as the SSATP. I will
briefly discuss the continued relevance of the Program to address the transport chal-
lenges faced by Africa, and the synergies between the Africa strategy of the World Bank
Group and the strategic priorities of the SSATP.

What is amazing is that the SSATP is 30-year old and still alive and kicking. I would like to
express my gratitude to the African countries and the partners who had the vision to
create such a program. During these 30 years, Africa has changed and grown enormous-
ly. The SSATP has adapted thanks to the continuous ownership and leadership of its
partner countries and to the financiers that have been providing adequate resources.
The theme of the conference “Africa Transport Policies, aligning with Sustainable Devel-
opment Goals” is indeed well in line with the SSATP DP3 strategic objective.

The three thematic areas that will be discussed this week and that are the focus of the
Program are critical for Africa. The following figures are telling enough :

  For regional integration, intra-African trade as a share of GDP is low relative to that of
   other regions. For instance, intra-continental imports are estimated at 4.3 per cent of
   Africa’s GDP, against 6.7 per cent in the Americas, 17.9 per cent in Asia and 21 per
   cent in Europe. Still, intra-African trade in goods as a share of GDP has risen sharply
   since around 2000, and transport infrastructure and services are a key enabling fac-
   tor to increase this share. Regional integration promotes trade and growth through




                                                                                          37
      facilitation of movement of goods and people. I would like to insist here that the
      “hard” (i.e., the infrastructure) is not enough and that sound transport policies are al-
      so needed to boost trade flows

     Concerning urbanization, it is projected that over the next twenty years there will be
      an additional 300 million urban residents in Africa by 2050, and 60 percent of all Afri-
      cans will live in urban areas. At the same time, motorization is growing fast leading
      to high congestion and unsatisfied transport demand, in particular for the vulnerable
      segments of the population. Indeed, urban mobility is about ensuring equitable ac-
      cess to economic opportunities. There are solutions to these development challeng-
      es such as the Bus Rapid Transit programs already active in certain cities like Lagos
      and Dar and under preparation in others such as Dakar or Marrakech.

     Regarding road safety, the fatality rate in Africa has increased from an estimated 24.1
      fatalities per 100,000 population in 2010 to 26.6 fatalities per 100,000 in 2013. 7 Be-
      tween 1990 and 2013, there has been an 89% increase in the number of road injury
      deaths, a 72% increase in pedestrian deaths, a 93% increase in motorcycle deaths, a
      73% increase in cyclist deaths. These are unacceptable statistics and demand imme-
      diate action. Road safety also has a substantial economic cost for African countries.
      Road safety is about making our transport systems safe and protecting our most vul-
      nerable populations.

Policies and actions along these three dimensions will make transport inclusive, safe,
resilient and sustainable and will help bolster the contribution of the transport sector on
the continent to the Sustainable Development Goals for the 2015-20130 period.

Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The mission of the World Bank is to end extreme poverty within a generation and boost
shared prosperity. With this mandate, the World Bank has developed its strategy for
Africa which identifies two priority areas specifically addressed in the Third Develop-
ment of the SSATP. They are regional integration and urbanization, within a sustaina-
ble/climate change perspective. Regional integration in Africa remains a critical piece of
the World Bank strategy to improve connectivity, leverage economies of scale, and en-
hance productivity. Integrated urban planning, addressing water, sanitation, transport,
housing, power and governance, will be vital to making urbanization a true driver of
cities’ productivity and income growth, and are at the core of the World Bank work in
Africa. And because Africa is the worst performer in terms of road safety, this has been

7   World Health Organisation (2015), “Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015”, Geneva.




38
specifically identified by the SSATP as a major area of action and is fully embedded in
the two priority areas above of the World Bank strategy for Africa. In addition, the strate-
gy for Africa identifies knowledge as essential to the World Bank effort to improve sus-
tainable development outcomes and make aid more effective and with due considera-
tion of potential social, environmental, and climate change impacts. As such the SSATP
is a flagship program and the largest regional program hosted by the World Bank to
develop knowledge and build capacity.

The SSATP is a critical source of knowledge creation for its partners, as it is for the World
Bank, adding the African experience to the wealth of knowledge acquired worldwide by
the Bank through its various programs and operations and underpinning policies’ de-
velopment. At the World Bank’s Transport Practice, five Global Solutions Groups were
created to ensure that our specialists and beneficiary countries have access to the most
up-to-date global knowledge to steer the development of their transport sector in sup-
port of their economic growth and poverty reduction objectives. Three of these groups
mirror the three priority areas of the SSATP. This puts in place the framework for im-
proved and increased synergy between the SSATP and the Bank for the benefit of both
and of member countries and other partners of the Program.

Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Myself and my colleagues Practice Managers for transport in Africa, are committed to
work with the SSATP team to ensure that the knowledge developed by the program is
reflected in the analytical work and integrated and implemented in each country’s poli-
cy agendas, underpinning infrastructure investments supported in particular by World
Bank operations. This will be for us an important criterion to measure the success of the
SSATP program at completion.

Going forward it is our strong believe that the SSATP guiding principles on “Ownership”
and “Partnership” are instrumental to its success. Indeed, working through partnerships
has been a key driver of SSATP’s success in the past. We are committed to strengthening
this partnership with all partners of the Program. The ownership which translates into a
demand-driven approach and that guides the design of activities, is to be commended.
We think that this is what really makes it a unique Program of its kind. We need to pay a
peculiar attention not to lose this specific strength. Finally, coordination among donors
to ensure we harmonize the way we provide support to the Program design and support
to its knowledge application would also be decisive in the success of SSATP.

To conclude, I would like to thank all of you for coming to this event and showing
through your attendance that the SSATP is very relevant for Africa. I would like also to




                                                                                          39
thank again the development partners who provide the necessary funding to make the
program a reality (e.g., EU, SECO, AfDB and AFD). Finally, I would like to thank again the
Kingdom of Morocco for hosting the meeting and in doing so help build a bridge to
exchange knowledge and experiences across the entire African continent. Thank you.

Your Excellency, Madam Minister of the Kingdom of Morocco,

Your Excellencies, Ministers of Transport of the countries represented,

                            Representatives of international organizations,

                            would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude
                            to the Government and people of Morocco, under the en-
                            lightened leadership of His Majesty, King Mohamed VI, for
                            the warm welcome extended to us since our arrival here in
Marrakesh. We are confident that this spirit of conviviality will prevail during our deliber-
ations and our stay here in Morocco.

Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

As the African Development Bank, we welcome the various topics on the agenda for
discussion and exchange of views over the next three days of the SSATP Annual Meeting
and General Assembly.

We are pleased that virtually all our regional economic communities are taking part in
this assembly. This not only sends a strong signal to the development partners, but also
attests to the importance that you attach to regional integration and to the develop-
ment of transport infrastructure and services. As you well know, transport infrastructure
boosts trade and unifies societies and economies. It is the backbone of regional integra-
tion and contributes to the economic growth of our countries. It has been determined
that an efficient transport system can increase GDP by between 1 percent and 5 percent.

The SSATP is not an institution; rather, it is a policy framework that has a role to play in
the achievement of these objectives. Indeed, for over three decades, the SSATP has




                                                                                          41
served as a source of ideas for appropriate policies, publishing several technical notes,
guides, studies, and concepts for infrastructure development and management. As the
SSATP’s Third Development Plan prepares to hit its stride, we call for an even deeper
commitment from the SSATP to help its members draft and implement tailored policies.

Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We have heard it said that Africa is on the move, that growth rates are rising. However,
the problems relating to infrastructure, and to transport infrastructure in particular, re-
main unresolved. This is the real “trap” for sustainable growth in Africa. If this deficit is
not narrowed, the current economic momentum cannot be sustained.

Over the past 10 years, the Bank, like the entire African continent, has enjoyed strong
growth. It currently has an active portfolio totaling US$25 billion, of which 60 percent is
invested in infrastructure. Last year, we committed almost US$7 billion, closely collabo-
rating with you on a number of occasions through such organizations as COMESA, IGAD,
the EAC, the SADCC, ECCAS, and ECOWAS. Multinational transport projects, the design
and management of which are the responsibility of our regional economic communities,
have also grown in importance, increasing from 20 percent of the entire transport port-
folio to close to 75 percent today.

Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We know what challenges lie ahead and we know what path we need to take. We must
be unwavering in our commitment to sharpening our focus on devising inclusive poli-
cies that are not just good, but excellent. This is what the AfDB aims to achieve through
its Ten-Year Strategy promoting inclusive green growth. The various topics selected for
this forum are timely, and discussions must also clearly include the issues of strengthen-
ing integration and stepping up the pace of progress in the area of global value chains.

Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is against this backdrop that the AfDB stands ready to support the Third Development
Plan, which focuses on efficient, safe, and sustainable transport systems to help the
poorest lift themselves out of poverty and countries to compete internationally.

Thank you for your kind attention.

Honorable Ministers,

Distinguished Participants,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

                              I am delighted to address you this morning in this beautiful
                              and historic city of Marrakech. It is befitting to organise this
                              annual meeting of SSATP in Marrakech at a time when the
                              Programme turns 30.

                              On behalf of the SSATP family, I thank the government of
                              the Kingdom of Morocco for hosting us and the hospitality
                              extended to us since our arrival.

                              This meeting is happening in a period when we are wit-
nessing significant changes in the development landscape in Africa and indeed the en-
tire world. We therefore have a unique opportunity to reflect on the implications of
these changes on the work of SSATP on the one hand and how SSATP could react to
these changes on the other.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let’s start with developments in regional integration, which is one of the pillars of
SSATP. As you know, regional integration is a major development strategy of Africa, and
in that regard the continent has embarked on the ambitious process of negotiating a
Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA). Just to put things in context, President Kagame
Report and recommendations for the AU reforms, put economic integration of our con-
tinent as one of the four areas of focus for the Union, including the CFTA, in line with
Agenda 2063. This is expected to boost intra-Africa trade which currently hovers around
12% of the continent’s total trade.

Africa will only reap the full benefits of the CFTA and regional integration in general if
the continent is physically connected. However, it is not enough to construct hard infra-
structure such as roads. This must be accompanied by the removal of all non-physical




                                                                                           43
barriers to transport and trade along transport corridors. SSATP’s work in trade and
transport facilitation is paramount in this regard.

Second, urbanization is another mega trend in Africa’s development landscape. This has
its advantages, including increased opportunities for Africans to improve their liveli-
hoods. However, lack of urban mobility may hinder access to these opportunities, there-
by leaving many urban dwellers behind. The SSATP pillar on urban mobility has an im-
portant role to play in ensuring that this does not happen.

Last but not the least, African countries have recently witnessed unprecedented eco-
nomic growth with many of them also experiencing growth in the middle class, culmi-
nating in a sharp rise in car ownership. This growth has been driven, in part, by the con-
struction of roads. If care is not taken, these positive developments could have unin-
tended consequences in the form of increased road crashes – leading to more deaths
and injuries on our roads. Road crashes also have economic implications and are esti-
mated to cost an equivalent of 1-2% of a country’s GDP which is roughly the same
amount that countries invested in the road sector. This suggests that investment in
roads is lost through road crashes, which is unacceptable.

The SSATP pillar on road safety has an important role to play in preventing this from
happening. We are aware that road safety is not often a priority in the political agenda of
most of our countries and this has to change. I am therefore happy that the SSATP will
explore ways to involve legislators in road safety discourse on the continent. The high
economic cost of crashes, in addition to social costs, should provide a strong incentive
for road safety advocacy.

We also know that proper road safety management depends on the availability of ro-
bust data. That is why SSATP and ECA are developing a minimum set of road safety indi-
cators for African countries to ensure comparability of data within countries and across
the continent. I encourage you all to support this important effort, which will go a long
way in ensuring evidence-based planning.

Distinguished participants,

SSATP’s work is also relevant to the global development agenda as it contributes to the
achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable transport in partic-
ular - including its economic, social and economic dimensions.

There is therefore no doubt that the Programme remains relevant and that, more than
ever before, it is needed to contribute in achieving Africa’s development agenda and in
cushioning the unintended impact of economic growth.




44
Let me conclude by calling on all partners to renew their commitment to the program
and to bring their collective knowledge and experience to bear on the planning and
implementation of SSATP’s activities. I thank you for your attention.

Distinguished Ministers,

Chair of the SSATP Executive Committee,

                                Program Manager of the SSATP,

                                Representatives of development partners,

                                Representatives of international organizations,

                                Your Excellencies,

                                Ladies and Gentlemen,

                                It is a genuine pleasure for me to address the distin-
                                guished participants in the General Assembly of the
Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP) and to welcome you to Morocco, a country of
hospitality and encounter.

I am especially pleased that the Assembly is meeting in Marrakesh, this important histor-
ic site, symbol of openness and African brotherhood.

I wish to convey the high esteem in which His Majesty King Mohammed VI holds Africa
in general and the SSATP Program in particular, a Program that aspires to be a forum for
discussion and the promotion of policies fostering efficient, safe, and sustainable
transport for the peoples of Africa. It was his desire that this SSATP General Assembly
should be held under his high patronage.

I am also pleased to be welcoming this important event shortly after Morocco rejoined
the African Union and I am certain that the ministers of transport and other transport
officials from fraternal African countries, the representatives of regional and continental
communities, and the representatives of financial institutions who have gathered here
will hold discussions on the concerns and problems associated with the transport sector,
which is a real engine for social and economic development in the countries of Africa.




                                                                                         47
Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Africa has major assets to offer. In the first place, its people constitute its wealth; the
population is young, growing rapidly, and is increasingly well educated. The continent is
also rich in potential for economic and social development: infrastructures, industrializa-
tion, social projects, a plethora of undertakings of major importance that are under way
or will soon be launched.

For all the above reasons, we are witnessing an unprecedented increase in interest in
Africa, which is seen as a very appealing alternative in terms of partnerships and eco-
nomic growth.

Given this set of circumstances, the path has been cleared for Africa to take its place in
inclusive development on a sustainable basis, provided that it can respond boldly to the
major challenges it is facing, particularly in the transport sector.

Indeed, the transport sector is a vital link in efforts to achieve the main goals relating to
the acceleration of the economic and social development process of our continent,
through facilitation of mobility and travel, development of domestic, regional, and in-
ternational trade, job creation, the reduction of regional disparities, the encouragement
of investment, and more competitive production systems.

From this perspective, the General Assembly of the SSATP Program is the appropriate
platform for discussions on and development of a Panafrican vision of sustainable de-
velopment. We therefore welcome the very pertinent choice made by the Annual Meet-
ing that preceded this Assembly of the theme “African Transport Policies, aligning with
Sustainable Development Goals.”

This theme, which is concerned with improving the sustainability of transport systems,
follows on the extremely useful discussion initiated in this very place last November, at
the 22nd Conference of the States Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (COP 22), a discussion that we hope will be continued in greater
depth through agreements, discussions, knowledge sharing, and constructive will.

The presence today in Marrakesh of more than a hundred prominent persons, including
many government officials and representatives of international organizations, testifies
to their commitment to this event and to its inspiring theme for the benefit of Africa.

Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,




48
It is a happy coincidence that this Assembly is taking place at the same time as the
observance of the thirtieth anniversary of the SSATP Program, on which Morocco relies
heavily in its efforts to establish a transport system that is reliable, safe, green, low-
carbon, and inclusive.

It is also a point of pride for Morocco that it is the first North African country to associate
itself with and to support the Program.

Accordingly, I wish to inform the participants in this Assembly of Morocco’s readiness to
contribute to the development of African transport infrastructures and services by shar-
ing strategic guidelines and experiences relating to the building of such infrastructures,
and reform of the transport sectors, with the aim of increasing the economic competi-
tiveness of our fraternal countries and promoting mobility and trade.

The Kingdom of Morocco is prompted to share these experiences because the last dec-
ade was a fundamental stage in the development of the transport sector, during which
Morocco witnessed continuous growth of infrastructure projects and an intensification
of efforts to reform and upgrade the various modes of transport in order to better serve
the country’s economic and social development.

Morocco continues to undertake major efforts to build modern infrastructure that facili-
tates trade at the local, regional, and international levels, which helps keep traffic mov-
ing smoothly and creates conditions for comfortable and safe travel by individuals and
the safe transport of freight. Morocco is also building local infrastructures with the aim
of reducing the isolation of people living in rural areas so as to provide them with access
to basic services and integrate them into the country’s economic fabric by helping them
share in the benefits of the dynamic processes occurring at the national level.

As far as reform of the transport sector is concerned, significant efforts have been made
to reduce restrictions on the sector’s services by encouraging the participation of private
operators, in addition to strengthening the relevant regulatory and statutory provisions
in order to ensure fair competition.

Your Excellencies,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my hope that the recommendations that emerge from the deliberations of this Gen-
eral Assembly will lead to the definition of a common and integrated vision of the
transport sector, a vision capable of strengthening the position of the African countries
vis-à-vis their partners and of generating socio-economic development that meets the
expectations of our peoples.




                                                                                            49
I firmly believe that the deliberations of this important Assembly will result in the adop-
tion of pragmatic approaches and suggestions and recommendations worthy of the
goals set in the SSATP Program. It is incumbent upon you, therefore, to consider the best
ways and means of implementing the Program’s Third Development Plan.

Such are the expectations that we must respond to, especially since our continent is
facing challenges that, for the most part, are linked to the acceleration and improve-
ment of economic integration and cohesion with the aim of addressing the continent’s
current fragmentation into many small-scale economies. This will stimulate economic
growth by facilitating trade and tourism, will improve transport services, mobility, and
accessibility, and, ultimately, will foster Africa’s integration into the world market.

Ladies and Gentlemen, allow me, on behalf of the host country, to welcome you once
again to your second homeland, Morocco.

May our deliberations be successful in the self-interest of the peoples of Africa.

                                   ***********

Ministers,

Distinguished members of the General Assembly,

Members of the SSATP Executive Committee,

                             Representatives of development partners,

                             Ladies and Gentlemen,

                             Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the two days of meet-
                             ings for discussions between African countries about the
                             three pillars of SSATP, namely, regional integration, urban
                             mobility, and road safety. My colleagues have informed me
                             about the quality of the presentations and discussions, and
                             of the recommendations resulting from the fruitful deliber-
ations to provide guidance for the efforts of countries and regional institutions to im-
prove the performance of the transport sector in Africa.

As the World Bank’s Regional Director for the Maghreb and Malta, but also on the basis
of my past experience in several countries of sub-Saharan Africa and with regional inte-
gration, I know that discussions of this kind are especially conducive to the sustained,
equitable, and harmonious development of the continent. From this point of view, Mo-
rocco has much to offer to the other African countries.

Morocco has made considerable efforts to improve its competitiveness and to be recog-
nized as a credible development partner. In 2015, trade between Morocco and the Euro-
pean Union countries involved imports worth EUR 18.2 billion and exports worth EUR
12.4 billion. This partnership has been reflected mostly in increased trade, but the need
to be competitive has had a much broader impact, going well beyond trade facilitation
alone. For example, as a result of the rapid growth rate of the urban population (2.1 per-
cent between 2004 and 2014, and an urbanization rate of 60.3 percent in 2014), the
Kingdom of Morocco realized that its towns and cities had to become more efficient if
the integrated development of the country was to be achieved. Particular attention has
also been paid to developing sustainable transport infrastructures and the quality of the
logistics and services chains. The preparation of the Green Logistics Strategy and the




                                                                                       51
efforts in the area of road safety are worthy of commendation. One sees here the influ-
ence of the three pillars of the SSATP Third Development Plan, i.e. integration and con-
nectivity, urban mobility, and road safety. However, in the area of road safety, the efforts
made have managed only to stave off any worsening of the situation. The implementa-
tion of the new road safety strategy and the start of operations of the new national
agency entrusted with an institutional mandate for this matter, which have recently
received support from the World Bank for the design stage, should give a new impetus
to efforts to improve the situation.

The Green Logistics Strategy is focused primarily on three major issues. The first is
strengthening institutions, public policies, and regulations relating to the development
of low-carbon transport modes or systems. The second is the development of multi-flow
logistics networks and parks in the Greater Casablanca area as a model project. The third
issue is the implementation of mitigation measures by investing in upgrades at logistical
parks as part of the Regional Logistics Plan for Greater Casablanca.

In the area of urban mobility, the World Bank has assisted the Government with urban
transport for Morocco, in particular, strengthening the capacity of institutions in the
sector for planning, carrying out, and monitoring urban transport services and infra-
structures and improving the service levels of urban transport. It should be noted that
Morocco is in the process of providing all cities in the Kingdom with an appropriate
planning tool under the “Urban Movement Plans.” This type of tool is perfectly aligned
with the goals of the SSATP urban transport and mobility pillar, and confirms the rele-
vance of cooperation in this field. I expect therefore that the Program will develop a set
of policies from which Morocco can draw inspiration, but which is also inspired by Mo-
rocco’s experience. Such synergy will make for greater effectiveness in developing effi-
cient, coherent, and sustainable policies and will make it possible to achieve results
more quickly.

We also provide ongoing support to Morocco in the area of trade facilitation through
analytical studies and the formulation of development policies. Thus, the recent Eco-
nomic Competitiveness Support Program includes trade facilitation as one of its three
priorities. I hope that SSATP, in partnership with Morocco, will provide other African
countries with an opportunity to draw lessons from this experience that can guide them
in defining their own policies in this field.

These two examples demonstrate the potential for discussion and cooperation that the
SSATP platform offers to the various partners and Program member countries. The Gen-
eral Assembly, which is meeting today, will be able to take stock of the progress made in
implementing the Program since its launch in May 2015, but primarily for the first year of




52
its implementation, which coincides with this calendar year. It also provides an oppor-
tunity to review the implementation forecasts for each of the pillars for the period up to
the Program’s scheduled conclusion at the end of 2018.

The countries and partners have placed great hopes in this Program. In view of the mas-
sive participation here (29 countries, AU, 5 regional economic communities, 11 multilat-
eral or bilateral financial institutions, and 8 private organizations and professional asso-
ciations), I am reassured with regard to the implementation of the Program and confi-
dent that its results will live up to the stakeholders’ expectations.

I wish you complete success in your deliberations and thank you for your kind attention.

bust data. That is why SSATP and ECA are developing a minimum set of road safety indi-
cators for African countries to ensure comparability of data within countries and across
the continent. I encourage you all to support this important effort, which will go a long
way in ensuring evidence-based planning.

Distinguished participants,

SSATP’s work is also relevant to the global development agenda as it contributes to the
achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable transport in partic-
ular – including its economic, social and economic dimensions.

There is therefore no doubt that the Programme remains relevant and that, more than
ever before, it is needed to contribute in achieving Africa’s development agenda and in
cushioning the unintended impact of economic growth.




56
Let me conclude by calling on all partners to renew their commitment to the program
and to bring their collective knowledge and experience to bear on the planning and
implementation of SSATP’s activities.

I thank you for your attention.




                                                                                57

 Opening Statement at the SSATP General Assembly by, Mr. Paolo Ciccarelli, Head of Unit -
                     Water, Infrastructures and Cities, European Commission,
                              and Representative of SSATP Donors
                                       February 23rd, 2017

                                      ***********

Honorable Minister(s),

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and gentlemen,

                                  I t is a great pleasure to make this address on behalf of the
                                  European Commission and other financing partners to
                                  the Africa Transport Program - SSATP. These are Switzer-
                                  land, France and the African Development Bank

                                  Let me start by posing a fundamental question: did we
                                  succeed in making the SSATP "fit for purpose" to tackle
                                  the complex challenges the transport sector is confronted
                                  with?

                                  My answer is indeed a clear "Yes" and I am pleased to
                                  elaborate on this in the next minutes.

                                  The Agenda 2030 calls for an integrated approach to
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and orients cooperation towards people,
planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.

The Climate Change agenda calls transport to decarbonize, to become resilient and en-
vironmentally friendly.

The social dimension of transport urges transport to boost road safety and consequently
reduce fatalities.

Cities are challenged by an ever growing urbanization pressure that calls amongst oth-
ers for sustainable urban mobility solutions and affordable public transport for all, par-
ticularly the vulnerable.

Transport needs to contribute to job creation and perspectives for the Youth if we want
to tackle the root causes for migration in the long-term.

Honorable Minister(s), Mr Chairman,




                                                                                            59
Those evolving challenges can no longer be side-lined and have to be prominently
addressed. But, on the other side, existing challenges do not disappear and continue to
co-exist.

Let me recall the most important ones. There is most and foremost:

The need to bridge the infrastructure financing gap by improving transport planning &
management and attracting the private sector;

The need to continue corridor development along PIDA orientations;

The need to tackle sector inefficiencies through governance measures that boost trade
and transport facilitation;

The need to build institutional capacity;

The need for enhanced project preparation and prioritization and the still prevailing
maintenance challenges to preserve investments.

Taking both strands into account for an integrated transport response framework that
guides our SSATP DP3, which key conclusions can we derive?

The first is that we can no longer do "business as usual" in a challenged and more com-
plex transport cooperation framework.

The second is that we are tasked to reconcile the existing with the evolving transport
challenges within a social, economic and environmental sustainable approach.

The third is that we have to move away from sectoral silo thinking and tackle transport
challenges within a systematic, integrated and transformative approach in response to
the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2030.

Honorable Minister(s), Mr Chairman,

To summarize, affordable, efficient and safe transport is vital for the economic and social
integration of the African continent, and to the integration of its regions and countries.
Trade and economic growth in all sectors depend on sustainable transport infrastructure
and services and, in the same way, transport is a lifeline for people in urban and rural
area, providing access to jobs, health services, education and other amenities.

Against the backdrop of my previous elaborations, I therefore conclude that we have
achieved to make SSATP 3rd Development Programme - DP3 "fit-for purpose" by focus-
ing on the 3 pillars "regional integration, connectivity and cohesion", "urban transport
and mobility" and "road safety".

By doing so, SSATP DP3 provides an integrated response framework to the targets of




60
SDG3 regarding injuries from road traffic, SDG9 regarding the provision of quality, relia-
ble, sustainable and resilient regional and trans-boundary infrastructure and SDG11 on
cities and the provision of providing safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable urban
transport systems for all.

Not only that we respond to specific SDGs, the orientation of SSATP is well in accordance
and in support of the broader development agendas of the G20, the G7, the aspirations
of the African Agenda 2063 and the 2016 proposal on the New European Consensus
on Development.

Honorable Minister(s), Mr Chairman,

Since our last annual general meeting in Nairobi in 2014, more than 2 years have passed.

With DP2 ending in March 2015 and the subsequent engagement into DP3 of some 11,6
million Euro, the years 2015 and 2016 were understood as transitional period for the
SSATP to re-orient and to get new project activities “up and running”.

As from 2017, SSATP operations will have to move to its full swing and enter into full
operations in order to demonstrate that SSATP is capable to deliver along its objectives.

Important will be to boost the reach-out of the SSATP 3 pillar activities and to ensure
complementarity with other ongoing cooperation initiatives and activities in domains of
regional integration/interconnectivity, road safety and urban mobility.

In this context, please allow me to particularly highlight the need for SSATP to contrib-
ute to the stimulation of investment dialogue to scale-up the needed transport invest-
ments, especially from the private sector. Through the design of the three pillars, it is my
view that such endeavor is achievable.

Secondly, I would like to flag the growing role of ICT as an enabler in transport infra-
structure which will have to be taken into account. This is of particular importance for
smart corridor development and urban mobility systems as it raises concerns such as
traffic and freight management.

Needless to say that motivation, commitment and ownership is the “fuel” to sustainably
drive the SSATP engine for a long-lasting success. The support given by African govern-
ments and authorities to the full achievement of the DP3 objectives will be of para-
mount importance. We will have to ensure that high level senior officials of respective
transport institutions take prominent roles since they are at the centre of gravity of poli-
cy making, dialogue and decision-making and provide the interface to the SSATP work
program, activities and results.

Honorable Minister(s), Mr Chairman,




                                                                                         61
Under this assumption, this day, we will work together, discussing and addressing on
one side the global emerging issues under DP3 and its response framework, including
climate change and governance, and on the other side the specific challenges the
transport sector is facing: how to accelerate regional integration, how to harmonize the
legislative and regulatory framework to reduce barriers to regional and international
trade, how to respond to the needs of land-locked countries, how to ensure urban mo-
bility and rural accessibility, how to address road safety.

Our common objective is to boost the implementation of DP3, to increase the role of
SSATP at continental level and to ensure that SSATP DP will make the difference.

I thank you for your attention.

           Director of Infrastructure and Energy of the African Union Commission
                                    February 23rd, 2017
                                    ***********

Honorable, Ministers,

Mr. Stephen KARINGI, Distinguished Chairman of the SSATP Board;

Mr. Ibou Diouf, SSATP Program Manager

Distinguished representatives of African RECs and Specialized Institutions

                               Distinguished representatives of International partner
                               organizations

                               Invited Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen

                               All Protocols observed:

                               It is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to
                               bring you the message of the African Union (AU) as well as
                               participate effectively in this important meeting. As you
                               are aware, in January this year, the AU passed yet another
                               milestone with a notable change of guard. The AU Assem-
                               bly at its 28th Ordinary Session elected a new Chairperson
and Deputy Chairperson of the Commission (AUC) as well as Commissioners responsible
for its various portfolios. The new Commission will assume duty by mid-March this year
i.e. next month. I may as well inform you that I, myself, am also a new arrival at the AUC
having just taken the reins of office in October last year (2016).

This, however, should not be a cause of concern. The new leadership including us all we
have come to the AUC with a vast wealth of relevant technical experience from our pre-
vious occupations. Moreover, the AUC itself maintains a chest of institutional memory
that ensures smooth continuity in the implementation of its responsibilities in the short,
medium and long terms.

In that context, I am well aware that the African Transport Policy Program (SSATP) is one
of the long-lasting endeavors that have left a huge footprint on the transformation of
the transport sector in Africa. This is a Programme which has overseen such useful re-
forms as establishment of autonomous road agencies and dedicated road maintenance
funds through its Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI) whose implementation started in




                                                                                            63
the early 1990s. These are among the set of policy initiatives that helped Africa to im-
prove the road maintenance function quite substantively and paved the way for accel-
erated road construction and upgrading in a number of states.

Furthermore, we duly note instrumental role that SSATP continues to play in promoting
and facilitating improvements in transport facilitation, rural transport, urban mobility
and road safety. Again, this role is clearly outlined and underscored in the 2014-2018
Development Plan of SSATP i.e. SSATP-DP3 which is structured around the three themat-
ic clusters: 1) Regional Integration, Connectivity and Cohesion; 2) Urban Mobility and
Accessibility; and 3) Road Safety.

Honorable Minister,

Mr. Chairman

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The AUC has been privileged to collaborate with SSATP in preparing key transport policy
documents for Africa. These are:

1. The Intergovernmental Agreement on Road Standards and Norms for Trans-African
Highways (TAH) (adopted by the AU Assembly in June 2014); and

2. The African Road Safety Charter (adopted by the AU Assembly in January 2016).

The two documents which were elaborated with the financial and technical support of
the World Bank through the SSATP are now being disseminated through regional work-
shops organized with the financial support of the EU as part of the Africa-EU partnership
on infrastructure. At this point, I would like, on behalf of the AU, to deeply thank all our
partners for this very substantial contribution to Africa’s socio-economic development.

The EU is also supporting us in our endeavor to transform all major trade corridors of
Africa into SMART corridors. To that end, we have started with two (2) pilot corridors
which are: (i) the North South Corridor from the port of Durban in South Africa to Lu-
bumbashi in DRC; and (ii) the Dar es Salaam Corridor from the port of Dar es Salaam in
Tanzania and also to Lubumbashi. As you would note, this activity is an intervention that
is well-aligned with the first thematic cluster of the SSATP-DP3: (Regional Integration,
Connectivity and Cohesion).

I would, therefore, like to thank the SSATP for inviting the AUC and facilitating our partic-
ipation in this meeting. Certainly, we would need to extend and strengthen this collabo-
ration which is essential for ensuring that these and other key initiatives for improving
the transport sector in Africa are effectively implemented across the entire continent.




64
We very are happy that SSATP has at last addressed our particular concerns by extend-
ing the scope of its coverage to the entire continent and locating its office in Kenya,
Africa. The basic philosophy of the African Union is that Africa is one; indivisible conti-
nent. Also, the continent should serve as a launching platform for all its important initia-
tives. Most notable, whether by chance or design, the decision to hold this meeting in
Morocco at this point in time following the AU Assembly decision about the country, is
very symbolic of the commitment of the SSATP to work with all of Africa. We commend
this new perspective.

Let me end here by wishing this meeting successful deliberations and solid outcomes.

Thank you for your kind attention.




                                                                                              65

Distinguished Ministers,

Chair of the SSATP Executive Committee,

                              Program Manager of the SSATP,

                              Representatives of development partners,

                              Representatives of international organizations,

                              Your Excellencies,

                              Ladies and Gentlemen,

                              It is once again a pleasure for me to address you at this
                              closing ceremony of the SSATP’s Annual Meeting, and we
are honored that you selected Marrakesh to host this Meeting.

As you could tell, this meeting had a very full and varied agenda, with four days of delib-
erations that paved the way for the finalization and adoption of the implementation
plan for the SSATP’s Third Development Plan.

I hope that this meeting, which focused on the issue of the sustainability of transport
systems in Africa, provided an appropriate opportunity for participants to not only make
statements and share their viewpoints and experiences, but also to put forward sugges-
tions and recommendations.

It is also my hope that the resolutions adopted at this Assembly, which coincided with
the observance of the 30th anniversary of the SSATP, will help refocus its management
and its intervention mechanisms, with a view to more effective implementation of the
Third Development Plan of this critical tool – the SSATP.

I would like to first thank our donors for their participation in this meeting and for their
unconditional support, both of which bode well for the SSATP and will help this Program
become more relevant, in terms of actions and initiatives to be undertaken in the coun-
tries and regions in which we operate.

On behalf of us all, I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr. Ibou DIOUF, the
SSATP Program Manager, and his team, who made every effort to ensure the success of




                                                                                            67
this important event.

Honorable guests,

Lastly, I would like to express my appreciation to all the delegates for their active partici-
pation in this Annual Meeting of the SSATP, and I hope that you all enjoyed your stay
in Morocco.

This General Assembly of the Africa Transport Policy Program is hereby adjourned.

Thank you for your kind attention.
