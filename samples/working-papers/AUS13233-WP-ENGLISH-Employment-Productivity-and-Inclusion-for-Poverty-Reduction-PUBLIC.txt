Azedine Ouerghi played a strategic role for the development of this activity and provided contributions and
advice at many steps along the way. Comments received at concept note stage and during report preparation
from Kathleen Beegle, Yoonyoung Cho, Mary C. Hallward-Driemeier, Ejaz Syed Ghani, and Yannick Saleman are
thankfully acknowledged. The team is also grateful to Nabil Chaherli, Cassandra Colbert, Jacques Morisset, and
Volker Treichel for their contributions and advice, as well as to Ousmane Diagana, Deon Filmer, Pierre Laporte,
Stefano Paternostro, Dena Ringold, and Katrina Sharkey for strategic guidance.
The jobs diagnostic report is part of a broad World Bank analytical engagement on the jobs agenda in Côte d’Ivo-
ire between 2013 and 2017, which included technical support to employment surveys, impact evaluation of
selected employment interventions, analysis of new source of employment data, as well as facilitation of policy
dialogue on employment with government counterparts. The jobs agenda activity informed the Systematic
Country Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Côte d’Ivoire, as well as provided the
basis for an Economic Update on the topic of employment published in December 2015. At an operational
level, engagement on the jobs agenda informed the scope and design of the additional ﬁnancing for the Youth
Employment and Skills Development project (Projet Emploi Jeune et Développement des Compétences, PEJEDEC).
The jobs diagnostic report has been shaped by ongoing dialogue on employment policy, strategy, and programs
with Ivorian authorities, including (among other activities) a workshop in June 2013, internal consultations
with the World Bank Group country team in February 2015, SCD dissemination on employment and skills in
May 2015, technical consultations on preliminary results from this report in February 2016, and high-level dis-
cussions on the ﬁnal report in November 2016. The many contributions from local counterparts during ongoing
policy dialogue on the topic of employment are gratefully acknowledged.
The team is particularly grateful to BCP-Emploi (Bureau de Coordination des Programmes Emploi) and to members
of the steering and technical committees of the national employment surveys. Micro data from employment and
household surveys were obtained through collaborations with the Ministry of Social Protection and Employment,
the Ministry of Youth Promotion, Youth Employment and Civil Service, as well as the National Statistical Institute
(INS). Micro data on apprenticeship providers are based on an ongoing impact evaluation of the PEJEDEC,
undertaken jointly with BCP-Emploi and AGEFOP (Agence Nationale de la Formation Professionnelle). INS, and
in particular its Centrale des Bilans team, was very helpful in providing access to the anonymized ﬁrm census
panel ﬁrm used in Chapter 5, which is gratefully acknowledged.
The Côte d’Ivoire jobs diagnostic builds on the activity on “Jobs and Job Creation in fragile and conﬂict states
(FCS) in Sub-Saharan Africa” supported by Korea Trust Fund (KTF) for Economic and Peacebuilding Transitions
(P147849), which funded technical support to employment survey, and as such allowed to jump-start comple-
mentary analysis on the broader jobs assessment report, in particular by supporting the development of materials
for Chapters 1, 4, and 6. The consolidation of complementary data on agriculture and ﬁrms used in Chapters 3
and 5 has been made possible through a grant from the World Bank’s Jobs Umbrella Trust Fund, which is sup-
ported by the Department for International Development/UK AID, and the Governments of Norway, Germany,
Austria, the Austrian Development Agency, and the Swedish Development Agency (SIDA).

OVERVIEW AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
After economic growth until the mid-1990s, Côte d’Ivoire entered a decade of political and economic
crises during the 2000s. Uprising and conﬂicts between 2002 and 2004 left the country divided until the
Ouagadougou Political Agreement in 2007, with severe consequences for the economy, human capital, gov-
ernance, and social cohesion. Presidential elections held in 2010 led to a post-electoral crisis until April 2011,
and saw the economy contract by 4.7 percent in 2011. The decade of crisis took a heavy toll on the domestic
economy and living standards, with gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in 2012 more than 10 percent
below its mid-1990s peak (Figures 1 and 2).
Since mid-2011, the country has regained political stability and has started to tap its considerable
social and economic potential again, eying to become an emerging economy by 2020. Economic
recovery is proceeding at a rapid and sustained speed and Côte d’Ivoire is now completing its transition away
from a post-conﬂict environment to one of political and economic stability. The country has embarked on an
ambitious program of reforms and investments aimed at leveraging its considerable endowments of human
capital, natural resources, and infrastructure to spur robust, broad-based, and sustainable economic growth.
Since the end of the post-election crisis in 2011, economic growth has resumed through sound macroeconomic
management combined with public and private investments. The GDP growth rate was 10.7, 8.7, and 8.0
percent, in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.
At the same time, Côte d’Ivoire is undergoing rapid demographic changes. Like other Sub-Saharan
African countries, demographic growth in Côte d’Ivoire creates a signiﬁcant youth bulge (Figure 3). In 2005,
the youth population was estimated at 5.9 million. Only 10 years later, it increased to approximately 7.3 million.
The youth bulge is expected to continue for the next decades, reaching 9.1 million in 2025 and 11.3 million
in 2035.1 Overall, between 350,000 and 400,000 young people are estimated to join the working-age popu-
lation each year (AGEPE and INS, 2014). This new workforce brings an opportunity for the country to beneﬁt
from a demographic dividend. At the same time, without better employment opportunities, many fear that a
jeunesse désoeuvrée may present a risk for the country.

       The estimates are from the United Nations (UN) population estimates (World Population Prospects: The 2012 Revision). The 2014 popu-
       lation census in Côte d’Ivoire indicates that the total population is estimated at 22,671,331 of which 36.2 percent are between 15 and 34
       years old (see: http://www.plan.gouv.ci/accueil.php?page=actu&id=242).

The issue of employment, and in particular youth employment, is a top policy priority in Côte d’Ivoire.
Seen through the lens of the World Development Report (WDR) 2013 Jobs (World Bank, 2012), jobs drive devel-
opment by supporting living standards, contributing to productivity, and building social cohesion. The Systematic
Country Diagnostic for Côte d’Ivoire identiﬁes the creation of better jobs as one of the main pathways to reduce
poverty and a source of sustainable growth (World Bank, 2015). The 2012–2015 national employment strategy
for Côte d’Ivoire (République de Côte d’Ivoire, 2012) seeks to expand employment opportunities for decent
work to contribute to poverty reduction. It is based on three pillars: (a) support to private enterprises to foster
growth and job creation, (b) investment in human capital and labor productivity, and (c) rationalizing gover-
nance of employment policy. A follow-up strategy note was issued in 2013 to outline how sectoral strategies,
structural measures, speciﬁc programs, and business climate improvements could lead to employment creation.
These strategic documents link to an initially announced presidential objective of creating 200,000 jobs per year
between 2012 and 2015. A new strategy for 2016–2020 is being ﬁnalized.
The objective of this Côte d’Ivoire jobs diagnostic is to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis and
solid evidence-base of employment challenges and opportunities in Côte d’Ivoire to inform strategies
and policy actions. The report has six chapters. This ﬁrst chapter presents an in-depth analysis of employment
patterns and trends in Côte d’Ivoire, drawing on a wide range of data, including national employment and
household surveys collected by the government (Premand and Tien, 2017a). Chapter 2 then analyzes the relative
potential of the various sectors of employment for inclusive and productive employment within Côte d’Ivoire’s
ongoing structural transformation (Christiaensen and Lawin, 2017a). Chapter 3 discusses how agriculture’s
contribution to Côte d’Ivoire’s jobs agenda can be maximized (Christiaensen and Lawin, 2017b). Chapter 4 elab-
orates on the challenge of raising productivity in nonagricultural self-employment, which is set to become the

major form of employment in the coming decade, while the formal wage sector continues to expand (Premand
and Tien, 2017b). The trends and perspectives for developing wage employment in formal ﬁrms are further
discussed in Chapter 5 (Hebous and Tran, 2017). With skills identiﬁed as a cross-cutting constraint, Chapter 6
assesses the role of education, skills and training for making Côte d’Ivoire’s workforce more competitive (Feda
and Ralston, 2017). The key insights and messages of the report are summarized in this overview.
Recent employment data for Côte d’Ivoire reveals some disconnect between the employment situ-
ation and the main focus of prevalent policy actions. While the employment strategy acknowledges the
broad scope of the employment challenge, including in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment where
most people are employed, the issues of reducing unemployment and creating jobs are used to drive many policy
actions on employment. The implementation of concrete actions on employment often tends to focus on formal
jobs, including with an emphasis on the numbers of jobs created and reducing unemployment. Yet unemploy-
ment is relatively low and most of the labor force is self-employed, which means that they are creating jobs for
themselves and in fact account for most ‘new jobs’ in the economy. While growing the modern wage sector
is necessary in the long term, projections of the future composition of employment show that the low base of
wage employment combined with rapid demographic growth implies that even strong growth of that sector
would only absorb a small share of the population over the next decade. The poor, who have less education and
often live in rural areas, have particularly limited opportunities to access (formal) wage jobs.
A broader jobs strategy that centers on ‘better jobs’ and the issue of ‘productive inclusion’ for the poor,
women, and rural populations could address more directly the central challenges of reducing poverty and
boosting shared prosperity in the short to medium term. In line with recent data from Côte d’Ivoire, evidence
from the 2013 WDR on Jobs, and the Regional Report on Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa (Filmer et al.,
2014), a more inclusive jobs strategy would also have as a core objective to improve earnings and quality of employ-
ment across all occupations, including in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment where the majority of the
population will remain employed for the foreseeable future. As such, this report invites to expand policy discussions
on employment from a focus on the number of jobs and unemployment to a broader attention to the quality,
inclusiveness, and productivity of jobs. This would include sharpening the poverty lens in employment policies.

Better jobs providing higher earnings is the key employment challenge for the near future
Analysis of recent data on the employment proﬁle in Côte d’Ivoire shows that the biggest employment
challenge relates to the quality, inclusiveness, and productivity of jobs. Figure 4 provides the breakdown
of the employment status of the working-age population by age. As youths complete their school-to-work transi-
tion, their labor-force participation increases steadily, to reach over 80 percent by age 24 and over 95 percent by
age 34. Most youths transition into the labor force by working in agricultural self-employment and nonagricultural

wage employment, as well as unemployment. Still, these phenomena are much less common than self-employment.
A major challenge stems from the high concentration of employment in low-productivity occupations
in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment. Figure 5 provides an overall picture of the working-age
population in Côte d’Ivoire. As of February 2014, unemployment affects 6.7 percent of individuals in the labor
force, and is more prevalent among the more educated in urban areas. A limited number of individuals hold
nonagricultural wage jobs (19.9 percent of the employed population), and less than half of them have formal
wage jobs, which are concentrated among the more educated in urban areas. In contrast, the majority of indi-
viduals are employed in agricultural or nonagricultural self-employment (47.5 percent, respectively 29.7 percent
of the employed population). Almost all the poor and individuals living in rural areas work in these self-employed
occupations. On average, self-employment tends to have relatively low-productivity and earnings, although there
are also substantial variations and opportunities for growth in earnings within these sectors.
Analysis of recent trends shows that the low-quality and low-earning jobs are largely a structural issue.
There are some indications that the share of nonagricultural self-employment has increased over the period of the
crisis, while the share of the formal wage employment in the economy decreased. However, despite these vari-
ations, the overall structure of employment has remained relatively stable. The structural transformation process
is taking place in Côte d’Ivoire, but in presence of very strong demographic changes. In this context, future fore-
casts of the employment composition show that the structure of employment is likely to remain relatively stable
till 2025, in the sense that most individuals are projected to remain employed in agricultural and nonagricultural
self-employment, even under scenarios of very high growth in the service or industry sectors. Nonagricultural
self-employment in services may in fact well become the most common type of employment within a decade.

There is substantial scope for labor productivity gains within the sectors where the poor work
Increasing earnings can be done by raising intrasectoral labor productivity and by facilitating labor
transitions across sectors (structural transformation). Broadly speaking, earnings of the poorer and more
marginalized segments of society can be increased either by increasing productivity within the sectors where the
poor currently work (mostly in agriculture and nonagricultural self-employment) and where they are located (mostly
in rural areas), or by facilitating transitions to sectors where labor productivity is higher. Agricultural and informal
activities are often seen as less productive, and nonagricultural and formal activities as more productive. Fostering
intrasector productivity and facilitating movements across sectors require somewhat different approaches.

What is the right balance between these different policy approaches for Côte  d’Ivoire today?
Historically, as countries developed, the share of labor in agriculture decreased, ﬁrst counterbalanced by a cor-
responding increase in nonagricultural self-employment, and over a longer period also formal wage employment.
Similar patterns of structural and occupational transformation have started to take place in Côte d’Ivoire and are
expected to continue over the next decade. These transformations usually also come along with urbanization,
through rural-urban migration as well as in situ urbanization of rural centers, and formalization. How much
movement between sectors, across space, and toward more formal forms of employment can and should thus
be strived for today, especially when taking inclusive employment as the overarching objective?
It may appear that there is a ‘Jobs Paradox’ in agriculture. As households get richer, the demand for food as
a share of total spending goes down and so does employment in agriculture. On the supply side, labor is generally
found to be more productive outside agriculture than in it. These large productivity gaps at the initial stages of
development and the subsequent convergence process suggest that a lot can be gained from moving people out of
agriculture. So, what can then be the contribution of agriculture to a country’s jobs agenda, besides releasing labor?
Both the traditional labor supply and demand side concerns regarding agriculture’s jobs potential come
with important caveats. On the supply side, recent micro evidence adjusting labor efforts for differences in
human capital and time use obtained from household surveys indicates that the commonly reported unadjusted
agricultural productivity gap from the national accounts2 is exaggerated, and more in the order of a factor 2 as
opposed to 6 (as observed from the national accounts). This implies that the gains from intersectoral movement are
substantially less than commonly purported, and, with a signiﬁcant part of the gap explained by underemployment
in agriculture, that agriculture is not intrinsically less productive. These observations also hold for Côte d’Ivoire.
Large heterogeneity in agricultural labor productivity further points to important opportunities for earnings gains
within agriculture (Figure 6). Finally, income generation in agriculture has been convincingly shown to be more
poverty reducing, although agricultural policies and initial conditions (such as equal land distribution) matter to
ensure that growth in the agricultural sector does promote inclusive employment and poverty reduction. Raising
agricultural labor productivity thus emerges as an important other policy entry point to increase earnings, in
addition to removal of impediments to migration and increasing productivity outside agriculture.
On the demand side, global demand for Côte d’Ivoire’s agricultural export commodities and dietary
transformation at home following income growth and urbanization open up opportunities for adding
new productive jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. In Côte d’Ivoire the value of agricultural
exports has been expanding rapidly over the past years. Given the predominance of smallholder and outgrower

production model for most cash crops, many can beneﬁt from the expansion of export crops. At the same time,
part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture following the lower (relative) demand for staples as incomes
rise can also be offset by catering to the increasing demand for higher-value and processed agricultural products
as countries get richer. This can create new jobs on the farm, but increasingly also off farm, in the expanding
agricultural value chains and agribusiness. It is countries that complement a successful structural transformation
(declining share of agriculture in the economy as they develop) with a successful agricultural transformation
(declining share of staples in agricultural value added) which experience the fastest decline in (rural) poverty.
Despite good prospects for new jobs and better earnings within agriculture, over time, most jobs will
be generated outside agriculture. It is often youth that is inclined to leave agriculture ﬁrst and in greater
numbers. So far, the pace of youth’s exit out of agriculture has been in line with Côte d’Ivoire’s level of devel-
opment. An important share of the demand for nonagricultural products and services and thus nonagricultural
employment, especially for the poorer segments of society, will come from broad-based agricultural growth
in the rural hinterlands (and less so from formal wage employment in modern manufacturing). In fact, even
during the fast-growth period in the years after the post-electoral crisis, the majority of new ‘jobs’ generated
were in self-employment (most of which were in agriculture on family farms). Only a minority of new jobs were
wage jobs (mostly still informal). In this sense, many of the new jobs for youths will also be indirectly linked to
agriculture and agribusiness. Labor productivity increases across the agricultural subsectors will thus be equally
necessary to keep agriculture competitive with other nonagricultural sectors, so as to retain youth, reap the
job opportunities that growth in domestic and external demand for agricultural products presents, and also to
pace the transition of labor out of agriculture and foster demand for nonagricultural products and nonfarm
employment generation.
The development of rural areas and secondary towns in Côte d’Ivoire is further called for to produc-
tively absorb labor exiting agriculture. About four in ﬁve rural workers are engaged in agriculture, which
is consistent with the ratios observed in other countries at similar levels of development. Yet only a very small
(and relatively smaller) share of the rural population (4 percent) holds nonagricultural wage jobs, pointing to
limited employment opportunities in the rural economy, and consistent with the high degree of urbanization
and urban concentration in Côte d’Ivoire. Households also tend to be more specialized, either in agriculture
or in nonagricultural self-employment. In this context, nearby access to off-farm self- and wage employment
in the rural economy and secondary towns is especially important for better and more inclusive employment.
How much movement between the main employment types can realistically be expected in
Côte d’Ivoire? Projections suggest a continuing diminution of the share of labor in agriculture, which is mostly
counterbalanced by an increase in nonagricultural self-employment. Even by taking a rather pessimistic outlook
on agricultural growth, by 2025, wage employment is still projected to remain the smallest employment cat-
egory compared to agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment. In fact, the projections highlight that
nonagricultural self-employment is likely to become the main source of employment by 2025. Faster growth in
agriculture, reﬂecting productivity gains within the sector, would slow the exit of labor from agriculture and its
entry into nonagricultural self-employment.
In sum, to address the employment challenge of promoting productive inclusion in Côte d’Ivoire, a
three-pronged approach is needed. First, with approximately two-thirds of Côte d’Ivoire’s poor living in rural
areas and almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, modernizing
and raising labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and inclusive employment
generation in Côte d’Ivoire. Second, expanding productive employment opportunities off the farm will be equally
important. Off-farm employment generation will be more inclusive and poverty reducing when it happens nearby.
The poor are concentrated in the rural economies and secondary towns, drawing attention to the challenge of
Côte d’Ivoire’s high rate of urban concentration and its corresponding low rate of rural off-farm wage employ-
ment. Expanding productive employment opportunities off the farm will require not only accelerating jobs creation
in formal ﬁrms, but also putting in place policies to raise productivity in nonagricultural self-employment in the
informal sector, while expansion of the formal sector continues. Finally, the occupational transformation typically
lags the economic transformation, and social protection will be needed for those unable to seize opportunities

and access more productive employment opportunities. An in-depth discussion of social protection policies falls
beyond the scope of the report, though it remains a key part of a comprehensive approach to the jobs issue.

Maximizing agriculture’s contribution to the jobs agenda
Increasing agricultural labor productivity is key to the jobs agenda in Côte d’Ivoire. It plays to the
country’s comparative advantage, it raises earnings of the poor directly, and it helps generate demand for
nonagricultural goods and services and thus off-farm employment. Given the large share of employment in
agriculture, even fast growth of urban wage jobs will not sufﬁce to absorb all new entrants in the working-age
population. Nonetheless, not all agricultural strategies perform equally at generating inclusive employment.
Export crops make up about a quarter of total agricultural output, with food crops making up the
rest (75 percent). There is a fair degree of market orientation in agriculture in Côte d’Ivoire. Four in ﬁve
smallholders sell at least some of their output, with one in ﬁve reporting that they sell their complete harvest.
Farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively well endowed with land. Given high land/labor ratios
and little mechanization, hiring labor is common, often migrant labor to make up for family labor shortages.
Use of non-family labor is especially high on cotton, rice, and cashew (grown in the north), the production of
which has been expanding over the past 5 years.
The overall objectives of an ‘Agriculture for Jobs Agenda’ would be to enhance agricultural produc-
tivity, to diversify, and to add value. In recent years, a beginning has been made on each of these fronts.
Among staple crops, progress has been especially noticeable for rice. Yield growth was negative however among
other staple crops (such as roots and tubers). It reﬂects a longstanding neglect of staple crops in favor of cash
crops and presents an area of attention, also in light of the higher poverty rates among food crop growers.
Among cash crops, yield growth has also been revived, especially among cotton and cashew, indicating diver-
siﬁcation beyond cocoa, though the production of coffee and pineapples declined.
Strong productivity growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversiﬁed the cash crop mix, but there has
been no real diversiﬁcation yet into high-value agricultural products. The expansion of rice, cotton, and
cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective (Figure 7). Rice emerges as one of the most labor-in-
tensive crops in Côte d’Ivoire. Cotton and cashew producers make most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops
are grown widely in the north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds
promise for inclusive employment. An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally (especially in
the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns. Vegetable pro-
duction is also highly labor intensive, but its potential has so far not been fully exploited. Overall, these trends
are promising, but scope for improvement remains.

Large heterogeneity in net returns per hectare across crops suggests substantial scope for productivity
gains. The net value of production per hectare for farmers producing at the 75th percentile is typically three to four
times higher than the net value of production per hectare for farmers producing at the 25th percentile. Controlling
for labor inputs and other factors, results also suggest substantial scope for productivity gains from increased use
of modern inputs. Nonetheless, inorganic fertilizer use is low and its proﬁtability deserves further investigation.
But the use of agrochemicals is relatively higher, raising concerns about health hazards and job quality.
An analysis of the rice value chain highlights challenges and opportunities for growth both among
producers and further down the value chain, and echoes similar challenges encountered along other
value chains. Stakeholders in the rice value chain (producers, processors, input providers, storage, and traders)
are generally poorly endowed with productive resources, under-equipped, poorly trained, and poorly organized
and coordinated. Among processors, both the lack of sufﬁcient supply of rice and cost and shortage of electricity
are also frequently mentioned as major constraints. This holds back investment and quality processing needed to
compete with imports. There is little optimal use of agricultural inputs and water control. As a result, producer
gross margin per hectare is often low and highly variable across sites and seasons. The overall lack of ﬁnancial
depth in the chain, with each actor facing credit constraints and largely ﬁnancing him/herself, is combined with
poor coordination and contractual arrangements among the different actors. Better coordination among and
organization in the chain is needed, a challenge the National Rice Development Strategy is working on.
Several policy entry points can be considered to maximize agriculture’s contribution to the jobs agenda
in Côte d’Ivoire. First, continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews
could be complemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Second,
smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation, in particular as there are no
signs that larger farmers in Côte d’Ivoire are more efﬁcient than smaller ones. There is substantial scope for mod-
ernization to take place in smallholder agriculture, including through mechanization. Third, Côte d’Ivoire would
need strong additional investments in agricultural research and development, including on staple crops. Fourth,
low educational levels and poor training among actors in agricultural value chains hold technological innovation
back. Rehabilitating the national agricultural education and training centers could contribute to leverage gains
in access to primary education and improve supply of agricultural knowledge and training opportunities. Finally,
improving rural land tenure security and overcoming ﬁnancing constraints will continue to be critical to catalyze
agricultural investment and raise productivity both for farmers and agribusinesses. This will often require a more
integrated value chain approach where the government can play an important coordinating role.

Raising productivity in nonagricultural self-employment through a more supportive business environment
Despite constituting a sizable share of jobs in Côte d’Ivoire, nonagricultural self-employment remains
largely unaddressed in employment strategies. In 2014, nonagricultural self-employment in microenterprises
accounted for 29.7 percent of employment in the country, compared to 47.5 percent in agriculture and 19.9
percent in wage jobs. Projections of the future employment proﬁle in Côte d’Ivoire indicate that nonagricultural
self-employment is likely to become the largest employment category by 2025. Yet policy strategies for the sector
in the country are limited, and often focused on formalization. A clearer and more comprehensive strategy to
create a more supportive business environment and raise productivity in the sector would be directly relevant to
ensure better employment opportunities as well as to contribute to poverty reduction and productive inclusion.
Almost all nonagricultural household enterprises in Côte d’Ivoire are in the informal sector, and many
operate at the margin of existing laws on small-medium enterprises. Nonagricultural household enter-
prises ﬁt the legal deﬁnition of microenterprises in Côte d’Ivoire. However, an important caveat is that most
nonagricultural self-employment activities are not registered and do not undertake any form of accounting.
In general, such informal employment behaves counter-cyclically and can act as a buffer in case of crisis and
shocks. In Côte d’Ivoire, while the informal sector expanded during the crisis years, a large part of the infor-
mal sector is rather structural and it includes a large number of businesses with many years of operation. The
median owner of a nonagricultural microenterprises is a young female with no formal education. The majority
of nonagricultural individual enterprises are in small-scale service activities, with approximately two out of three
operating in urban areas.

Employment in nonagricultural self-employment is not only the result of push factors, and a range of
pull factors contribute to entry into household enterprises. In fact, many individuals express preferences
for work in the sector over other employment opportunities. These patterns may reﬂect a constrained choice
set, particularly for the low-educated individuals for whom formal wage jobs are unattainable. Clearly, not all
individuals are in the informal sector by choice, but quantitative and qualitative data provide a somewhat more
nuanced view compared to the negative connotation the sector often elicits.
The fact that many ﬁnd employment in nonagricultural self-employment desirable is consistent with
wide heterogeneity in earnings and productivity in the sector. While some individuals are just surviving in
the sector, for many, nonagricultural self-employment can offer a better job, a source of higher earnings, or a
pathway out of poverty. Overall, enterprises owned by men and operating in Abidjan are the most productive,
while operators in rural areas are much less productive. Sectors that are relatively more capital intensive such as
transport, wholesale trading, or bar and restaurants also tend to be more productive.
Individuals face multiple constraints to create and operate nonagricultural household enterprises.
Analysis from both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that there is a distinct hierarchy of constraints.
Capital constraints are the most binding for individuals in the sector. The very limited or nonexistent ﬁnancial
services compel (potential) entrepreneurs to mostly rely on personal savings or on family and friends networks
for ﬁnancing. The lack of safe working environment or access to markets represent an impediment. For instance,
many business operators complain of problematic relations with local authorities. Despite paying taxes, micro-
enterprise owners do not receive many services. Finally, with regard to education and skills, although formal
education is not necessary conducive to higher productivity in nonagricultural self-employment, the number of
years of experience as well as basic business skills matter for operating a business successfully. Entrepreneurs in
the sector also mention challenges related to behavioral skills, in particular for youths.
Several policy entry points can be considered to build a more supportive business environment for
nonagricultural self-employment. At a policy level, there is no clear national strategy for the sector. Many
actions regarding informal enterprises tend to start with the question of how to ‘formalize’ them. The facilitation
of procedures for starting a formal business in recent years has contributed to an increase in small registered
ﬁrms (see Chapter 5). Still, formalization cannot be seen as an end in itself, particularly since international
evidence on the effectiveness of policies to encourage formalization on ﬁrm productivity or taxes collected are
rather mixed, showing only a small number of ﬁrms may able to formalize. Recent innovations suggest that
formalization can be incentivized through complementary beneﬁt packages that seek to address constraints to
ﬁrm productivity. In this sense, ﬁnding effective policies to address constraints to productivity can come ﬁrst,
with attempts to formalize coming later. One real challenge to set up a more supportive enabling environment
for nonagricultural self-employment in Côte d’Ivoire is a lack of clear roles or responsibilities with respect to
the sector. A multitude of government agencies have relations to the sector but focus on particular issues, for
instance on building registries to better regulate or tax the sector, with relatively less attention to the provision
of services needed to address constraints to productivity.
New actions are possible to address the multiple constraints to a more supportive business environ-
ment for nonagricultural self-employment. A three-step approach is suggested. First, at a policy level, it is
essential to articulate a strategy to provide voice for micro- enterprise operators, as well as institutional coordi-
nation and accountability for public agencies dealing with the sector. Second, at a programmatic level, speciﬁc
interventions can be undertaken to relax binding constraints for household operators facing market failures.
Easing access to capital through effective mechanisms is clearly a top priority, followed by the facilitation of
access to markets and suitable work location. With regard to skills, the direct scope for intervention might be
more limited, although providing access to training on business skills and skills upgrading opportunities could
be considered. This could include leveraging and incentivizing existing private training providers, such as those
in the traditional apprenticeship system, which are quite common for youths. Overall, based on international
evidence, integrated interventions that address several of these binding constraints hold most promise. Lastly,
given the heterogeneity in the sector, social protection may still be the only option for those that may not be
able to grow or become more productive.

Encouraging formal job creation by expanding the number, size, and spatial distribution of formal firms
Given the higher quality of jobs in the modern formal sector, expanding the size of the formal
sector is key to more and better jobs. Côte d’Ivoire’s economy is characterized by a relatively developed and
diversiﬁed industrial sector by Sub-Saharan African standards, but competitiveness and the overall investment
climate eroded during the decade-long civil strife. Government and political stability were long ranked as one
of the most important obstacle to doing business, but instability is no longer perceived as a major constraint.
The country is now eying emergence, and could capitalize on the peace dividends to focus on other constraints
limiting competitiveness and growth of the private sector.
Firm-level analysis reveals that, in the years after the Ouagadougou accord in 2007, Côte d’Ivoire has
seen sustained progress in business activities, entry of new ﬁrms, and formal employment growth.
The total number of registered formal ﬁrms increased more than threefold between 2007 and 2012 (Figure 8).
Compared to other countries with available data, the Ivorian formal economy has displayed relatively more
dynamism in business creation and growth: job creation is concentrated in young ﬁrms but also large ﬁrms,
indicating the importance of both entry and growth in incumbent ﬁrms. The pattern of ﬁrm employment over
the life cycle also suggests that ﬁrms do grow over time, indicating a relatively well-functioning market.
However, as the economy just started recovering during the period covered by the available ﬁrm
panel census, and since the numbers of ﬁrms and formal jobs are low to start with, there is still limited
evidence of structural changes. Based on Centrale des Bilans data, the formal sector went from employing
approximately 200,000 individuals in 2003 to approximately 300,000 individuals in 2012. At the same time,
formal jobs creation has been small in the aggregate: the highest number of formal jobs created in a year is only
approximately 40,000 (Figure 9). Since there are more than 10 million employed individuals in the country, this
means there is limited potential for the formal sector to absorb a large amount of labor in the short term. As
discussions in Chapter 3 also highlight, it will take a sustained period of fast growth in the industry and service
sectors for the share of formal wage employment in the economy to substantially increase. In addition, despite
signs of regional diversiﬁcation, over 90 percent of ﬁrms and jobs are still concentrated in Abidjan, creating
challenges related to the inclusiveness of formal jobs. In terms of output, new sectors such as oil and gas have
become the most important contributor to value added but their contribution to employment is negligible. The
continued concentration of employment in agribusiness activities, including in agriculture and food processing,
implies that these sectors will remain important engines for job creation in the foreseeable future.
Observed patterns of ﬁrm and formal job dynamics in Côte d’Ivoire suggest several key constraints for
growth in the formal sector. Firms, especially small and young, endure very high job churning and low survival
rates. While entry of foreign ﬁrms seems to create a positive competition effect that favors more productive ﬁrms
to survive, the ability of local ﬁrms to compete with foreign ﬁrms also appears limited. This result indicates poten-
tially important capability constraints. For those that do manage to survive, employment growth is concentrated

among a subset of ﬁrms, and growth rate is higher among more capital-intensive and productive ﬁrms and sectors,
suggesting access to capital, ﬁrm capabilities, and output demand as potential constraints for job growth. At
the same time, there is substantial heterogeneity in job quality as measured by differences in the average wages
across sectors and ﬁrm sizes. Interestingly, medium and large ﬁrms tend to pay signiﬁcantly higher labor costs.
This appears to be driven by a different organizational structure which includes more organizational layers and
managerial positions. High labor cost due to high skill premium could be one of the constraints for ﬁrms to grow.
Comparisons of ﬁrm dynamics patterns and business climate with a set of comparator countries lead
to a range of potential policy actions. Access to ﬁnance is a constraint, as indicated by the relatively low levels
of capital intensity and high rate of returns to capital in Ivorian ﬁrms. Within Côte d’Ivoire’s formal sector, there
seems to be substantial heterogeneity in capital constraints across sectors and ﬁrm size. In contrast to conven-
tional wisdom, smaller ﬁrms are not necessarily more capital constrained. At the institutional level, Côte d’Ivoire
still has margin for improvements in its access to ﬁnance regulations, due to a lack of a credit registry or credit
information sharing, and a movable collateral registry. Doing Business reforms in these areas could reduce the
overall cost of lending and improve access to ﬁnance especially for smaller and less-established ﬁrms. In addition,
for the small and medium ﬁrms in particular, combating corruption and lack of competition in the transport
sector, will help improve their access to regional markets. Indeed, in the short run, growth in output demand
is most likely to come from tradable sectors, but high transportation costs due to outdated infrastructure and
inefﬁcient logistics are limiting Ivorian ﬁrms’ ability to reach regional and global markets.
Beyond institutional reforms at the economy level, Côte d’Ivoire can also consider more targeted
direct support to compensate for some shortcomings in the investment climate. The country already
has a long history of strong foreign presence and sophisticated entrepreneurs. It can capitalize on the recent
returns of foreign investments to maximize the potential beneﬁts from the capital inﬂows as well as learning and
linkages spillovers. While the government is implementing a generous incentives program to encourage foreign
direct investment (FDI), the existing incentives are not sufﬁciently well targeted to promote job creation or exports.
The government could consider linking incentives to more labor-intensive sectors or to ﬁrm activities that would
encourage upgrading of skills and management practices, exports, or local hiring and procurement. Targeted
support can also be at the spatial level to reduce existing regional disparities in economic and job opportunities.
Finally, the overall average labor costs in Côte d’Ivoire are at the low end based on international
comparisons, but its labor force no longer appears competitive after accounting for labor productivity.
Low labor productivity can in part reﬂect some demand constraints. Low labor productivity in Ivorian ﬁrms can
also be a result of skill supply constraints: low education attainment and convex returns to education might
contribute to high skill premium and inability of ﬁrms to absorb labor costs to grow. In this context, Chapter 6
discusses in more details education, skills, and training for a more competitive workforce in Côte d’Ivoire.

Education, skills, and training for a competitive workforce in Côte d’Ivoire
To achieve its objective of becoming a leading emerging economy in Sub-Saharan Africa and being
globally competitive, Côte d’Ivoire faces substantial challenges to rapidly make its workforce competitive.
The years of crisis affected the quality of education services and the ability for children to acquire the skills they need
to be productive in the labor force. As mentioned above and in Chapter 5, although wages are not necessarily very
high in the formal sector compared to other countries, low worker productivity likely contributes to push up relative
labor costs and may constrain expansion of formal ﬁrms. At the same time, and as mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4,
education and skills also matter for productivity in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment, in particular
to ensure that individuals are able to seize opportunities such as improved technologies or business practices. In
this context, Côte d’Ivoire faces an urgent challenge to ensure today’s children acquire the skills that tomorrow’s
labor force will need, as well as in ﬁnding opportunities for the current workforce to effectively upgrade their skills.
Participation in primary education has been negatively affected by the crisis, and Côte d’Ivoire has
not yet fully caught up with other countries in the region. Gross enrollment rates (GERs) deteriorated
between 2002 and 2010. While there was some catch-up in enrollment after 2008 (and in particular after 2011)
and the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to 16 years in 2015, enrollment still remains
below the average enrollment rate for Sub-Saharan African developing countries. Enrollment in secondary and
tertiary education also remains relatively low, although Côte d’Ivoire achieves the regional average enrollment
in secondary education and exceeds the regional average in enrollment of post-secondary education. Overall
there is substantial variation in the access to education across the country, with the poor, females, and those
living in rural areas lagging in educational attainment.
The 2010–2011 post-electoral crisis in Côte d’Ivoire marked a watershed moment for higher education
in the country, with signiﬁcant disruption to education provision in public universities. Since 2012,
with the end of the crisis and with increased sociopolitical stability, enrollment in higher education returned
to its pre-crisis levels, equivalent to 866 enrolled for every 100,000 people in the country. While the country’s
performance is good relative to other Francophone countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is still room for
improvement, especially in comparison with other middle-income countries. In addition, disparities in terms of
gender and wealth quintiles are persistent.
As Côte d’Ivoire aims to become an emerging economy over the next decade, the current stock of
human capital hinders its global competitiveness. In light of historical enrollment patterns, educational
attainment remains modest among the youth of working age in Côte d’Ivoire. Over 50 percent of youth between
the ages of 15 and 34 lack a complete primary education, and only around 24 percent of working-age youth
have completed more than primary education. Educational attainment lags behind other emerging economies
both in Africa (such as Nigeria) and beyond (such as Indonesia).
Quality of primary education in Côte d’Ivoire also lags behind other Sub-Saharan African countries,
limiting the skills that children can acquire in school. For instance, students at CM2 level (ﬁfth grade of
primary school) are behind relative to other Francophone countries in the region (Figure 10). Math scores are
particularly low and less than 25 percent meet minimum competence requirements. French scores are more
comparable to the average level obtained in other countries but still less than 45 percent are meeting minimum
requirements. Since the education system constitutes the main source of skills acquisition for most individuals,
continued improvements in access to education, as well as rapid gains in learning through improvements in the
quality of education services will be critical for Côte d’Ivoire’s competiveness.
Education inﬂuences both the occupations where individuals are working, as well as their productivity
in these occupations. Higher-educated individuals are more likely to work in the wage sector, and employment
in agriculture decreases with educational attainment. Access to wage employment is particularly limited for
females relative to males, unless females have tertiary levels of education. In the wage sector, there are positive
education earnings premia in wage work for both males and females, and signs of nonlinear, convex patterns.
Strong heterogeneity in earnings proﬁles by gender are observed, with women receiving far lower wages at all
levels of the education distribution in wage work. In nonagricultural self-employment, however, limited returns to
additional years of education are observed, except for highly educated females who stay involved in this sector.

Few individuals have opportunities to acquire skills after they have exited the education system.
Only 12 percent of the working-age population participates in post-school training. Training provided by private
providers is the most common, in particular traditional apprenticeships, which accounts for half of individuals
undertaking post-school training. While traditional apprenticeships appear accessible and relevant to individuals
with low levels of education, private and public technical and vocational training attract more educated groups.
While informal apprenticeships are the main source of post-school training — in particular for low-
skilled youths — they are often overlooked in policy discussions on skills, which tend to focus on the
education system and publicly provided training. Informal apprenticeships are provided by micro and small
enterprises, mostly in the informal sector. Besides labor directly provided by apprentices, employees often hire
from the pool of apprentices. Master-craftsmen also charge signiﬁcant fees to apprentices, so that apprenticeships
can constitute a source of revenues for ﬁrms. Firms consider behavioral skills as the most important characteristic
sought in youth, as well as one of the most difﬁcult characteristics to ﬁnd. In fact, a large number of apprentices
are observed dropping out before completing their training. While informal apprenticeship is characterized by a
range of apparent inefﬁciencies, public interventions need to balance attempts to improve training quality with
the risks of distorting a large source of private training provision for low-skilled youth in the informal sector.
Côte  d’Ivoire faces the challenge to rapidly overhaul its education system to affect the ﬂow of
incoming youths joining the active population. Human capital projections for Côte d’Ivoire show that
achieving universal primary education (Millennium Development Goal [MDG] 2) by 2020, will reduce the
incidence of youth entering the labor force without having completed the primary cycle by 12 percentage points
(from 23 percent to 11 percent) and eliminating the share of those entering the labor force with no education
by 2025. If the MDGs were met by 2020, it also suggests that a greater share of the youth will have completed
upper-secondary or some higher education. At the same time, improvements in the quality of basic education
services are critical and urgent. As access to basic education and quality continue to improve, Côte d’Ivoire can
also prepare to have a more performing higher education system.
Ensuring skill upgrading opportunities for youths and adults who already exited the education system
is challenging given so many have low educational attainment and limited skills to start with. For this
subgroup, the role for public intervention is not necessarily to directly provide training. Facilitation of access and
quality improvements in existing private training opportunities can be considered as well. This can include leveraging
informal apprenticeship arrangements, or better tailoring the currently inadequate professional training system to
the underserved low-skilled population. Beyond technical skills, avenues to improve business skills and behavioral
skills need to be further considered, both within and outside the education system. Together, these strategies can
produce the foundational human capital necessary to ensure competitiveness and foster emergence in Côte d’Ivoire.

QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVE INCLUSION
IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE

1.1 THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Until recently, micro data on the employment situation in Côte d’Ivoire have remained relatively scarce.
This limited the diagnosis of the employment challenge in the country, as well as analysis of past trends and
assessment of future prospects. Recent efforts by the government to provide a more regular ﬂow of employment
statistics provide a clearer picture of the employment situation. Nationally representative surveys collected in
October 2012, February 2014, and January-March 2015 provide recent and reliable micro data on employment
in Côte d’Ivoire (see Box 1.1 for a summary of micro data sources). This chapter starts by describing the employ-
ment situation in Côte d’Ivoire and highlights its broad implications for employment policy. It does not seek to
reproduce a large number of employment statistics already available from descriptive survey reports.3 Rather, it
focuses on the main patterns that are relevant for policy. By building on the framework of the regional report
on Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa (Filmer et al. 2014), the chapter analyzes patterns of employment
across the main employment types: agriculture, nonagricultural self-employment, and wage employment.

BOX 1.1: SOURCES OF MICRO DATA ON EMPLOYMENT IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
This report uses various nationally representative employment and household surveys from Côte d’Ivoire. They
include three household living standards surveys from 2002, 2008, and 2015, as well as employment surveys from
2012 and 2014.
The 2002 and 2008 household surveys Enquête Niveau de Vie des Ménages (ENV 2002 and ENV 2008, hereafter) are tra-
ditional household living standards surveys. They present some limitations to get comprehensive employment data, but
contain modules on labor and jobs to analyze employment and derive comparable statistics for key indicators over time.
The government has made strong eﬀorts in collecting regular employment data in recent years. Nationally repre-
sentative employment surveys were collected in October 2012 (EEMCI 2012) and February 2014 (ENSETE 2013).
This report mostly relies on the later survey, in particular to provide information on the recent employment situa-
tion, as well as to build comparable time series for key employment indicators. The survey is a labor force survey,
which includes detailed individual employment information, as well as household-level modules on nonagricultural
household enterprises, agriculture, and livestock. Although the survey was originally planned for late 2013, and is
therefore known as the 2013 employment survey (ENSETE 2013), data collection took place in February 2014. A
new employment survey has been collected in 2016 and is being processed at the time this report is being ﬁnalized.
Finally, a national household living standards survey was collected in January-March 2015 (Enquête Niveau de Vie
des Ménages (ENV 2015), with the objective to update poverty statistics and other social indicators. The survey
includes modules on employment, nonagricultural household enterprises, and agriculture, as such allowing to
construct key employment statistics, although with some comparability issues with the employment survey.

Confusions at times arise in policy discussions and public debates on employment in developing coun-
tries, including in Côte d’Ivoire. Some of the formal deﬁnitions that are used to characterize a labor market
where individuals look for wage jobs and employers supply these wage jobs are not well suited to contexts where
self-employment in agricultural and nonagricultural activities predominate, and few individuals are not working
and are instead looking for wage jobs. The overall jobs diagnostic is based on the ofﬁcial international employ-
ment deﬁnitions as they are adopted by Côte d’Ivoire.4 Box 1.2 provides deﬁnitions of terms used throughout
the report. In line with international norms, an individual is considered employed if she works at least one hour
over the previous seven days. An individual is considered unemployed if she works less than one hour in the last
7 days, is actively looking for work, and is available to work in the next 15 days.
Instead of the share of individuals being unemployed, a more informative indicator of the employment
situation in Côte d’Ivoire is the distribution of employment across agriculture, nonagricultural self-em-
ployment and wage employment, or earnings and productivity levels across these different types of
jobs. Therefore, rather than focusing on the level of employment and unemployment, this chapter analyzes the
composition of employment by distinguishing the three main types of employment: agricultural self-employment,
nonagricultural self-employment, and wage employment. Importantly, underemployment in Côte d’Ivoire is not
so much characterized by individuals working limited hours (underemployment based on hours worked). Rather,
many individuals work in activities providing limited earnings (underemployment based on earnings).
In addition to reviewing the proﬁle of employment in Côte d’Ivoire, this chapter also builds compa-
rable indicators over time to analyze recent employment trends, covering the period of crisis and
recent recovery. The chapter analyzes employment data from the 2002 and 2008 household surveys, in addi-
tion to the 2012 and 2013 employment surveys (collected in October 2012 and February 2014, respectively),
as well as the 2015 national household survey. These ﬁve surveys are large-scale, nationally representative,
high-quality, household-based surveys providing detailed information on individual employment. By analyzing
trends between 2002 and 2015, the chapter describes demographic changes in the working-age population
and labor force in Côte d’Ivoire, as well as analyzes changes in the composition of employment across the main
sectors of employment.


BOX 1.2: DEFINITIONS OF KEY TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT
The terms used throughout the report are based on the oﬃcial employment deﬁnitions for Côte d’Ivoire. Speciﬁcally,
the report is based on the norms for employment statistics adopted during the 13th Conference of Labor Statisticians
(CIST) held in 1982. The norms for employment statistics were adjusted following the 19th Conference of Labor
Statisticians held in 2013, but comparable employment indicators cannot be built retrospectively for previous
years for the new indicators. Box 1.3 highlights some of the diﬀerence between the old and the new norms for
employment statistics.
In line with oﬃcial deﬁnitions, the working-age population is classiﬁed into two groups: active and inactive. The
active population is further divided into employed and unemployed. An individual is considered employed if she works
at least one hour over the previous seven days. An individual is considered unemployed if she works less than one
hour in the last seven days, is actively looking for work, and is available to work in the next 15 days. In this report,
we further subdivide the employed population into three main categories of wage employment, agricultural self-em-
ployment, and nonagricultural self-employment. Deﬁnitions of the key terms used in this report are provided below.

BOX 1.3: OLD AND NEW OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT DEFINITIONS
The oﬃcial international deﬁnitions of employment statistics were adjusted in 2013. To ensure comparability, this report
builds comparable employment statistics based on the deﬁnitions used for the previous 30 years. Speciﬁcally, the
report is based on the norms for employment statistics adopted during the 13th Conference of Labor Statisticians, CIST,
held in 1982, which provided the basis of the oﬃcial ILO deﬁnitions until 2013. New norms for employment statistics
were recommended following the 19th conference of labor statisticians held in 2013, but comparable employment
indicators cannot be built retrospectively for previous years, and these new norms have not yet been widely or consis-
tently applied. Overall, this report seeks to focus on the broad trends in the composition of employment in Côte d’Ivoire.
In this context, the use of the old and the new norms does not change the main policy messages from the report.a
The 19th International Conference of Labor Statisticians held in 2013 recommended the adoption of new inter-
national norms for employment statistics. Figures B1.3.1 and B1.3.2 illustrate the structure of employment in
Côte d’Ivoire in February 2014 according to the old and new norms. In both cases, the population is decomposed
into the population under 14 and the working-age population. However, the decomposition of the working-age
population is diﬀerent based on the two sets of norms.
Based on the old norms, the working-age population is decomposed into the population in the labor force (or
‘active population’) or the inactive population (out of the labor force). In turn, the labor force or active population
is decomposed into the employed population and the unemployed population. An individual is considered employed
if he/she spent at least one hour working in the 7 days before the survey. An individual is considered unemployed
if he/she spent less than an hour working in the 7 days before the survey, is looking for work, and is available to
work in the next 15 days.
Some changes to these basic concepts are introduced by the new norms for employment statistics. Under the new
norms, the working-age population is decomposed into the population in the labor force and out of the labor force.
As before, the population in the labor force is still decomposed into the employed population and the unemployed
population. However, some nuances are introduced in the composition of the population out of the labor force.
Speciﬁcally, the population out of the labor force now includes individuals who are looking for work but not available
to work immediately (‘potential labor force’), individuals who are working but not employed, and other individuals
outside the labor force.
While this decomposition may seem similar to the one under the old norms, it has some strong implications with
regard to the composition of the labor force. Under the new norms, individuals engaged in activities without any
form of payment or ‘for own ﬁnal use’ (for instance, subsistence farmers growing crops exclusively for own con-
sumption) who were considered as employed, and therefore part of the labor force based on the old norm, are
now considered to be out of the labor force based on the new norm. A new category of individuals ‘working but not

Note (a): The new norms of employment statistics introduce distinctions between ‘work’ and ‘employment’ that create additional confusion in the policy
discussions on employment.

employed’ is created, which is part of the out-of-labor-force population. For these reasons, the size of the labor
force is smaller under the new norms than it was under the old norm. Consequently, the unemployment rate also
changes since it is a function of the size of the labor-force population (because both the numerator and denom-
inator of the unemployment rate change, the rate can increase or decrease once the new norms are applied). As
such, the old and new norms are not comparable.
Box 3.1 provides additional information on the challenges of applying the new norms to the agricultural sector.


1.1.1 Labor-force participation and unemployment
Côte d’Ivoire has a very young working-age population. In February 2014, the working-age population
in Côte d’Ivoire was estimated at 62.5 percent of the overall population. Over 60 percent of the working-age
population is composed of youths between 15 and 34 years (35.1 percent ages 15–24, and 25.2 percent ages
25–34). Individuals older than 35 years represent 39.7 percent of the working-age population, with less than
4 percent above 65 years.
Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by high labor-force participation. In February 2014, 76.8 percent of the adult
population was in the labor force. Labor-force participation rates reach 85 percent in rural areas, much higher
than in urban areas (68 percent). Inactive individuals (those who are outside the labor force) mostly include youth
who have not yet left school to enter the labor force, especially in urban areas, as well as the elderly (Table 1.1).

Labor-force participation remains relatively lower among women than men. Taken together, 27.2 percent
of the adult women are inactive, much higher than the 19.3 percent of adult men. Gender differences are
particularly large for age groups 25–34 and above, that is after youth have left school. Women face additional
constraints than men to enter the labor force, including related to fertility choices and family duties.
The population out of the labor force is mainly composed of people who are currently in school.
Young people who prepare to undertake a gradual school-to-work transition are part of the inactive popula-
tion (Figure 1.1). Overall, 73.8 percent of the inactive are in school, respectively 83.5 percent among men and
63.1 among women (Figure 1.2). An overwhelming majority (86.1 percent) of the inactive cohort 14–24 are
still in school, but only 36.2 percent of the next cohort (25–34) (Figure 1.3). The inactive also include some
young people who are not in education, employment, or training, which are often called NEETs (youths not in
employment, education or training)5 The NEETs represent 13.9 percent of the inactive cohort 14–24, and 63.8
of the 25–34 age group.
Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by relatively low unemployment. Unemployment affects a relatively small
share of adults in the labor force (6.7 percent). Unemployment is formally deﬁned as the share of individuals in
the labor force who are not working, looking for work, and available to work. Consequently, unemployment
is a concept that mostly relates to a formal labor market of wage jobs. As such, unemployment is very low in
rural areas (3 percent), where formal labor markets are thin and most individuals are self-employed. Overall, the
vast majority of adults in the labor force are engaged in some type of work, although many are employed in
low-productivity occupations (as further described below).

     In addition to the inactive that are not in education and training, the NEETs also include the unemployed.

In addition to being more likely to be inactive than men, women also have a higher rate of unem-
ployment. Women face higher rates of unemployment (9.4 percent) compared to men (4.5 percent). Taken
together, 66 percent of the adult women are working, much lower than the 77 percent of men. In addition to
facing constraints in entering the labor force, women also face hurdles in accessing employment once in the
active population, including in terms of occupational choice as further described below.
The prevalence of unemployment is also higher among younger cohorts, particularly in urban areas.
Although unemployment remains low by international standards, unemployment rates are relatively higher among
youths, reaching 7.9 percent of the labor force for the 25–34 age group, and 13.6 percent for the same age group
in urban areas (Table 1.2).

One pattern that is often overlooked is that inactivity and unemployment tend to be relatively higher
among the wealthier groups. Inactivity and unemployment rates are the lowest at the bottom of the wealth
distribution (Figure 1.4).6 Less than 3 percent of those in the bottom wealth quintile are unemployed, and only 16
percent inactive. The poorest mostly live in rural areas, do not stay in school very long, and are engaged in some
type of work. Most cannot afford to be unemployed, and the concept of ‘looking for work’ which underpins
the deﬁnition of unemployment is not as relevant in contexts where self-employment is predominant, including
in rural areas. By contrast, inactivity and unemployment rates increase steadily along the wealth distribution.
Among the top quintile of the wealth distribution, less than two-thirds of the population is active, in part due to
higher school participation rates among youths. At the same time, 11.6 percent of the labor force is unemployed.
Unemployment rates are higher among the most educated, although the majority of the unemployed
still have low levels of education. Unemployment rates are relatively higher for individuals who have
completed secondary or tertiary education (Figure  1.5). Youths who reached higher levels of educational

achievements tend to live in urban areas and come from families in the upper quintiles of the wealth distribution,
and as such may be able to support longer job searches. Importantly, however, relatively few individuals reach
these high levels of education, so that the majority of the unemployed still have less than secondary education.
While unemployment is relatively low, those who are unemployed remain so for a long time. The 2013
employment survey data shows that more than three out four unemployed are long-term unemployed; that is
they have been without a job for more than a year. This pattern also holds across gender, age group, area of
residence, and level of education (AGEPE and INS, 2014).
The labor force in Côte d’Ivoire is relatively mobile.7 Approximately half of individuals in the labor force
have migrated at some point in their life, including 42 percent of those living in urban areas and 58 percent of
those living in rural areas. The migration is predominantly internal to Côte d’Ivoire, including permanent migrants
and individuals who migrated away from their place of birth before going back. The share of migrants who
were born abroad is more limited, though still sizable at 7 percent of the labor force. These numbers exclude
temporary international migrants who come to Côte d’Ivoire to work before returning to their home country.
Such seasonal international migration is particularly relevant in agriculture, as discussed in Chapter 3.

1.1.2 The composition of employment in Côte d’Ivoire

The overall composition of employment
The main employment challenge in Côte d’Ivoire stems from the high concentration of employment in
agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment. Rather than the share of individuals being unemployed,

7
      The deﬁnition of (labor) mobility used here is based on the place of birth of the individual, not on citizenship.

                                                                                                                                                 22
a more informative indicator of the employment situation in Côte d’Ivoire is the distribution of employed
individuals in different types of jobs. Building on the framework of the World Bank regional report on Youth
Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa (Filmer et al. 2014), employment is divided in three main types of employ-
ment: agricultural employment, nonagricultural self-employment, and modern wage employment. Figure 1.6
summarizes the composition of employment in Côte d’Ivoire in February 2014 based on these categories. As
noted above, unemployment is relatively low, and so is the number of wage jobs in the economy. Only 22.8
percent of employed individuals hold wage jobs, mostly in nonagricultural wage jobs (19.9 percent).8 By contrast,
47.5 percent of the employed population is self-employed in agriculture, and 29.7 percent is self-employed in
nonagricultural activities. Self-employed individuals do not operate in a formal ‘labor market’ for wage jobs.
They mostly work for themselves and create their own jobs. Most adults work on family farms, or in nonagricul-
tural individual enterprises selling goods or services in small-scale informal activities. While there is substantial
variation within these employment sectors (including in agricultural and nonagricultural microenterprises), on
average these occupations tends to have low productivity.
Côte d’Ivoire has an employment proﬁle similar to lower-middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa, but distinct from upper-middle-income countries in the region. Figure 1.7 contrasts the labor-force
composition in Côte d’Ivoire with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (based on Filmer et al. 2014). With an
unemployment rate below 10 percent and approximately 20 percent of the population in wage employment, the
labor-force composition in Côte d’Ivoire contrasts sharply with upper-middle-income countries (such as Gabon
or South Africa). Côte d’Ivoire has an employment proﬁle much closer to lower-middle-income countries (such
as Cameroon, Ghana or Senegal) or resource-rich countries (such as Nigeria), with over 45 percent of the labor
force in agriculture and over 25 percent in nonagricultural self-employment. This being said, Côte d’Ivoire does
tend to have slightly higher unemployment and wage employment, and slightly less agricultural employment
than comparator lower-middle-income countries in Africa.
Women are particularly highly concentrated in self-employment, including nonagricultural self-em-
ployment, with limited access to wage jobs (Table 1.4). Among women, 12 percent of those employed hold
wage jobs, including 24.4 percent in urban areas. In comparison, employed men are more than twice as likely
to hold wage jobs, 26.4 percent nationally and 52.9 percent in urban areas. In contrast, nonagricultural self-em-
ployment is a key source of employment for women — 41.9 percent of women are engaged in nonagricultural
self-employment, twice the share of men. Taken together, close to 90 percent of women are self-employed in
either agriculture or nonagricultural activities.

Strong spatial employment patterns are observed (Table 1.5, Figure 1.8). Self-employment is the most
common form of employment in both urban and rural areas. The prevalence of agricultural self-employment is
particularly marked in rural areas, where wage jobs are very rare. In rural areas, 72.6 percent of the employed
population work on family farms, and 16.3 percent are self-employed outside agriculture. Agricultural self-em-
ployment is relatively more prevalent in the north, with nonagricultural self-employment relatively more common
in the south. Nonagricultural self-employment is also more prevalent than wage employment in urban areas,
where wage jobs are not the norm either. Only 40 percent of employed individuals in urban areas hold wage
jobs, while 51 percent are engaged in nonagricultural self-employment. Both wage employment and unem-
ployment are strongly concentrated in urban areas and in the south. In fact, over 90 percent of formal jobs are
concentrated in Abidjan (see Chapter 5).

Employment aspirations of the population reﬂect geographical differences and are rather mixed, as
many declare preferences for self-employment. Females and individuals outside Abidjan are more likely to
prefer self-employment, while individuals in Abidjan are mostly oriented toward wage jobs (Figure 1.9). Similar
patterns are observed among the unemployed. While these patterns may seem surprising, these aspirations are
aligned with the reality of the employment structure in Côte d’Ivoire, and in particular the high prevalence of
self-employment activities. And of course, even the relatively low share of individuals aspiring to formal wage
jobs remains higher than the available wage job opportunities.
Education inﬂuences access to employment opportunities. Education contributes both to the occupations
where individuals work, as well as the productivity in these occupations. Patterns of occupational selection are
rather strong in Côte d’Ivoire. Most individuals with low education achievement are concentrated in agricul-
ture, and access to nonagricultural wage jobs is concentrated among individuals with completed secondary
education or more. The share of nonagricultural self-employment is relatively stable across levels of education,
although it slightly decreases at secondary levels and above (Figure 1.10). Education is a key determinant of
access to certain types of job. As such, stronger gender differences in educational attainment contribute to the
strong gender differences in occupation. Box 1.4 further describes the likelihood of employment in the main
types of employment given individual characteristics (gender, education) while controlling for other situational
factors (social origin, region of residence). Results show that the descriptive patterns of occupational selection
by educational level are strong. Chapter 6 further discusses the links between education, skills and training, and
productive employment in Côte d’Ivoire.

BOX 1.4: PATTERNS OF OCCUPATIONAL SELECTION
Table B1.4.1 illustrates descriptive patterns in occupational selection into the main types of employment based on
a multinomial logit model. The reference category is agricultural self-employment. The table presents the relative
risk ratio (RRR), which indicates the marginal change in the likelihood of an individual working in a given employ-
ment type (more likely if the coeﬃcient is larger than 1, less likely if the coeﬃcient is smaller than 1), compared to
agricultural self-employment. Overall, gender, education, individual’s father’s occupational background, and area of
residence signiﬁcantly aﬀect the likelihood of being in a given occupation compared to agricultural self-employment.
The estimated eﬀects represent associations, not causal eﬀects.
Education has strong eﬀects on the RRRs. Estimates indicate that education is associated with a strong increase
in the odds of being wage employed or being self-employed relative to being in farming. For instance, individuals
who have completed primary school have a probability between 51 to 76 percent higher than individuals with no
education of working as wage workers compared to being in farming (Table B1.4.1). These odds are between 133
to 200 percent higher for individuals who have completed secondary school.
Gender patterns are also very strong. Men are much more likely than women to be wage employed compared to
self-employed in agriculture. For example, men are twice more likely as women to be wage employed compared
to being in farming. On the other hand, the chances for men being in nonagricultural self-employment instead of
farming are about half those of women.

                                                                                                                                               26
The region of residence also strongly determines whether an individual ends up in agricultural self-employment
or not. Living outside of Abidjan, the major economic city, reduces the probability of ending up in some type of
employment outside farming (wage employment, self-employment).
Finally, family background matters and patterns in the intergenerational transmission of occupations are quite
strong. We proxy social origin of the individual with the employment type of his/her father when the individual was
15 years old. Individuals are more likely to end up in either wage or nonagricultural self-employment than in farming
when their father was also in another type of employment outside farming.

Although many individuals cumulate several activities, there is little diversiﬁcation in employment
types within households. Different members of the same household tend to be engaged in similar types of
activities, so that households are fairly specialized in wage employment, nonagricultural self-employment, or
agricultural self-employment. For instance, 40.2 percent of households are engaged in agricultural self-employ-
ment only, 21.1 percent in nonagricultural self-employment only, and 18.2 percent in wage employment only.
Only about 20 percent of households have members in different employment types. The most common diversi-
ﬁcation pattern combines wage employment and nonagricultural self-employment (9.5 percent of households
nationally), followed by nonagricultural self-employment and agricultural employment (8.9 percent of households
nationally). Diversiﬁcation patterns differ in urban and rural areas (Figure 1.11). Rural households do not combine
many agricultural activities with nonagricultural activities, although, of course, there is substantial diversiﬁcation
within agriculture itself, such as combination of cash and food crops, agriculture and livestock (see discussion
in Chapter 3). Urban households are slightly more diversiﬁed, mostly through nonagricultural self-employment.

Underemployment and earnings
Most people spend relatively long hours at work in Côte d’Ivoire, and more so in nonagricultural
self-employment than in wage jobs. In February 2014, the average number of hours worked a week was
around 41.8, with a median around 42 (Figure 1.12a). Only 20 percent of employed individuals worked less than
30 hours a week. By contrast, 40 percent of individuals report working more than 60 hours a week. Nonetheless,
there are some differences in the number of hours worked by type of employment. Agricultural employment is
known to exhibit substantial seasonality, with much lower work during the lean seasons. Individuals in agricul-
tural self-employment worked the least hours compared to other occupations in February 2014, in part due to
seasonal patterns (see discussion in Chapters 2 and 3). As discussed in Chapter 2, this seasonality in agricultural
employment explains a substantial share in differences in average labor productivity across sectors. However,
individuals in nonagricultural self-employment work slightly more hours (47.6 ) than those in wage employment
(46.7) (Figure 1.12c). Among wage workers, it is individuals in the public sector who work less (41.4) than their
counterparts in the private formal (45.8) or informal sectors (46.6) (Figure 1.12d).
The employment challenge in Côte d’Ivoire is sometimes described as widespread underemployment,
but the issue relates to earnings more than time worked. What the data makes clear is that outside agri-
culture the main challenge is not so much underemployment in terms of hours worked. Indeed, if hours worked
are used to characterize underemployment, outside of agriculture it is the wage employed in the public sector
that would be most likely to be characterized as underemployed. As such, the employment challenge really is

the concentration of employment in low-productivity occupations where individuals spend many hours at work
but earn relatively little.
Average earnings are low in Côte d’Ivoire, even with respect to comparator countries from Sub-
Saharan Africa (World  Bank, 2015). Based on macroeconomic data for 2013, earnings per worker in
Côte d’Ivoire was estimated at around CFAF 97,266, or only US$197 per month, which is below the average
for Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1.13b).10 Reﬂecting poverty trends, average earnings have not increased much
over the last decade due to rapid demographic changes as well as limited economic growth through 2011
(Figure 1.13a). Since then, economic growth led to an increase in average earnings that was already visible in
2012, and that is likely to have continued until recently, even though more recent data are not yet available.
Measures of productivity by employment type illustrate the concentration of employment in low-pro-
ductivity occupations. Macroeconomic data on GDP composition can be combined with microeconomic
data on employment to derive measures of earnings and productivity by employment type. Agricultural and
nonagricultural self-employment occupy over three-fourths of the employed population. Yet on average these
activities are the least productive, providing average earning per worker of CFAF 63,944 (or US$129) per month.
While less than 20 percent of workers are employed in wage jobs and less than 10 percent in formal wage jobs,
earnings in the formal sector are on average CFAF 306,477 (or US$523) per month (World Bank, 2015). These
comparisons illustrate the strong income inequalities stemming from the employment proﬁle in Côte d’Ivoire.

     The presentation of macroeconomic data on earnings is based on World Bank (2015). Unless noted otherwise, earnings per worker are
     computed in real GDP for 2013 (PPP for 2009) divided by the employed population. The indicator is a measure of worker productivity. It is
     however not necessarily equal to wages: in theory, wages would be equal to marginal productivity, not average productivity.

                                                                                                                                                            30
Large welfare differences are also found across individuals and employment types in micro data. Table
1.5 presents the share of individuals in various employment types by poverty status or welfare quintiles (based
on per capita consumption). The share of individuals in agricultural self-employment decreases strongly along
the welfare distribution, with 63.1 percent of the poor occupied in agriculture, and only 35.8 percent of indi-
viduals in the top welfare quintile. By contrast, only 11.1 percent of the poor have wage jobs (which are mostly
informal), compared to 29.6 percent of individuals in the top quintile. The share of individuals in nonagricultural
self-employment increases slightly along the welfare distribution. Overall, these patterns point to large variations
in earnings within all types of employment.

Strong variations are also observed in average worker productivity by sector (Figure 1.14, World Bank, 2015).
Agriculture and commerce occupy three-fourths of the population, yet these activities are also the least produc-
tive. Average earnings are estimated at CFAF 39,612 per month in agriculture, and CFAF 52,125 per month in
commerce. Sectors with the highest earnings are also those with the smallest employment shares. For instance,
the ﬁnance or extractive industry sectors have average earnings of 2.3, respectively CFAF 1.6 million per month.
Yet, privileged workers in these sectors amount to less than 0.5 percent of the employed population. Growth

in these sectors has limited employment potential. Finally, there are a range of intermediary sectors, such as

have been increasing since the 2010–2011 post-electoral crisis.


Characteristics of the most common employment types
Only a minority of individuals in Côte d’Ivoire have wage jobs, and among them formal employment
in the private sector is also the exception. Of the employed population, 22.8 percent hold wage jobs, which
includes 3.9 percent of wage workers in the public sector, 3.7 percent of wage workers in the formal private
sector, and 15.1 percent of wage workers in the informal private sector (including apprentices). Therefore,
over 65 percent of wage jobs are informal, that is not based on any type of written or oral contract and not
subject to labor regulations. Even excluding the public sector, the majority of private wage jobs are informal in
the economy. Informality in wage employment is particularly common for individuals with lower educational
achievement. Over 80 percent of individuals with less than secondary education who have wage jobs do not
have a written or oral contract (Figure 1.15). They often work in daily casual wage jobs. Formal jobs become the
norm only for the wage employed who have completed secondary education. Strikingly, for the more educated,
public wage jobs are more prevalent that wage employment in the formal sector.
Most wage employment takes place in small ﬁrms and in the services sector. In February 2014, nearly
72 percent of all wage employment was in the service sectors, with only 12 percent in industry and manufactur-
ing. In the formal wage sector, the share of services is even higher (82.9 percent, Figure 1.16). In line with the
prevalence of informal wage employment, small ﬁrms account for most wage employment. In fact, 50 percent
of wage employment takes place in ﬁrms with ﬁve workers or fewer (Figure 1.17).
Chapter 5 provides a detailed review of past trends and assesses the prospects for formal job creation
in Côte d’Ivoire using a unique ﬁrm-level dataset comprising all registered enterprises in Côte d’Ivoire
from 2003 to 2012. The chapter provides an overview of the formal sector, describes job creation and ﬁrm
dynamics, examines the determinants of ﬁrm survival and exit, and analyzes wages, job quality, and labor costs.

BOX 1.5: DETERMINANTS OF EARNINGS IN WAGE EMPLOYMENT
Table B1.5.1 presents the results of estimated earnings regressions for individuals in wage employment. Overall,
earnings increase with age for all wage workers, though at a decreasing rate. Furthermore, one more year of
education increases earnings between 3 and 6 percent. Men earn substantially more than women, particularly in
nonagricultural wage employment.

We perform Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to investigate whether wage diﬀerentials between men and women are
explained by diﬀerences in observed characteristics between the two groups. Diﬀerences in individual character-
istics between men and women appear to explain most of the diﬀerential; with age and education accounting for
an important part of the diﬀerence (Table B1.5.2).

Nonagricultural self-employment in household enterprises accounts for 29.7 percent of employment
in Côte d’Ivoire. The large share of employment in nonagricultural household enterprises is often overlooked.
Yet individual microenterprises are a key source of employment, particularly for the poor and women. Most
of nonagricultural self-employment takes place in microenterprises owned and operated by the household
(Figure 1.18). Self-employed individuals working for themselves in small-scale commerce or service activities
account for 65.9 percent of employment in the sector. Of the individual enterprises, 22 percent include the
owner as well as unpaid family helpers from the same household. Only a small share of individual enterprises
(approximately 10.4 percent) relies on workers from outside the households. As such, this sector includes house-
hold enterprises of very different nature than formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that mostly rely on
wage workers.The median individual in nonagricultural self-employment tends to be young female with no
formal education. The majority of household enterprises are in small-scale service activities, and almost all are

informal. At the same time, they are not short-lived — 75 percent of household enterprises operate year-round,
and over 80 percent have been in operation for ﬁve years or more.
Chapter  4 provides a detailed description of the nonagricultural self-employment (household
enterprise) sector. It discusses who operates in the sector and why, and what are the most common types of
activities. In light of very large heterogeneity in productivity in the sector, the chapter then addresses constraints
for individuals to create or operate nonagricultural self-employment activities in Côte  d’Ivoire, as well as
determinants of household enterprises’ productivity.
In terms of agricultural self-employment, farming is dominated by smallholders who are relatively
well endowed with land and fairly market-oriented. Four in ﬁve smallholders sell at least some of their
output, with one in ﬁve reporting to sell their complete harvest. In other words, most farmers engage with the
market and have moved well beyond farming for subsistence only (Table 1.6). Close to 30 percent of households
reported selling 100 percent of their agricultural production. This includes the sale of food and cash crops. As
such, the data suggest that the vast majority of selling households are growing and marketing both cash and
food crops, while very few of them specialize in food crops or subsistence agriculture. Around half of selling
households are producing (and selling) both cash and food crops. Those focusing only on the production and
sale of cash crops represent 32.7 percent. Only 17.2 percent of selling households are growing and marketing
only food crops. Unlike selling households, non-selling households are more specialized in food crops. Close to
47 percent of them grew food crops only.

Agricultural households rely heavily on labor from other households, in addition to family labor. About
45.9 percent of households hire agricultural labor and 42.4 percent beneﬁt from the assistance of relatives to
work on their farm. Only 28.9 percent of the households rely only on family labor. The average number of hired
labor per household is close to ﬁve persons. A great number of relatives (unpaid labor) were also engaged on
the household’s farm. The average number of relatives that worked on the household’s farm is around four
persons. Overall, these data from agricultural households suggest a relative high use of labor from other house-
holds (including from migration), although the employment data mentioned above only suggests a small share
of overall employment in agricultural wage employment.
Chapter 3 further describes agricultural self-employment and entry points to maximize agriculture’s contribu-
tion to the jobs agenda in Côte d’Ivoire. The chapter begins with a brief proﬁle of smallholder agriculture. It
then outlines the opportunities and challenges it presents for advancing the jobs agenda, both by increasing
productivity, earnings and jobs directly within agriculture, as well as further down the chain. Special attention
goes to the labor aspects of agriculture, and areas which hold promise, but which have received somewhat less
attention so far, such as rice. Some of the other cash crop sectors also hold promise to generate better employ-
ment opportunities if challenges in the value chains can be addressed.

1.2 EMPLOYMENT TRENDS IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
The ﬁrst part of this chapter provided a picture of the current employment situation in Côte d’Ivoire in February
2014. The second part of this chapter assesses trends in the composition of employment over time. Speciﬁcally,
it builds comparable indicators between 2002 and 2015, covering the crisis period as well as more recent
recovery.11 By analyzing trends between 2002 and 2015, the chapter highlights the underlying demographic
evolution in the working-age population in Côte d’Ivoire, as well as changes in the composition of employment
across the main sectors of employment.

1.2.1 Working-age population, labor force, and unemployment over time
Côte d’Ivoire is undergoing fast demographic changes. The absolute size of the employed and unemployed
population is largely driven by demographic forces. Changes in the composition of the labor force are more
nuanced, and the participation and employment rates are relatively more stable over time. As such, demographic
forces and the increase in the size of the population are the main drivers of the absolute numbers of people
unemployed or employed in the various employment types. In terms of magnitude, changes in the composition
of the labor force and employment are second-order to the broader demographic changes.
Demographics are driving large changes in the size of the working-age population and labor force
(Figure 1.19). In 2002, there were 10.3 million individuals in the working-age population (60.8 percent of the
overall population), with 7.1 million individuals in the labor force. As a result of demographic growth, the work-
ing-age and active populations have strongly increased over the last decade. By February 2014, the working-age
population was estimated to have increased to 14.5 million individuals (62.5 percent of the total population),
with 11.1 million individuals in the labor force.
Reﬂecting the increase in the size of the labor force, the size of the employed population has also
increased strongly over time. The size of the employed population increased from 6.7 million in 2002 to 10.4
million in February 2014. As will be further discussed below, the large increase in the employed population is
mainly driven by the combination of the demographic growth in the working-age population and the fact that the
vast majority of the population is self-employed. In this context, the vast majority of ‘employment creation’ occurs
though individuals entering the working-age population and creating self-employed occupations for themselves.
Given the demographic trends, the number of unemployed individuals has also strongly increased
over time. The number of unemployed individuals grew from an estimated 350,000 individuals in 2002, to

     The chapter analyzes employment data from the 2002, 2008, and 2015 nationally representative household surveys, in addition to the
     2012 and 2014 nationally representative employment surveys. Table A.1 in Annex A provides key summary statistics with their conﬁdence
     interval, to gauge the signiﬁcance of changes over time.

                                                                                                                                                      36
an estimated 750,000 individuals in 2014. In particular, the number of unemployed individuals grew strongly
between 2008 and 2012 due to the combined effect of demographic growth and the 2010–2011 post-electoral
crisis, to peak at 925,000 individuals in 2012.
Beyond the absolute numbers, the labor-force participation rate and employment-to-work-
ing-age-population ratio have slowly increased over time. Labor-force participation increased by 8.7
percentage points between 2002 and 2014; from 68.1 percent of the working-age population to 76.8 percent
(Figure 1.20). The employment-to-working-age-population ratio measures the share of individuals employed
over the total working-age population. This ratio was 64.6 in 2002, and increased to 71.7 percent in 2014.
The employment-population ratio plateaued between 2008 and 2012, before increasing again in the post-crisis
recovery period. The increase of the employment-to-working-age-population ratio is mostly explained by the
increase in labor-force participation over the same period.
The unemployment rate increased in the aftermath of the 2011 crisis before going down in 2014.
Despite a growing number of unemployed individuals, the unemployment rate is low overall. The unemployment
rate was estimated at 5 percent in 2002, decreasing to 3.8 percent in 2008, before rising sharply to 8.7 percent
in 2012 in the aftermath of the post-electoral crisis. The unemployment rate dropped slightly to 6.7 percent in
February 2014 and remained stable through 2015 (Figure 1.21).
While patterns of labor-force participation by gender have been stable over time, women have
become more likely to be unemployed than men. The labor-force participation rate for women is lower than
their male counterparts, but the difference has remained similar over time, from 2002 to 2015 (Figure 1.22). In
contrast, the unemployment rate for women started out in the early 2000s at around 4.4 percent, but rose to
reach 9.4 percent in February 2014. On the contrary, the unemployment rate for men dropped to 4.5 percent
in February 2014 from 5.6 percent in 2002 (Figure 1.23).
Focusing on more recent trends, since the 2011 crisis, strong growth has led to higher employment and
lower unemployment. As discussed above, the changes in absolute numbers of the active and employed pop-
ulation are largely driven by fast demographic changes in Côte d’Ivoire, including the 350,000 to 400,000 young
people who are estimated to join the working-age population each year.12 Between November 2012 and February
2014, an estimated 700,000 additional individuals became employed. This reﬂects an increase in the working-age
population, a faster increase in the active population (from 75 percent to 76.8 percent of the working-age pop-
ulation), an increase in employment (from 91.3 percent to 93.3 percent of the active population), as well as a
decrease in unemployment (from 8.7 percent to 6.7 percent of the active population) (Table 1.7).Preliminary data
available for 2016 suggest a continuing increase in labor-force participation and decrease in unemployment.

1.2.2 The composition of employment over time
We now describe the evolution of the composition of employment in Côte d’Ivoire, by showing how the shares
of employed individuals in wage employment, nonagricultural self-employment, and agricultural self-employ-
ment have been evolving.13
Formal wage employment has remained relatively low over the last decade, with self-employment
consistently accounting for over 80 percent of employment. Overall, the share of individuals holding wage
jobs has increased a little between 2002 and 2014, from 15.8 percent to 22.8 percent (Figure 1.24). As such,
informal employment in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment has remained the main source of
employment opportunities over the last decade, with little change overall in their predominant role in the struc-
ture of employment in Côte d’Ivoire.
A diminishing share of employment in agriculture has mainly been compensated by increases in
nonagricultural self-employment. Most people have been working and still work in agricultural and nonag-
ricultural self-employment (Figure 1.24). While the share of agricultural self-employment has been decreasing
over time, it is mainly the share of employment in nonagricultural self-employment that has increased. In par-
ticular, the share of agricultural self-employment diminished strongly between 2008 and 2014, and the share
of nonagricultural self-employment increased during that period.
These trends in the composition of employment are broadly comparable to those observed across Sub-
Saharan Africa. To provide some perspectives, Figure 1.25 compares the percentage change in employment
share by employment sectors across a range of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa where harmonized employment
indicators can be constructed from household surveys. Growth has contributed to shift the structure of employ-
ment away from agriculture in some countries, mostly toward nonagricultural self-employment. Yet in most
countries, that shift has been very slow. For Côte d’Ivoire, the graph displays the changes between 2002 and

2008. It shows that during that period, the employment structure in Côte d’Ivoire has stayed the most stable
relative to comparator countries, with the share of agriculture diminishing little and the share of private wage
jobs increasing little, with a stronger increase in nonagricultural self-employment.
The share of formal wage employment has diminished over time, as informal wage jobs have become
more prevalent (Figure 1.26). The share of informal wage jobs increased from 38.7 percent in 2002 to 59.8
percent in 2014. In contrast, the share of public wage jobs and formal private wage jobs decreased strongly
between 2002 and 2014 (Figure 1.26). Taken together, the formal wage sector (including the private and
public sectors) accounted for 8.1 percent of employed individuals in 2002, and 6.3 percent in 2014. There are
some signs that the crisis contributed to disrupt the formal modern wage sector. This evidence from micro-level
employment trends reﬂects some broader evidence from ﬁrm-level data on the effects of the crisis on ﬁrm pro-
ductivity (see Chapter 5 in this report).
While the predominance of self-employment has changed relatively little over time, the sectoral
composition of employment has evolved, especially with a decrease in the agricultural sector and an
increase in the service sector. The share of agricultural employment declined by more than 14 percentage
points between 2002 (63.4 percent) and 2014 (51.1 percent). Over the same period, the share of employment
in services increased from 30.4 percent to 42.1 percent (Figure 1.27).

The increases of employment in the service and manufacturing sectors have to be interpreted carefully
as they have mostly been in self-employment, not in wage employment. The share of wage employment
in the service and manufacturing sectors increased slightly to 18.4 percent in 2015 from 14.5 percent in 2002.
However, it is rather the increase in the share of self-employment in these sectors that has counterbalanced the
decrease in the share of employment in agriculture. In 2015, the share of self-employment in the service and
manufacturing sector was 30.4 percent compared with 22.1 percent in 2002. Self-employment in the manu-
facturing sector includes the low-productivity basic food-processing activities (Figure 1.28).

1.3 CONCLUSION
This chapter started by describing the employment situation in Côte d’Ivoire and highlighted its broad impli-
cations for employment policy. Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by a young population with high labor-force
participation. Unemployment is relatively low, although with higher prevalence among educated youths in urban
areas. The main employment challenge in Côte d’Ivoire stems from a high concentration of employment in agri-
cultural and nonagricultural self-employment, and from a lack of formal wage employment. Underemployment
is mostly characterized by individuals working in activities providing limited earnings. In this sense, the provision
of better jobs — of all type, including in self-employment — to generate higher earnings is a key employment
challenge for the near future. The recent employment situation highlights particular challenges for quality of
employment and productive inclusion outside Abidjan, for the poor and for women.
This chapter also reviewed jobs trends in Côte d’Ivoire between 2002 and 2015. In the past decade, demo-
graphics have been the main driving forces of the size of the working-age population, active, employed and
unemployed population. Trends in employment data also indicate signs of a widening gender gap in inactivity
and unemployment. Employment in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment remained preponderant
over the last decade, with a decrease in agricultural self-employment counterbalanced by an increase in nonagri-
cultural self-employment. Over the same period, the share of wage employment increased, although there were
signs that the share of formal wage employment has not increased much. Overall, formal wage employment
has remained the exception in Côte d’Ivoire. More recently, growth has not strongly changed the structure of
employment, for instance between 2012 and 2015. The majority of additional individuals who became employed
after the post-electoral crisis still work in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment. The next chapter
discusses patterns in structural transformation and assesses at the implications for future employment outlooks in
Côte d’Ivoire. As will be illustrated, in the medium term, even in presence of strong growth in the modern wage
sector, the majority of employment is expected to remain in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment,
in line with patterns for the broader region.
Since most people who join the labor force are employed, and demographics largely drive the absolute number
of employed individuals in the economy, a focus on the number of jobs in the economy, or overall ‘job creation’
is missing the core employment challenge in Côte d’Ivoire, which mostly relates to the composition and quality
of employment. In this context, a broader jobs strategy that centers on ‘better jobs’ and the issue of ‘produc-
tive inclusion’ for the poor, women and rural populations could address more directly the central challenges
of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity in the short to medium term. The objective of an inclusive
jobs strategy would go well beyond counting the number of new formal wage jobs created. It would seek to
improve earnings and inclusive employment across all occupations, including in agricultural and nonagricultural
self-employment where the majority of the population will remain employed for the foreseeable future. As such,
the rest of this report invites to expand policy discussions on employment from a focus on the number of jobs
and unemployment to a broader attention to the quality, inclusiveness, and productivity of jobs.

BOX 1.6: IMPACTS OF LABOR-INTENSIVE PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMS ON EMPLOYMENT QUALITY
The impact evaluation of the labor-intensive public works program of the Youth Employment and Skills Development
Project (PEJEDEC) illustrates how employment programs can increase employment quality in Côte d’Ivoire. Short-
term results show that the public works program only increases slightly the share of youths who are employed.
This is consistent with the observation that unemployment is relatively low and that most youths are engaged in
informal jobs. In this context, the main impact of the program is to change the composition of employment by
allowing youths to access better-paying wage jobs. Beyond impacts on economic indicators, participation in the
public works program also improves attitudes and “psychological well-being”, including self-esteem and aspirations
towards the future. Overall, youths’ well-being improves strongly during the program.
The impact evaluation study also documents that short-term impacts are very heterogeneous. A sub-group of
participants, including the most vulnerable who indicate that they would be willing to work for a lower wage, as well
as women, beneﬁt very strongly from the program in economic terms. At the same time, the program attracts a
substantial number of youths who are less vulnerable and beneﬁt little in economic terms. Less vulnerable youths’
psychological well-being still improves. In the end, the short-term eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of the public-works
program could be improved by explicitly targeting the most vulnerable individuals and women. This would also
promote productive inclusion of the most disadvantaged groups.

2 JOBS WITHIN THE STRUCTURAL
2:
TRANSFORMATION — INSIGHTS FOR
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Luc Christiaensen and Gabriel Lawin
A well-rounded jobs strategy seeks to generate more and better jobs so as to accelerate poverty
reduction and foster shared prosperity. This suggests particular emphasis on raising earnings for the poorer
(say bottom 40 percent) and more marginalized segments of society. Broadly speaking, this can be achieved
either by increasing employment and productivity within the sectors where the poor currently are (agriculture
and rural areas), or by facilitating shifts to sectors where labor productivity is higher. Agricultural and informal
activities are hereby typically seen as less productive, and nonagricultural and formal activities as more productive.
Each approach (fostering intrasectoral productivity growth versus intersectoral labor shifts) entails
somewhat different policy interventions. Those focused on fostering intrasectoral productivity growth aim to
get the macro-fundamentals and business environment right, which beneﬁts all sectors, possibly complemented
with targeted sectoral initiatives to increase labor productivity within sectors (for example, through technolog-
ical development and capital accumulation). By affecting the difference in labor productivity between sectors,
the latter also affect incentives for intersectoral labor movements. But intersectoral labor mobility can also be
encouraged more directly, through the removal of barriers to cross-sectoral movements. The release of labor
out of agriculture could for instance be facilitated by removing land tenure insecurity (which also fosters land
improvement and thus long-term agricultural productivity growth) or by providing information services about
employment opportunities off the farm.
Historically, as countries developed, the share of labor in agriculture decreased, ﬁrst counterbalanced
by a corresponding increase in nonagricultural self-employment, and over a longer period also formal
wage employment. These transformations usually also come along with urbanization, through rural-urban
migration as well as in situ urbanization of rural centers, and formalization. Similar patterns of structural, spatial,
and (to a much lesser degree) institutional transformation have started to take place in Côte d’Ivoire and are
expected to continue over the next decade. So, what then is the right balance between these different policy
approaches for Côte d’Ivoire today? How much movement between sectors, across space, and toward more
formal forms of employment can and should be strived for today, especially when taking inclusive employment
generation as the overarching objective?
This chapter ﬁrst reviews the key insights from theory and the historical experience, in light of Côte d’Ivoire’s own
comparative advantage and its evolvement along the structural transformation. In doing so, particular emphasis
goes to inclusive job creation. The jobs potential for agriculture under the structural transformation is discussed
ﬁrst (section 2.1), followed by an elaboration of the role of the nonfarm sector and proximity (section 2.2). To
further deepen the empirical perspective and gauge the relative importance of the different sectors for inclusive
employment in the near future, projections of where individuals are expected to work in Côte d’Ivoire over the
next decade are presented in section 2.3. These draw on the conceptual and historical insights from sections
2.1 and 2.2, past trends, and macroeconomic growth forecasts. The chapter concludes by suggesting a three-
pronged approach to generating more, better, and inclusive employment (section 2.4): (a) modernize agriculture,
(b) expand productive employment opportunities off the farm and outside the large cities, and (c) support the

livelihoods of those left behind. This sets the stage for Chapters 3–5, which elaborate on the speciﬁc possibilities
and challenges of the main employment opportunities in Côte d’Ivoire today. Chapter 3 identiﬁes opportunities
and guiding principles to maximize the contribution of agriculture. The critical issue of raising productivity in
nonagricultural household enterprises (the informal sector) is assessed in Chapter 4. The trends and prospects
for the creation of wage jobs in formal ﬁrms are discussed in Chapter 5. An in-depth discussion of the critical
complementary role of social protection falls beyond the scope of the report.14


2.1 JOBS POTENTIAL FOR AGRICULTURE

2.1.1 Agriculture’s jobs paradox
As households get richer, the demand for food as a share of total spending goes down and so does
the demand from agriculture for labor. It has been widely observed across history that as countries develop,
the share of agriculture in the economy and employment declines (Figure 2.1). These structural and occupational
transformations at the macro level reﬂect people’s demand behavior at the micro level, that is, their relatively
larger demand for non-food than for food as they get richer.15 As a result, the share of spending on food declines
as incomes rise (widely known as Engel’s Law), even though, in absolute terms, spending on food still increases.
At the macro level this translates in a declining share of agriculture in GDP as countries develop, as well as a
declining share of employment in agriculture.
From the supply side, labor is generally found to be more productive outside agriculture than in it.
According to the national accounts, the value added per laborer outside agriculture is, in developing countries,
on average 4.5 times the value added per laborer in agriculture. In middle-income countries, the ratio is 3.4, and
in high-income countries, 2.2.16 Within African countries, nonagricultural labor is 6 times more productive. These
large productivity gaps at the initial stages of development and the subsequent convergence process suggest
that there is a lot to be gained from moving people out of agriculture. It has also given rise to a popular view
that the sectoral movement of people out of agriculture is a causal driver — rather than a manifestation — of
development. In this view, the marginal productivity of labor in agriculture is virtually zero, such that labor can
be removed from agriculture without (much) loss of output.

So, what can then be the contribution of agriculture to a country’s jobs agenda, besides releasing labor?
Both these labor supply and demand side perspectives on the role of agriculture would suggest that increas-
ing labor productivity during the structural transformation should mainly happen through a reduction of the
agricultural labor force and that to do so, policies should especially focus on removing barriers to sectoral (and
spatial) migration. Yet, even though popular, there are a number of important caveats to these perspectives.
For example, recent evidence indicates that the frequently cited agricultural productivity gap measures based
on the national accounts abstract from a series of confounding factors and measurement issues, which exag-
gerate the gap. This suggests that the gains from sectoral movements, and thus the incentives to move, may
not be as large as commonly purported. Furthermore, the view that labor is less productive in agriculture — a
viewpoint that is especially well established in macro policy circles — has often also been taken as evidence that
labor in agriculture is intrinsically less productive, and thus less worthy of investment. This sits oddly with the
agricultural success stories of agro-exporters such as the United States and the Netherlands, and more recently
also Vietnam, Chile, and Peru.
There are also caveats to the somewhat more pessimistic perspective from the demand side. While Engel’s Law
holds globally, its strength at the national level depends on the tradability and comparative advantage of the
countries’ agricultural commodities. Furthermore, part of the declining demand for labor in agriculture, following
the lower (relative) demand for staples as incomes rise, will be offset by the increasing demand for higher-value
and processed agricultural products as countries and their populations get richer. This creates new jobs on the
farm, but increasingly also off the farm, in the expanding agricultural value chains and agribusinesses that is in
extended agriculture. The latter effects are currently largely hidden in the numbers as they are largely incorpo-
rated in the manufacturing (food processing, machinery) and service (storage, transport, wholesale, retail) sectors
of the national accounts. Yet, it is argued that it is exactly the extent to which countries manage to transform
their agriculture away from staple crops, as they get richer and their staple crop productivity reaches sufﬁciently
high levels, which determines whether they can generate productive employment for the poor and sustain the
pace of rural poverty reduction.
The following two subsections examine these labor supply and demand side considerations within
the context of Côte d’Ivoire. The working hypothesis is that, in general, as countries accelerate their develop,
and in Côte d’Ivoire today in particular, there is still a lot of scope for increasing earnings of the poor within
agriculture. Increasing labor productivity in agriculture is also needed to help facilitate the labor movement out
of agriculture (see section 2.2), which will in turn become more important as agricultural labor productivity
increases and Engel’s Law becomes more binding. This is not to say that facilitating labor movement out of
agriculture is not part of the process, but rather to emphasize that lots of unexploited inclusive jobs potential
remains in agriculture, which should be realized, also to facilitate the agricultural labor exit itself.

2.1.2 Agriculture’s labor productivity
First, new micro evidence suggests that the incentives for labor productivity gains from exiting agri-
culture are substantially less than commonly purported. Until today, the agricultural labor productivity
gap is usually calculated from the macro data, by comparing the value added in nonagriculture per person
primarily employed in nonagriculture with the value added in agriculture per person primarily employed in
agriculture. Yet scrutiny of both the macro output and labor input measures suggests that they bias the gap
to the detriment of agriculture, and that the bias increases the poorer and less advanced countries are in their
structural transformation.
To see this, note that labor input (the denominator) is typically proxied by the number of people who
have their primary occupation in agriculture (or nonagriculture). They do not account for differences in
actual hours worked or differences in human capital. After controlling for these sectoral differences in labor
efforts using additional information from household surveys, Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) demonstrate,
for example, that the average ratio of nonagricultural to agricultural labor productivity among African coun-
tries reduces from 6 to 3.3. Similarly, Vollrath (2013) ﬁnds that sectoral misallocation of labor explained only
12 percent of the cross-country income variation in his sample of 42 countries, when correcting the sectoral


                                                                                                                      47
employment numbers from FAO17 for sectoral differences in time use and educational achievements, as opposed
to 32 percent, when using unadjusted sectoral employment.18
Twelve percent is still a signiﬁcant amount of variation, especially when considering that educational differences
are usually thought to explain 10–15 percent of cross-country income variation. But it is signiﬁcantly less than
what has been reported commonly, with the simulated gains from sectoral labor reallocation much lower than
commonly assumed, and most likely still an upper bound. For example, turning to the sectoral output measure
(the numerator), which is typically obtained from the national accounts, this is also bound to exert further
upward bias on the gap. Across 10 countries, Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) estimated the labor effort
adjusted nonagricultural to agricultural productivity ratio19 to be on average 2.6 when using sectoral value added
from the macro data versus 2.2 when estimating sectoral value added from the household surveys. National
accounts tend to miss food produced for own consumption, for example, which in low-income countries often
makes up an important part of total agricultural output.20 Accounting for differences in capital intensity would
bring the gap down further, especially in resource-rich countries, of which Africa counts many.
Along these lines, recent extension of the work by Gollin, Lagakos, and Waugh (2014) using detailed, carefully
collected nationally representative micro data on sectoral income and time use from four African countries
shows that the agricultural productivity gap can drop to well under two when using micro data and controlling
for the actual number of hours worked (Figure 2.2) (McCullough forthcoming).21 The labor productivity and
earning gains from intersectoral labor movement, while real, are substantially less than commonly purported.
Add to this the cost of moving, and the lower rural-to-urban migration rates observed in Sub-Saharan Africa
(De Brauw, Mueller, and Lee 2014) pose less of a surprise. Furthermore, the large drop in the labor productivity
gap when expressed per actual time input suggests that agriculture is not intrinsically less productive, and thus
in principle equally worthy of investment to raise labor productivity.22
The observation of lesser than expected productivity gain from intersectoral labor movement also
applies to Côte d’Ivoire. From the micro data, average net nonagricultural labor productivity per person pri-
marily self-employed in Abidjan, other urban, and rural areas is 4.8, 3.7, and 3.1 times higher than in agriculture,
respectively. As in other countries, accounting for educational differences across sectors/locations and the lower
number of hours worked in agriculture would bring these gaps down substantially. While the data available do
not permit a direct estimation of the agricultural productivity gap accounting for these factors,23 back-of-the
envelope calculations suggest that they would come down to about a factor two.24 Comparing daily wages by
location and sector of employment and education level can provide further approximations (Table 2.1). Wages
in Abidjan are on average 1.9 to 2.1 times higher than in (rural) agriculture; in other urban areas they are about


17
     These are based on a person’s primary sector of employment.
18
     Maximizing the level of output per capita in each country by equalizing the marginal product of labor between sectors reduced the
     cross-country variation in log output per capita to 68 percent from the observed cross-country variation when using adjusted FAO sec-
     toral employment numbers and to 88 percent when adjusting the FAO sectoral employment numbers for sectoral diﬀerences in labor
     eﬀort (time use and human capital). Vollrath approximated households’ sectoral time use shares using agricultural and nonagricultural
     household income shares under the assumption that within each household households equalize their marginal returns to time across
     occupations. He proxied households’ human capital by multiplying the aggregate number of years of education of the male and female
     workers in each household by their respective returns estimated separately from Mincerian regressions. Calculations are based on the
     RIGA data (http://www.fao.org/economic/riga/rural-income-generating-activities/en/).

     Adjusted for labor input for diﬀerences in hours worked across sectors and diﬀerences in human capital using micro data.
20
     Household surveys, on the other hand, miss out on the production of large farms. Yet, the latter also tend to be more capital intensive, and
     while important from an aggregate output and factor compensation perspective (the perspective taken by the national accounts), their
     inclusion is less relevant when comparing labor productivity among the poorer segments of society, which are mainly smallholder farmers
     and the focus of the discussion.

     Testimony to the huge productivity potential of the agricultural sector are, for example, American, Dutch, Chinese, and Brazilian agriculture.
23
     In addition to family labor, households also rely on mutual labor exchange arrangements whose contribution can be substantial. Yet in the
     available data they are only expressed in terms of person contributions and not in person days (or hours). This prevents a direct replica-
     tion of the calculations made by McCullough (forthcoming) (as in Figure 2.2).
24
     Adjustments are made based on the estimated ratios in educational achievement and hours worked across nonagriculture and agriculture
     (about 25 percent more educational achievement in nonagriculture — 2.52 years of education on average in nonagricultural self employ-
     ment versus 2.05 in agriculture, calculations based on ENSETE, 2013), and about 25 percent less hours worked (about 2000 hours of work
     outside agriculture compared with around 1600 in agriculture — Figure 2.3).

1.5 times higher. This is clearly much smaller than the agricultural productivity gaps previously mentioned. The
respective gaps further decline when controlling for the level of education.25 Controlling for differences in cost
of living as well as differences in capital intensity would further reduce the gap. Again, this is not to say that
there are no labor productivity gains from intersectoral labor movements,26 but rather that the gains are much
less than anticipated at ﬁrst sight. It redirects attention to the need for intrasectoral labor productivity gains.

                To see this compare the ratio of nonagricultural over agricultural wages for workers with higher education with the ratio of nonagricultural
                over agricultural wages for workers without education.
26
                The limited diﬀerences in nominal wages suggest that wage labor markets in Côte d’Ivoire are reasonably integrated and that sectoral
                wage labor misallocation is relatively limited (as in Vietnam, see Trung and Oostendorp, 2017), especially for the unskilled, whose labor
                productivity is the primary focus of the report. Yet, as in other countries (Vietnam and Tanzania, Nerman (2015)), there remains also a
                signiﬁcant gap between the average rural nonagricultural and agricultural market wage rates (mostly ﬂuctuating around CFAF 1,900 per
                day, Table 2.2) and the average shadow wage in agricultural self-employment (estimated at CFAF 884 per day applying Nerman’s meth-
                odology to ENSETE 2013). While less than in Vietnam (where the agricultural shadow wages/rural market wage ratio is about 25 percent,
                compared with 45 percent in Côte d’Ivoire), it remains suggestive of some market segmentation (between wage and agricultural self-em-
                ployment) and possibly labor surplus/underemployment in agriculture. The reasons behind this gap (for example, food security concerns/
                preferences for own crops, the seasonal nature of agricultural productivity, lack of demand for nonagricultural goods and services and
                thus lack of nonagricultural self-employment or wage opportunities, constraints (credit, skills) to entering nonagricultural self- employ-
                ment, work preferences) remain however poorly understood (Nerman 2015; Trung and Oostendorp 2017).

Second, large heterogeneity in agricultural labor productivity points to important opportunities for
productivity gains within agriculture. Comparing the distributions of (net) labor productivity in Côte d’Ivoire, in
agriculture and self-employment in rural, other urban, and Abidjan (Figure 2.3) conﬁrms that average labor produc-
tivity (per person primarily employed in the sector) is highest in Abidjan (with other urban a close second). It is lowest
for agriculture, with rural self-employment in between. The ﬁgure further shows that there is large heterogeneity in
each of these activities, including in agriculture. This suggests substantial scope for raising agricultural labor produc-
tivity, even under existing agronomic practices. Simply bringing those currently operating at the 25th percentile of
the agricultural labor productivity distribution to the 75th percentile would increase net labor productivity per person
7.8 times.27 Similarly large gains can be obtained among those primarily employed in rural self-employment.28 The
substantial scope for intrasectoral productivity increase has also been observed in other countries.29
Closing the agricultural productivity gap will partly require addressing agricultural underemployment
which can also be done within agriculture. Part of the heterogeneity in agricultural labor productivity follows
from underemployment in agriculture. Yet this should not be taken to undermine Côte d’Ivoire’s potential for
raising labor productivity within agriculture. As shown in Figure 2.4, people primarily employed in agriculture work
substantially fewer hours on an annual basis than those primarily engaged in nonagricultural activities (Figure 2.4),
which, as shown above, explains a signiﬁcant part of the agricultural per person productivity gap. It also indicates
that agriculture is not intrinsically less productive, and thus equally worthy of investment.30



27
     Given that agricultural underemployment is less pronounced in Côte d’Ivoire (compared with some of the other countries featured in
     Figure 2.3), measures to reduce agricultural underemployment as well as those that increase output per hour worked will be needed. See
     Chapter 3 for a more detailed discussion.
28
     The within sectoral productivity gap may narrow somewhat, when expressed in net terms, at least to the extent that higher labor produc-
     tivity results from higher use and spending on inputs.
29
     For Uganda, Christiaensen and Kaminski (2016) calculated net labor productivity in farming, and rural and self-employment from the
     nationally representative 2009 Living Standard Measurement Study-Integrated Survey on Agriculture. They ﬁnd both the average (as
     well as the spread) of net labor productivity in farming to be smaller than among the self-employed in rural areas. Moving farmers from
     the 25th to the 75th percentile in the distribution would increase their labor productivity 4.5 times. A similar move among self-employed
     people in rural areas would increase their productivity by a factor 10, though, given the larger spread, they would also start at a 40 percent
     lower productivity.
30
     The signiﬁcant sectoral diﬀerence in estimated time use accounts also for the larger share of labor eﬀort adjustments and the decline in
     the agricultural productivity gap in Vollrath (2013, Table 3) (two-thirds on average due diﬀerences in time use versus one-third due to dif-
     ferences in educational achievements). Yet full cost-beneﬁt analysis is needed to compare the returns with other investment opportunities.

                                                                                                                                                      50

Note: Net labor productivity is measured as the ratio of net output per person primarily employed per year. In the self-employment sector,
net output is the value of annual proﬁt.

Agricultural underemployment is also present in Côte d’Ivoire, albeit less pronounced than in the comparator
countries (Figure 2.4) (with those primarily employed in agriculture working on average about 1,600 hours per
year versus about 2,000 hours among those primarily working outside agriculture).31 This lower underemploy-
ment is consistent with the greater importance of cash crops and the greater use of hired labor (Chapter 3), the
country’s further evolvement in the structural transformation, and its high degree of urbanization (see section
2.2). Moreover, underemployment among those primarily occupied in agriculture can also be addressed within
agriculture. Agricultural underemployment may, for example, be related to the seasonal nature of agricultural
production, characterized by periods of peak labor demand during which those primarily in agriculture cannot
work off farm, as well as periods of relative idleness. It may then become difﬁcult to engage with nonagricul-
tural activities whose production cycles coincide with those of agriculture, or nonagricultural activities that are
capital intensive and in need of continuous operation to be competitive. Underemployment may also arise when
markets are absent or costly to reach, such that surplus production for sale no longer pays and subsistence
farming emerges as the better option.
Yet, technology can help overcome these seasonal constraints, either by relaxing seasonal labor constraints
(for example, through mechanization of seasonal agricultural tasks such as land preparation, weeding) or

           While there is undoubtedly also idle time among those primarily employed in informal self-employment, the data suggest that this is much
           less substantial than among those primarily employed in agriculture, possibly related to the seasonal nature of agricultural production.

                                                                                                                                                               51
by extending the growing season (for example, through irrigation to allow a second crop outside the rainy
season). Mixed farming systems with divergent production cycles (crops and livestock) can also help. The cost
of market access can equally be reduced. Solutions to underemployment in agriculture are thus not conﬁned to
nonagricultural activities, but can equally be found in agriculture, on and off the farm. Also, with agricultural
underemployment less pronounced in Côte d’Ivoire, especially measures that that increase output per hour
worked will be needed. The opportunities and challenges to raise agricultural labor productivity in Côte d’Ivoire
are discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
Third, income generation in agriculture is more poverty reducing. Cross-country evidence has convincingly
shown that GDP growth in agriculture is more poverty reducing than GDP growth originating outside agricul-
ture.32 This holds especially when it concerns extreme poverty, when most of the poor live in rural areas, earning
their living in agriculture,33 and when land is more equally distributed, such that poor smallholders can put both
their assets (labor and land) to work, beneﬁt from them directly, and do so in large numbers. These cross-country
empirical regularities are conﬁrmed in Asia (for example, China)34 as well as in recent African case studies. For
instance, two-thirds of the 4 percentage point reduction in the poverty headcount during 2005–2009 in Uganda
could be accounted for by the increase in earnings among individuals who were working primarily in agriculture
in 2005 and continued doing so through 2009.35 This followed because a large share of the population stayed
in agriculture (49 percent) and many of them were poor, such that even a small drop in their poverty rate corre-
sponded to a large number of people exiting poverty. The bulk of the sharp drop in poverty in Ethiopia during
1996–2011 could similarly be ascribed to growth in the agricultural sector.36
Yet, income generation in agriculture does not always or automatically lead to poverty reduction. In Brazil,
for example, growth in agriculture did not contribute much to poverty reduction.37 Land in Brazil is unequally
distributed, and its agricultural boom of the past two decades has largely been driven by large-scale, highly
mechanized, skill-intensive agriculture (much of it following the development of the Cerrado for soybean
exports to China). It highlights that the job-generating and poverty-reducing powers of agriculture are further
conditioned by initial conditions (agro-ecological potential and land distribution), production modalities (large
versus small scale) and agricultural policies.
It also does not mean that fostering agriculture will necessarily yield the fastest overall economic growth. A
trade-off between the rate of poverty reduction and overall GDP growth rate is possible, as illustrated by the
experience of Uganda during 2005–2009, where two-thirds of poverty reduction could be ascribed to agricul-
tural income growth among farmers, while two-thirds of overall consumption growth was on the account of
the nonagricultural sector. Half of the latter came from growth in Kampala; the other half from consumption
growth in the rural off-farm sector. Yet, growth in agriculture does not always lag growth elsewhere,38 and the
trade-off needs to be judged in terms of returns to investment as well as its political sustainability over time.
Overall, the available theoretical, empirical and historical evidence overwhelmingly suggests an
important role for agricultural productivity growth to increase the earnings of the poor. The gains
from intersectoral labor reallocation are less than commonly assumed, partly because of somewhat better
labor market integration and lower agricultural underemployment than observed elsewhere. Wide heteroge-
neity in Côte d’Ivoire’s agricultural labor productivity further suggests substantial scope for improvement, and
income growth among smallholder farmers proves to be most effective at generating inclusive employment and
poverty reduction. The conditions to do so are also present in Côte d’Ivoire. More than 50 percent of the active
population and 78 percent of the rural population are still employed in agriculture; agriculture is still largely

     In Brazil, agriculture grew on average 3.7 percent per year during 1996–2014, industry 2.0 percent and services 3.2 percent. At 7.3
     percent and 4.9 percent per year on average, agricultural GDP growth has also been solid in Ethiopia and Rwanda (albeit half the growth
     rate outside agriculture).

smallholder based, and more than 60 percent of the poor are smallholder farmers (World Bank 2011a).39 latest
recent Country Economic Memorandum for Côte d’Ivoire (World Bank 2011b) indicated an annual growth
potential for agriculture over the next decade of at least 5 percent. Since the post-election crisis (2011–2014),
it has been growing at an average of 5.7 percent per year. This does not do away with a continuing role for
facilitating movement out of agriculture, as elaborated upon in section 2.3, but it highlights the continuing need
and potential for raising labor productivity through agriculture at the current juncture.

2.1.3 Agriculture’s future demand for labor
Fourth, global demand for Côte d’Ivoire’s agricultural export commodities points to continuing oppor-
tunities for adding new jobs and increasing earnings in agriculture. The extent to which Engel’s Law acts as
a constraint on the demand for a country’s agricultural products (and labor), depends also on the tradability of its
agriculture, the evolution of global (as opposed to domestic) demand, and the country’s comparative advantage.
The more tradable and competitive its agricultural commodity, the less constrained the country is by domestic
demand and the larger is its agriculture’s potential for generating jobs. The production and export of cash crops,
especially cocoa, but also of coffee, cotton, and palm oil have historically been a cornerstone of Côte d’Ivoire’s
economy and job creation. They also feed other sectors of the economy, particularly agro-processing, commerce,
and transportation and contribute importantly to formal wage job creation, many of them low skilled (Chapter 5).
In Côte d’Ivoire the value of agricultural exports has been expanding rapidly over the past years (at
9.7 percent per year during 2005–2012),40 largely driven by the expansion of cocoa, rubber, cashews,
and palm, which accounted for 26, 13, 4, and 3 percent of the growth, respectively (Figure 2.5). This
was not only driven by an increase in price, but also by an increase in volumes. It is indicative of its agricultural
export potential and reminiscent of the development model followed by Vietnam, which conquered world
markets in the 1990s and 2000s to become one of the largest exporters of rice and coffee. During 1980–2000,
Côte d’Ivoire was still among the top ﬁve world exporters of green coffee (in volume).
Given the predominance of the smallholder or outgrower production model in Côte d’Ivoire for most of
its cash crops, many can beneﬁt from the expansion of export crops. Households in cash crop production
tend to be better off than those growing food only (as estimated from the 2008 household survey data) (World Bank
2011a). Controlling for other factors, per capita consumption was 9 percent higher among cocoa growers compared
with those not growing export crops. Households growing oil palm, rubber, and cotton had even higher per capita
consumption, averaging 10, 17 and 23 percent higher, respectively, than farmers that did not grow export crops.

     Poorer rural households rely heavily on crop production. For the bottom 40 percent, crop production constitutes nearly 70 percent of income.
40
     In real terms (that is, corrected for changes in the terms of trade or the import unit/value index), the value of agricultural exports
     increased by 3.3 percent per year.

                                                                                                                                                                                                          53
But much scope for improvement remains. Reforms in the cocoa sector have already resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in production (from 1.2 million tons in 2009/10 to 1.8 million tons during the 2014/15 campaign).
Diversiﬁcation and expansion into newer crops, such as labor-intensive cashew (especially since the early 2000s),
and adding value, through further processing, also hold a lot of potential for jobs. Since the mid-1990s, cashew
production in Côte d’Ivoire has seen massive expansion. It became the world’s leading exporter of (unshelled)
cashew nuts in 2002 and more than quadrupled its production since, to over 426,000 tons in 2013. But for
now, only around 6 percent of its cashew nuts are processed domestically. The government’s target is to bring
this to 50 percent by 2020. Increasing locally generated added value in cashew, but also cotton, could be crit-
ical for jobs. Both are grown in the central and northern parts of the country, which house many of the poor
and have been hit hard by the longstanding multifaceted crisis. The 2007–2012 experience also shows formal
employment generation in agribusiness ﬁrms teds to beneﬁt the unskilled (see Figure 5.15).
Fifth, the dietary transformation following income growth and urbanization also opens up new demand
for agricultural products and employment on, and increasingly also, off the farm in the value chains. As
countries grow and urbanize, the demand for protein-rich food products, higher-value fruits and vegetables as well
as purchased and packaged products increases. After Engel’s Law, this is the second large Law of Demand, named
after Bennett. This also opens up new jobs opportunities, directly in the production of these products (dairy, meat,
fruits, and vegetables), and indirectly in the associated chains (storage, transport, processing, packaging, wholesale,
and retail). The production of high-value agricultural products tends to be more labor intensive (see also Figure 3.6),
while jobs in the agricultural value chain (especially in agro-processing) are often taken up by women (Table 2.2).
Together they add better earning and more inclusive jobs, mitigating the decline of jobs in staple crop production
as increasing labor productivity in staple production releases labor (given less than unit income elasticity of demand
for staples) and the structural transformation proceeds. Linking changes in dietary patterns to the employment
structure in six East and Southern African countries, Tschirley et al. (2015) project that between 2010 and 2025
about one-quarter of the decline in the farm labor share (3.2 percentage points out of a decline of 13.2) will be
absorbed in food preparation away from home, food manufacturing, and marketing and transport.

Countries that complement a successful structural transformation in response to Engel’s Law with
a successful agricultural transformation in response to Bennett’s Law have historically experienced
the fastest decline in rural poverty reduction. This is well demonstrated by the experience of China and
Vietnam (Figure 2.6).41 Laos and Cambodia still have to embark on their agricultural transformation, while
Indonesia transformed its agriculture away from staples, but lags in its overall structural transformation. Both
the structural and agricultural transformation are least advanced in the Philippines; the rural poverty decline
has advanced least there as well.

2.2 MOVING BEYOND THE FARM

2.2.1 Youth has been leaving agriculture in Côte d’Ivoire, but at a normal pace
Seventh, despite good prospects for new jobs and better earnings within agriculture, over time, most
jobs will be generated outside agriculture. As highlighted in the previous section, the prospects for new,
better, and inclusive jobs in agriculture are particularly good in Côte d’Ivoire (compared to other countries), given
its relatively low staple crop productivity (Chapter 3), its high potential for expanding its labor-intensive cash
crop export and the production and value addition in high-value agricultural products through inclusive value
chain development. Nonetheless, the overarching deeper trend remains toward a decline in the overall share of
agricultural employment over time. This follows from the power of Engel’s Law, which drives the (worldwide)
structural transformation propelled by the lower income elasticity of the demand for food compared to the
demand for non-food.
Often, it is the youth who are inclined to leave agriculture ﬁrst or in greater numbers, also in Côte d’Ivoire.
They tend to better educated, have more degrees of freedom and less to lose, rendering them more mobile.
Difﬁcult access to land (through land scarcity, hereditary laws, or poorly functioning rental markets) or (seasonal)
lack of employment opportunities on the family farm may further drive them off the farm. Looking at actual partic-
ipation shows that youth are indeed less involved in agriculture in Côte d’Ivoire than the older cohorts (Figure 2.7).
Among the 20–34-year-olds (excluding students), 34.5 percent of workers were employed in agriculture in 2008;
among the 35–60-year-olds, the ratio was 49.1 percent or 14.6 percentage points higher. Those who stay tend
to engage full time and work as many hours as the older cohorts, suggesting a high degree of specialization.
So far, youth’s exit out of agriculture has been in line with Côte d’Ivoire’s level of development.
Figure 2.8 presents the age participation gaps (percentage points) (around 2010) for a number of African coun-
tries as a function of their level of development.42 An even higher gap in agricultural participation between the
20–34 and 35–60-year-olds is observed in Nigeria (19 percentage points). The difference is lower in Tanzania and
Uganda (9.2 and 11.2 percentage points, respectively) and much lower in Ethiopia, Malawi, and Niger (5.2, 6.7,
and 2.3 percentage points, respectively). These cross-country differences are broadly consistent with their levels
of development — the higher are their per capita incomes, the further they are in the structural transformation

and the larger is the generational agricultural engagement gap. The rate of decline in agricultural engagement
currently observed across Côte d’Ivoire’s age cohorts is overall consistent with this pattern.43
Nonetheless, a note of caution is in order. The observed agricultural participation gaps are simple cross-sectional
differences between age cohorts. As such, they also reﬂect life cycle issues unrelated to the structural trans-
formation (such as youth starting to work off the farm before returning to farming in attendance of access to
land) and they should be taken as upper bounds. Subtracting the difference in agricultural participation across
age cohorts among the three least-developed countries, which are still at the cusp of their structural transfor-
mation (Ethiopia, Malawi, and Niger), as an indicator of a ‘normal’ age gradient, would reduce Côte d’Ivoire’s
age gradient to about 10 percentage points (from 14.6 in 2008).
Eighth, the road out of agriculture runs also partly through agriculture. Raising agricultural productivity
remains critical to pace the transition out of agriculture and to foster nonfarm employment generation with
broad-based agrarian production structures and inclusive agricultural value chains tending to be especially suc-
cessful. An important share of the demand for nonagricultural products and services and thus nonagricultural
employment, especially for the poorer segments of society, will come from broad-based agricultural growth in the

43
     As expected, between 2008 and 2014, the overall participation rate also continued to decline.

                                                                                                                                                                56
rural hinterlands (and less so from modern wage employment in modern manufacturing). In fact, 70 percent of
the new ‘jobs’ generated between 2012 and 2014 were in self-employment (most of which were in agriculture
on family farms) (Chapter 1). Only 30 percent of new jobs (working for someone else) were wage jobs (mostly
still informal and without contract). Many of the new jobs will also be indirectly linked to agriculture and agri-
business.44 Labor productivity increases across the agricultural subsectors will thus be equally necessary to keep
agriculture competitive with other nonagricultural sectors, so as to retain youth and reap the job opportunities that
the growth in domestic and external demand for agricultural products presents, but also to pace the transition of
labor out of agriculture and foster demand for nonagricultural products and nonfarm employment generation.
Indeed, there might be increasing reluctance to stay engaged in agriculture at current productivity levels, at
least from an aspirational perspective.45 Depending on how the question is asked, two to four in ﬁve current
farmers in Côte d’Ivoire already report to aspire to work outside agriculture.46 This is not surprising as better-off
individuals in rural areas tend to be somewhat more diversiﬁed or specialized in nonagricultural self- and wage
employment, also in Côte d’Ivoire (Figure 2.9). Nonetheless, the decline in agricultural specialization across the
wealth gradient is gradual and even among the wealthiest quintile, still more than two in ﬁve farmers are spe-
cialized in agriculture. In other countries the decline in the share of agricultural employment across the income
quintiles is usually stronger. This partly also reﬂects the greater earnings potential offered by tradable cash crops
(compared to other countries), and the more diversiﬁed and commercialized nature of agricultural activities in
Côte d’Ivoire (see Chapter 3). With projected rural poverty rates in Côte d’Ivoire still at 57 percent in 2011, it is
also consistent with limited off-farm opportunities in the rural economy and its urban centers.

2.2.2 Proximity matters for inclusiveness
Ninth, development of rural areas and secondary towns in Côte d’Ivoire is further called for to pro-
ductively absorb labor exiting agriculture. At ﬁrst sight, the rural employment structure is broadly consistent
with current development. About four in ﬁve rural workers work in agriculture, which is consistent with the ratios
observed in other countries at similar levels of development (Figure 2.10).47 Yet only a very small (and relatively

     Detailed analysis of the national accounts showed that while the value added in agriculture was estimated at 17.5, 6.5, and 2.5 percent,
     in Nicaragua (2006), Peru (2007), and Chile (2008), respectively, the value of forward and backward linkages added 5.2, 3.2, and 2.2
     percentage points (Anriquez 2016), with the share of these linkages in the total value added by agriculture (production and linkages)
     increasing as countries become richer (Nicaragua, 1,849 (2010 US$) GDP/capita, in 2015; Peru (5,974 (2010 US$) GDP/capita in 2015;
     Chile 14,626 (2010 US$) GDP/capita in 2015) and the value added in agriculture declined.

     Surprisingly, there is not much diﬀerence across age cohorts. Much of the occupational transformation usually happens through younger
     age cohorts, who are more skilled and ﬂexible.

     When asked about the type of business they would like to run in the future, about 60 percent of people employed in agriculture aspire to
     run a farm. When asked about the type of job they would like, more than 80 percent of those currently employed in agriculture, indicate
     to be aspiring a job outside agriculture.

smaller) share of the rural population (4 percent) is engaged in nonagricultural wage employment. This is most
likely linked to the high degree of Côte d’Ivoire’s urbanization and urban concentration with most ﬁrms and
nonagricultural wage employment conﬁned to Abidjan. Fifty-three percent of the population is urban, of which
40 percent lives in Abidjan (Figure 2.11). In 2012, less than 10 percent of formal jobs were outside Abidjan
(Figure 5.10), with the vast majority of new formal jobs continuing to be generated in Abidjan (Figure 5.16), and
only very few in other urban areas (mainly in agribusiness). This urbanization pattern comes along with a high
wage premium for skilled labor (laborers with higher education) who tend to earn on average about as much
in other urban areas as in Abidjan, and about three times more than unskilled laborers in these urban areas (the
highest locational skill premium) (Table 2.1). The low difference in wages for highly skilled workers between
Abidjan and other urban areas suggests that a wage premium is needed to attract skilled labor to other urban
areas (possibly also because of underdeveloped public services in these areas).
Controlling for GDP, households in Côte d’Ivoire tend to be also more specialized, either in agriculture
or in nonagricultural self-employment. There is less part-time farming and income diversiﬁcation within

households than observed elsewhere. On the one hand, the larger degree of specialization is consistent with
larger land availability per person (Figure 3.2) and cash crop growing such that, in the absence of mechanization,
relatively more labor can stay employed on the farm. It may also point to limited off-farm income opportunities
in the rural areas to diversify, such that sorting is more dichotomous — either fully in agriculture; or fully outside
agriculture, but further away, in the city where nonagricultural self-employment and wage jobs are concentrated
(see subsequent chapters).
Nearby access to off-farm self- and wage employment in the rural economy and secondary towns is
especially important for better and inclusive employment. Cross-country evidence from across the world
shows convincingly that movements out of agriculture to the rural economy, secondary towns, and secondary
cities (deﬁned as less than 1 million inhabitants) are more poverty reducing than exits out of agriculture into the
metropoles.48 While those who make it to the city, tend to gain much more on average than those who move
nearby, only few of the poor manage to do so, and many more ﬁnd their way into off-farm activities when they
are nearby. The end outcome is one of an accelerated poverty reduction when people can ﬁnd off-farm employ-
ment opportunities nearby. Given the bulky nature of the source material and related transport costs, many
agribusinesses (for example, millers, beer breweries, processors) establish in urban centers closer to the sourcing
areas. These centers often also act as trading hubs facilitating the supply of inputs (seeds, fertilizer, machinery),
storage, marketing and transport of produce, generating off-farm employment opportunities. Even before
accounting for related services agribusiness activities, including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing
(ISIC 15) alone accounted for more than 30 percent of total formal employment and more than 20 percent of
value added in formal ﬁrms (Figure 5.5). Agribusiness also forms the only source of formal manufacturing jobs
outside Abidjan. The past couple of years have witnessed a small increase in formal enterprise establishments
outside Abidjan (Chapter 5), though much room for expansion remains.


2.3 HOW MUCH MOVEMENT BETWEEN SECTORS CAN REALISTICALLY BE EXPECTED IN
CÔTE D’IVOIRE?
A benchmark scenario to gauge expected movement between employment sectors. The sections above
provide a conceptual framework to consider the potential for agriculture and other sectors to generate employ-
ment and raise earnings for the poorer segments of society. This section presents a benchmark scenario outlining
how much movement between sectors can realistically be expected in Côte d’Ivoire over the 2015–2025 horizon.
It starts from the employment situation in Côte d’Ivoire in February 2014 and applies projections of population
growth and growth rates for the main sectors of the economy over the next decade, as well as international
historical estimates of the sectoral elasticity of employment in Africa and around the world. The projections
forecast the composition of job growth over the next decade as well as the resulting effects on the country-wide
employment structure. They provide a benchmark to consider how changes in productivity in agriculture or in
other sectors, or changes in the composition of GDP growth, can inﬂuence the overall employment composi-
tion (holding sectoral elasticities of employment constant). The benchmark scenario is optimistic as it assumes
high growth in industry (secondary), commerce, and services in the next decade, with more limited growth in
agriculture (Table 2.3) (see Annex B for more background on methodology and ﬁndings).49

Projections suggest a continuing decline of the agricultural labor share, mostly counterbalanced
by an increase in nonagricultural self-employment, which is expected to become the main source
of employment (Figure 2.12). Speciﬁcally, it is expected that the share of employment in agriculture could
decrease from 51 percent in 2014 to 29 percent in 2025. In parallel, it is likely that nonagricultural self-
employment will become the main source of employment by 2025, 43 percent of the labor force is expected to
be self-employed outside agriculture. The share of wage employment also increases, but it will remain the least
prevalent type of employment, with less than 30 percent of the labor force.
Wage employment remains the smallest employment category and concentrated in services. These
baseline projections are only indicative and subject to changes in within-sector productivity, the macroeconomic
situation or the country’s political stability. Nonetheless, wage employment remains the smallest employment
category under a host of differing scenarios that consider differing growth patterns for industry and services,
while maintaining the rather pessimistic outlook on agricultural growth (see Annex B). Wage employment is
expected to remain largely dominated by the service sector, while the share of wage employment in industry will
remain limited to 3 percent at most, even when considering fast expansion of the service and industry sectors.
Faster growth in agriculture would slow the exit of labor from agriculture as well as the expansion
of nonagricultural self-employment. The benchmark scenario assumes a 3 percent growth rate of the agri-
cultural sector over most of the next decade. If the agricultural sector modernizes more rapidly, a decade of 4
percent agricultural GDP growth is plausible. This would be on par with performance in Vietnam or China over

the past three decades. Such stronger growth in the agricultural sector would limit exits from agriculture. As
such, a share of 29 percent of employment in agriculture is best considered a lower bound.50
An important caveat to these projections is that they abstract from intersectoral linkages. Productivity
growth in agriculture could also help growth, employment, and earnings in the other sectors, by increas-
ing domestic demand for nonagricultural goods and services, as well as demand for higher-value and more
processed agricultural produce, which would both lead to more and better off-farm jobs, in construction, in
manufacturing (including agro-processing), and in food and non-food trade. It highlights the role for agriculture
also to foster the transition.51
In sum, informal off-farm self-employment, not formal wage employment, is set to become the major
source of employment, and policies to raise productivity of those earning their living as self-employed
workers will be essential for more productive employment and poverty reduction. While essential, given
the small initial base (especially in industry), even fast growth in the formal service and industry sector can only
add a relatively small number of additional (formal) wage jobs. Though declining, employment in agriculture will
remain large in the foreseeable future, with labor productivity gains in the sector also being an important factor
in facilitating exit out of it. This does not do away with the important role formal ﬁrms play for employment,
but rather highlights the need for realism in expectations and balanced policy attention.


2.4 A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH TOWARD PROMOTING PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT
AND ACCELERATING POVERTY REDUCTION
With two-thirds of Côte d’Ivoire’s poor living in rural areas according to recent (2011) estimates and
almost half of the poor living in households whose head is primarily engaged in agriculture, raising
labor productivity in agriculture has to be a key entry point for more, better, and more inclusive
employment generation in Côte d’Ivoire. This also plays to its potential comparative advantage in cash
crop production and takes advantage of the rising demand for high-value and processed agricultural produce
following rising incomes and dietary diversiﬁcation, especially among its large urban population. For the country
to grasp these opportunities, agricultural labor productivity will need to be made competitive with off-farm
opportunities in the cities. Otherwise the exit of youth out of agriculture, some degree of which is normal, will
only accelerate. Modernizing agriculture is therefore the ﬁrst prong to more, better, and more inclusive employ-
ment. It will be the topic of Chapter 3.
But with global (and domestic) income elasticity for nonagricultural goods exceeding that for agri-
cultural goods, the deeper running demand forces make that agriculture cannot do it alone, and
expanding productive employment opportunities off the farm will be equally important. The transi-
tional pace can be slower in Côte d’Ivoire given its agricultural export potential (and its high level of urbanization
already). Off-farm employment generation will be more inclusive and poverty reducing, when it happens nearby.
It is in the rural economies and rural urban centers where the poor are concentrated, drawing attention to the
challenge of Côte d’Ivoire’s high rate of urbanization (and urban concentration) as well as its low rate of rural
off-farm wage employment. On the upside, pursuance of the agricultural transformation through inclusive
agricultural production structures and inclusive value chain development emerges as a powerful remedial force
through off-farm employment generation up and down the chains in rural urban centers. After modernizing
agriculture, expanding productive employment opportunities off the farm is thus the second prong, with a fair
bit of it directly related to agriculture. The importance and potential of off-farm employment generation nearby
for inclusive employment generation and the link with agribusiness development will be elaborated upon in
Chapters 4 and 5. The critical issue of raising productivity in nonagricultural household enterprises (the informal
sector) will be assessed in Chapter 4. The trends and prospects for the creation of wage jobs in formal ﬁrms are
discussed in Chapter 5.

50
     But productivity growth in agriculture would also help growth, employment and earnings in the other sectors, by increasing domestic
     demand for nonagricultural goods and services, which in turn may lead to more and better oﬀ-farm jobs. The projections abstract from
     such interlinkages.

                                                                                                                                            61
Finally, the occupational transformation typically lags the economic transformation, and social protec-
tion will be needed for those unable to seize opportunities and access more productive employment
opportunities. On the one hand, many (often older and female) farmers may be left behind in the rural
areas. On the other hand, some individuals in urban areas may have limited potential to enter more produc-
tive occupations, including in nonagricultural self-employment where variations in productivity are substantial.
Appropriate social assistance, including health and social protection systems, will need to be developed to assist
those who can no longer make the transition to modern agriculture or switch to productive nonagricultural
activities in urban areas. While the ﬁrst two prongs are focused on increasing earnings, especially among the
poorer segments of society, the third prong thus seeks to mitigate the rising income gap for those left behind
through targeted employment programs and transfers. The set-up of such safety nets can further accelerate
the structural and agricultural transformation, by encouraging investments, as well as expanding demands for
products. An in-depth discussion of these issues falls however outside the scope of this report, which is focused
on employment with a poverty lens.

PROJECTION OF FUTURE EMPLOYMENT STRUCTURE — METHODOLOGY
The simulations follow the methodology used for the sectoral employment projections reported in the IMF
Africa Regional Economic Outlook (IMF, 2012; Fox et al., 2013) and the World Bank regional report on Youth
Employment in Africa (Filmer et al. 2014). The baseline structure of employment is obtained from the nationally
representative microeconomic data on the employment situation in Côte d’Ivoire collected in February 2014
(ENSETE 2013). Estimates of population composition are based on the UN population data. Projections for sectoral
composition of growth are taken from the World Bank 2015 Macro and Poverty Outlook (World Bank, 2015).
Finally, a range of estimates of the sectoral elasticity of employment are used based on international experience,
ranging from most conservative to highly optimistic.
The 2013 employment survey (ENSETE 2013) provides nationally representative individual-level data on labor-force
participation and employment, including the type of employment (wage employment or self-employment) and
sector of employment (agriculture, industry or services). The projections distinguish three categories of employment:

∫ Agricultural employment — mostly smallholder and commercial farmers. Wages agricultural employment
  is also included in this category, as well as ﬁshing and forestry.
∫ Nonagricultural self-employment (industry and services) — these are small nonfarm businesses that tend
  to be operated by households in the industry and services sectors, it mostly includes self-employed people
  running unincorporated businesses who at times employ family members and outside workers. Family helpers
  outside of agriculture are also categorized in nonagricultural self-employment.
∫ Wage employment (industry and services) — work outside the agricultural sector for which wages are
  received from an unrelated individual. It occurs in both the industry and service sectors with the former
  involving mostly tradable goods and the latter non-tradable. The wage employed category includes salaried
  workers, employers, volunteers for organizations outside households, apprentices, and interns.
The working-age population (WAP) includes individuals over the age of 14. At the 2014 baseline, the working-age
population was 62.5 percent of the total population, or 14,501,118 individuals (Table B.1). Of this working-age
population, the employment participation rate (share of employed population in working-age population) was
estimated to be 70 percent. Among the employed population, 51.1 percent were engaged in agriculture, 2.5
percent in wage employment in the industry sector, 5.1 percent in wage employment in the commerce sector, 11.7
percent in wage employment in other services sector, 4.4 percent in self-employment in the industry sector, 20.9
percent in self-employment in the commerce sector, and 4.2 percent in other services (see Figure 1.26).
To undertake the projections, based on the working-age population at baseline (from the 2013 employment
survey and UN population data), we calculated the working-age population growth rates in Côte d’Ivoire and
the commensurate size of the working-age population from 2014 through 2025.52




52
     While the UN deﬁnitions for working-age population align with the ENSETE deﬁnition and encompass all individuals over the age of 14, the
     working-age population data used in our calculations provided by the UN population division provides population estimates for individuals
     ages 15–64. Since were unable to locate population data disaggregated into the 14+ age group, we produced our estimates in Table B.2
     below using the available data for the 15–64 age group.

                                                                                                                                                 64

Data from national accounts provide the sectoral breakdowns of value added. Projections of GDP growth in the
agriculture, industry, and service sectors were used through 2025, with the assumption that, from 2017 through
2025, overall GDP growth across all sectors would gradually decline. Table B.2 shows strong but declining growth
within the industry and service sectors, and weak declining growth in agriculture.

To be able to project the future composition of employment based on the above sectoral growth rates, estimates
of employment elasticity by sector are required. The calculation of the employment elasticity of growth/value
added is a simple expression of the responsiveness of employment to output growth. The relationship is analyzed
by sector and is expressed as follows:
                                                          dln(Eit)= αi dln(GDPit),
where Eit is the volume of employment by employment sector (i) (wage and non-wage) at time t, GDP is the
sectoral output value at time t and α is the sectoral employment elasticity, for the country (Fox et al. 2013). The
parameter  α could also be estimated directly using actual historical data, year on year. However, studies have
shown that this estimate could potentially be unreliable due to greater volatility in annual output growth rates
than in employment growth (Fox et al. 2013). As a result the preferred method is to use a longer period to esti-
mate elasticities or a regression panel technique to account for employment persistence. Once α is estimated at
the country level, future employment change can be projected for a given sectoral output change (IMF 2013).
This approach relies on two strong assumptions: that the underlying relationships between the structural param-
eters which jointly determine employment and output in a given sector stay constant over time and that a long
period of high or low sectoral growth will not affect elasticity. Fox et al. (2013) conduct a range of robustness
checks and conclude that this modeling technique performs satisfactorily.

Note (a): Data is estimated over 1991–2003. (b) Agricultural employment closes the model for low-income and resource-rich countries. (c) Self-employment
includes nonwage industry and nonwage services.


The projections were produced based on three different growth scenarios (See Table B.4) combined with the elas-
ticities in Table B.3. These growth and elasticity combination scenarios include: high industry and services growth
with low-income country employment elasticity (Scenario 1), very high services growth with resource-rich country
elasticity (Scenario 2), and medium services growth also with resource-rich country elasticity (Scenario 3). Projections
vary depending on the underlying scenarios considered, but trends are fairly robust. Figures B.1 and B.2 show the
projected employment proﬁles in Côte d’Ivoire through 2020 and (more tentatively) through 2025, respectively.

3 MAXIMIZING AGRICULTURE’S
3:
CONTRIBUTION TO THE JOBS AGENDA
Luc Christiaensen and Gabriel Lawin
As highlighted in the previous chapter, increasing agricultural labor productivity is key to the jobs agenda in
Côte d’Ivoire. It plays to its comparative advantage; it raises earnings of the poor directly, and it helps generate
demand for nonagricultural goods and services and thus off-farm employment. Also, given the large share of
employment in agriculture, even fast growth of urban wage jobs will not sufﬁce to absorb all new entrants. But
not all agricultural strategies are equally successful in generating inclusive employment.
This chapter discusses policy entry points to maximize agriculture’s contribution. It begins with a brief proﬁle of
smallholder agriculture in Côte d’Ivoire and the opportunities and challenges it presents for inclusive employment
within agriculture, and also further down the chain. The focus is on features of the agricultural system that
are important from a jobs perspective and agricultural subsectors that are particularly promising for inclusive
employment, but that have so far received less attention in national employment strategies. This is not to dismiss
the important potential of export crops, but these have been discussed extensively elsewhere (World Bank 2012;
2015). Furthermore, many of the challenges faced by these crops, are also akin to those faced in the rice chains,
which are discussed in more detail.53 The chapter concludes with ﬁve policy entry points.

While they contribute to 50 percent of the overall export value, export crops are only about a quarter
of the value of total agricultural output. Food crops make up the rest (75 percent). Two in ﬁve farmers grow
both cash and food crops (44 percent). About one-third grows only cash crops — they are richer on average. One
in four (24 percent) grows only food crops — they are poorer on average. Traditionally, cash crops have received
the most attention. These numbers would suggest greater attention to food crop growers and raising food crop
productivity. This could also help raise labor productivity among women, who tend to be more engaged in the
food cropping system54 (Camara 1984; Chaléard 1988). There is also an important geographic dimension to this.
There are two main distinct agricultural regions in Côte d’Ivoire, the forest region in the south (south-
ern and western regions) and the drier savannah in the north. With higher and more reliable rainfall and
better soils, the forest region produces the majority of Côte d’Ivoire’s export crops (cocoa, rubber) (Figure 3.1), with
cocoa mainly grown by smallholders, and rubber on plantations. Together, they accounted for 56 percent and 16
percent, respectively of the total value of agricultural exports during 2011–2013. Food crops are less frequent in
the south, consistent with the greater importance of cash crops (especially cocoa), and concern mainly roots and
tubers. Overall, food crops are especially prevalent among smallholders in the northern region, dominated by cereals
and rice. (Roots and tubers are also common in the eastern and central regions.) When it comes to cash crops,
cashew and cotton are the cash crops of the north, both grown by smallholders (with cashew nuts also frequently
in the central region). They contributed 5 percent and 4 percent of the total agricultural export value, respectively.

     Aka (2007) showed that in Côte d’Ivoire, only 23% of coﬀee and cocoa growers are female. See also Camara (1984), Chaléard (1988),

Regional poverty patterns are associated with cropping systems. The poverty headcount rate is very high
in the north (59 percent in 2015), but it houses only 19 percent of the population. The opposite holds in the
south (which includes Abidjan), a lower poverty headcount rate (36 percent), but hosting a larger share of the
total population (47 percent). Better prospects, including through cocoa production, attracted more migrants.
The combination of both factors (high poverty rate and low population share, and vice versa) makes that the
northern and the southern regions account, respectively, for about 24 percent and 37 percent of the total
number of poor people in 2015, or about two-thirds of the total number of poor. Inclusive employment gen-
eration suggests particular attention to these areas and their livelihoods systems. The revival of cotton and the
recent boom in cashew and increasingly also rice are important developments from this perspective, especially
for the northern region (see further below).

Farming is dominated by smallholders who are well endowed with land and hire (migrant) labor
to make up for family labor shortages. Farmers own on average 2.2 ha per adult (Figure 3.2). Given very
little mechanization, the use of hired labor (as well as labor exchange) is common to make up for family labor
shortages. Almost half of the farmers (49 percent) use hired labor and 45 percent use unpaid labor (typically

5.1 persons and 4 (unpaid) persons.55
Use of hired labor is especially high in cotton, rice, and cashew (grown in the North), the production of
which has been expanding over the past 5 years. Only 28 percent of agricultural households rely exclusively
on family labor. This suggests substantial agricultural wage labor opportunities. Nonetheless only a very small share
of the rural population reports to work as agricultural wage laborer (2.7 percent), suggesting that agricultural
labor needs are often met by migrant laborers from neighboring countries. Both phenomena (low incidence of
agricultural wage labor and high use of hired labor) are otherwise difﬁcult to reconcile. The ﬁndings are also con-
sistent with the notion of relatively limited agricultural labor surplus within Côte d’Ivoire, discussed in Chapter 2.
There is a fair degree of market orientation. Four in ﬁve smallholders sell at least some of their output,
with one in ﬁve reporting to sell their complete harvest (Figure 3.3). In other words, most farmers engage with
the market and have moved well beyond farming for subsistence only. It also suggests that the number of

     The labor questions of the agriculture module in the ENSETE 2013 only cover the last 3 months and so these statistics might suﬀer from
     underestimation and seasonality. Also, the use of hired and unpaid labor is only expressed in number of persons used, not in number
     of person days. Nonetheless, the number of unpaid persons used on the farm suggests that labor exchange (unpaid non-household
     members working on the farm) is non-negligible (and almost on par with hired labor use), suggesting that it is important to keep it in mind
     when calculating labor productivity measures, albeit less so from the perspective of jobs generation. The surveys do not provide additional
     information regarding the motivation, the precise extent or the individual characteristics of those involved in this unpaid labor exchange.

subsistence workers estimated from the 2013 ENSETE survey (using the new ILO employment categories) is most
likely an overestimate. The survey classiﬁed about 50 percent of the people engaged in agriculture as subsistence
workers (that is, workers working for their own consumption). Yet more than half of those lived in households
who sold at least 30 percent of their harvest (in value terms) (see Box 3.1 for details). Households with land
titles and access to irrigation commercialize a greater share of their production; female-headed households are
less market oriented (Box 3.2).


BOX 3.1: SURVEY APPLICATION OF NEW INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEFINITIONS:
THE INITIAL CATEGORIZATION OF SUBSISTENCE FARMERS USED IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO ACTUAL MARKET ORIENTATION
The 19th International Conference of Labor Statisticians held in 2013 recommended the adoption of new interna-
tional norms for employment statistics, including revisions of the norms put in place after the 13th International
Conference of Labor Statisticians held in 1982. Box 2 in Chapter 1 provides a detailed discussion. The new deﬁnition
introduced a new category of people outside of the labor force called ‘subsistence workers’. These are people who
work for their own consumption. They are considered ‘working but not employed’. This new categorization aﬀects
the employment rate, especially in countries where a large share of people are self-employed in agriculture, often as
subsistence farmers. All other things equal, omitting these farmers from those ‘employed’ will increase the unem-
ployment rate (by reducing the number of employed). This poses challenges, conceptually, and for comparability.
The concept is also diﬃcult to operationalize in practice.
Côte d’Ivoire was one of the ﬁrst countries to apply these new norms in the 2013 employment survey (AGEPE and
INS 2014). Due to limitations in the survey instrument and lack of guidelines to implement the new employment
deﬁnitions, the original classiﬁcation of subsistence farmers was implemented based on a question in the survey
where individuals reported whether or not they have cash earnings from agriculture.
To assess the robustness of this classiﬁcation, this report compares the degree of agricultural market participa-
tion among agricultural workers classiﬁed as employed and agricultural workers classiﬁed as subsistence workers
using a household commercialization index (HCI) constructed from a household-based agricultural module also
included in the survey. The HCI is deﬁned as the ratio of the gross value of all crop sales and the gross value of all
crop production:
                                        Gross value of crop sales (in XOF)
                          HCI = [                                                 ] x 100.
                                    Gross value of all crop production (in XOF)

This index can be seen as a measure of a household’s market orientation. The larger the index the higher is the
degree of commercialization or market orientation. A value of zero signiﬁes no market participation — the household
only produces for it is own consumption; that is, full subsistence.
Application to ENSETE 2013 shows that the vast majority of individuals originally classiﬁed as subsistence workers
(73.5 percent) actually reside in households who sell at least some of their products in the market. In fact, ﬁfty-four
percent of individuals originally classiﬁed as subsistence workers sell more than 30 percent of their products,
and twenty percent sell all of it. Clearly, aside from any conceptual concerns about the omission of subsistence
workers among the employed, the original classiﬁcation failed to properly distinguish between farmers working for
their own consumption and farmers engaging with the markets. The inadequacy of the classiﬁcation can also be
seen from the small diﬀerence in the average HCI between those employed in agriculture and those categorized
as subsistence workers (51.9 percent versus 44.9 percent, respectively). The results illustrate the importance of a
household-based approach in capturing agricultural market orientation. Gender diﬀerences within households in
market orientation could lead to an underestimation of household production for the market, for example. Similarly,
the shorter reference period (30 days) used in the individual labor module used to classify farmers as subsistence
workers or not may also lead to underestimation. The agricultural module is based on sales during the last season.

BOX 3.2: DETERMINANTS OF OUTPUT COMMERCIALIZATION
To explore the determinants of output commercialization, we run a simple OLS regression analysis of the HCI (see
Box 3.1) on a set of determinants. The estimates indicate that gender of the household head, land certiﬁcation,
access to irrigation, the type of crop grown, and the use of inputs (organic and inorganic fertilizer, pesticides) are
associated with the degree of output commercialization (Table B3.2.1). The commercialization index of female-
headed households is on average 7 percent lower than that of male-headed households. Having a formal land
certiﬁcate (land title or sale attestation) is associated with a higher rate of commercialization. Households with
a land title commercialize 6 percent more of their production than those who do not have a land title. Access to
an irrigation system increases the degree of agricultural commercialization. The regression coeﬃcients show a
positive and signiﬁcant relationship between commercialization index and cash crops growing. Cocoa growing
has a huge eﬀect on the commercialization index. We do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between commercial-
ization and the household’s cultivated land per adult suggesting that large farmers are not necessary those who
are more market oriented (at least not in relative terms). Pesticide utilization increases by 4 percent the level of
output commercialization.

3.2 ENHANCEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND DIVERSIFICATION
HAS STARTED, BUT SUBSTANTIAL SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT REMAINS
For rice, cotton, and cashew nuts, the productivity increase has started. The overall objectives of the
‘Agriculture for Jobs Agenda’ are to enhance agricultural labor productivity in existing crops, to diversify the
agricultural output mix, and to add value. In recent years, a beginning has been made on each of these fronts.
Among staple crops, progress has been especially noticeable for rice, with FAO statistics suggesting annual yield
gains in the order of 20 percent (Figure 3.4). In light of the much lower yield levels recorded in the micro data,
such a growth rate seems somewhat large and deserves further scrutiny.56 Nonetheless, irrespective of the exact
growth rate, progress in rice production since the 2008 world food price crisis is real and consistent with concerted
government efforts to boost domestic rice production (see section 3.3). Yield growth was negative however
among other staple crops (such as roots and tubers). It reﬂects the longstanding neglect of staple crops in favor of
cash crops and presents an area of attention, also in light of the poverty rates among food crop growers. Among
cash crops, yield growth has also been revived, especially in cotton and cashew, indicating diversiﬁcation beyond
cocoa, though the production of coffee and pineapples declined (not reported in Figure 3.4).
Strong yield growth in rice, cashew, and cotton diversiﬁed the cash crop mix, but there has been no real
diversiﬁcation yet into high-value agricultural products. Overall, net agricultural production value increased
by 2.5 percent per year (between 2004/06 and 2011/13). The annual increase was higher in rice (11.5 percent),
other export crops (4.2 percent) (driven especially by cashew and cotton),57 and meat (3.3 percent, especially
chicken [9.2 percent] and cattle) (Figure 3.5). This resulted in a rising share of rice in total output (from 3.5 percent
on average during 2004/06 to 6.2 percent during 2011/13) and a diversiﬁcation in cash crops beyond cocoa (whose
share declined from 26.6 percent to 24.2 percent). Diversiﬁcation in high-value agricultural products (meat, dairy,
fruits, and vegetables) remains limited. The share of meat increased only slightly from 7.9 percent to 8.3 percent,
while the share of other high-value agricultural products decreased slightly from 16.5 percent to 15.8 percent).

      The 2013 national employment survey (ENSETE 2013) puts the average rice yields at 1.8 tons per ha (rising to 2 tons per ha in the subse-
      quent 2015 national household survey ENV 2015) — though the median is only 600 and 1000 kg per ha, respectively. This is substantially
      lower than the averages reported in the macro data from the national statistics, which rose from slightly below 2 tons/ha during the
      mid-2000s to about 5 tons/ha in 2013–2014. This discrepancy between the macro and micro data (or national/administrative and survey
      statistics) warrants further investigation. Some of the discrepancy may be the result from the fact that the household surveys capture
      only one of the rice harvests. They also exclude large commercial farms where yields are higher (higher input use, better water control,
      and typically more than one rice cycle per year).

The expansion of rice, cotton, and cashew production is promising from a jobs perspective.58 Survey
averages of family labor input per crop per hectare are presented from the employment survey collected in
February 2014 (ENSETE 2013, which only concern the past 3 months) and the 2015 national household survey
(ENV, which covers the past year) (Figure 3.6).59 More generally, accurate labor input data in agriculture are
notoriously hard to come by and Côte d’Ivoire is no exception.60 Therefore, the results from both surveys are
reported (to check consistency) and the emphasis is on the ranking of crops in terms of their labor intensity,
rather than the absolute values.
Across survey years and labor input variables (family and hired), rice emerges as one of the most labor-intensive
crops in Côte d’Ivoire. The recent expansion of rice production is thus also promising from a jobs perspective.
Cotton and cashew producers make the most extensive use of hired labor. Both crops are grown widely in the
north, where poverty rates are highest. The expansion of their production also holds promise for inclusive jobs
generation (including for neighboring countries).61 An increasing share of cashew nuts are also processed locally
(especially in the central region), creating potential off-farm employment opportunities in secondary towns.
Finally, consistent with ﬁndings from other countries (for example, Damiani (2003) for Brazil), vegetable pro-
duction is also highly labor intensive. Its potential has so far been largely left unexploited. Overall, these trends
are promising, but much scope for improvement remains.
Large heterogeneity in net returns per hectare across crops suggests substantial scope for productiv-
ity gains. The net value of production per hectare for farmers producing at the 75th percentile is typically three

                        The expansion of rice production followed largely from increasing yields. Cashew expanded ﬁrst through area expansion (2000–2007) and
                        subsequently through an increase in yields (2008–2013). Cotton seed production bottomed out around 2008 to increase to early 2000
                        levels through an increase in yields. A labor productivity increase can follow both from yield and land expansion (assuming labor input
                        remains constant). Output/laborer = output/ha × ha/laborer. Consequently, yield increases among labor-intensive crops, holding labor
                        input constant, increases labor productivity for many. Alternatively, if output increases mainly through area expansion in labor-intensive
                        crops (holding labor input per area constant), many new jobs are generated. From a jobs perspective, a production increase in labor-inten-
                        sive crops is beneﬁcial either way and it is thus useful to understand the diﬀerence in labor intensity among diﬀerent agricultural products.
59
                        For hired labor, only the number of hired laborers per crop cultivated has been reported, not the number of days.
60
                        See Arthi et al. (2016) for a series of experiments to gauge the diﬀerence in reported labor input in agriculture depending on the method used.
61
                        While agricultural wage labor is often employment of last resort, and not seen as a ‘quality’ job, it would still entail an improvement in
                        labor productivity if it exceeds the marginal value of on-farm self-employment (which was still estimated to be somewhat lower than the
                        agricultural market wage, even though by a smaller margin than observed in other countries, suggesting a lower prevalence of surplus
                        labor in Côte d’Ivoire, and consistent with the use of hired labor from neighboring countries. (See discussion in section 2.1.)

to four times higher than the net value of production per hectare for farmers producing at the 25th percentile
(Figure 3.7). This holds by crop and when considering overall crop income per household. Many factors could
explain the productivity gap, such as differences in soil fertility, water control, agro-ecological circumstances,
and market access. Controlling for labor inputs and other factors, multivariate regression results also point to the
importance of differences in modern input use. Overall, as already illustrated by the heterogeneity in agricultural
labor productivity reported in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.3), the heterogeneity in land productivity equally suggests
substantial scope for productivity gains.
Inorganic fertilizer use is low and its proﬁtability deserves further investigation. In 2014, only 26
percent of cultivating households reported using inorganic fertilizer. In 2015, the share was only 18 percent,
corresponding to 14.7 percent of the cultivated land being fertilized. This is similar to Tanzania (17 percent
of farmers use inorganic fertilizer), but much less than in in Nigeria (41 percent), Ethiopia (56 percent), and
Malawi (77 percent). Use is higher among cotton and rice growers, which also recorded substantial yield expan-
sion. Cross-country differences in fertilizer use are consistent with differences in land/labor endowments. Land
per agricultural worker is higher in Côte d’Ivoire and Tanzania; while Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi are more
densely populated. When land/labor endowments decline, the adoption of land-saving technologies such as
inorganic fertilizer increases, raising the question whether inorganic fertilizer use is proﬁtable under the current
circumstances. There may also be room for improvements in the fertilizer policy environment. At 64.4 to 100,
Côte d’Ivoire scores slightly better than the Sub-Saharan African average on the fertilizer policy score according

to the 2016 Enabling-the-Business-of-Agriculture report. The conditions (soil fertility, input, and output prices,
crops) under which inorganic fertilizer is proﬁtable in Côte d’Ivoire deserves an in-depth analysis.62
Use of agrochemicals, on the other hand, is high, raising concerns about health hazards and job quality.
In 2014, the use of agrochemicals was reported in 46 percent of cultivating households. The share was 37
percent in 2015, which is still substantially higher than in other African countries (see Figure 3.8). Use is most
widespread on cotton and rubber, but also common on cocoa and rice. To the extent that it concerns herbicides,
it helps save labor, reducing labor costs for weeding. While pesticide use is generally found to increase output
value (also in other countries, for instance by 33 percent in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda), it is also found to
be associated with an increase in health problems among users, raising issues about job quality.63


3.3 THE CASE OF RICE
Until most recently, most of Côte d’Ivoire’s rapidly growing demand for rice was met by imports.
During 2000–2013, domestic rice consumption grew by almost 5 percent per year to attain more than 1.8 million
tons in 2013, or an estimated 64 kg/person/year64 (FAO 2016). Until most recently, most of this growth was met
by imports, which, in 2013, accounted for 60 percent of the total rice consumption (Figure 3.9).

     See Liverpool-Tasie et al. (2015) for an in-depth analysis of the proﬁtability of inorganic fertilizer use in Nigeria. They ﬁnd that, in Nigeria,
     transport costs to the nearest agro-input dealers, a measure of input market access, substantially reduce the proﬁtability of fertilizer use
     for a number of farmers.

The National Rice Development Strategy (NRDS) seeks to ﬁll the large import gap, thereby also provid-
ing an estimated 500,000 jobs in the supply chain. Rice imports have consistently supplied more than half
of consumption for the past three decades, despite numerous strategies and policies to boost domestic produc-
tion. These attempts have been reinvigorated following the 2008 food crisis, which saw world rice prices more
than triple in a matter of months. A new NRDS65 was adopted in 2008 and revised in 2011. It seeks to attain a
production of 2 million tons and to eliminate the import gap by taking a comprehensive value chain approach.
Despite rapid growth in rice production and yields recorded in the national statistics, many challenges
and opportunities for growth remain both among producers and further down the value chain. As
indicated in Figures 3.4 and 3.9, following a long period of stagnation, national statistics have recorded a very
rapid gain in rice production in Côte d’Ivoire since 2009. These gains are largely achieved through gains in yields.
But many challenges and opportunities for production, yield and jobs growth remain through interventions on
the farm, but also down the chain. Poor organization of marketing and processing of paddy rice was for example
recognized by the NRDS as one of the key challenges to boost production, thereby for the ﬁrst time explicitly
linking the challenge of increasing yields with the challenge of improving performance along the whole chain.
It identiﬁed (a) the lack of conﬁrmed and regular buyers, (b) the high costs of collection and transport (under-
mining import competitiveness), (c) the non-remunerative prices for producers, the absence of a price guarantee
mechanism, and the failure of buyers to observe contract terms, (d) an inefﬁcient paddy-processing sector, and
(e) lack of storage facilities as important constraints to boost import competitiveness and domestic production.
While progress has been made on these issues, a recent qualitative survey of the rice value chain in four purpo-
sively selected rice-producing districts commissioned by FAO and Ofﬁce National pour le Développement de la
Riziculture de Côte d’Ivoire indicates that much room for improvement remains (Doumbia 2016).
Among processors, both the lack of sufﬁcient supply of rice and cost and shortage of electricity are frequently
mentioned as major constraints. This holds back investment and quality processing needed to compete with
imports. Traders are generally underﬁnanced, and as a result, poorly equipped with regard to weighing equip-
ment and vehicles, with lack of access to credit even more pronounced with women traders. Among producers,
there is little optimal use of agricultural inputs such as improved seed, fertilizers, and pesticides (Table 3.2).
Adequate water control (both to avoid ﬂooding as well as drought) remains a great challenge. Only 16 percent
of the area planted with rice has relatively good water control. And technical support remains deﬁcient. As a

                     In particular, it seeks to (a) enhance producers’ access to improved seeds, irrigation, agricultural inputs, and mechanization; (b) promote
                     processing units close to production areas; (c) promote more private investment in the rice sector; 4) regularize and secure rice prices
                     both at the production, processing and marketing level. In addition to meeting national rice demand, the NRDS is projected to create (a)
                     500,000 direct jobs for the production of paddy using irrigated system; (b) 1.5 million direct jobs for paddy production in rainfed condi-
                     tion; (c) more than 500,000 direct jobs in related manufacturing and services.

consequence, rice yield and producer gross margin per hectare are often low and especially highly variable across
sites and seasons. This in turn reduces volume, making rice milling less proﬁtable.
The study concludes that the stakeholders in the rice value chain (producers, processors, input providers, storage,
and traders) are generally poorly endowed with productive resources, under-equipped, poorly trained, and poorly
organized and coordinated among themselves and across the different actors in the chain. The overall lack of
ﬁnancial depth in the chain, with each actor facing credit constraints and largely ﬁnancing him/herself, com-
bined with poor coordination and contractual arrangements among the different actors in the chain continues
to challenge the rice sector to leave its lower level equilibrium fully behind.

Note (a): The rice production system in Côte d’Ivoire is characterized by three cropping systems (i) rainfed rice grown throughout the country but dominant
in the west, north and west-central, (ii) ﬂooded rice, which is mainly grown on the large north-western and northern plains, and (iii) irrigated rice, which
is grown in the developed lowlands and the dam-based schemes of the center, west, center-west and north. This qualitative survey examines the cropping
system in four districts in Côte d’Ivoire: Gagnoa, Man, M’Bahiakro, and Bongouanou.
Note: Input costs were only partially reclaimed by the project. Otherwise, the gross margin would have been negative (-67,027 XOF).

3.4 AGRICULTURAL POLICY ENTRY POINTS FOR MORE, BETTER, AND INCLUSIVE
EMPLOYMENT GENERATION
Continued support to productivity growth in labor-intensive rice, cotton, and cashews could be com-
plemented with additional support to other labor-intensive staples and high-value crops. Côte d’Ivoire’s
traditional policy focus on cash crops more broadly (and cocoa in particular), has recently been extended to rice
taking a more promising, holistic value chain approach that seeks to integrate all stakeholders. Despite much
progress, many challenges remain, all along the chain, which continues to suffer from undercapitalization
and lack of skills, coordination, and organization at all levels. There remain also important and underexplored
opportunities for productivity increase in other staples (roots and tubers), which would also help raise women’s
agricultural labor productivity,66 and employment generation in the expansion of other high-value products
(meat, dairy, fruits, and vegetables). Value chain studies can further help identify chain-speciﬁc constraints.67
To maximize employment generation, inclusive value chain approaches should be promoted. This remains an
important area for further investigation.
Smallholder agriculture holds most promise for inclusive employment generation. Smallholders in
Côte d’Ivoire are relatively well endowed with land and hire labor (including from abroad) to make up for
family labor shortages. There are no signs that larger farmers in Côte d’Ivoire are more efﬁcient than smaller
ones (Figure 3.10). Recent, rigorous assessment of the (short-term) spillover effects from new large farm estab-
lishments in Mozambique also points to limited beneﬁcial effects on neighboring smallholders within 25 to 50
kilometers.68 The limited indirect effects reported in Mozambique are furthermore limited to the adoption of
better agronomic practices and accessing modern inputs, but were not found to extend to employment gener-
ation or output market participation and are counterbalanced by a decrease in perceived welfare. As in Brazil,
this recent experience from Mozambique underscores once again that more and better jobs from large-scale
commercial agricultural production units remain often far and few between.
Mechanization remains limited. As urban and rural wages increase, pressures to mechanize will increase. This
does not necessarily imply large-scale farming. Different market solutions (such as machinery services) exist to
overcome the indivisibility of farming capital and capture the economies of scale implied in mechanization.
They have been deployed successfully, most recently also in China, where land endowments are multiple times
smaller.69 While not acute, the need for supporting smallholder mechanization within Côte d’Ivoire and its
implications for employment generation in agriculture deserves further investigation.

     The 2011–2016 regional US$44 million West African Agricultural Productivity Program (WAAPP), which Côte d’Ivoire participates in and
     which is the ﬁrst phase of a 10-year program, provides an initial step in addressing the staple crop productivity gap. The program focused
     on the development and dissemination of improved seed varieties and processing techniques for a series of staple crops (plantain, rice,
     manioc, rice, maize, mango) and animal husbandry (chicken, pork). Regional research centers were set up, each focusing on one crop. The
     center in Côte d’Ivoire focused on plantain.

Addressing technology adoption, health hazards, and skills gap. Inorganic fertilizer use is low. Nonetheless,
multivariate analysis suggests positive gross returns to inorganic fertilizer use for most crops. These disappear
however when looking at net returns (when the fertilizer expense is accounted for). Inorganic fertilizer is often
also inadequately used (as illustrated in the qualitative rice study) and considered costly. The proﬁtability of
inorganic fertilizer use and the policies affecting it (fertilizer policy, agronomic extension) need further inves-
tigation. Agro-chemicals on the other hand are widely used. In addition to soil and water pollution, they also
raise important concerns about health hazards, which deserve more attention.
Côte d’Ivoire remains also well below the 1 percent agricultural GDP benchmark in terms of its public spending
on agricultural research and development (Figure 3.11). And even recently (2011), there were only 131 full-time
equivalent researchers (compared with 1,151 in Kenya or 815 in Tanzania). While much of agricultural research
and development (R&D) in Côte d’Ivoire is ﬁnanced by the private sector (through the International-Professional
Fund for Agricultural Research and Extension (Fonds Interprofesionnel pour la Recherche et le Conseil Agricole,
FIRCA) and the food industry (including the establishment of local research centers by some multinationals), this
is mainly geared toward cash crops, not staple crops.70

     WAAPP a regional program focused on increasing staple crop productivity, including by strengthening the national research centers,
     begins addressing some of the constraints.

                                                                                                                                                82
Finally, low educational levels and poor training among all actors in the chains (farmers, traders, and proces-
sors) hold agricultural innovation back. Rural literacy rates, for example, are just 25 percent, highlighting the
lack of foundational skills, an enormous and urgent challenge elaborated upon in Chapter 6. But demand for
agricultural-speciﬁc technical education also largely exceeds supply and agricultural innovation increasingly also
asks for skills not traditionally developed in agricultural education, that is the so-called soft skills that enable
people to communicate, develop leadership, and work collaboratively Rehabilitating the agricultural education
and training centers would allow to leverage gains in primary education (Chapter 6) and build the stock of agri-
cultural knowledge providers. But it also requires bringing these centers into the agricultural innovation system
by creating communication channels between researchers, producers and employers (for example by linking
professional networks), modernizing curricula (shifting them to applied learning, and problem solving with an
interdisciplinary focus), and rendering them more gender inclusive (for example through targeted recruitment
policies in education, research, and extension programs).71
Improve rural land tenure security. Land tenure security matters for ﬁxed land investments that are important
to increase land productivity, but take time to pay off (land improvement, irrigation, tree crops). It also facilitates
off-farm diversiﬁcation and prevents land disputes and conﬂict. On the one hand, at 34 percent the share of
households which reported to have a land title is much larger in Côte d’Ivoire than in other African countries
(1 percent in Malawi, 11 percent in Niger, 14 percent in Tanzania, 19 percent in Uganda).72 Yet, this still leaves
two in three farmers without a title, and even among those with a title, only one-third (11 percentage points)
has an ofﬁcial document. Most land is owned and transferred according to local customary law. Facilitating the
resolution of land disputes, especially those involving immigrants, is a priority for promoting greater inclusiveness
in rural land tenure and preventing conﬂicts. Working with traditional and local authorities to develop alterna-
tive dispute resolution mechanisms acceptable to all could be a step in this direction. But even so, with women
not allowed to inherit land in many ethnic groups, access to land for women remains conﬁned to borrowing,
renting or share cropping, or through their husbands. This holds back their productivity potential and requires
special attention (FAO 2010; Ministère de l’agriculture de Côte d’Ivoire, 2013).
Overcome the ﬁnancing gap. As highlighted in the rice value chain study, the ability of farmers and agri-
businesses to invest is importantly determined by their access to ﬁnancial services. Initiatives to expand access
to ﬁnance in rural areas have as yet proven unsuccessful. Even micro ﬁnancial institutions (MFIs) devote only
5 percent of their portfolio to ﬁnancing agriculture. As a result, only an estimated 14 percent of the rural
population have access to formal ﬁnancial services. A comprehensive agricultural ﬁnance diagnostic is called
for. Successful development of ﬁnancial services will, among others, require a supportive legal and regulatory
framework that enables the enforcement of legal contracts in the agricultural sector. Market-friendly government
support mechanisms (such as partial credit guarantee schemes and public-private partnerships to encourage the
development of agricultural insurance) will also be needed.

     The training model followed by the Songhai agricultural training center in Porto Novo, Benin provides just one such example. It is locally
     owned and privately managed. Instruction favors application, with more than 75 percent of time devoted to practical subjects. Innovations
     in the training include creation of a business center of agricultural products and a credit program to help trainees establish themselves
     after training. About 20 percent of the trainees are women and 60 percent come from rural areas. Sixty-ﬁve to seventy percent of its
     graduates settle in agriculture. Other African institutes which successfully adapted their AET programs include Makerere in Uganda, Jomo
     Kenyatta in Kenya, as well as institutes in Mauritius. For a comprehensive review of AET reform guidance, see module 2 in Agricultural
     Innovation Systems, An Investment Sourcebook (World Bank 2012b).

4 RAISING PRODUCTIVITY IN
4:
NONAGRICULTURAL SELF-EMPLOYMENT
IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Bienvenue N. Tien and Patrick Premand

4.1 INTRODUCTION
Projections of the future employment proﬁle in Côte d’Ivoire indicate that nonagricultural self-employ-
ment is likely to become the largest employment category by 2025. Nonagricultural independent activities
already make up a sizable share of jobs in Côte d’Ivoire. Based on employment survey data (ENSETE 2013), non-
agricultural self-employment in microenterprises accounted for 29.3 percent of employment in the country in
February 2014, compared to 46.9 percent in agriculture and only 17.4 percent in wage jobs (see Chapter 1). This
share is projected to reach more than 40 percent by 2025. While projections of course have a margin of errors,
nonagricultural self-employment is likely to become the largest employment sector, larger than the expected
share of wage jobs and probably even agricultural employment (see Chapter 2, in particular, Annex B).
Almost all nonagricultural household enterprises are in the informal sector, and their legal status is fuzzy.
In the Ivorian legal framework, microenterprises are deﬁned as having a maximum of 10 permanent employees,
with an annual turnover (after taxes) up to CFAF 30 million, and doing some form of simpliﬁed accounting.
Nonagricultural household enterprises are in this sense also microenterprises. However, an important caveat
is that most independent activities are not registered and do not hold any form of accounting.73 As such,
household enterprises operate at the margin of current laws on small-medium enterprises in the country. In
this chapter, the terms nonagricultural self-employment, nonagricultural household enterprises, nonagricultural
microenterprises, or simply household enterprises are used interchangeably. Box 4.1 gives an overview of existing
deﬁnitions of informality.
Surprisingly, the large share of employment in the sector along with its potential is often overlooked
in policy discussions. Policy strategies for nonagricultural self-employment are very limited in Côte d’Ivoire. Yet,
nonagricultural household enterprises are a key source of employment, particularly for the poor and women.
While the Government of Côte d’Ivoire aims to have an ‘emerging economy’ by 2020, the informal sector is
there to stay. As such, addressing the informal sector in policy strategies will be needed as part of the efforts
to achieve this ambitious goal. Raising productivity in the sector will be particularly critical to ensure better and
more inclusive productive opportunities as well as to contribute to poverty reduction. It can also contribute to
off-farm diversiﬁcation in rural areas, as mentioned in Chapter 2.
This chapter discusses employment and productivity in the nonagricultural household enterprise
sector in Côte d’Ivoire, as well as the scope for policies to support it. The chapter starts with an overall
description of household enterprises. Some basic questions are addressed, such as who operates in the sector
and why, what are the most common types of activities, do these activities persist over time? In light of very
large heterogeneity in productivity, the chapter then addresses constraints for individuals to create or operate

     For Côte d’Ivoire, oﬃcial deﬁnition of small and medium enterprises is provided in Loi N o 2014-140 du 24 Mars 2014 on National Policy
     Orientation for small and medium enterprises. Chapter II, Article 5 of this law provides the deﬁnition of microenterprises.

                                                                                                                                              85
household enterprises, as well as determinants of household enterprises’ productivity. The analysis is primar-
ily based on quantitative micro data, but also supported with complementary qualitative data on household
enterprises collected as part of the study (see Box 4.2 for a discussion of data sources). The ﬁnal section looks at
different policy entry points for the sector and analyses the interplay of the different actors (household enterprise
operators, policy makers, and other stakeholders).


BOX 4.1: NONAGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLD ENTERPRISES AND INFORMALITY:
CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS
Analyzing nonagricultural household enterprises requires a workable deﬁnition of these activities in the broader
realm of the informal economy. Existing deﬁnitions of informality itself are many and far from being consensual
(Maloney 2004). In spite of its varying meanings, scholars, pundits, and decision makers tend to give a negative
connotation to informality: unprotected workers, excessive regulation, low productivity, unfair competition, evasion
of the rule of law, underpayment or nonpayment of taxes, and work ‘underground’ (Perry et al. 2007).
Conceptually, a deﬁnition of the informal sector was adopted during the ILO’s Fifteenth International Conference
of Labor Statisticians (15th ICLS) in 1993, which subsequently was included in the revised international System
of National Accounts (SNA 1993). Two approaches of the informal sector emerged from that conference: the
enterprise approach and the labor approach. In the enterprise approach, the informal sector is deﬁned in terms
of characteristics of the production units (enterprises) in which activities take place. In the labor approach, the
informal sector is deﬁned in terms of the characteristics of the persons involved or their jobs (Hussmanns 2004).
According to Hussmanns (2004), on the one hand, employment in the informal sector includes “all jobs in informal
sector enterprises or all persons who, during a given reference period, were employed in at least one informal sector
enterprise, irrespective of their status in employment and whether it was their main or a secondary job” (p. 2). On
the other hand, informal sector enterprises were deﬁned on the basis of selected criteria such as size, registration,
market orientation, nonagricultural activities. Moreover, the 17th ICLS deﬁned informal employment as “comprising
the total number of informal jobs, whether carried out in formal sector enterprises, informal sector enterprises, or
households, during a given reference period.” In addition to the above-mentioned criteria, compliance with public
regulation has emerged as an important criterion to deﬁne informality; with the rationale that interactions with
the state play a pivotal role to deﬁne informality (Benjamin et al. 2014; Kanbur 2009).
Still, the above-mentioned criteria have been subject to criticism. It is diﬃcult to deﬁne the informal sector in a
dichotomized manner (Benjamin and Mbaye 2012). Existing deﬁnitions do not suﬃciently distinguish between
formal and informal ﬁrms. Some scholars prefer to coin the informal sector as a ‘continuum’ with diﬀerent degrees
of formality (Steel and Snodgrass 2008). On that ground, Benjamin and Mbaye (2012) establish criteria to classify
ﬁrms in six diﬀerent levels of informality.
Against this backdrop, the term ‘household enterprise’ ﬁts in the realm of the conceptual framework elaborated
above. Fox and Sohnesen (2012) and Filmer et al. (2014, p.150) deﬁne household enterprises (HEs) as unincor-
porated, nonfarm businesses owned by households. From an employment perspective, they include self-employed
individuals running unincorporated businesses as well as family members working in those businesses, mostly as
family helpers. This deﬁnition incorporates both the enterprise and labor approaches.
Operationally, in the case of Côte d’Ivoire, existing literature on informality indicates that the country follows the
ILO framework elaborated above. However, the predominant way to deﬁne informality is based on the registra-
tion criterion, and slightly less on the size criterion. Indeed, from both approaches (enterprise or labor), being in
informality implies that the operating entity or employee is not registered with the Government Social Security
Oﬃce (Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale or CNPS). The rationale is that registration with the social security
oﬃce is generally the last administrative step to establish an enterprise or declaring an employee in Côte d’Ivoire,
while often preceding steps of formalization are juridical or ﬁscal natures (AGEPE 2011). Throughout this chapter,
nonagricultural household enterprises are deﬁned as in Filmer et al. (2014). The terms nonagricultural household
enterprises or simply household enterprises or informal sector are used interchangeably.

BOX 4.2: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA SOURCES FOR AN INTEGRATED APPROACH
TO ANALYZE THE NONAGRICULTURAL HOUSEHOLD ENTERPRISE SECTOR IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Existing analyses on household enterprises (Fox and Sohnesen 2012; Filmer et al. 2014) have mostly relied on
quantitative surveys. To some extents, quantitative data may not capture all the nuances of the sector, in particular
as quantitative interviews and traditional labor-force surveys, may not adequately measure the characteristics,
productivity or constraints faced by household enterprise operators (Benjamin et al. 2014).
To get a comprehensive picture of constraints and challenges in the sector, this chapter uses both quantitative
micro data and complementary qualitative data. First, cross-sectional quantitative data is obtained from the 2013
national employment Survey (ENSETE 2013). The survey provides nationally representative data on approximately
12,000 households and their members. It includes a household-based module on Income Generating Activities and
Household Enterprises. From this survey, we are able to perform analysis at the level of the unit of production as well
as at the level of the household enterprise owner (often household heads). Key information on diﬃculties at entry,
sector, and location of operation, number of workers, levels of proﬁts or revenues are derived from this module.
As indicated earlier, quantitative surveys, in particular cross-sectional surveys, present some limitations, for example
in providing information on interactions between operators and government oﬃcials or consumers, as well as the
eﬀect of the recent conﬂict on the sector in Côte d’Ivoire. Following recent work on household enterprise in fragile
and conﬂict aﬀected states that originated in Liberia (Chapman and Heaner, 2016), complementary qualitative
data was collected in Côte d’Ivoire to better understand the sector. While the qualitative data is not representative,
it is useful to draw contrasts and highlight nuances harder to pick up from closed questions. For instance, the
qualitative survey helps to identify the range of constraints aﬀecting productivity in the sector, as well as gain a
deeper understanding of issues from the perspective of diﬀerent stakeholders, which may not be revealed in existing
quantitative data (Benjamin et al. 2014).
In practice, the qualitative work covered 10 communities throughout Côte d’Ivoire, including 6 urban communities
(Yopougon and Abobo in Abidjan, Man, Bouaké, Korhogo, and Bondoukou) and 4 rural communities (around Man,
Bouaké, Korhogo, and Bondoukou). In each community, focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews
(KIIs) were conducted. The FGDs targeted Household Enterprise Operators (HEOs), Aspiring Entrepreneurs (AEs),
Consumer/Community Members (CCs), while the KIIs targeted HEOs, AEs, community leaders, government represen-
tatives, and nongovernmental organizations (see Figure B4.2.1). The qualitative work led to a substantive ﬁeld report
that was produced as a background piece to this chapter (Bouaki 2016), as well as over 500 pages of transcripts.

4.2 WHO IS OPERATING HOUSEHOLD ENTERPRISES AND WHY?

4.2.1 Who works in the sector?
As in many countries in the region, the median owner of a nonagricultural household enterprise is a
young female with no formal education. In Côte d’Ivoire, 60 percent of nonagricultural household enter-
prises owners are female.74 Also, approximately half of all nonagricultural household enterprises are owned by
young people between the age of 14 and 34 (Figure 4.1). More than half of the owners do not have any formal
education. Only about 14 percent have at least completed low secondary or more (Figure 4.2). These general
characteristics of household enterprise owners are in line with ﬁndings in other Sub-Saharan African economies,
such as Ghana and Cameroon (Fox and Sohnesen 2012).
The majority of nonagricultural household enterprises are in small-scale service activities. Figure 4.3
indicates that more than 40 percent are in small-scale retail and trading activities, such as selling personal
products (Table C.1 in Annex C lists the most common activities). Other common activities include small-scale
manufacturing activities (such as producing fruit juice, alcohol or other activities involving basic processing and
the transformation of agricultural products) (17.4 percent), as well as food selling and restaurants (15.5 percent).
The majority of nonagricultural household enterprises are operated in urban areas (70.2 percent). In urban
areas, retail activities, personal services (hairdressing), and construction activities are relatively more common
than in rural areas. In rural areas, activities involving the transformation of agricultural products or selling food
are relatively more common (Figure 4.3).75
Almost all nonagricultural household enterprises are informal. More than 90 percent are not registered
in any way. An earlier informal survey conducted in Abidjan also found similar results (AGEPE 2011). In addi-
tion, more than 60 percent of nonagricultural household enterprises report not keeping any books, with just
14.4 percent undertaking formal bookkeeping (Figure 4.4). The degree of informality is also evident through
the fact that 68.1 percent of household enterprise owners are not subject to formal ﬁscal regimes. Only some
5.0 percent are subject to regime réel, and 27 percent pay lump-sum taxes (Figure 4.5). That being said, most
microenterprises do need to pay local authorities for permits (patente) to operate.
Although they are informal, nonagricultural household enterprises are persistent. More than 75 percent
of nonagricultural household enterprises are active throughout the year (Figure 4.6). In addition, they are not
short lived. More than 80 percent have been active for more than 5 years (Figure 4.7).

       As indicated in Chapter 1, in Côte d’Ivoire, the share of women in nonagricultural self-employment is much higher than male counterparts.
       However, there are no signiﬁcant diﬀerence over time in the gender break-down in the sector.
75
       The data from employment survey makes it hard to categorize employment in terms of tradable and non-tradable sectors. However,
       it is clear that small-scale retails activities (such as selling personal or food products) dominate nonagricultural self-employment in
       Côte d’Ivoire. These types of activities are most likely to oriented to ﬁll the needs of local communities and markets.

4.2.2 Why do people work in the sector?
In general, the literature has documented that the degree of informality in an economy may depend
on the structure of the labor market, as well as the overall economic situation in a given country.
Loayza and Rigolini (2011) document that in the long run, informality is larger when labor productivity is lower,
government services weaker, and business ﬂexibility less prevalent. In the short run, they ﬁnd that informal
employment behaves counter-cyclically, which suggests that it acts as a buffer or safety net in case of crisis and
shocks. In Côte d’Ivoire, the trends presented in Chapter 1 suggest that the informal sector indeed expanded


                                                                                                                                                                                       89
during the years of crisis. However, a large part of the informal sector is rather structural and it includes busi-
nesses with many years of operation, as mentioned above.
Decisions to enter into entrepreneurship or nonagricultural self-employment have also been the
subject of many studies.76 A common framework to analyze entry into the sector contrasts push and pull
factors.77 For instance, expected level of proﬁts, economic growth, and high innovative potential characterize pull
factors, while differences between expected proﬁts and current local wages in the sector represent push factors
(Lederman et al. 2014). In countries such as Tanzania and Republic of Congo, push factors appear predominant
(Fox and Sohnesen 2012). In Côte d’Ivoire, a range of pull factors are also at play.
In line with descriptive patterns above, women and individuals with no or low education levels
are more likely to be self-employed. Estimates from probit regressions indicate that education along with
numeracy are associated with variations in the likelihood of being self-employed. More educated individuals
and those with better reading and writing skills (of French language) are less likely to be in self-employment.
Similarly, males are less likely to enter the sector compared with female counterparts (see Box C.1 in Annex C
for more details on the estimation technique, and see Table C.2 in Annex C for results).
Moreover, in contrast to common perceptions, many individuals report preferring self-employment
over other types of occupations including wage employment. More than 53 percent of the individuals
(15 years of age and more) desire to be self-employed, while only some 18.2 percent and 18.7 percent desire
to be in public and private wage employment, respectively. The desire to be self-employed is even higher
among individuals with no formal education (77.9 percent) compared with only 10.8 percent among those
with post-secondary education level (Figure 4.8). These patterns may of course reﬂect a constrained choice set,
particularly for the low-educated individuals for which formal wage jobs are often unattainable.
Overall, a range of pull factors contribute to entry into nonagricultural self-employment. Expected
earning potentials (43.2 percent) in the sector as well as the desire to be independent (being one’s own boss)
(37 percent) are key motives why individuals declare preferring self-employment. In particular, the expectation
of higher earnings than in other activities is a key reason for women to prefer the sector (44.2 percent) as is the
desire to be independent individuals in rural areas (45.9 percent) (Table 4.1).

      Lederman et al. (2014) and Perry et al. (2007) provide a comprehensive review of the literature on the selection into the sector.
77
      For more formal entrepreneurship, Lederman et al. (2014) indicate that entry mistakes may occur if potential entrepreneurs are over-
      conﬁdent. This may apply less to developing countries and small-scale self-employment activities. Still, in the case of Côte d’Ivoire, the
      qualitative survey indicates that virtually all potential entrepreneurs say they are absolutely conﬁdent that they will succeed once they
      establish their enterprises. Their conﬁdence is explained by their own assessment of their abilities, prior experiences in the sector they
      want to operate, and so on.

Qualitative data also provide additional insights as to why some individuals may prefer self-employ-
ment as opposed to other types of work. Factors such as the risk associated with informal private wage
sector jobs and the role of social capital in job search were regularly mentioned by qualitative informants.
Moreover, for individuals in rural areas, nonagricultural household enterprises represent a key source of diver-
siﬁcation of the household income portfolio. Nonagricultural household enterprises are, for instance, used as a
buffer or a complementary activity to mitigate harvest risks (see Box 4.3 for examples of pull factors from the
qualitative work).


BOX 4.3: SELECTED QUALITATIVE QUOTES ON ENTRY INTO NONAGRICULTURAL
HOUSEHOLD ENTERPRISES
As described in Box 4.2, this chapter relies both on quantitative micro data and complementary qualitative data to
better understand the constraints and challenges in the sector. Several factors lead individuals to self-employment.
When asked, participants in FGDs alluded to key factors which shed light on why they may choose to operate a
household enterprise. This provides additional insight to the reasons elaborated in Table 4.1. For instance, risks
associated with private wage sector (for example, being not well paid, or not being paid at all), lack of adequate
social capital to obtain wage jobs, or seasonality in rural settings. Below are selected quotes from participants to
highlight these points.
Risks in private wage jobs: “Souvent tu travailles chez eux [les employeurs] et en ﬁn de semaine, ils ne te donnent
pas ton argent. A la zone, si tu as un accident de travail, ton employeur ne fait rien pour toi, il te laisse comme ça.
Le SMIGR n’est pas respecté à la zone industrielle. […]” (FGD CC M Yopougon)
Social Capital: “ On nous a formé ici. Le jour de la remise des kits, ils ont laissé ceux qui ont eu les bonnes moyennes
et ils nous ont laissés. Ils ont pris ceux qu’ils connaissaient pour les récompenser. […]” (FGD AE, Korhogo urbain)
“ …[Q]uand les structures viennent, ils ne prennent pas en compte nos diplômes. Ils recrutent par relation”
(FGD HE Man)
Seasonality: “Le manioc produit une fois en un an alors que le commerçant gagne un peu tous les jours […]” (FGD

Self-employment is not necessarily synonymous with unhappiness with work and life compared with
other occupations. The previous discussion highlighted for many individuals a preference for self-employ-
ment relative to wage employment as an aspect of the rationale for entering into self-employment. There is an
emerging literature looking at the relationship between sector of employment and happiness with work and
life. For instance, Falco et al. (2012) show, in the case of Ghana, that there is a high degree of overlap in the
distribution of satisfaction across sectors (formal employment and informal employment). In other words, being
in self-employment does not necessary translate into unhappiness. In the case Côte d’Ivoire, analysis from the
qualitative work shows that many operators display positive attitude with regard to their work. This illustrates
that a productive nonagricultural household enterprise can contribute to well-being.
Clearly, not all individuals are in the informal sector by choice, but these patterns highlight substantial
heterogeneity in the sector, and a somewhat more nuanced view compared to the negative connota-
tion the sector often elicits. More educated individual are less likely to enter nonagricultural self-employment
by choice. At the same time, and as further described below, many operators in the sector face constraints
that hinder their business opportunities. It remains that, for many individuals, entering nonagricultural self-em-
ployment is a way to increase their earnings. Indeed, as mentioned in Chapter  3, average productivity in
nonagricultural self-employment tends to be higher than average productivity in agriculture. As such, for many,
entry into nonagricultural self-employment can contribute to offer a better job and a pathway out of poverty.

4.2.3. The household enterprise sector is very heterogeneous
The large heterogeneity in the household enterprise sector is visible through substantial variations
in productivity.78 Figures 4.10–4.13 illustrate the distributions of productivity across gender and area of resi-
dence. Figures 4.10 and 4.12 display the frequency distributions of productivity. Figures 4.11 and 4.13 display
cumulative distributions of output per worker, showing the fraction of individuals in the sector at or below any
given level of productivity. The horizontal differences are indicative of the productivity gaps between groups.
Overall, productivity measures have a high dispersion.
The household enterprise sector includes a mix of high and low productivity units of production. While
many individuals are just surviving in the sector, many others are doing very well. Figures 4.10–4.14 illustrate
some stylized facts: enterprises owned by men and operating in Abidjan are the most productive, while operators
in rural areas are much less productive.
Sectors that are relatively more capital intensive tend to be more productive. The heterogeneity in house-
hold enterprises is reﬂected by strong variation in productivity across types of activities. Sectors such as transport,
sales, or bar and restaurant activities are more productive than trade (Figure 4.14). These sectors are generally
more capital intensive. For instance, operators in sales (for example, retails of personal articles, cereals, clothes,
and so on) are estimated to be, on average, between 23 to 28 percent more productive than those trading
alcohol, juice, and fruits. These estimates are highly statistically signiﬁcant (Figure 4.15; Table C.3, in Annex C).


4.3 WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AND DRIVERS OF PRODUCTIVITY IN
NONAGRICULTURAL SELF-EMPLOYMENT?
From a policy standpoint, one key question is to understand the constraints for individuals in low-pro-
ductivity household enterprises to become more productive. This requires a better understanding of the
most prevalent constraints, as well as market failures that could be addressed through public interventions. The
preceding sections have highlighted the characteristics of operators as well as the highly heterogeneous nature
of the sector. This section sheds light on inhibiting constraints as well as factors enhancing productivity.
As in many other countries around the world, individuals in Côte d’Ivoire face multiple constraints
to create and operate household enterprises. These constraints evolve around the capital available at entry
and in operation, the business environment in which (potential) micro-entrepreneurs (expect to) operate, and
the business and entrepreneurial skills of the operators. Analysis from both quantitative and qualitative data

indicates that there is a distinct hierarchy of constraints, in the following order: capital constraints, constraints
in terms of space and working environment, interactions with authorities, and skills.
Figure 4.16 illustrates the most prevailing constraints from a nonrepresentative survey of urban
(mostly informal) microenterprises that reported interest in hosting apprentices as part of the PEJEDEC
project (Crépon and Premand, 2017). The ranking of constraints is broadly consistent with the ordering
mentioned above. Microenterprise owners overwhelmingly report lack of access to capital as a major binding
constraint they face to open their business, with over 60 percent reporting facing capital constraints. As men-
tioned above, access to work space can often be an issue, with few microenterprises operating in a dedicated
business space. Owners report access to land as one of the top ﬁve constraints they face. The business environ-
ment, lack of clients, as well as difﬁculties with local government are common constraints. While a very large
share of the owners have no education, and few undertake any accounting, lack of skills does not appear high
on the list of obstacles reported by enterprise owners.
Capital constraints are the most binding for individuals in the sector. In the 2013 national employment
survey (ENSETE 2013), more than half of household enterprise owners (52.7 percent) cited lack of capital as a major
problem for start-up.79 Qualitative data provides highly consistent information, showing that the lack of access to
adequate ﬁnancial services is both a constraint to entry as well as for household enterprise operation, also because
it limits working capital and opportunities for longer-term investments. The very limited or nonexistent ﬁnancial ser-
vices compel (potential) micro-entrepreneurs in the sector to mostly rely on personal savings or on family and friends
networks for ﬁnancing.80 This situation is in line with earlier ﬁndings in other countries in Africa (Filmer et al. 2014).
The lack of safe working environment or access to markets represent an impediment for productivity
in the sector. Descriptive statistics from the employment survey (ENSETE 2013) show that most household enter-
prises operate on the street (34.4 percent), followed by home (26.4 percent), market place (23.7 percent), in a
permanent building (11.1 percent), and other (4.4 percent). At the same time, estimates show that entrepreneurs
operating from home have signiﬁcantly lower productivity. For instance, at the national level, owners operating
in a ﬁxed building or in a market place are, respectively, 57.2 percent and 18.5 percent more productive than
those operating from home (Table C.3, column 2). These differences are strongly statistically signiﬁcant.

     Although lack of capital is reported as major binding constraint at entry, individuals who report such entry constraint do not have lower
     productivity on average. Estimates indicate that individuals who, for instance, had no diﬃculties at entry are not necessary more pro-
     ductive than comparable counterparts who had no access to capital at entryThis may be the case because they had to enter a less
     capital-intensive sector due to the constraints they face in the ﬁrst place (Table C.3, column 2).

In the qualitative survey, many business operators also complained of a poor business environment
and problematic relations with local authorities. Microenterprise owners complained about extortion,
including from municipal authorities.81 Although many operators pay simpliﬁed taxes to the municipalities in
which they operate, they often report being extorted by tax collectors or having to pay bribes. Many microenter-
prise owners do not feel like they are receiving adequate services in exchange for the taxes they pay. These issues
would need to be tackled as part of the strategy to improve the enabling environment for microenterprises.
Formal education has mixed effects on productivity in household enterprises. In the national employ-
ment survey, it ﬁrst appears that schooling is correlated with household enterprises’ productivity. However, this
effect works through a range of other factors, including the number of years in operation and hours worked a
week, so that there is no remaining education premia after controlling for these factors (Table C.3, Annex C).
Earlier cross-country analysis also suggested limited returns to education in the sector (see Fox and Sohnesen
2012), although the majority of household enterprise owners have no formal education. Chapter 6 in this report
also shows that earnings premia for additional education are lower in nonagricultural self-employment than
they are in wage employment. Still, qualitative informants acknowledge that basic education can contribute to
run microenterprises through basic numeracy and literacy skills.82
Years of experience in operation are associated with higher productivity. One of the key differences
between formal and informal enterprises is that formal enterprises have the ability to acquire skilled workforce or
upgrade workforce whenever necessary, while microenterprises have limited scope for human capital changes. As
indicated above, household enterprises’ owners work alone most of the time and have limited formal education.
Qualitative informants indicate during FGDs that they often compensate the lack of these skills with experience
over time (‘learning by doing’)83 (Figure 4.17). Estimates from the national employment survey also indicate
that there is a positive and statistically signiﬁcant nonlinear effect of age on household enterprises productivity
(Figure 4.18). The coefﬁcient estimates range from 9.9 percent to 11.1 percent (Table C.3, columns 1 and 2).
Basic business skills also seem to matter for productivity, including through the capacity to keep
books, accomplish necessary administrative paperwork, or the ability to expand, diversify, and
improve product quality. Similarly, estimates show that household enterprises with formal bookkeeping

records and some simpliﬁed form of booking are, respectively, 14.4 percent and 31.2 percent more productive
than household enterprises that do not keep books at all (Table C.3, Annex C). Lack of adequate business skills
coupled with limited or lack of training opportunities make it difﬁcult for small-scale entrepreneurs to expand,
diversify, and develop effective marketing strategies.84 Simply put, operators in the sector are constrained by
weak technical and business skills (managerial and marketing skills).
Operators in the sector also mention challenges related to behavioral skills. Micro-entrepreneurs in
specialized activities in urban areas have difﬁculties at ﬁnding skilled and trusted workforce; even when they are
willing to provide on-the-job training.85 Qualitative informants in focus group discussions in rural communities
mention that they ﬁnd difﬁcult to retain recruits as well.


4.4 TOWARD A MORE SUPPORTIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FOR
SELF-EMPLOYMENT
A discussion of the informal sector would not be complete without addressing the issue of interac-
tions between household enterprise operators and the state. In the literature, government failures have
been identiﬁed as a key factor contributing to the spread of informality, especially in developing economies. In
this context, informality is viewed as a deliberate rational choice in response to the relative costs and beneﬁts of
formal versus informal status (see Diop and Niang 2012, for an exhaustive list of other references). In other terms,
institutional settings do inﬂuence individuals’ decisions to operate formal or informal enterprises. When discussing
government failures in this context, the literature indicates three factors affecting ﬁrms’ choice of becoming or
remaining informal: access to public services, the regulatory and tax environment, and the enforcement of regu-
lations (Diop and Niang 2012). This section sheds light on existing institutional roles and strategies for the sector,
as well as entry points to set up a more supportive business environment for the household enterprise sector.

4.4.1 Existing institutional roles and strategies
Household enterprises are not explicitly featured in the national employment strategy. As indicated,
micro-enterprises represent a key source of job, including for women and youths. Yet formal SMEs attract by
far the most policy attention, despite their much smaller labor share. A review of the recent literature and policy
documents undertaken as background to this chapter shows that that there is no comprehensive national strat-
egy for household enterprises or the informal sector.
Furthermore, actions regarding informal enterprises tend to start with the question of how to ‘for-
malize’ them.86 In this spirit, over the past few years, Côte d’Ivoire has substantially reduced the procedures
for starting a formal business; ranking globally 46 out of 189 economies on the ease of doing business (Doing
Business 2016). Today, with a one stop-shop agency, there are four major steps taking up to seven businesses
days to create a formal business in the country (Doing Business 2016). These improvements are welcome, and
as Chapter 5 discusses, the share of small ﬁrms have been growing in the formal sector over time. Still, many
informal microenterprises remain unaware of these changes. In fact, most qualitative informants do not seem
familiar with the simpliﬁed procedures to register a business in the country; especially for individuals in secondary
cities. This is consistent with international experience, which has shown consistently that efforts to encourage
formalization is only effective for a relatively small share of ﬁrms.
Formalization should not be seen as an end in itself, particularly since evidence on the effectiveness
of policies to encourage formalization on ﬁrm productivity are rather mixed. Overall, as indicated in
Bruhn and McKenzie (2013), formalization policies — based on current evidence (see Box 4.4) — result only in

a modest increase in the number of ﬁrm registrations. At the same time, formalizing household enterprises
typically contribute very little to tax revenues. In addition, most informal ﬁrms appear not to beneﬁt much from
formalizing, and therefore public rationale for trying to formalize micro-enterprises may be subject to debate.
More and more, formalization is incentivized through complementary beneﬁt packages that seek to address
constraints to ﬁrm productivity. In this sense, ﬁnding effective policies to address constraints to productivity
should come ﬁrst, and attempts to formalize second.


BOX 4.4: FORMALIZATION AND MICROENTERPRISE PERFORMANCE: WHAT DO WE KNOW?
When it comes to formalization and performance in the informal sector, there are two broad questions that are
usually asked (Benjamin et al. 2014): (a) Does a reduction in entry procedures (for example, reducing number
of days to start a business) lead to an increase in the number of new formal ﬁrms? and (2) What happens once
ﬁrms formalize? For instance, do these ﬁrms show increased performance with respect to informal ﬁrms? It is
worth noting here that overall, the body of literature on formalization and the informal sector performance in Sub-
Saharan Africa is scarce. Most of the studies on this topic have been conducted in Latin America and Southeast
Asia (Benjamin et al. 2014; Bruhn and McKenzie 2013).
Bruhn and McKenzie (2013) summarize a number of studies on the ﬁrst question on the eﬀects of entry reforms
and related policies to promote ﬁrm formalization. Overall, they ﬁnd most of these policies to promote ﬁrm formal-
ization result only in a modest increase in the number of formal ﬁrms, if at all. For instance, in Mexico, Bruhn (2011)
analyzed the impact of a reform that, in 2002, reduced the number of days to start a business from 30.1 to 1.4. The
author ﬁnds that the reform increased the number of registered ﬁrms, but only by 5 percent, a small magnitude.
Similarly, Cárdenas and Rozo (2009) ﬁnd, in the case of Columbia, that the inception of a one-stop-shop in six
major cities increased business registrations by 5 percent. In Peru, Mullainathan and Schnabl (2010) ﬁnd that a
municipal licensing reform in Lima increased the number of provisional licenses issued to informal ﬁrms, but many
of these ﬁrms did not renew their license later. Andrade, Bruhn, and McKenzie (2013) ﬁnd in a case study from Belo
Horizonte (Brazil) that information campaigns following simpliﬁcation of formalization (registration requirements)
result in very few informal ﬁrm registering, in particular only when the ﬁrms received a municipal inspection. In that
case, the likelihood of formalizing was between 21 to 27 percentage points. Moreover, studies from South Asia also
ﬁnd similar results. For instance, in Sri Lanka, de Mel, McKenzie and Woodruﬀ (2013) ﬁnd that information provi-
sion and cost reimbursement of business registration had no eﬀect on formalization rate. In Bangladesh, a study
to deliver brochures with information to 1,500 informal ﬁrms ﬁnds that the information delivery had no eﬀect on
formalization rate (de Giorgi and Rahman, 2013). However, in a case study from Portugal, Branstetter et al. (2014)
ﬁnd that the introduction of a one-stop-shop, which decreased the number of days to register a business by 91
percent, led to an increase of the new ﬁrms created by 17 percent. Benhassine et al. (2016) study the eﬀect of the
introduction of the entreprenant legal status in Benin, as well as the combination of a free registration process with
supplementary eﬀorts to enhance the presumed beneﬁts of formalization (through links to government training
programs, support to open bank accounts, and tax mediation services). Overall impacts on formalization are limited,
but the full package leads to the largest impacts on formalization (16.3 percentage points). However, Benhassine
et al. (2016) show that formalization oﬀers limited beneﬁts to the ﬁrms, and the costs of personalized assistance
are high, suggesting that such enhanced formalization eﬀorts are unlikely to pass cost-beneﬁt tests.
The second strand of studies looks at the performance of ﬁrms once they formalize. Emerging evidence suggests
that formalization can contribute to higher performance, but that the eﬀects are relatively small (Benjamin et al.
2014). Among others, Fajnzylber, Maloney, and Montes-Rojas (2011), evaluate the impact of Brazil’s formalization
program, SIMPLES, and ﬁnd that formality increases the employment, the probability of having a ﬁxed location, and
revenues and proﬁts. However, Monteiro and Assunção (2012) using the same dataset as Fajnzylber, Maloney, and
Montes-Rojas (2011), though with a diﬀerent identiﬁcation strategy, ﬁnd that the program had limited impacts on
formalization.87 Moreover, in the case of Vietnam, Rand and Torm (2012) ﬁnd that ﬁrms that formalized in the period


87
     Recently, Piza (2016) revisited both previous papers and found that the diﬀerences in results are explained by the dates each study uses
     to identify when the program was put in place. In addition, a robustness check indicates that seasonality around November may, among
     other factors, cast some doubts on the identiﬁcation strategy used in both studies.

                                                                                                                                                97
of 2007-2009 registered an increase in their proﬁts and investments compared with similar ﬁrms that remained
informal. In the case of Bolivia, McKenzie and Sakho (2010) also ﬁnd that ﬁrms that become formal issue more tax
receipts and have increase in their sales. Campos, Goldstein and McKenzie (2015) document encouraging short-
term results on ﬁrm registration from a program in Malawi, although still with limited results on tax registration.
Support to business registration alone has no impact, but the combination of formalization assistance and bank
information session results in signiﬁcant impacts on having a business bank account, ﬁnancial practices, savings,
and use of complementary ﬁnancial products.

Governance of the household enterprise sector suffers from lack of clarity in institutional roles and
inter-ministerial coordination. To set up a more supportive enabling environment for household enterprises in
Côte d’Ivoire, one real challenge is a lack of clear roles or responsibilities with respect to the sector. Figure 4.19
illustrates the coordination challenges among different ministries and agencies. In general, each ministry does
have (de jure) speciﬁc mandates. However, when it comes to the informal sector, several ministries often have
similarly narrow but overlapping objectives, in this case formalizing the informal sector. There are parallel
efforts to create registries of individuals in the informal sector. For instance, the Ministry of Commerce plans
on having a national registry of traders (Carte du commerçant) in the informal sector, while the Ministry of
Handicraft and Promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises simultaneously intends to create a national registry
of mastercrafstmen (Carte de l’Artisan/Entrepreneur).
While government agencies are focused on building registries to better regulate or tax the sector,
there is relatively less attention to the provision of services needed to address constraints to produc-
tivity. When asked, many qualitative informants reveal that they are not aware of the adequate authorities who
could address their needs or concerns, or where they could acquire information or look for support opportunities
(Bouaki 2016). As such, one critical aspect of setting up a more supportive business environment would involve
stronger accountability in public service provision for the informal sector. This is especially important given that,
as mentioned before, formalization cannot be seen as an end of its own.

4.4.2 Outlining a strategy for more productive nonagricultural self-employment
The previous sections highlighted key challenges facing operators of household enterprises at entry
and in operation. These constraints relate to missing or imperfect markets for capital, work space or skills, and
as such provide scope for public intervention to better support operators in the household enterprise sector. As
noted in Benjamin et al. (2014), recommended policies to support the informal sector in general depend on both
the nature of the informal ﬁrms as well as the causes and effects of informality. Below are some policy entry
points that could help improve and enhance the operating environment for household enterprises in the country.
Strategies ought to address the systematic constraints to a more supportive business environment,
both at the institutional and individual levels. A three-step approach could be considered to create a more
supportive business environment for nonagricultural self-employment: (a) articulate a strategy ensuring voice
for household enterprise operators and accountability for public agencies dealing with the sector; (b) undertake
speciﬁc interventions to relax binding constraints for operators in the sector facing market failures; and (c) set
up a safety net for those that may not be able to grow or become more productive.
At a policy level, it is essential to articulate a strategy to ensure effective voice for household enterprise
operators, institutional coordination, and accountability for public agencies dealing with the sector.
At a strategic level, nonagricultural self-employment would need to be tackled explicitly in the overall national
employment strategy, including to outline approaches that go beyond attempts to formalize or regulate it. In
the process, providing household enterprise operators a mechanism to voice their ideas and concerns may be
beneﬁcial. The strategy would likely beneﬁt from a differential approach for urban and rural sectors, as well as
speciﬁc attention to inclusiveness of women and the poor. At an institutional level, more effective service deliv-
ery for operators in household enterprises would require addressing coordination failures, including to clarify
roles and responsibilities of various government agencies, both at the national and local level. Mechanisms to

                                                                                                                         98
minimize corrupt or extortive practices from some public agents would help to address concerns from opera-
tors and contribute to greater accountability. Speciﬁc measures could include clearer deﬁnitions of rights and
obligations, as well as the establishment of reporting channels for grievances.
At a programmatic level, speciﬁc interventions can be undertaken to relax binding constraints for
household operators in the sector facing market failures. Cho, Robalino, and Watson (2014) review evidence
on effectiveness and design elements of programs to address a range of constraints for self-employment. They
highlight mixed evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions. International evidence can be used to identify
the most promising interventions to address prevalent constraints in Côte d’Ivoire. In light of multiple constraints
for productivity in the sector, integrated interventions addressing multiple drivers of productivity appear more
promising than fragmented interventions. To minimize fragmentation of actions, interventions could be centered
directly to the hierarchy of constraints identiﬁed in this sector based on both qualitative and quantitative data.
Finding cost-effective instruments to facilitate access to capital is clearly a top priority as highlighted
by both qualitative and quantitative data. Some programs have been demonstrated as effective in relaxing
capital constraints and boost productivity among self-employed individuals. As Blattman, Fiala and Martinez
(2014) have shown in Uganda, the provision of cash grants to youths groups can be an effective instrument.
However, there might be concerns in scaling up such an approach, and alternative ﬁnancial instruments suitable
to reach the most vulnerable individuals would be useful. At the same time, existing international evidence on
the effectiveness microﬁnance interventions is much more mixed (see Banerjee, Karlan, and Zinman (2015) for
a summary of recent studies). This suggests that, although capital constraints are binding, ﬁnding the right
instrument to address them is not straightforward. The PRISE88 project currently tests a range of alternative
instruments in western Côte d’Ivoire (in particular, cash grants, semi-credit, and rotating savings groups). Results
from its impact evaluation will be very informative to identify the most cost-effective ﬁnancial instrument to
relax capital constraints for individuals in informal employment in Côte d’Ivoire.
Access to a suitable work location and markets is critical as well. At a minimum, this would mean ensuring
proper and safe space to work for household enterprise operators, who are often forced to relocate, disrupt-
ing their business. The expansion of markets and upgrading of their infrastructure can help, together with an
explicit consideration of the household enterprise sector, in urban planning and policies. For rural entrepreneurs,
the facilitation of access to market may also take the form of value chain facilitation, including better access
to equipment and inputs, as well as opportunities to sell products. Micro-franchising could also be considered.

With regard to skills, the direct scope for intervention might be more limited. It is not that clear that skills
are a binding constraint, and international evidence on interventions providing training alone has been quite mixed.
As will be further discussed in Chapter 6, a large number of youths obtain training through private informal appren-
ticeships that often take place in informal ﬁrms and provide a pathway for youths to in turn become self-employed.
Existing private training providers and master-craftsmen could be used as a platform and incentivized to improve
the quality of the training they provide. In addition, providing access to training on business skills and opportu-
nities to upgrade skills could also be considered. Training programs that build a range of skills together (rather
than focusing exclusively on selected technical skills) has shown some promise to raise productivity in the informal
sector, in particular for women when combining behavioral skills with business skills or technical skills training.
Complementing social protection interventions with livelihood support programs addressing multiple
constraints can promote productive inclusion among the poorest population. Safety nets programs typ-
ically target the poorest populations, including those engaged in low-productivity self-employment. The set-up
of safety nets can facilitate savings, encourage risk taking and more broadly stimulate demand. Care should
be taken in not excluding individuals from productive interventions on the basis of ad hoc criteria. Indeed,
studies have shown that the most constrained individuals can stand to gain a lot from productive interventions
addressing capital or skill constraints. This is particularly the case for multi-faceted graduation programs that
target the poor and provide a mix of cash transfers, productive asset transfer (typically cash or livestock) and
training, along with regular coaching visits and access to savings. An evaluation of the graduation approach
in six countries around the world showed large impacts on earnings, consumption, food security and assets
(Banerjee et al., 2015). Efforts to expand and scale-up such an approach are underway in a range of countries
and could also be considered in Côte d’Ivoire.
Lastly, given heterogeneity in the sector, a social protection and safety net system would still be
needed for those that may not be able to grow or become more productive. Given the high number
of individuals operating in self-employment, and the large variation in productivity in the sector, it is probable
that a share of individuals may not be able to seize opportunities and strongly increase their earnings. For these
individuals, a safety net is needed to ensure basic welfare levels and protection against extreme poverty.

4.4.3 Conclusion
There is a wide variety of informal nonagricultural self-employment activities in Côte d’Ivoire, and
many individuals choose to operate in the sector. From a legalistic standpoint, being informal means that
the establishment (operating unit) or the employee is not registered. As in many countries in the region, the
median owner of a nonagricultural microenterprise tends to be young females with no formal education. The
majority of nonagricultural individual enterprises are in small-scale service activities, but these enterprises persist
over time. In fact, in contrast to common perceptions, many individuals declare preferring self-employment over
other types of occupations. A range of pull factors, including earning potentials, attract individuals into the
sector. For rural households, nonagricultural activities represent a source of income diversiﬁcation to mitigate
harvest risks or seasonal variations, and often a pathway out of poverty. Still, as Chapter 3 has highlighted,
off-farm diversiﬁcation remains limited in rural Côte d’Ivoire and there might be scope to further encourage it.
Heterogeneity in the nonagricultural employment sector is also reﬂected by substantial variations of
productivity. Individuals face multiple constraints to create and operate their household enterprises. Start-up
capital remains the most binding constraint for individuals. The second binding constraint is the lack of safe working
environment and access to market. Other key constraints facing the operators are that they are often subject to
extortions by some government authorities, in particular municipal tax collectors, despite receiving limited services in
exchange of their tax payments. Finally, although large returns to education are not directly observed in the sector,
operators often ‘learn by doing’ through on-the-job experience. Limited business skills also affect productivity.
Institutionally, household enterprises are not fully featured in the national employment strategy. Most
government actions focus on SMEs and the formal sector. Existing actions regarding informal micro-enterprises
mostly center on attempts to ‘formalize’ them. Governance of the sector also suffers from lack of clarity in insti-
tutional roles and inter-ministerial coordination. There are initiatives by government agencies to build registries


                                                                                                                           100
to better regulate or tax the sector, but there is relatively less attention to the provision of services needed to
address constraints to productivity.
Strategies ought to address systematic constraints to a more supportive business environment, both
at the institutional and individual levels. To do so, a three-step approach is suggested: (a) articulate a strat-
egy ensuring voice for household enterprise operators and accountability for public agencies dealing with the
sector; (b) undertake speciﬁc interventions to relax binding constraints for household operators in the sector
facing missing markets, and (c) set up a safety net for those that may not be able to grow or become more
productive. If better-integrated in the national employment strategy, the sector can offer a pathway out of
poverty for many individuals, in particular youth and women. As such, it is directly relevant to offer better and
more inclusive employment in Côte d’Ivoire.

BOX C.1: METHODOLOGY FOR ANALYSIS OF HOUSEHOLD ENTERPRISE PRODUCTIVITY
This chapter analyzes the determinants of household enterprise productivity based on cross-sectional data from
the 2013 national employment survey (ENSETE 2013). We attempt to account for possible sample selection eﬀects,
and use a two-step Heckmann selection model.
Formally we estimate (Hill et al. 2008),
                              zi* = γ +γ wi+ui,                       i = , … , N.                              ()
The selection equation is expressed in terms of a latent variable zi* (corresponding here to the productivity
level) that depends on the explanatory variables wi. zi* is not observed, but we do observe the binary variable
zi = if zi* > and zi = , if zi* ≤ .
We start by estimating a probit model of selection into nonagricultural self-employment, and use the results to
estimate the inverse Mills Ratio (IMR), which is equal to      ϕ(γ +γ wi )
                                                          λi = Φ(γ +γ w )
                                                                           i




                                                                                                                                               103
                                                                  ϕ(γ̃ +γ̃ wi )
Once zi is known, we then run an OLS with the estimated IMR, λi = Φ(γ̃ +γ̃ w ) , included to correct for selection
                                                                            i
bias, yielding the estimation equation

                                   yi = β +β xi+βλ λi+vi,                     i = , … ,N .                  ( )
with the dependent variable yi (here the log of productivity), and xi a vector including individual, household enter-
prise, and geographical characteristics.
In the ﬁrst stage (equation (1)) the covariates include individual characteristics of the household head (age, gender,
and education), regional dummies, and number of children in the household. Following Nagler and Naude (2014),
we make the assumption that number of children in a household contributes to household selection into nonag-
ricultural self-employment in the ﬁrst stage, but does not aﬀect productivity in the second stage. In the second
stage (equation (2)), individual characteristics of the owner and regional dummies (same in the selection stage)
along with household enterprises characteristics (type of activities, point of operations, and so on) are included.
Ultimately, while the analysis should be interpreted carefully and not as providing causal estimates, it is useful in
analyzing covariates of productivity in household enterprises based on the available cross-sectional data.

5 TRENDS AND PROSPECTS FOR
5:
FORMAL JOB CREATION IN
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Sarah Hebous and Trang Thu Tran

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Given the higher-quality of jobs in the modern formal sector, expanding the size of the formal sector
is key to more and better jobs. As indicated in the analysis in Chapter 1, Côte d’Ivoire’s main employment
challenge stems from the concentration of employment in informal and low-productivity occupations. An analy-
sis of the employment proﬁle illustrates a very low share of wage employment among the employed population.
In particular, less than 4 percent of the employed population holds formal private wage jobs. In this context, it
is essential to better understand the dynamics of employment in formal enterprises, and the constraints to the
creation of formal jobs. This is also particularly relevant as the formal sector constitutes a large share of aggre-
gate value added in the economy.
Côte d’Ivoire’s economy is characterized by a relatively developed and diversiﬁed industrial sector
for Sub-Saharan Africa, but competitiveness and the overall investment climate eroded during the
decade long civil strife.89 While the country has been in a long-term economic decline since the 1990s, the
conﬂict years between 2002 and 2004 left the country divided, with severe consequences for the economy,
human capital, governance, and social cohesion. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth further declined from
−0.5 percent in 1990–2000 to −1.2 percent in 2000–2010 (World Bank 2015a). Amid the difﬁcult business
environment since 2000, businesses were less likely to form and survive. In particular, a signiﬁcant share of
foreign ﬁrms left the country during this period (Klapper et al. 2013).
As the country is recovering from conﬂict and eying emergence, Côte d’Ivoire could capitalize on the
peace dividends and focus on addressing other constraints limiting competitiveness and growth of
the private sector. Using data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) and the World Economic Forum
(WEF) Executive Opinion Survey, government and political stability were consistently ranked as one of the most
important obstacle to doing business in 2009 (Figure 5.1a). However, the formation of a new Government
in May 2011 has led to important progress in the security situation throughout the country. Côte d’Ivoire
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating rose sharply from 2.7 in 2011 to 3.3 in 2014 — the
fastest increase in the entire region and one of the fastest historically for any country (World Bank 2015a). This
improvement is reﬂected in the most recent WEF ranking where businesses no longer consider instability to be
a major constraint (Figure 5.1b).
Being a member of a currency union has contributed to stable macroeconomic conditions and low
inﬂation. It also, however, renders exchange rate devaluation infeasible as a trade tool — a disadvantage for a
commodity-driven economy (World Bank 2010). Côte d’Ivoire will need to rely on other policy tools including
those affecting the overall business environment and other vertical policies at the ﬁrm or sector level. Both the
WBES and WEF data suggest access to ﬁnance and infrastructure as among the most important constraints to

ﬁrms. Beyond this general pattern, there are signiﬁcant differences across ﬁrms, with large and small ﬁrms being
more ﬁnancially constrained. Using Centrale de Bilans data from 2010 and additional qualitative evidence, a
study on the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector (World Bank 2015a) further suggests that the main
constraints to manufacturing are (a) transport infrastructure and logistics, (b) access to land, (c) electricity, (d)
high labor cost, and mixed quality and low levels of workers’ skills.
This chapter reviews past trends and assesses the prospects for formal job creation using the Centrale
de Bilans (CdB), a ﬁrm-level dataset comprising registered enterprises from all sectors in Côte d’Ivoire
from 2003 to 2012. Speciﬁcally, we expand on the previous analyses by studying ﬁrms in manufacturing and
beyond over a 10-year period from 2003 to 2012. This long panel allow us to follow ﬁrms during conﬂict epi-
sodes in 2003–2006, their recovery after the Ouagadougou Peace Accord in 2007, the 2010–2011 post-electoral
crisis and formation of a new government in 2011. The dataset contains information on ﬁrm ownership, loca-
tion, employment by skill level, ﬁnancial statements, and import-export of inputs and sales. Where appropriate,
we also supplement the CdB data with cross-country data from the WBES.

The chapter proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the formal sector. Section 3 describes
job creation and ﬁrm dynamics to study who creates jobs and whether the pattern of job reallocation indicates
a ﬂexible labor market or rather excessive job destruction and churning. To identify the main constraints to job
creation, section 4 examines the determinants of ﬁrm survival and exit and section 5 reports labor productivity
and growth in continuing ﬁrms. Section 6 continues to study wages, job quality, and labor cost. Section 7 pro-
vides a discussion and conclusion. Additional results and robustness checks are presented in Annex D.


5.2 AN OVERVIEW OF THE FORMAL SECTOR

5.2.1 Trends in formal jobs and firms
The main analysis in this chapter is based on anonymized ﬁrm-level data from the Registrar of
Companies for the modern enterprise sectors, collected by the National Statistics Institute (INS). The
Registrar of Companies collects information upon incorporation including physical location, sector classiﬁcation
and shareholdings for all shareholders. All registered operating ﬁrms are then legally required to submit annual
ﬁlings to the INS, the tax administration (Direction Générale des Impôts, DGI), the court of justice, and the
Central Bank (Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest, BCEAO) with detailed ﬁnancial and employment
information, which are reported under the West Africa accounting system standards, Système Comptable Ouest
Africain (SYSCOA).90 Firms hand in hard copies of their forms between March and June following the closing
of the ﬁscal year in December, after which the data are processed by INS.91
The resulting panel dataset, Centrale des Bilans (CdB), covers the years 2003–2012. It spans part of the
conﬂict episodes in 2003–2006, recovery after the Ouagadougou peace accord of 2007, the post-electoral crisis
in 2010/2011 and establishment of a new government in 2011. It includes unique ﬁrm identiﬁcation which
allows us to track ﬁrms over time. The dataset covers the universe of registered ﬁrms in all sectors — agriculture,
mining, manufacturing, construction, and services. A major advantage of this dataset is that it does not have
a cut-off point in terms of size either by revenue or employment, including one-person ﬁrms (ﬁrms without
employees). While smaller ﬁrms — those below certain revenue thresholds — are subject to different tax regimes,
they are required to submit ﬁnancial and employment information in a simpliﬁed format. As a result, the data
allow us to have a full picture of the formal economy.


BOX 5.1: TAX REGIMES AND REPORTING REGIMES IN THE CENTRALE DES BILANS
There are four tax regimes in Côte d’Ivoire: Réel Normal and Réel Simpliﬁé (real systems) as well as Synthetique
and Forfait (ﬂat rate systems), corresponding to decreasing revenue thresholds. In general, ﬁrms obliged to the
real system submit the full questionnaire under the ‘normal’ accounting system, Systeme Comptable Normal. Other
ﬁrms submit a shorter version under the simpliﬁed accounting system, System Comptable Allégé. Nevertheless,
there are a number of cases of mismatches between the tax regime and reporting system in the data.
For details on these tax regimes, see http://cote divoire.eregulations.org/menu/10?l=fr


Positive trends in the aggregate number of ﬁrms and jobs appear consistent with increasing economic
activities after the peace accord in 2007 (Figures 5.2 and 5.3). There is a signiﬁcant and sustained increase
in both the number of ﬁrms and formal jobs since 2008. Within 10 years, the number of formal ﬁrms has more
than tripled from 3,458 in 2003 to 13,387 in 2012. Similarly, aggregate formal employment in 2012, at about
300,000, is more than 50 percent higher than during the 2003–2007 period. Increases in formal employment

     Before 2011, ﬁrms were required to submit this information to the INS and the Tax Administration separately. Since 2011, the data are
     collected through the ‘Guichet Unique de dépôt des états ﬁnanciers (GUDEF) and shared between INS and DGI. Given the sensitive nature
     of tax information, one might be concerned about ﬁrms’ misreporting to INS after 2010 for tax reasons. However, a preliminary analysis
     on distribution of ﬁrms’ reported revenues suggest that it is not the case. See Annex D for more details.

     Côte d’Ivoire is planning to introduce an electronic submission platform which is expected to shorten processing time and which would
     also reduce the likelihood of data entry errors.

are particularly noticeable in services. These trends are consistent with increasing investments in the economy
by the private sector, amid rising conﬁdence in the country’s prospects and stability. Private investments were
found to be the main contributor to real GDP growth of 3.6 percent and TFP growth of 0.4 percent in the
2011–2013 period (World Bank 2015a).
Increases in the number of ﬁrms appear to be driven by the entry of smaller ﬁrms, as seen in the
declining shares of normal ﬁrms and foreign ﬁrms. However, measured by the share of ﬁrms, the structure
of the formal sector has not changed signiﬁcantly. There is a slight decrease in the share of ﬁrms in primary
sectors, picked up by manufacturing ﬁrms.
Notably, economic activities are returning to regions outside Abidjan after 2010. Abidjan has always
been the most important industrial center for Côte d’Ivoire but there had been other growth poles in the past,
whose importance declined signiﬁcantly during the 2002–2004 conﬂict. However, despite the number of ﬁrms
in Abidjan increasing steadily since 2007, its relative share in the country-wide ﬁrms has decreased from around
90 percent in 2003 to around 80 percent in 2012. In Bouaké, there is a substantial increase in registered ﬁrms
making the share eight times its 2003 level. In San-Pédro, the share of ﬁrms in 2012 is slightly higher than in 2003.
Another visible trend is a rapid return of foreign investment in 2011 and 2012. Following the conﬂict years,
the share of foreign-owned ﬁrms, that is ﬁrms that report a foreign capital share larger than 50 percent, abruptly
decreased from almost half of all formal ﬁrms in 2003 to under 5 percent in 2004. In 2011, this share rebounded
to almost 20 percent with the total number of foreign-owned ﬁrms being even higher than in 2003 (2,449 and
1,421 ﬁrms, respectively). In 2003, the biggest share of foreign-owned ﬁrms was French, followed by Russian, and
Lebanese ﬁrms, with shares of 48 percent, 10 percent, and 9 percent, respectively. In 2012, the picture changed
considerably. While French ﬁrms are still the largest share of foreign-owned ﬁrms, their share is merely 25 percent.
At the same time, there are almost as many Lebanese ﬁrms (23 percent). Other African countries account for 8
percent of foreign-owned ﬁrms. Interestingly, the increase in Lebanese ownership seems consistent with anecdotal
evidence suggesting that Lebanese investors were taking over businesses left by French interest after the conﬂict.92
An important caveat to note is that part of the trends might also reﬂect better data coverage over time.
In particular, the spike in 2010 in the number of ﬁrms also coincides with the new data depository, GUDEF,
introduced to improve data consistency. Nevertheless, while there is no direct information on the extent of
data coverage over time, analysis using ‘Normal’ ﬁrms only — that is, larger ﬁrms that are more visible and face
higher cost on non-reporting — reveal that the trends are similar for this group of ﬁrms. Similarly, the increase in
foreign ﬁrms in 2011–2012 cannot be a data-driven result as they are the most likely to comply with reporting
requirements. This result suggests it is unlikely that the patterns presented above are driven by data reporting alone.

5.2.2 Characteristics of formal firms
Formal ﬁrms in Côte d’Ivoire are highly heterogeneous. The distribution of ﬁrms, both in employment and
output are skewed (see Table D.4 in the Annex D). The average size in terms of employment (37 employees) is
many times over the median size (5 employees) and even the 75th percentiles (13 employees). Similar high vari-
ance can be seen in sales or other ﬁrm characteristics. Of those reporting, very few are exporters (7.5 percent)
or importers (13.9 percent). Not all ﬁrms reported purchasing any raw materials or intermediate inputs in a given
year. Less than 75 percent reported having invested in their physical capital stock and even fewer ﬁrms had any
investments in intangible capital (investments in R&D, licensing, and so on).
Firms are larger in the manufacturing sector compared to the services sector, driven by the presence
of larger ﬁrms on the top of the distribution. There are many small ﬁrms in both sectors — the median
employment size is only 4 and 5 in services and manufacturing. However, the large manufacturing ﬁrms are
much larger than large services ﬁrms. The 75th and 95th percentile in manufacturing is more than two and
four times larger than in services. As a result, the average manufacturing ﬁrm employs more than 63 workers,
almost three times more than the average of 23 workers in services.
At a more aggregate level, sectors are also highly heterogeneous, with employment and output
dominated by agribusiness activities (Figure 5.5). More than half of total formal employment is concen-
trated in only four sectors (ISIC 01, 15, 74, 52). Among them, food manufacturing (ISIC 15) stands out as the
most important contributor to value added and the second biggest contributor to employment. Even without
counting related services, agribusiness activities including agriculture (ISIC 01) and food manufacturing (ISIC 15)
alone account for more than 30 percent of total employment and more than 20 percent of total value added

in formal ﬁrms. In contrast, the Oil and Gas sector (ISIC 11) for example, while accounting for more than 10
percent of aggregate output, employs only a negligible share of workers. Given this outsized role of agribusiness
for employment, policies emphasizing job creation will continue to have to pay special attention to the sector.

5.2.3. Patterns of firm entry and exit
Entry rates have been increasing after 2007 with the exception of a setback in 2010 and 2011. In
2012, the entry rate reaches its highest level at 25 percent, coinciding with the recovery after the 2010–2011
post-electoral crisis. We deﬁne ﬁrm exits as permanent exits from the dataset, hence the exit rates reported here
are potentially higher than the true exit rates. Nevertheless, the trend over time reveals generally declining exit
rates, with the exception of 2009.93

The business demographics displayed in Figure 5.5 illustrate a very dynamic entry-exit pattern com-
pared to other countries with available data. Cross-country results for both developed and developing
countries from Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta (2009), Hallward-Driemeier and Rjikers (2013), and
Shiferaw (2009) show that virtually all countries have higher entry rates than exit rates.94 With the exception of
Hungary, the differences between entry and exit rates are small, not exceeding 5 percentage points. Exit rates
for most countries are below 10 percent. Latvia is the only country that exhibits an entry-exit pattern similar
to Côte d’Ivoire. Nevertheless, Latvia’s entry and exit rates of 12 percent and 16 percent stay visibly below the
Ivorian averages (2003–2012) of 15 percent and 23 percent, respectively. The volatile business environment in
Côte d’Ivoire is possibly driven by the conﬂict episodes and businesses transforming from and to the formal sector.
The increase in entry rate and decline in the size at entry suggest lower barriers to formalization and
entry, driven possibly by both a more stable political and economic environment.
The size of entering ﬁrms in all sectors has declined over time. The median size at entry has fallen from
four employees in 2003 to only two after 2007. Even if one ignores the conﬂict period between 2003 and 2006,
the average size of entering ﬁrms has been declining steadily since 2007. While not shown here, this pattern
holds true overall, as well as for both manufacturing and services ﬁrms. Interestingly, size at entry in the CdB is
fairly consistent with data from the WBES 2009 (Figures 5.8 and 5.9). Compared to peer countries within and
outside the region, Ivorian ﬁrms enter at a smaller size, indicating possible lower barriers to entry in Côte d’Ivoire.

5.3 JOB CREATION AND FIRM DYNAMICS

BOX 5.2: EMPLOYMENT AND FIRM SIZE DEFINITION
In this chapter, we only report internal employees (Personnel propre), both full-time (permanents) and part-time
(saisonniers), but exclude external employees (Personnel extérieur) from all of our deﬁnitions involved employment.
In the Organisation pour l’Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Aﬀaires (OHADA) accounting system, external
employees include the services of salaried employees loaned temporarily from another company. Internal employees
include those on a company’s own payroll (Masse salariale).95
During the 2003–2012 period, in aggregate, 75–88 percent (internal) employment in the formal sector is reported
as full-time. At the ﬁrm level, about 11 percent of ﬁrms have part-time employees in the whole sample period,
where for those that employed part-time workers, their share in total employment is 39 percent.
To facilitate international comparison, ﬁrm size categories in this chapter are deﬁned by employment, where ﬁrms

     This is the case even as exit is also deﬁned as exit from data.

are deﬁned as Micro, Small, Medium, and Large if their total number of (non-temporary) workers are in between
[0–4], [5–19], [20–99], [100+], respectively. These are the same deﬁnitions employed by the WBES and have been
typically used in studies with cross-country benchmarking.
These deﬁnitions depart from those adopted by the Government of Côte d’Ivoire, where a combination of number of
employees and revenue is used. Firms are deﬁned as micro if their total number of (non-temporary) workers does not
exceed 10 and annual revenue does not exceed CFAF 30 million. A small or medium ﬁrm (Petite et Moyenne Entreprise,
PME) has less than 100 employees and its revenue does not exceed CFCF 1 billion. Where appropriate, this chapter aims
to look at ﬁrm outcomes along the full distribution of employment rather than by only three categories as described above.

5.3.1. Distribution of private formal employment
Most formal jobs are concentrated in large and old ﬁrms, as well as ﬁrms in Abidjan. Firms with over 100
employees provide almost 70 percent of jobs. This is consistent with more recent ﬁndings from the Employment
Survey collected in February 2014 (ENSETE 2013) which suggest that medium and large ﬁrms account for more than
75 percent of formal employment (see Chapter 1). The share of jobs generated by ﬁrms older than 10 years is similarly
high. Less than 10 percent of formal jobs are outside Abidjan. The majority of jobs are in lower-skilled occupations.
The services sector generates most formal jobs. Nevertheless, agribusiness and manufacturing still con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to total private formal employment. While the share of ﬁrms in the agribusiness sector was

only 4 percent in 2012 it generated 18 percent of jobs. This is consistent with the Growth and Competitiveness
Report for the manufacturing sector that found using 2010 census data that the agribusiness sector is highly
important both with regard to value added and employment (World Bank, 2015b).
Given the increase in entry, small and young ﬁrms are becoming more important for employment. In the
conﬂict period (2003–2006), small ﬁrms and young ﬁrms had employment shares of 10 percent and 12 percent,
respectively. In 2011–2012, employment shares for both types of ﬁrms increased to more than 15 percent.
Structurally, there have not been big changes in the sectoral and regional composition of formal
employment however. Manufacturing becomes slightly less important but still accounts for more than 30
percent of jobs. Despite the increase in number of ﬁrms in other regions, the share of jobs in regions outside
Abidjan is still very little.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in the share of employment in higher-skilled occupations, indi-
cating that there are still challenges concerning the quality of the jobs in Côte d’Ivoire’s formal sector.
Over the sample period, the number of jobs in technical and management positions remain at around 35 percent
of total employment.
The most striking change has been a continuous shift of the employment distribution to the left
(Figure 5.12). In all years, from 60 percent to almost 90 percent of ﬁrms are small ﬁrms but the size distribution
has become increasingly skewed. This is consistent with the annual increase in entry of small ﬁrms observed above.
Nevertheless, Côte d’Ivoire is not an outlier in its shares of small ﬁrms (Figure 5.13 and 5.17). Even
compared to developed and transitioning economies, results from Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta
(2009) suggest that the share of micro and small ﬁrms exceeds 80 percent in all countries with available data.
Contribution of these ﬁrms to employment in Côte d’Ivoire is very low however, which perhaps indicates a higher
concentration of micro ﬁrms. Employment generated by formal micro and small ﬁrms in Côte d’Ivoire is about
11 percent compared to 20 percent is the United States and the United Kingdom, and 50 percent in Sweden.

5.3.2. Which firms create formal jobs?
Net formal job creation has been mostly positive since 2006 but in aggregate few new jobs have been
created in the formal sector (Figure 5.13). As the large increase in number of ﬁrms after 2007 is due to entry
of smaller ﬁrms, aggregate net job creation has been limited. High-skill occupations exhibit less volatility than
overall net job creation. There is a steady level of net job creation among more skilled positions throughout all
years even in years with large swings in low-skill jobs.

Job creation for low-skilled occupations appear more sensitive to overall economic and political
conditions. In the peak years of net job creation, 2008 and 2012, net job creation reaches three times its
average level. These spikes are driven by creation of lower-skilled jobs. In the same years, high-skilled jobs only
made up a quarter of overall job creation, only slightly exceeding its usual level. The temporary nature of demand
changes as well as labor supply constraints might explain the different trends in high- and low-skilled net job
creation. The trends suggest more limited potential for higher-skilled job creation but also potential higher
employment stability for more skilled workers.
The majority of jobs are created in services with relatively higher share of skilled employment. The
agribusiness sector has a substantial contribution to job creation despite its low share of ﬁrms. However, jobs
created in the agribusiness sector tend to be unskilled.
Job creation continues to be concentrated in Abidjan. There are virtually no jobs created in manufacturing
other than agribusiness outside Abidjan. The primary sector is the only sector where a considerable share of jobs
is created outside Abidjan. Most jobs created in Bouaké are in the agribusiness sector. San Pédro contributes to
net job creation in the primary sector and in trade.
In Côte d’Ivoire, young ﬁrms and large ﬁrms create the vast majority of net jobs. There is conﬂicting
cross-country evidence on the relative importance of small ﬁrms and young ﬁrms for job creation. In the United
States, it has been shown that new ﬁrms are the most important source of job creation. However, evidence from

Note: Data from Lebanon and Tunisia are from Schiffbauer et al. (2015). In all three graphs, size is the base year size (ﬁrm size in year t − 1 for incumbents
and ﬁrms that exit in year t, while for entrants it is size in year t).


developing countries points to small and older ﬁrms as the greatest contributors to net job creation; see Li and
Rama (2015) for an overview of ﬁrm dynamics and job creation in developing countries.
Young Ivorian ﬁrms across all size groups exhibit a positive net job creation. Firms that are young and
small create the highest number of net jobs. While this is also the case in countries such as Lebanon and Tunisia,
unlike in Côte d’Ivoire the net job creation of young and small ﬁrms by far exceeds the net job creation of other
size-age groups. The contribution of young ﬁrms in Côte d’Ivoire, while less signiﬁcant, also occur beyond entry
for ﬁrms in the 5–9 age group.
The simultaneous importance of entry by new ﬁrms and expansion among large and incumbent ﬁrms
for net job creation implies more economic dynamism compared to other developing countries. Firms with
200–999 employees in particular show a high net job creation. This pattern cannot be observed in countries like
Lebanon and Tunisia where only the smallest among the incumbent ﬁrms contribute signiﬁcantly to net job creation.

5.3.3 Formal employment growth over the life cycle
In Côte d’Ivoire, ﬁrms appear to grow over time. The results above can be completed by an analysis of employ-
ment growth from a different angle, namely the ﬁrm’s life cycle, to ﬁnd descriptive evidence for whether job creation

Note: Data for the United States, Mexico, and India are from Hsieh and Klenow (2014). Data for Peru are from Aterido and Iacovone (2015). Employment
in the youngest group (age <5 years) is normalized to 1 in each country. The ﬁgure gives unweighted average employment per operating plant/ﬁrm versus
plant/ﬁrm age in the cross-section. For Côte d’Ivoire, we use the cross-section in 2012 and also include the median employment at each age bin. The pattern
for Côte d’Ivoire is very similar whether we use data in 2012, pool over 2003–2012 or other sub-periods, or when we account for industry (value added)
weights at the 3-digit, 2-digit or section level.

slower over time due to poor marketing functioning that constrains ﬁrms to invest and expand. In India, Peru, and
Mexico, this holds true as evidenced by comparing average employment at different age bins with the U.S. man-
ufacturing sector (Figure 5.18). Yet we observe a much healthier size-age pattern for Ivorian ﬁrms (Figure 5.18). In
fact, the average growth rate over the ﬁrm’s life cycle is higher than all other countries with available data.
Employment growth is concentrated in a subset of ﬁrms however. The median size at most age bins is smaller
than the average size, suggesting that there is a section of ‘better ﬁrms’ that drives most of the employment-age
relationship. The breakdown of ﬁrms by employment growth percentile lends further support to the above observed
paradox that while the fastest-growing ﬁrms are young, not all young ﬁrms grow. As shown in Table 5.1, average
employment size, median sales size, and share of small ﬁrms are similar for ﬁrms exhibiting employment growth above
the 90th percentile and below the 50th percentile. Both high- and low-growth ﬁrms tend to be young; average and
median age as well as share of young ﬁrms is comparable for low-growth ﬁrms and ﬁrms above the 75th percentile.
High-growth ﬁrms are, however, signiﬁcantly smaller and younger than ﬁrms between the 50th and 75th percentile.
This pattern is true in both manufacturing and services, and in different periods during the whole sample period.

5.3.4. The role of firm entry and exit in formal job creation
Net changes in employment hide a considerable amount of job creation and destruction. Cross-country
evidence (such as Bartelsman, Haltiwanger, and Scarpetta 2009) has found a high degree of employment turbulence
in both developed and developing countries, indicated by simultaneously large gross job creation and destruction.
To understand the role of business entry and exit in job creation, we decompose aggregate employment growth
into job creation (by new and expanding ﬁrms) and job destruction (by contracting and existing ﬁrms).96
Côte d’Ivoire exhibits a very high level of job churning driven by ﬁrm entry and exit, even compared
to other low-income countries. In 2007–2010 the total job creation and destruction rates in Côte d’Ivoire
were around 25 percent and 20 percent of total employment, respectively. For the United States (1980–2009)
these ﬁgures are around 15 percent. Li and Rama (2015) provide an overview of job creation and job destruc-
tion rates for developing countries. All countries with available data exhibit gross job creation and destructions
below 18 percent, much lower than Côte d’Ivoire. For example, Ethiopia’s (1997–2007) gross job creation and
destruction rates are about 17 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
Since 2007, entry has become much more important for job creation. During the conﬂict period overall
job creation was around 17 percent with only about one-third of new jobs being created by entering ﬁrms. This
share has increased to 50 percent of overall job creation in 2011–2012. At the same time, the relative importance

of exiting ﬁrms for job destruction has not changed. About half of the job destruction is caused by ﬁrms exiting.
This pattern is consistent with the observed increase in the number of ﬁrms and the relatively stable exit rate.
Overall, the above evidence suggests that the most important constraints to job creation in Côte d’Ivoire
appear to be the low survival rate of ﬁrms and the high volatility of the business environment. The ﬁndings
indicate a business environment with ﬁrms constantly entering and exiting. Rather than reﬂecting efﬁcient realloca-
tion, it probably reﬂects difﬁculties of ﬁrms to survive. This seems to be especially the case for small ﬁrms after 2007.


5.4. FIRM SURVIVAL
Given the above evidence on the important role of ﬁrm survival, this section aims to understand the
determinants of ﬁrm survival/exit by analyzing the link between exits and ﬁrm-level productivity
and the degree of sector-level competition. The key hypothesis is that in a well-functioning market, there
should be a positive selection of more productive ﬁrms to survive (less likely to exit) and this effect is stronger in
more competitive markets. Box 5.3 outlines the methodology, and table B5.3.2 reports the estimation results.
As expected, we see evidence of a weak but positive market selection effect such that more produc-
tive ﬁrms are less likely to exit. In most speciﬁcations, the coefﬁcient estimates on labor productivity are
negative and signiﬁcant. In the baseline speciﬁcation, the result indicates an average marginal effect of log labor
productivity on exit probability of −0.0175. This implies that a one standard deviation improvement in log labor
productivity reduces the chances of exit by 1.8 percentage points.97 While positive, this is a very small effect
considering the average exit rate of about 24 percent in the sample period.
Relative to 2003–2006, there is a weaker productivity selection in the 2007–2010 period. The results
in column (2) suggest that the magnitude of the impact of labor productivity has reduced by about 50 percent
in 2007–2010. This is the same period where the economy started to recover and we see a marked increase in
the entry of smaller ﬁrms. The expansion in economic activities in this period does not favor a more efﬁcient
reallocation of resources toward more productive ﬁrms. Unfortunately, we do not have data beyond 2012 to
analyze whether market efﬁciency has improved during the most recent economic recovery.
Competition with foreign ﬁrms appears to be a key channel of market selection by productivity.
Results in columns (3) and (5) show that in sectors with high entry rate of foreign ﬁrms, productive ﬁrms are
more likely to survive. Notably, when the interaction between foreign entry and labor productivity is included,
productivity alone has a much smaller and insigniﬁcant effect on exit rates. This result indicates that unpro-
ductive incumbents are much more likely to survive in sectors with less foreign competition. In the absence of
new foreign entry, there is no evidence of positive productivity selection. Interestingly, sectoral competition as
measured by the output Herﬁndahl-Hirschman index (HHI) does not seem to make a difference to ﬁrm exit rates,
as shown in columns (4) and (6). This result is consistent with the argument that foreign competition might be
much more important than domestic competition for market selection.
Evidence of increased failure rates in sectors with high foreign entry rate and a survival premium for
older and bigger ﬁrms suggest the need to support young domestic ﬁrm’s capacity to compete. While
foreign competition appears to reinforce the positive market selection effect, it is worrying that increases in
foreign presence in a sector also reduces the average probability of ﬁrm survival, even after taking into account
productivity. The estimates in column (3), for example, imply that a one standard deviation increase in foreign
entry rate increases ﬁrm exit rates by 2.6 percentage points. Further, results from all speciﬁcations show that
regardless of productivity, older and bigger ﬁrms are more likely to survive. Firms in the largest cities (Abidjan,
Bouaké, San Pédro) are also more likely to survive. Interestingly, ﬁrms in Bouaké tend to have signiﬁcantly higher
survival rates, suggesting potentially higher market opportunities there.

     This is calculated by evaluating the diﬀerence in exit probability when log labor productivity is one standard deviation away from its mean
     and all other controls are at their means, and when all controls are at their means.

BOX 5.3: EXIT PROBABILITIES REGRESSIONS
Based on ﬁrm dynamics models as in Olley and Pakes (1996), ﬁrms exit when the net present discounted value of
proﬁts, accounting for ﬁxed costs, is negative. Since productivity and market structure are the key determinants
of proﬁts in such models, the ﬁrm’s exit hazard in each time period can be written as:
                                           Pr(Eist = ) = Pr(δTFPist- +βXit- + γZst- ≤ cfit- )
Assuming that ﬁxed cost is a random error term following a logistic distribution, the empirical speciﬁcation can be
estimated using a complementary log-log model.98 For simplicity, we control for labor productivity (value added per
worker) instead of TFP and control for the ﬁrm’s capital intensity to account for the possibility that ﬁrms having high
labor productivity is due to high capital intensity rather than TFP.99 The key hypothesis is that in a well-functioning
market, there should be a positive selection of more productive ﬁrms to survive (less likely to exit).
We include a range of interactions with productivity to understand how diﬀerent factors aﬀect the market selection
eﬀect, including (a) whether a ﬁrm is foreign owned, (b) time period dummies to proxy for the conﬂict periods,
and (c) competition intensity as measured by the entry rate of foreign ﬁrms and an output HHI index at the 2-digit
sector level. We also include other ﬁrm characteristics such as size, age, region and industry and year ﬁxed eﬀects
(FE) to account for unobserved policy and other changes in market fundamentals at the industry level and over
time that could aﬀect ﬁrm exits.

     This speciﬁcation is also equivalent to a discrete time hazard model (Cameron and Trivedi 2005).

     The results are similar using a Solow TFP index calculated with constant returns to scale and 2-digit industry’s median labor shares. Since
     our measure of output captures revenue rather than physical output, a high level of labor productivity or TFP could imply either high pro-
     ductivity or market demand and we will not be able to distinguish between the two.

5.5 LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH IN CONTINUING FIRMS
For surviving ﬁrms, employment growth signiﬁcantly decreases with size. We have seen earlier that job
creation is highest among young and small ﬁrms. This section puts more structure into the descriptive analysis in
section 5.3 by regressing ﬁrm-level employment growth — in continuing ﬁrms — on ﬁrm characteristics, produc-
tivity, and other sector-level controls in both OLS and FE regressions (see Table in Annex D for the speciﬁcations
and associated results). While not reported here, the OLS results in column (3) show that once size and other
ﬁrm characteristics are controlled for, the age effect is only signiﬁcant for ﬁrms older than 25 years. This result
is consistent with the ﬁnding that only a small portion of young ﬁrms are able to grow, which on average might
result in similar growth rates among different age groups. It suggests that much of the positive growth-age
relationship seems to be driven by size: along the size distribution, smaller ﬁrms appear to growth faster.



                                                                                                                                                              122
Beyond size and age, ﬁrm-level productivity has a positive effect on post-entry growth. This relation-
ship between employment growth and productivity is another useful indicator for market allocative efﬁciency
as in a competitive market, productive ﬁrms should be able to grow while unproductive ﬁrms contract and exit
(see for example, the discussion in Syverson 2011). The OLS estimates on labor productivity show a positive but
weak within-sector correlation where a doubling of labor productivity is associated with an average of only 4–5
percent increase in employment growth. The FE coefﬁcient estimates are higher. While the magnitude of the
effect is still small, it suggests that when ﬁrms improve productivity, they manage to increase the labor force
at the same time instead of shedding labor. However, as mentioned above, our productivity measures revenue
productivity hence increases in productivity will partially capture increases in ﬁrm’s demand. Therefore, our results
could also be interpreted as ﬁrms facing higher demand are more likely to grow.
Employment growth also increases with the sectoral growth in labor productivity. The results in column
(6) shows that conditional on own productivity, ﬁrms are able to grow faster when labor productivity in the
sector as a whole is growing. One interpretation is that there is a positive reallocation of employment from
less-productive to more-productive sectors. To the extent that sector labor productivity is a signal of aggregate
sectoral demand growth, this result further suggests that demand growth is important for job creation.
Capital-intensive ﬁrms tend to grow faster. Estimates in the FE speciﬁcations suggest that a 10 percent
increase in capital intensity is associated with around 9–13 percent increase in employment growth rate. While
capital intensity alone is a poor proxy for ﬁnancial constraint, the fact that more capital-intensive ﬁrms, that
is less labor-intensive ﬁrms, are able to grow faster conditional on ﬁrm ﬁxed effects and other characteristics
suggest the potential role of access to ﬁnance as a constraint for job creation.
There are no clear differences between manufacturing and services ﬁrms. One might expect that for
tradable sectors, employment is more likely to increase with productivity growth due to potential for demand
expansion. Yet, we see a slightly smaller (but not statistically signiﬁcant) coefﬁcient estimate for manufacturing
ﬁrms compared to services. This result indicates that the manufacturing sector might be performing below its
potential for output growth and job creation. Interestingly, there is a positive correlation between employment
growth and the share of French-speaking West African employees in most speciﬁcations. This relationship seems
driven solely by the services sector however, suggesting that employment growth in services has occurred dis-
proportionally more for those workers.


5.6 WAGES, JOB QUALITY, AND LABOR COSTS
This section studies the pattern of wages as an indicator for job quality and well as labor cost across
sectors, ﬁrm types, and over time. It also explores how the wage growth path is related to labor productivity
and other ﬁrm-level characteristics. The analysis helps answer the following questions: (a) Are wages higher
in large or small ﬁrms, ﬁrms creating jobs versus non-job creators? (b) Do wages increase with productivity,
including productivity within ﬁrms and across sector? (c) How does this wage-productivity relationship vary by
the extent of market competition?
First, there is a lot of heterogeneity in wages across and within sectors, even after accounting for
skill composition. Not surprisingly, most sectors pay better than agriculture. Somewhat unexpectedly, the food
manufacturing sector has one of the lowest average wage. The oil and gas related industries (ISIC 11 and 23)
are by far the highest-paying sectors. Those in the public sector (75) are also among the highest-paying jobs,
lending support to the argument that in many developing countries including Côte d’Ivoire, high public wages
might impose a wage ﬂoor effect for skilled workers in the private sector. This observation is consistent with
the ﬁnding in Chapter 1 that for the more educated — those at least upper-secondary education — public jobs
are more prevalent that private wage employment in the formal sector.
One might expect that variations in sectoral wages are driven mainly by differences in the skill
content. However, decomposing wages by different occupations (where skilled workers are deﬁned as those in
management or technician positions) show that there remains substantial heterogeneity across sectors, both for

skilled and unskilled workers. While occupation alone is not a perfect measure of skill content, this heterogeneity
is potentially a result of wage rigidity or non-transferability of skills across sectors.
Second, there appears to be different wage levels in micro and small ﬁrms compared to larger ﬁrms,
where wages are signiﬁcantly higher.100 As expected, wages in micro ﬁrms are lower than in small ﬁrms, which
in turn have lower wages than medium and large ﬁrms. Interestingly, there are no clear differences in wages
among large and medium ﬁrms. The wage distribution on the left, in particular, appears identical for medium
and large ﬁrms. If wages can be considered a sufﬁcient proxy for worker’s characteristics, it looks as if medium
and large ﬁrms are hiring a similar set of workers who are however distinctly different from the micro and small
ﬁrms. This result has important implications. Results on labor costs from previous studies focusing on the larger
ﬁrms (such as World Bank 2015), may not be applicable across all ﬁrms, as is further discussed in section 5.7.

               This is in contrast to results from the 2009 Enterprise Survey (World Bank 2010), which ﬁnds small ﬁrms to have higher labor cost.

                                                                                                                                                                                                           124
One potential explanation for this pattern might be that large ﬁrms require a different organizational
structure that involves signiﬁcantly more managerial positions. The explanation is supported by analyzing
how ﬁrms are most likely to be organized across different size categories (see Caliendo, Monte, and Rossi-
Hansberg 2015, for an explanation on how ﬁrms organize to economize on their use of knowledge). Among
those with at least 20 employees, the vast majority of ﬁrms are organized in a more complex structure that
includes all four types of employees (unskilled laborers, technicians, middle management, and senior executives).
In contrast, only 16.6 percent of micro ﬁrms have all four layers of employees while the vast majority only have
one or two types of workers. As average wages are signiﬁcantly higher for the upper more-skilled layers, these
differences in ﬁrms’ organizational structure can account for their wage differentials.
Over time, average wages in the formal sector have been declining in real terms, perhaps reﬂecting
the entry of more low-skill workers. Figure 5.23 shows the evolution of average wage and average value
added per worker, after accounting for sector, size, and age composition of ﬁrms over time. By 2012, the average
labor productivity was about 17 percent lower than its level in 2003, and the difference is statistically signiﬁcant.
One explanation for the declining labor productivity is if ﬁrms have become less skill intensive, which is consistent
with the results shown in Figure 5.14. Given that these estimates are net of sector, size, and age effects, the
result suggests that the share of less-skilled workers might have increased within ﬁrms.
The difference between wages and labor productivity has remained constant over time, suggesting
that the relative bargaining power of workers and ﬁrms has not changed much. As the average labor
productivity decreases, we see a similar decline in ﬁrm-level wages. In the entire sample period, average wages
always stay at approximately 60 percent that of the average labor productivity. As the relationship between
wage and labor productivity should be determined by the bargaining power between ﬁrms and workers, the
observed wage gap indicates that ﬁrms have maintained a similar level of bargaining power overtime.
To formalize the descriptive statistics presented above, the rest of this section discusses the determi-
nants of wages based on a rent-sharing model (in the spirit of Van Reenan 1996; Card, Devicienti, and
Maida 2014). The main idea is that depending on the structure of the labor market, how wages paid to workers
compare to their marginal product of labor (in other words, how proﬁts are shared) depends on their respective
bargaining power. More speciﬁcally, we regress (log) wage on ﬁrm’s average labor productivity, skill ratio, the
sectoral level of productive and wages — as proxy for the outside option for the ﬁrm’s employees — and other
ﬁrm and sectoral characteristics.101 This is equivalent to averaging the individual wage determination problem
into a ﬁrm-level wage function (see Table D.3, Annex D, for the speciﬁcations and regression results).
Firms’ unit labor cost decreases as they grow. OLS results suggest that across ﬁrms and sectors, the rela-
tionship between ﬁrm size and wages is non-monotonous. Micro ﬁrms have lower wages than small ﬁrms,

consistent with the descriptive evidence above. Once they reach 50 employees, wages start to decrease with size.
However, when ﬁrm ﬁxed effects are accounted for, ﬁrm age has no signiﬁcant effect. Most strikingly, wages
decrease monotonously with ﬁrm size, indicating that ﬁrms’ average wages decrease as they grow. In addition,
the negative correlation between wages and whether a ﬁrm creates jobs further conﬁrms the importance of
labor costs for employment growth.
As expected, ﬁrm-level wages increase with labor productivity. The coefﬁcient estimates on labor produc-
tivity imply an elasticity of 0.15 to 0.38. This is true whether we control for ﬁrm-level productivity alone or when
we control for sectoral productivity, such that the estimates can be interpreted as the impact of ﬁrm-speciﬁc
productivity (or demand) shocks. When ﬁrm ﬁxed effects are accounted for, the estimated elasticity is smaller,
suggesting that wage growth within ﬁrms is less responsive to productivity increases than across ﬁrms. While
not strictly comparable, these elasticity estimates are relatively large compared to those in previous studies such
as Card, Devicienti, and Maida (2014), implying a fairly large rent-sharing effect in Côte d’Ivoire.
Interestingly, the average sectoral productivity has a dampening effect of ﬁrm-level wages. This is in
contrasts to evidence from Sweden (Carlsson et al. 2015) which ﬁnds that common productivity shocks within
sectors have a large positive effect on wages. In other words, we do not ﬁnd evidence of proﬁtability improve-
ments among ﬁrms in the same labor market segment result in wage growth for workers. This might be an
indicator of the lack of labor mobility across sectors, consistent with our earlier observation of wage heteroge-
neity and possible lack of skill transferability across sectors in Côte d’Ivoire.
Firm-level wages increase with the outside wage but the extent of market concentration and skill
intensity do not have a signiﬁcant impact on rent sharing. The average sector-level wages have a positive
effect on ﬁrm-level wages, conﬁrming the hypothesis that workers have higher bargaining power when they have
better outside options. However, market power as measured by the sectoral HHI index of employment does not
have any signiﬁcant impact on wages, both in levels and in its interaction with ﬁrm-level productivity. Similarly,
the coefﬁcients on the interaction with skill ratio in the ﬁxed effect speciﬁcation are small and insigniﬁcant,
suggesting that skilled workers are not more likely to beneﬁt from productivity improvements.


5.7 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The various analyses above reveal some very positive trends in the formal sector: ﬁrms are increasingly
formalized and are growing over time, contributing to a sustained net gain in formal employment
since 2007.102 With increased political stability, we also see a return of foreign investors and foreign workers,
especially after the 2011 election.
Yet, in aggregate, the number of new jobs created in the formal sector is still negligible compared
to the size of the labor force. In 2014, the total number of wage jobs is approximately 2 million, a multifold
of the size of the formal sector in 2012 and its most signiﬁcant annual net job gain (300,000 and 40,000,
respectively). Part of the explanation is that while we do see ﬁrms grow over time, many struggle to survive in
the ﬁrst place. Compared to other countries with available data, Côte d’Ivoire has one of the most volatile ﬁrm
and job dynamics patterns. For those that do survive, growth seems concentrated in a small fraction of ﬁrms.
In addition, there remain deep regional disparities in business activities.
Among other factors, both capital intensity and ﬁrm-level labor productivity appear to improve
chances of ﬁrms’ survival and growth. Given our revenue productivity measure, the role of productivity
further suggests the importance of demand. Labor cost, particularly for more skilled occupations, also seems
to affect ﬁrms’ ability to expand. These results suggest a number of areas of investment climate constraints to
ﬁrm growth. The following sections discuss these constraints and potential policy responses, with an emphasis
on capital and labor/capabilities constraints.

      It is worth noting again that since part of the trend could reﬂect better data collection, not all the gains observed in the data might be
      attributed to new economic activities alone.

5.7.1. Investment climate constraints and policies
Entry regulations no longer appear to be a major constraint. Côte d’Ivoire has achieved signiﬁcant progress
in its business regulatory environment, as measured by the Doing Business (DB) rankings since 2012. The most
remarkable improvement has been the area of ‘starting a business’, where Côte d’Ivoire’s performance with
regard to distance to frontiers jumped from 40 in 2004 to 91 in 2016, driven by reductions in both time and
cost of registration. With its long-standing history of openness to foreign businesses and workers, the country
also has virtually no regulatory restrictions on foreign equity ownership.103 The increase in entry observed in the
CdB data, both domestic and foreign, suggest that investment climate constraints to the formal sector growth
might rest more with operations and market opportunities rather than ﬁrm entry.
Beyond political instability, constraints to post-entry growth might be partly explained by access
to ﬁnance, transport and logistics, as well as skill and cost constraints in the labor market. Despite
improvements, Côte d’Ivoire is still characterized by similar investment climate constraints facing other countries
the region. In 2016, and despite recent improvements, its Doing Business ranking is still 142 out of more than
180 countries. Beside political instability, the non-conducive investment climate possibly contributed to high
exit rates, and high level of labor churning.
Access to ﬁnance is an important constraint, indicated by ﬁrm perceptions as well as low levels of
capital intensity and high returns to capital. Table 5.3 shows the cross-sectional variations in capital intensity
and returns to capital by ﬁrm size in Côte d’Ivoire and a set of comparator countries. Capital intensity among
Ivorian ﬁrms is in fact substantially lower than in other countries. Conversely, the average returns to capital
across different ﬁrm sizes are almost always higher. While it is difﬁcult to assess where capital is most binding,
we use average return to capital, measured as the ratio of value added over the capital stock, as a proxy. The
idea is that for proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrms, the marginal returns to capital should be equated to its price, hence
higher returns indicate higher capital cost, or that the ﬁrm is more capital constrained. Using this proxy, Ivorian
ﬁrms appear to be most capital constrained among comparator countries both in West Africa and other regions.

Capital constraint varies substantially by sectors and type of ﬁrms, indicating frictions in the capital
market (Figures 5.24 and 5.25). Using the same average capital returns as a proxy, it appears that manufactur-
ing and services industries associated with mining, computer and other equipment, and ﬁnancial intermediation
(ISIC 12, 30, 32, 33, 50, 67, and 72) are the most ﬁnancially constrained. The agribusiness sector (ISIC 15), on
the other hand, appears to be less constrained. Similarly, capital constraints also vary by ﬁrm size. In general,
access to ﬁnance appears more binding for smaller ﬁrms. However, in contrast to suggestions from other
studies, formal micro ﬁrms might not be the most ﬁnancially constrained. Using our proxy, ﬁrms between 5–20
employees will beneﬁt most from capital reallocation. Still, as Chapter 4 highlights, capital constraints are also
the most binding constraints for household enterprise.
Accordingly, policies to improve access to ﬁnance need to pay attention to ﬁrm and sector heterogeneity.
The country’s low score on the Doing Business ‘getting credit’ indicators, for example, is driven by the lack of a credit
bureau or credit registry, sharing of credit information, and a movable collateral registry, which negatively affects
the allocation of credit in the economy and often impacts smaller ﬁrms disproportionally. Alternatively, to alleviate
capital constraints, one might consider policies to attract foreign investments in sectors that are more ﬁnancially
constrained. These policies need not be blunt instruments such as tax incentives but could be targeted investment
climate policies that would encourage foreign entry in certain sectors. In addition, low returns to capital in certain
sectors and types of ﬁrms can be caused by constraints in complementary inputs such as skilled labor. Therefore,
policies that do not consider other complementary inputs might fall short of alleviating ﬁrms’ constraints to grow.
Another concern about the formal sector’s competitiveness, particularly the manufacturing sector, is its
conceived high labor cost (World Bank 2014). If this is true, excessively high labor cost could be a constraint
to ﬁrm growth and aggregate employment growth. We already ﬁnd support in the CdB data that ﬁrms appear
to grow at the same time as they reduce the average labor cost. We further look at cross-country evidence for
whether Côte d’Ivoire is competitive in its labor cost. Results from the WBES are presented in Figure 5.26.
In contrast to the manufacturing study focusing on the largest ﬁrms (World Bank 2014), Ivorian ﬁrms
in fact pay a moderate level of wages compared to those in other countries both inside and outside
the region. Average wages in 2009, which excludes former rebel zones, is only higher than that of Mali and
Ghana. The labor cost in 2012, which includes former rebel zones, is even lower.
However, Côte d’Ivoire also has a relatively low labor productivity/labor cost ratio. This result implies
that the labor force is not competitive and that low workforce productivity might become a constraint to formal
sector expansion.




                                                                                                                                    128
BOX 5.4: LABOR REGULATIONS AND THE MINIMUM WAGE
With regard to regulatory costs, Côte d’Ivoire does not have overly restrictive labor regulations (World Bank 2010).
The minimum wage level appears non-binding for most ﬁrms in the whole sample period, where the average wage
for around 95 percent of the ﬁrms is higher than the minimum wage level.
In 2013, Côte d’Ivoire doubled its minimum wage level for the ﬁrst time since the 1994 devaluation. There has been
no evidence on the impact of this increase on employment but our ﬁrm-level data suggest that the new minimum
wage could become binding for a signiﬁcant share of micro and small ﬁrms, as around 37 percent of those ﬁrms
are currently paying at the level of the new minimum wage on average.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, a substantial share of the employed population, and even those in wage jobs, in fact
earn much less than the minimum wage. In part, this is because only a small share of the employed population hold
formal jobs, as highlighted in this chapter. Earnings in nonagricultural and agricultural self-employment, although
rather heterogeneous, are on average lower than the minimum wage for the formal sector.
At the same time, the new minimum wage does not appear excessive for formal ﬁrms. Based on the Doing Business
database, the ratio of minimum wage to overall value added per worker (GDP per employed person) in Côte d’Ivoire is
still at the low end among West African countries and comparator countries such as Kenya and Vietnam.104 Policies
to improve labor competitiveness for the formal sector will have to consider aspects related to the workforce as
well as broader policies that can reduce the cost of living in urban areas. Gelb et al. (2013), for example, suggest
several possible causes for high living costs (Côte d’Ivoire is one of the countries with the highest price levels given
its income level), including the dependence on resource-based exports and investment inﬂows, and high trans-
portation costs driving up food prices. Hence complementary policies to reform agricultural and services sectors
or better manage urbanization might help drive down living costs and needed compensation levels.

Low relative productivity indicates that the level of skills of the workforce might be a key constraint
to growth in better ﬁrms. As will be further discussed in Chapter 6, due to the crisis, education attainment
in Côte d’Ivoire has lagged behind Sub-Saharan Africa’s trend. Yet, Chapter 1 suggests that only those with
at least secondary education have a decent chance of working in the formal sector. At the same time, convex
pattern in the return to schooling are found in Côte d’Ivoire (see Chapter 6), indicating steep increases in labor
costs as ﬁrms employ higher shares of skilled workers. Given the results above that larger ﬁrms tend to have
employ higher shares of technical and managerial positions, high labor cost associated with high skill premium
might be a binding constraint for growth. This observation is in line with Gelb et al. (2013) which ﬁnds that
large ﬁrms pay higher wages in Sub-Saharan Africa, potentially due to labor management issues resulting in
higher supervisor-to-worker ratio than elsewhere.
Beyond concerns about efﬁciency, low labor productivity might also be an indicator that ﬁrms are
constrained by lack of demand. Recent research (see Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson 2016) suggests that
a key explanation for the slow growth of young ﬁrms in the United States is more likely linked to slow growth
of demand rather than productivity. Evidence from the CdB data appears consistent with this hypothesis: while
younger ﬁrms grow faster on average, only a subset of them do grow, and once ﬁrm labor productivity is
accounted for, age has very little explanatory power over growth.
In the context of Côte  d’Ivoire, two factors stand out as possible constraints to output demand
growth: transport infrastructure and logistics, and ﬁrm capabilities. As in most countries, rapid expansion
of demand is most likely to occur in tradable sectors. Côte d’Ivoire has an advantage over many other landlocked
countries but its logistic performance index (LPI) is barely above the Sub-Saharan Africa average. The cost of
export and import based on Doing Business data is inexplicably more expensive than landlocked countries such
as Burkina Faso and Mali.105 For smaller ﬁrms in particular, reaching the regional market might be an important

channel for export. Yet road and rail transport infrastructure in Côte d’Ivoire is inefﬁcient and expensive, contrib-
uted to by entrenched monopoly, inefﬁcient quota system, and pervasive roadblocks and corruption demands
in the north such as along the Abidjan-Ouagadougou corridor (World Bank 2014, 2015b). Successful demand
accumulation also requires a certain degree of ﬁrm capabilities. As argued earlier, the fact that Ivorian ﬁrms
are signiﬁcantly less able to survive in sectors with a high rate of foreign entry suggests the need to improve
capabilities for domestic ﬁrms. These include, beyond better access to ﬁnance, other complementary inputs
such as business services support, access to information about foreign markets, and public inputs such as quality
standards. The next section discusses some of the policy tools toward this goal.

5.7.2. Incentives and other direct support programs
Beyond policies to improve the overall investment climate, governments can also consider other
direct support programs that could compensate for a poor business environment in the short run. The
government of Côte d’Ivoire has an extensive incentives program to promote FDI. However, much of the current
FDI incentives favor capital expenditures and are not necessarily in line with the goal to promote exports or
employment (World Bank 2016). Given the high cost in foregone taxes, public funding might be better diverted
to provide subsidies or tax credits to encourage exports, hiring, skills and quality upgrading, or creating linkages
with the local economy rather than on expensive tax breaks for capital-intensive sectors with limited linkages
to the rest of the economy such as the oil and gas sector.
Incentives and support programs might beneﬁt from taking into account sectoral potential for job
creation. One measure that could help guide targeting is to consider the labor intensity in different sectors,
particularly for unskilled labor. Table D.4 shows a breakdown along this line, where labor intensity is measured
as the expenditure share of employment in value added output, which could be considered as the derived
labor demand. Food manufacturing (ISIC 15), for example, is important for employment but as a relatively
capital-intensive sector, its employment returns to the same amount of investments will be fairly limited. Other
high-potential sectors include business activities (ISIC 74) and transport services (ISIC 63), due to their high
contribution to aggregate employment and a high labor intensity. In addition, these are also network industries
whose growth can have potential to improve services inputs to the rest of the economy. An alternative to ex
ante targeting, given the difﬁculty to predict business success, is to identify emerging successful ﬁrms or sectors
and consider policies to alleviate the constraints speciﬁc to those ﬁrms/sectors.
Support programs also need to address existing regional disparities in economic activities as well as
agglomeration effects. The continued concentration of businesses in Abidjan suggests that in the short run,
it will be difﬁcult to create inclusive opportunities for formal jobs in the rest of the country. In the long run,
rebalancing the pattern of economic activities in the country will require policies address coordination failures

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         130
by providing infrastructure and incentivizing market linkages between downstream and upstream businesses
in other regions. The most likely candidates could be cities to leverage agglomeration beneﬁts from existing
concentration of infrastructure and human resources. One such effort is the project to support the Ivorian
Government develop the city of Bouaké. The project includes both infrastructure ﬁnancing and direct technical
and ﬁnancial support instruments provided for ﬁrms to stimulate investments and job creation. In Bouaké,
for example, the project leverages its position as a trading hub and proximity to agricultural supplies to target
agro-transformation activities.
Given the likelihood of interdependent constraints, especially for micro and small ﬁrms, it is possible
that no one type of support would be sufﬁcient to improve ﬁrm performance and growth. Any policy
intervention would need to carefully consider a range of possible constraints speciﬁc to sector and ﬁrm type
while ensuring market competition, and incorporating tracking and evaluating interventions where possible.

ANNEX D:
Distribution of firms around the tax thresholds
Figure D.1 shows the number of ﬁrms in different revenue groups in 2004, 2005, 2009, and 2010 to examine
whether there is any bunching around the two revenue thresholds of CFAF 50 million and CFAF 150 million
which will put ﬁrms in the Simpliﬁed versus Normal tax regimes. The threshold changed in 2004 due to a new
Law of Finance, whereas starting in 2010, ﬁrms were asked to submit the same information to INS and the Tax
Administration. The lack of bunching around these tax thresholds suggests, at least, that there is no evidence
of ﬁrms manipulating reported revenue to avoid paying the higher tax rate.

Data attrition and firm exit
As ﬁrms’ true exits are not observed in the data, we deﬁne a ﬁrm as exiting when they permanently exit from
the dataset (hence exit is set as missing in the last year of the dataset). This deﬁnition will over-report exits and
create potential bias in the trend of ﬁrm exits overtime if ﬁrms exit and reenter the data in multiple years. To
evaluate to extent of bias, we examine the trends in ﬁrm entry, both by entry in dataset and true entry as deﬁned
by their reported establishment year. We observe an expected over-reporting of entry, but the trends in entry
rates using the two measures are fairly similar with the exception of 2010 and 2011, suggesting that the trend
using our exit deﬁnition is also likely not misleading.
To further check for potential bias in the observed entry pattern due to better data collection, we report the
trends in size at entry for Normal ﬁrms only. If better data collection leads to disproportional shares of small
ﬁrms (non-Normal ﬁrms) to be included in more recent years, then we might expect the entry pattern for Normal
ﬁrms to be very different. However, we observe a very similar as with all ﬁrms, suggesting the observed trend
in decreasing ﬁrm size at entry is likely not driven by data reporting.

Wage regressions
Following Van Reenan (1996), in a wage bargaining model, individual wages can be written as a function of the
marginal product of labor, which is proportional to labor productivity with a Cobb-Douglas technology, and other
ﬁrm-level and industry characteristics that determine the bargaining power between the ﬁrm and the employee:

                                               i j st
                                                        = βpij t+γXjst+δZst+εij st
Averaging the above equation across workers and accounting for the skill composition, the ﬁrm-level wage regres-
sions can be written as follow, where we control for sectoral wages and productivity to proxy for workers’ outside
options and sector’s employment concentration as a measure of competition and bargaining power of the ﬁrm:
                        wjst = βp̅ jst+γ skillratiojst+ γ Xjst+δ w̅ st+δ p̅ st+δ HHIst+δt+αi+εjst
Note that our results should be interpreted as correlations only. One of the key endogeneity issues with the
speciﬁcation is that we use labor revenue productivity (the problem holds even if we use revenue TFP). In a
non-perfect competitive market, this productivity measure will include output prices and therefore is also a
function of wages (see for example, Carlsson et al. 2016, for a discussion).

6 EDUCATION,
6:           SKILLS AND
   EDUCATION SKILLS,
TRAINING FOR A COMPETITIVE
WORKFORCE IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Kebede Feda and Laura Ralston
Côte d’Ivoire faces substantial challenges for its workforce and human capital to be competitive globally.
The years of crisis affected the quality of education services and their ability to instill in children the skills they
need to be productive in the labor force. As Chapter 5 highlighted, although wages are not necessarily very high
in the formal sector, low worker productivity likely contributes to push up relative labor costs and may constrain
expansion of formal ﬁrms. At the same time, and as mentioned in Chapters 3 and 4, education and skills also
matter for productivity in agricultural and nonagricultural self-employment, in particular to ensure that individuals
are able to seize opportunities such as improved technologies or business practices. In this context, Côte d’Ivoire
faces an urgent challenge to ensure today’s children acquire the skills that tomorrow’s labor force will need, as
well as to ﬁnd opportunities for the current workforce to effectively upgrade their skills.


6.1 SCHOOLING, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND SKILLS

6.1.1 Basic education and skills
Participation in primary education has been negatively affected by the crisis between 2002 and
2011 and Côte d’Ivoire has not yet fully caught up with other countries in the region.106 Before 2002
Côte d’Ivoire was almost on par with average primary education enrollment rates for developing countries
in Sub-Saharan African. However, the gross enrollment rate (GER), which measures total enrollment relative
to the primary age population, has deteriorated from 2002. In 2002 gross enrollment was 77 percent and it
decreased to as low as 70 percent in 2007. While there was some catch-up in enrollment during the years of
peace between 2008 and 2010, where the rate stepped back up to around 73 percent, the most signiﬁcant
improvement came after 2011 when the rate increased to 90 percent by 2014. In 2015, the government
declared schooling compulsory for children up to 16. This should help close the gap in enrollment rates with
respect to Sub-Saharan Africa, where the GER in primary education was 99.6 percent in 2013. In fact, some
patterns in inequality in access to education are more pronounced in Côte d’Ivoire than other Sub-Saharan
African developing countries, and addressing access and enrollment in basic education remains an important
policy consideration to ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending school.
Enrollment in secondary and tertiary education remains relatively low but is similar to other countries
in Sub-Saharan African. While a complete time series of data is not available in Côte d’Ivoire, for the years
in which data is available, enrollment in secondary and tertiary education appears similar to the mean rate for
developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 6.1). For example, gross enrollment in secondary education

      This analysis is based on the data reported on gross primary enrollment rates in the World Development Indicators (WDI) accessed in July
      2016. The WDI cites the source as the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics
      and the deﬁnition of gross enrollment as the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that oﬃcially
      corresponds to the level of education shown.

increased from 25.6 percent to 41.2 percent. On tertiary education, Côte d’Ivoire does better than the mean
and enrollment increased from 6.6 percent to 9.1 percent over the same years, compared to 4.0 percent to 8.1
percent for Sub-Saharan African developing countries. While on par with other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
enrollment in secondary and tertiary education remains relatively low by international standards.
Female enrollment in primary education is particularly low in Côte d’Ivoire. Enrollment in primary edu-
cation lags other Sub-Saharan African developing countries, and the problem appears most acute among
females (Figures 6.2a and 6.2b). Before the conﬂict that began in 2002 enrollment of females in primary school
in Côte d’Ivoire stood about 15 percentage points below the regional average at 65 percent compared to 80
percent, while enrollment of males was closer at 88 percent compared to 93 percent. Both the enrollment of
boys and girls was detrimentally affected by the conﬂict and crises. However, by 2014, the most recent year for
which data is available, male enrollment had recovered to 96 percent compared to a regional average of 103
percent, while female enrollment stood at 84 percent, still more than 10 percentage points below the regional
average of 96 percent. As such, inequality in access to education is particularly marked among women. This
analysis can be complemented with other Côte d’Ivoire speciﬁc sources of information on GERs, such as the
2012 Demographic Health Survey and the 2013 Employment Survey (ENSETE 2013). While these show higher
aggregate GERs of 95.7 percent and 100.8 percent, respectively, they also uncover gender gaps with the male/
female rates being 101.9 percent / 89.3 percent and 107.3 percent / 94.3 percent, respectively.
Cost is one of the main reasons for not enrolling in education. According to recent survey data, many
of the youth in Côte d’Ivoire are constrained in their ability to attend school due to the cost of attending

(Figure 6.3a).107 This reason is more prevalent among females and youth living in the lowest-income groups.
A lack of interest in attending school is actually more prevalent among males, urban youth, or youth from
higher-income groups. This indicates that the majority of the groups with the lowest educational attainment
(females, the poor, and those in rural areas) are constrained in their access to education. These groups also state
that having to work is another common reason why they cannot attend school. Lower educational attainment
in the current population of youth is more likely due to barriers to access.
In light of the historical enrollment patterns, educational attainment remains modest among the youth
of working age in Côte d’Ivoire. According to the national employment survey collected in February 2014,
over 50 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 34 lack a complete primary education. Approximately
37.5 percent have no education and 17.5 percent have not completed primary school. This reﬂects the low
primary enrollment rates over the last 30 years — for example, in the early 1990s gross enrollment was below
70 percent. So while enrollment rates have improved, there is still a deﬁcit of human capital in the current
working-age population, even among those in the younger cohorts. Recent improvements in enrollment will
beneﬁt the next generations of youths entering the working-age population, and the overall education proﬁle
of the working-age population will take time to change substantially.
Only a minority of the youth of working age have secondary or tertiary education. Approximately
13 percent have completed lower-secondary education, 6 percent upper-secondary education, and 5 percent
post-secondary education. This implies that only around 24 percent of working-age youth have completed
more than primary education. As Côte d’Ivoire eyes to become an emerging economy over the next decade,
the current stock of human capital may hinder its global competitiveness.
Educational attainment — like enrollment — is unequal in Côte d’Ivoire. Females, the poor, and those living
in rural areas have less education (Figures 6.3b and 6.3c). There are stark differences in the educational attainment
of females and males in Côte d’Ivoire as about 47 percent of females ages 15–34 have no education, while over
71 percent of males have some level of education. There are also proportionately more males in higher levels of
education: 24 percent relative to 18 percent with complete primary schooling, 23.5 percent relative to 14 percent
with any secondary schooling, and 6.5 percent relative to 3.5 percent with post-secondary schooling. Larger
differences exist between the level of educational attainment of youth living in urban relative to rural areas: 23.5
percent relative to 19 percent with complete primary schooling, 29 percent relative to 9 percent with secondary
schooling, and 9 percent relative to 1.5 percent with post-secondary schooling. As can be expected, educational
attainment is signiﬁcantly correlated with income as only 26 percent of the youth in the lowest-income quintile have
completed primary education compared to 69 percent in the highest-income quintile. It is among the wealthiest

      The survey lumps cost and distance, but according to the latest education country status report the distance accounts only for 2.1
      percent among those reasons in the 6–11 years population and for 1.4 percent in the 12–15 years population.

income groups that secondary and tertiary educational attainment is concentrated. This variation in educational
attainment is likely due to a combination of factors, including inequality in the provision of education across
different areas and socioeconomic groups, demand-side aspects, and barriers to access across different groups.
Quality of primary education in Côte d’Ivoire lags other Sub-Saharan African developing countries,
limiting the skills that children can acquire in school. Both the rate of children repeating grades in primary
school and the literacy attainment in the current working-age population highlights signiﬁcant issues in the
quality of education in Côte d’Ivoire (Figures 6.4 and 6.5). The primary school repeater rate is still in the order of
10–15 percentage points higher than other Sub-Saharan African countries, even though it has been declining
in recent years.
Issues with the quality of education have implication for the skills children are able to acquire through
the education system. While educational attainment has increased in recent years, many children are not
learning much in school. Data from standardized test scores of young children who are currently enrolled in
school show that many are not acquiring sufﬁcient skills over time. Earlier data on test scores from the 2009
PASEC Programme d’analyse des systèmes éducatifs de la confemen) evaluations reveal a low level of French and
Math skills, and limited improvements in these skills during the school year (République de Côte d’Ivoire, 2012).
For instance, up to 40 percent students display severe shortage in French and Mathematics skills when entering
the CE1 level (Cours élémentaire première année, second grade of primary school). A full school year later, the

share of students with severe shortage in French skills does not decrease, and the share of students with severe
shortage in Math skills only decrease slightly to 30 percent. At the end of the school year, only 14 percent of
students score are assessed to have sufﬁcient skills in French, and 27 percent in Math (Figure 6.6a). More recent
cross-country comparison data from PASEC 2014 evaluations show that students at CM2 level (Cours moyen
deuxième année, ﬁfth grade of primary school, PASEC, 2016) are behind relative to other Francophone countries
in the region (Figure 6.6b). Math scores are particularly low and less than 25 percent of students meet minimum
competence requirements. French scores are more comparable to the average level obtained in other countries
but still less than 45 percent of students meet the minimum requirements.
Due to enrollment gaps and limited acquisition of skills among children attending schools, literacy
rates are relatively low.108 It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd internationally comparable time-series data on literacy rates.
WDI data suggest that literacy rates have declined in Côte d’Ivoire for both adults above 15 and youth between
15 and 24 over the period 2000–2012 (Figures 6.7a and 6.7b). Adults in 2000 were likely to have had a higher
skill level when entering the workforce than was the case for adults entering the workforce in 2012.
Côte d’Ivoire lags other emerging African economies, such as Nigeria, with respect to educational attain-
ment (Figures 6.8a and 6.8b). For example, in 2010 approximately 46 percent of 20–64-year-olds had no education
in Côte d’Ivoire, while this was the case for only about 33 percent of Nigerian 20–64-year-olds. Côte d’Ivoire also

has a much larger percentage of 20–64-year-olds with incomplete primary education compared to Nigeria (20
percent compared to 5 percent). While Nigeria is growing the proportion of the population with upper-secondary
and post-secondary education, the baseline and forecast estimates for Côte d’Ivoire are also more modest.
Compared to non-African emerging economies, such as Indonesia, Côte d’Ivoire has substantial prog-
ress to make to catch up with regard to educational attainment, particularly on primary education
(Figure 6.8c). Indonesia far surpasses Côte d’Ivoire on primary and secondary educational attainment among
20–64-year-olds. This demonstrates the ambitious transition that Côte d’Ivoire must navigate with regard to
skilling its workforce to become competitive globally with other emerging economies.
Low female educational attainment constrains labor productivity in Côte  d’Ivoire (Figure  6.9).
Compared to Nigeria and Indonesia, Côte d’Ivoire has a higher proportion of female working-age
population with no or incomplete primary education. While Nigeria also lags Indonesia in primary and low-
er-secondary education for females, it does relatively better in upper-secondary and post-secondary education.
Côte d’Ivoire, however, lags Indonesia across all categories of education for females.

6.1.2 Higher education
The 2011 crisis in Côte d’Ivoire marked a watershed moment for higher education in the country, with
signiﬁcant disruption to education provision in public universities. The government shut down three of its
main public universities for 18 months in 2011–2012 in an effort to stabilize peacekeeping efforts in the country

and engage in rehabilitation of physical structures and equipment that had suffered extensive damages during the
conﬂict period. At the same time, the government began the implementation of the new License-Master-Doctorate
system (LMD) in 2012 which was originally adopted through a legislation in 2009 but not operationalized until
2012. The move toward the LMD system is expected to improve efﬁciency in higher education by streamlining
educational channels, providing international accreditation, and therefore increasing competitiveness of the
workforce and increasing potential labor mobility across regional and international frontiers.
Since 2012, with the end of the crisis and with increased socio-political stability, enrollment in higher
education returned to its pre-crisis levels with a total of 176,000 enrolled, equivalent to 866 enrolled
for every 100,000 people in the country. Figure 6.10 shows the trend in enrollment by type of institution and
by ﬁeld of study. It indicates that enrollment in public institutions rebounded strongly in 2012 and 2013, reaching
over 98,000 students in 2013–2014. It also indicates that private institutions play a key role in accommodating
students in higher education. It was especially important during the conﬂict period where private institutions
accounted for 80 percent of total enrollment, ensuring continuity in studies for students who could afford it. In
2013–2014, the share of enrollment in private schools decreased to 44 percent.
Between 2010–2011 and 2013–2014, there have been important shifts in students’ ﬁelds of study in
higher education. The general trend in ﬁeld of studies indicates that while Commerce and Administration was
still the most popular ﬁeld in 2013–2014, the share of enrollment in this ﬁeld decreased between 2010–2011

and 2013–2014. In parallel, enrollment in Science ﬁelds has also been on the decline while other areas such as
Literature and Social Sciences seem to have captured a greater enrollment share.
With regard to access to higher education, there has been little improvement between 2008 and 2015,
and persistent disparities in access by gender and by wealth quintile. Figure 6.11 shows the higher edu-
cation GER by gender and by wealth quintiles. At the national level, access to higher education remains relatively
unchanged, increasing from 6 percent to 8 percent between 2008 and 2015. The ﬁgure also indicates that the
gender gap decreased slightly over time with female GER improving from 4 percent to 7 percent compared to
male GER which increased from 8 percent to 10 percent over the same time period. The access by wealth quintile
indicates that higher education is most likely accessed by afﬂuent families and the trend indicates a worsening
of the situation between 2008 and 2015. In 2015, for example, 19 percent of the richest households enrolled
in higher education compared to 1 percent in the lowest quintile.
An international comparison of access to higher education in Côte d’Ivoire indicates that while the
country’s performance is good relative to other Francophone countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is
still room for improvement, especially in comparison with other middle-income countries. Figure 6.12
shows the higher education GER and gender parity index (GPI) for Côte d’Ivoire and other comparison groups
as well as the GER relative to the country’s GDP per capita.

With a GER of 8 percent and a GPI of 0.7, Côte d’Ivoire tends to perform much better than other Francophone
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which have a corresponding GER of 5.3 and a GPI of 0.67. Côte d’Ivoire’s perfor-
mance is closer to the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 8 percent GER, although it underperforms in comparison
with the 0.78 GPI Sub-Saharan Africa average. With regard to GDP per capita, Côte d’Ivoire is among the
best-performing GERs in the Sub-Saharan Africa region. On the other hand, when comparing its performance
with middle-income countries which have a GER of 12 percent and a GPI of 0.88, Côte d’Ivoire still lags, indi-
cating that the country still has signiﬁcant room for improvement in access at this level of education.


6.2 EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AND EMPLOYMENT
Education inﬂuences access to employment sectors. In Côte d’Ivoire, most low-skilled individuals are con-
centrated in agriculture, while individuals with secondary education or higher are more likely to be employed in
the wage sector (Figure 6.13). As indicated above, the share of individuals with less than secondary education is
high, so that the majority of the population is in fact concentrated in the bottom of the education distribution,
and as such mostly work in agriculture and nonagricultural self-employment. Nonagricultural self-employment
involves individuals from all levels of education.
Sector of employment sector varies by gender as well as by education. Employment in agriculture is more
prevalent among males, while nonagricultural self-employment is more prevalent among females (Figures 6.14a
and 6.14b). With no education there is high proportion of males and females in agriculture (69 percent and 60
percent, respectively). However, as education levels increase, females are more likely to be engaged in nonagricul-
tural self-employment than men, who instead stay in agriculture or access wage employment. There are more males
in wage employment at each education level, indicating that this sector is harder for females to enter. This could be
due to personal preferences or constraints, such as difﬁculties in balancing childcare with ﬁxed hours wage work
or a desire for the ﬂexibility self-employment enables, or due to the unwillingness of employers to hire females.

Among those that are wage employed, access to formal wage jobs with a contract increases with
education for both males and females (Figure 6.15). With no education or incomplete primary education,
only about 50 percent of males obtain contracts in the wage sector, with post-secondary this increases to over
70 percent. With no education or incomplete primary education, only about 45 percent of females obtain con-
tracts in the wage sector, with post-secondary this increases to almost 85 percent.
The skill mix by employment sector varies by gender (Figure 6.16). For example, in agriculture females
have very low levels of education, with over 80 percent 15–24-year-olds and 25–34-year-olds having no or
only primary education. In contrast, among 15–24-year-old males and 25–34-year-old males, about 30 percent
working in agriculture have lower-secondary education or higher. In the wage sector, the females that do ﬁnd
employment have higher levels of education relative to their male counterparts. While the evidence is only
suggestive, females may need a high level of education to access jobs in the wage sector. Nonagricultural
self-employment shows a similar level of educational skill mix among males and females. As such, this sector may
be a catch-all category that occupies females that are too educated to ﬁnd attractive employment opportunities
through agriculture, yet do not move into the wage sector.
There are positive education earnings premia in wage work for both males and females, although
there is heterogeneity in earning proﬁles for each gender (Figure 6.17). For males there is a signiﬁcant
jump up in wages from upper-secondary to post-secondary (CFAF 132,000 per month to CFAF 270,000 per
month). The rest of the wage proﬁle increases with education but at lower rate. For females the earnings premia

for primary education are low (from CFAF 27,000 per month with no education to CFAF 43,000 per month with
complete primary), but are quite substantial at higher levels of education. Moreover, the relative increase in earn-
ings premia for any secondary education are greater for females than males (CFAF 43,000–74,000 per month
moving to lower-secondary, CFAF 43,000–118,000 CFA per month moving to upper-secondary compared to CFAF
76,000–109,000 per month and CFAF 76,000–132,000 per month for males, respectively). Despite high relative
earnings premia, in absolute returns the premia are lower for females as shown by the persistence of a gender
gap in earnings. Overall women receive far lower wages at all levels of the education distribution in wage work.
Despite a prevalence of females in nonagricultural self-employment, males obtain higher earnings. In
addition, greater educational attainment only raises earnings for females with the highest educational achieve-
ment (Figure 6.18). For both males and females, the correlation between educational attainment and earnings
in nonagricultural self-employment is weak. For example, for males with no education the mean earnings is
CFAF 52,000 per month and those with upper-secondary education or more only increase their earnings to CFAF
63,000 per month. The beneﬁts to additional years of education are stronger for females with the highest levels
of education (upper-secondary or above) as their average earnings are about CFAF 46,000 per month, relative
to CFAF 31,000 per month or below for other levels of education. Most striking, however, is the gender gap in
earnings at all levels of education, averaging over CFAF 20,000 per month. This may reﬂect differences in access
to other inputs that are not captured in this analysis.109 Complementary analysis in Chapter 4 shows that it is
mainly those individuals that lack basic numeracy skills or have minimal levels of education that are occupied in
self-employment (see Box C.1 and Table C.2 in Annex C for more details and results).

6.3. TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT
Few individuals have opportunities to acquire skills outside the education system. In the last 5 years, 15
percent of males and 9 percent of females in the working-age population participated in some form of training
outside the education system (Figure 6.19). Participation in training outside the education system110 is most
common among the 25–34 age group, where 21 percent of males and 13 percent of females have participated.
For all age groups participation in post-school training is more common among males than females.
Individuals with low educational achievement have limited opportunities to access post-school train-
ing (Figure 6.20). Participation in training increases with education level, and at a greater rate for females
compared to males. For example, at no education 6 percent of males report having taken training in last 5 years
compared to 2 percent of females, but at post-secondary education 32 percent of males report having taken
training in last 5 years compared to 39 percent of females. Common reasons for not participating in training
programs include being in school (for 14–24-year-olds), having a job (for 25–34-year-olds) and the lack of means
or lack of institutions (all age groups).
Training that are provided by private providers is the most common. Traditional apprenticeship is the most
prevalent form of post-school training, particularly among males (Figure 6.21). About 59 percent of 14–24-year-
old males and 44 percent of 25–34-year-old males who participate in post-school training report taking part in
this type of training. Formal apprenticeship and then private technical and vocational training are the next most
prevalent forms of training for both males and females. These types of training are more common among the
older age group of 25–34-year-olds than the 14–24-year-olds. While traditional apprenticeships are the most
common type of training for females, fewer participate compared to males. Formal apprenticeships and private
training command a signiﬁcant share of female training participants.

Traditional apprenticeships attract participants from all levels of education, while private, public, and
on-the-job training attract more highly educated participants (Figure 6.22). About 58 percent of the par-
ticipants in traditional apprenticeships have primary education or less. This proportion decreases to 25 percent in
formal apprenticeships, 29 percent in private training, 17 percent in public training, and 22 percent in enterprise
training. Training offered under traditional apprenticeships is the most accessible to individuals with lower levels of
educational attainment, while other types of training have additional educational requirements. As described in the
next section, traditional apprenticeships are provided by private master-craftsmen in micro and small enterprises.
They involve apprentices providing free or low-cost labor in exchange for being taught vocation-speciﬁc skills.

Those involved in the wage sector have the highest participation in training outside the education
system (Figure 6.23). This is aligned with the observation that most training participants have higher levels of
education and that most highly educated individuals ﬁnd employment in the wage sector. Most training oppor-
tunities are designed to promote access to wage employment. Traditional apprenticeship is the main source of
skills for nonagricultural self-employment. In contrast, there are very few sources of training in the agricultural
sector. Only a very small share of those involved in agricultural self-employment have participated in any training
(8 percent males, 2 percent females).
Data on returns to post-school training are limited, but evidence is mixed. Post-school training appears
mostly associated with higher earnings for those with low levels of education in nonagricultural self-employment
(Figures 6.24a and 6.24b). Limited association between post-school training and earnings is observed for those
with higher levels of education or in the wage sector. Despite the higher participation in training by those with
high levels of educational attainment and those who are employed in the wage sector, there appears to be little
or no gain in average earnings for these groups. Individuals who have primary education or less do appear to
gain, with regard to average earnings, when they participate in training. The gain in earnings is greater for those
employed in nonfarm household enterprise than the wage sector. These results could suggest that training is
pursued, on the one hand, as a complement to education for those with high levels of education but lower initial
productivity to help them access higher-paying employment, and on the other hand it is pursued by those with
low levels of education who would like to pursue self-employment in a speciﬁc skilled trade to access higher
potential earnings. Regardless, however, training is pursued by a minority of the workforce and the current data
suggest that it has little effect on earnings for the majority of the participants. Existing data are not sufﬁcient
to further examine the change in productivity of individuals who enroll in training and the quality of training.

6.4 THE APPRENTICESHIP MARKET
While informal apprenticeships are the main source of post-school training — in particular for low-
skilled youths — they are often overlooked in policy discussions on skills, which tend to focus on the
education system and publicly provided training. Until recently, very limited data existed on Côte d’Ivoire
on the way the apprenticeship market functions, including on the proﬁle of ﬁrms offering apprenticeships, or
the process through which apprentices ﬁnd ﬁrms and ﬁrms ﬁnd apprentices. This section presents highlights
from a recent survey of ﬁrms expressing interest to host apprentices as part of the Youth Employment and Skills
Development Project (PEJEDEC, see Crépon and Premand, 2017) in urban areas including the cities of Abidjan,
Adzopé, Divo, Gagnoa, Daoukro, Mankono, Bouaké, and Man. Although the sample is not nationally repre-
sentative, it helps shed light on the way apprenticeships are structured and the types of skills that are valued by
ﬁrms. It also provide insights on the potential role for public policy in the sector.
Informal apprenticeships are often provided by micro and small enterprises, mostly in the informal sector.
The large majority of enterprises hosting apprentices are informal: 16 percent have an ofﬁcial legal status, 22
percent are formally registered and 34 percent use any accounting system. While these ﬁrms are informal, they
tend to be in business for over a decade (13.5 years on average). On average, they have 7 employees. Only about
half of these employees work autonomously without supervision, but ﬁrms have on average 3.4 apprentices.
As such, ﬁrms rely heavily on apprentices for labor. Apprentices account for nearly half the workforce of these
micro and small enterprises, and this share does not change much over time as ﬁrms tend to grow little with
additional years of operation (Figure 6.25).
While the self-reported reasons to take apprentices given by enterprise owners are largely altruistic,
economic considerations are likely prevalent. Enterprise owners often cited altruistic reasons for offering
apprenticeships: over 80 percent of respondents stated their reason for taking apprentices was to help youth or
share their knowledge with youth. Only 12 percent answered that their motivation to recruit apprentices was
for labor or to train qualiﬁed workers for their enterprise. However, as mentioned above, apprentices constitute
a large share of the workforce for many enterprises. In addition, while 31 percent of ﬁrms never hire employees,
25 percent hire staff internally from their apprentice pool (Figure 6.26). As such, hiring of apprentices is the
most common recruitment method. Finally, apprentices also pay for training, and these revenues are at times
not negligible for the micro and small ﬁrms offering apprenticeships.
Some master-craftsmen charge fees to apprentices, and apprenticeships often contribute to ﬁrms’
revenues, but apprentices also start to be paid relatively soon. Fees tend to be broken down in two
parts: a registration cost and then a fee paid at regular or non-regular intervals. About half of apprentices pay
registration fees at the beginning of the apprenticeship, and about a quarter pay training fees. Many enterprises
collect training fee payments irregularly, and, on average, fees are paid for a little less than a year. At the same

time, apprentices start being paid by the ﬁrm relatively soon, after approximately 6 months on average. Overall,
the median duration of apprenticeship is reported to be 6 years.
Many ﬁrm owners consider behavioral skills as the most important characteristic sought in appren-
tices, as well as one of the most difﬁcult characteristic to ﬁnd. Few enterprises report that they search for
apprentices with a certain education level or certain technical skills. On the other hand, a lot of enterprises want an
apprentice who is respectful, obedient, hardworking, disciplined, honest, who does not steal, and has good morals.
Respect is also reported as being the most difﬁcult characteristic to ﬁnd in an apprentice. Possibly in part due to their
search of these behavioral skills that are difﬁcult to observe, enterprises mostly rely on social networks and relatives
to recruit apprentices. About 84 percent of enterprises hire apprentices at the request of the apprentices’ parents.
Only 8 percent of ﬁrms hire apprentices via unsolicited applications and only 1 percent recruit through advertising.
The quality of training obtained during traditional apprenticeships is likely limited. Firms typically report
having some but not all the material needed to train the apprentice. Master-craftsmen who mentor and train
apprentices tend to have low level of education and training. Master-craftsmen have very low level of education
on average, with only 20 percent having completed primary school and less than 1 percent having completed high
school; 40 percent have no schooling. In addition to having low levels of education, only 7 percent of masters took
a training course in the last year, and the last time masters took a training course was an average of 10 years ago.
About 71 percent of transfers report a need to take additional training Finally, a vast majority of apprenticeship
trainers are men, as women are often concentrated in occupations such as sowing and hairdressing.
At the same time, a large number of apprentices are observed leaving before completing their training.
In fact, the number of apprentices who were reported to leave prematurely is more than twice the number who
completed training. Firm owners report that many apprentices quit because of lack of interest or inability to
learn (Figure 6.27). Consistent with the emphasis on behavioral skills and the challenges in screening for these
skills, employers also report that many apprentices leave prematurely because they were either disobedient or
accused of theft.


6.5. POLICY DIRECTIONS
To achieve its objective of becoming an emerging economy and being globally competitive, Côte d’Ivo-
ire will need to further improve the skill level of its workforce. Côte d’Ivoire faces substantial challenges
for its workforce and human capital to be competitive globally. The years of crisis affected the quality of educa-
tion services and the opportunities for children to acquire the skills needed to be productive when they join the
labor force. On the one hand, Côte d’Ivoire needs to rapidly overhaul its education system to have an impact on

the ﬂow of incoming youths joining the labor force. On the other hand, interventions in the post-school training
areas can provide opportunities for the current workforce to effectively upgrade their skills.
Continued efforts are needed to ensure universal access to primary and secondary education.
Fundamental skills such as literacy and numeracy obtained through primary education are important for house-
hold enterprise activities and agriculture, the largest sectors of employment in the economy. Numeracy skills
enable individuals to better manage their ﬁnances and literacy can help them participate more effectively in
markets. Fundamental skills such as numeracy and literacy are also prerequisites for achievements at higher levels
of education and for access to higher skill occupations. Yet currently approximately 55 percent of 15–34-year-
olds in Côte d’Ivoire have incomplete or no primary education. The situation is particularly worrisome among
females and in rural locations, where 64 percent and 71 percent have incomplete or no primary education. This
contrasts with other emerging economies such as Nigeria and Indonesia, where among 20–64-year-olds, 38
percent and 13 percent have incomplete or no primary education, relative to 67 percent in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2015,
the government declared schooling compulsory for children up to age 16. Addressing access and enrollment in
both primary and secondary school remains an important policy consideration to accelerate the effective imple-
mentation of the compulsory schooling laws and ensure that all children are effectively enrolled and attending
school. Supporting complete enrollment will require signiﬁcant investments to meet a substantial increase in
coverage. The move to make secondary education compulsory will help youth better transition into the formal
sector where secondary education is often the minimum educational attainment required to access wage jobs.
Human capital projections for Côte  d’Ivoire show that achieving universal primary education
(Millennium Development Goal 2) by 2020, will reduce the incidence of youth entering the labor force
without having completed the primary cycle by 12 percentage points (from 23 percent to 11 percent)
and eliminate the share of those entering the labor force with no education by 2025. Figure 6.28 shows
the projection of the education composition of youth ages 15–24 with regard to educational attainment by 2045
under two scenarios: (a) the trend of dropout and retention remains the same until 2045 and (b) the MDG of
universal primary education is achieved by 2020 (see Annex E for details on methodology). The ﬁrst scenario
assumes that no major investment or reform takes place to change the trend of the current retention rates at all
levels of the education cycle; the second is the more ambitious yet achievable assumption that the MDG is met
by 2020 with major investments and reforms in education.111 These projections highlight how the composition of
tomorrow’s workforce can be modiﬁed dramatically if major investments and reforms are undertaken today. For
instance, if the current trend persists, about 18 percent of youth aged 15–24 will the enter labor force without
completing primary by 2030. But achievement of MDG Goal 2 by 2020 will ensure that all youth at labor force
entry age have completed primary education by 2030.
If current trends persist, with transition rates remaining as they were in 2015, close to 27 percent of
youth ages 15–24 would enter the labor force by 2045 without completing primary education or with
no education. In contrast, if the MDG were to be met by 2020 with sufﬁcient investments in the educational
system, all youth will enter the labor force having completed primary education by 2030. The latter scenario
also means that 41 percent would have completed primary education by the same time, compared with just 20
percent under the former scenario (see Figure 6.28).
If MDGs are met by 2020, a greater share of the youth will have completed upper-secondary or had
some higher education. Under this scenario, by 2045, about 60 percent of the youth will have completed
lower- or upper-secondary and 11 percent would have some higher education compared to 48 percent and 4
percent, respectively, under the base scenario. These projections highlight the effect of short-term policy actions
on long-term human capital stock and workforce skill, which is key to maintain competitiveness both in the
region and internationally.
At the same time, improvements in the quality of basic education services are critical and urgent.
Increases in access will not be sufﬁcient if not accompanied by strong measures to ensure that children are

effectively learning and acquiring skills while in school. While more years of education is usually positive, without
increases in learning outcomes, the results can become meaningless. As highlighted in Chapter 5, labor productivity
is key to ensure labor costs are competitive and for the continued expansion of formal enterprises. In this respect,
results from resent PASEC data on the skills of children throughout the education system are concerning. PASEC
data from 2009 and 2014 suggest that the quality of education in Côte d’Ivoire, measured in terms of test scores
in French and Math, is below that of other Francophone African countries. These results point to strong skills gaps
among children, which can have long-lasting consequences and limit the competitiveness of the future workforce.
As access to basic education continues to improve, Côte d’Ivoire can also prepare to have a more
performing higher education system. In that regard, one key challenge is to ensure that students acquire
the skills needed for productive employment, including those demanded by companies. For higher education
institutions to provide professional skills, governance reform including the setup of performance-based ﬁnancing
and public-private partnerships would need to be considered and effectively implemented. In many ways, such
reforms are important to put in place before expansion to access is tackled.
Ensuring access to skills upgrading opportunities for youths and adults who already exited the educa-
tion system is challenging, particularly because so many have low educational attainment and limited
skills to start with. For this subgroup, the role for public intervention is not necessarily conﬁned to the direct
provision of training. Facilitation of access and incentivizing of quality improvements in existing private training
opportunities can be considered as well. For instance, traditional apprenticeship is one of the most prevalent
source of training opportunities. Rather than replacing these traditional apprenticeships and attempting to set up
a parallel publicly managed system, existing private informal apprenticeship arrangements could be leveraged.
For example, the setup of certiﬁcation frameworks allowing apprentices to take exams and become certiﬁed
could be linked to ﬁnancial incentives for trainers whose apprentices succeed at these exams. The setup of such
an approach is not without challenges, but it would allow building on the widespread private apprenticeship
system rather than attempting to replace it.
On the other hand, the current professional training system is inadequate, with many poor-perform-
ing institutions. One of the issues is that few professional training opportunities are available to low-skilled
individuals, including those with less than primary or secondary education. Yet a large share of the labor
force that requires skills upgrading have very limited formal education. This population could be better served,


                                                                                                                                        159
including with more tailored curriculum allowing basic certiﬁcation in certain technical areas in relatively short
periods of times (for example, 6 to 18 months depending on the ﬁeld). Such an approach would also provide
opportunities to incentivize linkages between professional training institutions and private-led apprenticeship
arrangements. At the same time, professional training opportunities are insufﬁcient in some sectors, including
those where most of the population is employed, such as agriculture. Professionalization of training in the
traditional sectors may provide better prospects that development of training for sectors considered promising,
but that have very limited labor shares (such as mining or extractive industries).
While most new jobs in the near future are expected to be generated outside agriculture, it currently
occupies four out of ﬁve rural workers and close to half of the total labor force. Raising productivity
in agriculture requires developing a rural workforce of better-educated farmers. Better-educated farmers are
more likely to adopt modern farm inputs and technologies, make better use of purchased inputs and labor,
choose technologies more effectively, and respond rapidly to changes in markets (Schultz 1988; Filmer et al.
2014). Improving the levels of basic educational attainment, through the development of reading, writing, and
numeracy skills among the rural workforce, the efﬁcacy of agricultural training can be signiﬁcantly improved.
And as rural incomes increase and technology innovations are adopted in agriculture, the demand for schooling
and more technical skills will rise. This will include the ability to use digital technology to access and interpret
information as it may be transformative in how farmers learn to interact optimally with markets and receive
information, such as weather predictions, that impact their farming decisions (Box 6.1).


BOX 6.1: INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES: ALTERING THE FLOW
OF AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION
For African farmers operating in an environment of rapid climatic and economic change, the age-old questions
of what to plant, when to plant, and how to plant have assumed immense importance. Answers are proliferating,
as rural radio, television, the Internet, and mobile services oﬀer an expanding array of information about speciﬁc
technologies and practices, climate change, disaster management, early warning (for drought, ﬂoods, and diseases),
prices, natural resource management, production eﬃciency, and market access (World Bank 2012a).
Researchers are rigorously testing the eﬀectiveness of diﬀerent information and communication technologies (ICTs)
at reaching and beneﬁting farmers, focusing primarily on the transmission of price information, although initial
studies on the provision of weather information are also underway. Radio, a long-standing method of communi-
cating with farmers, has helped them to obtain better farm-gate prices by providing information on commodity
prices. Internet stations with agricultural market information (e-Choupals) have done the same in Madhya Pradesh,
India. Mobile phones have allowed ﬁshermen and onshore buyers in Kerala, India, to communicate supply and price
information, resulting in higher proﬁts, lower consumer prices, and less waste. Among grain traders in Niger, the
introduction of mobile phone coverage in two markets reduced the price variation between the two, ultimately
increasing traders’ proﬁts, decreasing prices paid by consumers, and increasing total welfare. Cell phone coverage
also reduced within-year price variation for producers.
For newer ICTs such as mobile phones and the Internet to convey agricultural information eﬀectively, the content
and mode of delivery may need to change, but what about the users themselves? Much has been made of young
people’s ready adoption of newer ICTs, as well as the capacity of ICTs (newer and older) to break through barriers to
the acquisition of information and skills, such as distance, the inability to read and write, or the expense of producing
and disseminating audiovisual information. Much has also been made of the potential for interactive ICTs to provide
agricultural recommendations tailored to an individual farmer’s circumstances. Yet much depends on whether the
individual user of ICTs is able to frame relevant questions based on learning acquired in good primary schools, coupled
with practice in imagining states of the world other than those already experienced. As discussed in this chapter,
educational systems need to deliver high-quality basic education, as well as increase enrollment. Among rural youths
who lack a basic cognitive foundation on which they can build, the beneﬁts of ICTs may be slower to emerge.

The majority of farmers, who have little education, will need access to effective agricultural extension
services to sharpen their skills, access information and new technology. Traditional extension services are
becoming less common across Africa, although the term is still used and applied to nontraditional approaches.
Newer approaches empower farmers, in particular female farmers, and can be used to foster a more demand-ori-
entated approach to learning where the farmers specify the information they require and select their provider
of training (as described in Box 6.2). Finally, a growing and diversifying agricultural sector will create jobs that
demand increasingly advanced technical and professional skills, from processing and marketing to agricultural
research as has been described in Chapter 2.


BOX 6.2: INNOVATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION: RELYING ON FARMERS TO
IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY
The question of whether agricultural extension services are best provided by the public sector (the traditional model),
the private sector, or a range of providers continues to generate debate in light of the mixed results obtained with
the traditional model.a This uncertainty has complicated eﬀorts to widen the adoption of improved agricultural
technologies and increase agricultural productivity. Newer models of extension, which are driven by farmers and
reinforce the quality of service delivery through incentives and other innovations, are proving more eﬀective than
traditional methods, but they too encounter diﬃculties and constraints to eﬀectiveness.
The impact of innovative approaches that mobilize farmers to improve returns to agricultural extension was recently
evaluated on a large scale. In Malawi and Mozambique, randomized controlled trials tested multiple modalities for
implementing peer and lead farming. In both experiments, communities nominated lead or peer farmers, who were
trained to use sustainable land management techniques and mandated to communicate those techniques to other
farmers in their village through demonstrations.
In Malawi, the social status (peer versus lead) and gender of the communicator were subject to random assignment,
and a small performance-based material incentive was given to a subset of the communicators. The project desig-
nated ‘shadow’ communicators in control villages to provide a counterfactual. In Mozambique, lead farmers — mostly
men — were already designated by the project team in all project villages at baseline. The intervention trained a random
subset of these lead farmers in sustainable land management. To add a gender variation, a woman lead farmer was
added to a random subset of treatment villages, since it was not possible to demote the previously chosen communi-
cator. Small performance-based material and social incentives were distributed to a subset of the treatment villages.
The results from these large pilots suggest that female farmers can be as productive as male farmers in teaching their
peers about a new technology and getting them to adopt it. Adding a woman communicator to a male-centered model
for delivering extension advice can add value and change the numbers of male and female beneﬁciaries. Evidence on
the use of performance-based incentives suggests that providing service to the community is more costly for women
leaders, as they are more responsive to incentives. Finally, despite performing as well as, and in some cases better than,
male communicators, female communicators still suﬀer from discrimination and are rated as worse teachers than men.
Overall, these results suggest that development projects that place the adoption of new agricultural techniques at
the center of their theory of change may consider using peer and lead farming interventions to boost their returns.
Given that female leaders appear to be as productive as male leaders in getting farmers to learn about and adopt
new techniques, empowering women to take on leadership roles may not only increase equity but also add value.
Performance-based incentives can play an important role in getting women leaders to devote additional time and
eﬀort to working with their community.

Note (a): For example, Birkhaeuser, Evenson, and Feder (1991) found no signiﬁcant relationship between the provision of traditional exten-
sion services and farm productivity in Africa, whereas Evenson (2001) and Dercon et al. (2009) identiﬁed some successes. Anderson and
Feder (2003) propose an organizational inquiry into which model of extension (public or private) can deliver superior results.

With nonagricultural self-employment and work in household enterprises emerging as one of the
key contributors to the generation of new jobs, it is important to consider the government’s role in
equipping the workforce with the right skills for this sector. Evidence is still emerging on which skills are
most useful in the household enterprise sector as well as how to cost-effectively develop these skills through
large-scale programs. For example, it is not clear whether technical or vocational skills can necessarily lead to
employment in a skilled profession, nor whether business or behavioral skills are the most binding constraint
to household entrepreneurs when many other constraints, such as access to credit or freedom to operate, are
known to exist. And even once a clearer understanding is developed on which skills are most important, it should
also be recognized that training programs are not always effective or efﬁcient at delivering these skills, even
though programs may be well-funded and politically supported (Blattman and Ralston 2015). Finding a training
program model that maintains high participation rates and delivers the skills that participants both want and
need for their work has been notoriously difﬁcult to implement in practice. Recent work, as described in Box
6.3, suggests that given these caveats it may be best to provide skill development programs through a more
demand-focused and results-driven approach, whereby individuals can seek out an integrate range of skills that
are most important to them and programs are funded based on meeting these needs.


BOX 6.3: ENTERPRISE PROJECTS BOLSTER SKILLS AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN
SENEGAL AND NEPAL
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) supports rural enterprise projects to provide the skills and
other resources that help rural people, especially women and young people, to create and develop local businesses
that provide income and employment oﬀ the farm. Projects may include the following components:
¬ Business advisory centers provide a range of business development services, including business orientation
    seminars, community-based skills training, small business management training, literacy and numeracy
    training, and information and referral services.
¬   Rural technology facilities support master-craftspersons, traditional apprenticeships, and the promotion,
    dissemination, production, and repair of technology for rural HEs and microenterprises.
¬   Rural ﬁnancial services, oﬀered in conjunction with ﬁnancial institutions, include credit for on-lending to
    small rural businesses and training for ﬁnancial institutions to provide ﬁnancial services to vulnerable groups.
¬   Support for rural household and microenterprise organizations includes support for local trade associations
    to build partnerships with stakeholders and support for formulating and strengthening polices through a
    working group on enterprise development.
In Africa, IFAD has implemented rural enterprise projects in Ghana, Madagascar, Rwanda, and Senegal. Impacts and
challenges of projects in Senegal are highlighted here.
The Promotion of Rural Entrepreneurship (PROMER) Project in Senegal, implemented by IFAD in 2006, sought to
reduce rural poverty by fostering and consolidating proﬁtable rural HEs and microenterprises capable of oﬀering
stable jobs. PROMER focused on strengthening and professionalizing rural entrepreneurship and improving the
overall political, legal, and institutional environment for such enterprises. For its target population — rural youths
and women ages 18–35 who were poor, unemployed, and out of school and who either operated or wanted to start
an enterprise — PROMER provided a combination of technical and management training and funding. Technical
skills training primarily involved agribusiness, including food processing, and provided skills to 700 entrepreneurs
in metalworking, equipment manufacturing, textile and clothing production, and hygiene and quality monitoring.
Management training was provided to about 500 entrepreneurs. The project cost CFAF 10 billion from 2006 to 2013.
PROMER helped to create 240 enterprises, consolidate 665 enterprises, create 3,750 jobs, and teach 458 people to
read. It usually takes enterprises 3 to 5 years to reach their full potential, and ﬁnding a niche in the economy can
be critical for success. Through the project, for example, a baker started to make traditional bread, which was in
high demand in peri-urban areas but not supplied by modern bakeries. Apprentices trained informally by the baker
opened 20 enterprises of their own and created about 84 jobs. Other rural enterprises were not as successful. Some
developed products that succeeded in rural markets but not in urban markets because of high transport costs,
poor marketing, or poor quality. Most entrepreneurs reported challenges in maintaining quality and continuous
production. Rural enterprises had trouble ﬁnding an urban location in which to present their products, a result that

                                                                                                                          162
highlights the problem of multiple constraints. Exhibitions have played a major role in bringing some rural products
to a wider market, especially furniture, and have attracted better contracts that have led to modest job creation.
Elsewhere in Nepal, about 500,000 young people enter the Nepalese labor market every year and often move into the
household enterprise sector in rural locations. In 2007, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)
joined with HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation to train 100,000 youth of which 75,000 moved on to gainful employment
through a program named the Employment Fund. Training was oﬀered in about 80 occupations, for example, in con-
struction, hospitality, garments and textile, agriculture, and electronics — to name a few — in locations all over Nepal.
Unlike many other skills training programs, the program applies a results-based ﬁnancing approach that has proven
to eﬀectively lead to gainful employment upon the completion of training. Training providers are paid based on their
success in training youth and subsequently connecting them with the labor market. The key result is gainful employment.
How does that work? In practice this means that training providers receive one part of their payment (40 percent)
after the graduation of trainees. Then the biggest share of the payment (60 percent) is provided only if graduates
are placed in gainful employment and earn an income above a predeﬁned threshold. The program puts special
emphasis on the inclusion of women and disadvantaged groups, for instance, through incentives and counseling.
More than 50 percent of the trainees are women, and 80 percent are from disadvantaged communities.
The results: The program has provided skills training to over 100,000 youth. More than 75,000 of them are gainfully
employed. Skills training per trainee costs US$300 on average. This investment pays oﬀ: it only takes about six
months for trainees to earn this amount after graduation.

Beyond technical skills, avenues to improve business skills and behavioral skills need to be further
considered, both within and outside the education system. Technical skills are often the focus of public
and private training providers, but recent data show that behavioral skills and business skills are both relevant
for worker productivity and essential for success in self-employment or wage employment. However, different
individuals will have different requirements in the skills that they most need to develop: ﬁnancial accounting
may be important to one individual, while customer service skills and team experience may be important for
another individual. As discussed earlier, this implies that it is important to build ﬂexibility into skill development
programs that will enable participants to seek out the skills most useful for them, while also keeping programs
results driven with the end goals on increased employment and higher incomes.
Training on business and entrepreneurship skills could be piloted in the education system, but would
require careful attention to the curriculum content and the speciﬁc skills being transmitted, as well
as the level at which the training is provided. Recent international evidence suggests that entrepreneurship
education might be more effective earlier in the education system, with some positive results from its introduc-
tion in secondary school, but more mixed evidence when introduced in higher education. Still, the evidence
remains relatively thin, so these approaches should be carefully tested ﬁrst.
The acquisition of behavioral skills demanded by formal ﬁrms as well as conducive to success in
self-employment is an area of global policy interest. International evidence has suggested that behavioral
skills remain malleable for longer, providing opportunities to train youths even after they dropped out of school.
Evidence from Uganda or Liberia has suggested positive results of delivering behavioral skills training as a com-
plement to technical or business skills training, particularly for women (see Box 6.4). More recent approaches
attempt to leverage mentors or role models in behavioral skills training delivery. There again, careful attention
to the curriculum, as well as its delivery, would be essential.

BOX 6.4: LEARN. WORK. THRIVE: ADOLESCENT GIRLS INITIATIVE PILOTS HELP
YOUNG WOMEN TRANSITION TO PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT
More than one-third of all youth are not in employment, education, or training (NEET) and across all regions of the
world young women are worse oﬀ than young men. Although the gender gap in school enrollment has been closing,
these gains have not yet translated into gains in secure, paid employment. Reaching girls during adolescence is
critical because decisions made and behaviors established during this period aﬀect their horizons later in life. To
this end the World Bank launched the Adolescent Girls Initiative (AGI) to understand how to help young women
transition to productive employment and has now implemented pilots in Afghanistan, Haiti, Jordan, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, and South Sudan.
One of the ﬁrst pilots in Liberia trained about 2,500 young women for either wage employment or self-employment plus
life skills, with an emphasis on job placement and follow-up support. The evaluation of the project shows that employment
rose by 47 percent while earnings increased by about US$32 per month — an 80 percent increase relative to the control
group. The impacts were larger for the self-employment track than for the wage employment track, but both show much
larger impacts than seen in other youth skills training programs that have been rigorously evaluated to date globally.
Overall, the AGI has demonstrated ways to make skills training more female-friendly and support young women’s
transition to productive employment. In addition to all the lessons about working with young women, the pilots also
taught a lot about how to improve the overall quality of skills training.

The ﬁve quality enh.ancement lessons, along with links to more information, can be summarized as:
     Lesson 1: Skills training projects need to set realistic expectations for self-employment versus wage employment.
     In contexts with limited opportunities for wage employment, skills training projects should help orient youth to
     the likelihood of self-employment and develop content suitable to diﬀerent levels of aspiration in that sphere.
     In Liberia, for example, a job skills track and a business skills track were oﬀered. The size of the job skills track
     had to be gradually reduced from 35 percent of trainees in Round 1 to just 18 percent in Round 3 after the
     impact evaluation showed that the employment rate in the business skills track was much stronger. This was
     not easy — it involved changing the orientation of the client, the training providers, and the girls themselves.
     Lesson 2: Involving the private sector can improve the market relevance and overall eﬀectiveness of training.
     AGI pilots partnered with the private sector in the implementation arrangements by hiring private companies
     to provide training tailored to the needs of a speciﬁc ﬁrm/sector — as in the Rwanda AGI — and by hiring private
     sector training and employment service companies to deliver training and assist with job placement — as in Haiti,
     Liberia, and Nepal. Low-cost steps were also taken to engage the private sector throughout implementation. For
     example, the Liberia AGI organized Private Sector Working Groups to provide routine guidance on project activities
     and enlisted members of the private sector to inspire the trainees by serving as guest speakers in the classroom.
     Lesson 3: Post-training support is critical and must be planned and budgeted for early on. Even getting the
     training up and running always seems like priority number one, but over the course of implementing the AGI
     pilots one of the lessons learned was that it was necessary to do a better job planning and budgeting for more
     structured and intensive post-training support from the very beginning of each project. The AGI pilots provided
     3–6 months of post-training job placement assistance — such as internships, job search coaching, and so
     on — or business advisory services — such as business mentoring and check-ins, linkages to micro-franchises
     and business capital, and so on. The exact balance of classroom training versus placement support has not
     been rigorously tested, but our experience suggests this support can really help trainees put their new skills
     to use in the labor market. An extended follow-up period may be particularly important for young women just
     entering the labor market or breaking into non-traditional trades.
     Lesson 4: Improving the monitoring and veriﬁcation of employment outcomes is essential if we want to
     improve employment outcomes in skills training projects. Many projects do not monitor attendance or per-
     formance during training, let alone keep track of participants after training ends. AGI pilots monitored business
     and job performance and veriﬁed employment outcomes up to six months after classroom training ended.
     The pilots relied on self-reporting by service providers, then veriﬁed these claims among a random sample of


                                                                                                                             164
     trainees (about 25 percent) by talking with employers, local women, and community members, and by accessing
     the trainee’s business records. The percentage of employed youth in the sample was then extrapolated to the
     population that the training provider claimed to be employed. In Liberia and Nepal, where pilots implemented
     results-based contracts, this extrapolation was used as a basis for the ﬁnal payment. Any inaccurate claims
     by training providers proportionally reduced their payment and could jeopardize eligibility for future rounds of
     training. In the Resource Guide (http://www.s4ye.org/agi), you can download the employment/business veriﬁ-
     cation strategy from the Liberia AGI, as well as tools for monitoring and placement veriﬁcation.
     Lesson 5: Performance-based incentives are operationally feasible — even in fragile settings — and seem to
     improve outcomes, though this is an area for more rigorous testing. Results-based contracts were used for
     training providers in the relatively small program in Liberia, targeting 2,500 young women, as well as in the Nepal
     AGI, which was embedded in a larger program that trains 15,000 youth annually. Both projects achieved impressive
     results and we hypothesize that the performance incentives for the service providers accounts for this in part.

ANNEX E:
HUMAN CAPITAL PROJECTIONS: ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGIES
The human capital projections performed for this chapter closely follow the International Institute for Applied
Systems Analysis’ (IIASA) methods of population projections in terms of required variables, as determined by
Population Development Environment (PDE) software. The analysis was limited to two scenarios: (a) the constant
scenario, in which the trend of drop-out and retention rates remains the same until 2045, under the assump-
tion that no investments or reforms have taken place to alter the trends and (b) MDG attainment, in which the
MDG of universal primary education is met by 2020 — the Government of Côte d’Ivoire targeted MDG by 2022.
To conduct a projection of educational attainment, a baseline population distribution must ﬁrst be generated
by 5-year age groups, sex, and level of educational attainment. The projection in this chapter used the 2008
and 2015 national household surveys, with a base year of 2015. The model likewise requires that (a) for each
5-year increment, cohorts move to the next highest 5-year age group, (b) mortality rates speciﬁc to age, sex, and
education group are applied to each period, (c) age- and sex-speciﬁc educational transition rates are applied,
(d) age-, sex-, and education-speciﬁc net migrants are added or removed from the population, and (e) fertility
rates speciﬁc to age, sex, and education groups are used to determine the size of the newest 0–5 age group.
The projection in Côte d’Ivoire was constructed based on the below assumptions.
        Migration: The effect of migration was not considered in the projection of education of the labor force, as
        Côte d’Ivoire had a small net migration rate, of 0.47 immigrants/1,000 as of 2015,112 and the gross migra-
        tion rate is less than 2.2 percent (International Organization for Migration). The demographic background
        of emigrants and immigrants are likewise similar as they typically come from neighboring countries and do
        not signiﬁcantly affect the education proﬁle of the labor force.
        Mortality: As complete death registration data is often unavailable in developing countries, this chapter
        adopts the census survival approach to overcome the limitation (UN 2002). Data from the 2008 and 2015
        national household surveys were used as an input into the UN’s life table model to estimate age-speciﬁc
        mortality rates. For life expectancy, differences estimated by Barakat et al. (2010) were adopted for each
        education level, and the model suggested that education was positively associated with longer life expec-
        tancy. A similar methodology applied to the education system in Côte d’Ivoire led to the assumption that
        life expectancy increases with education by one year for each level of education, that is, none, incomplete
        primary, completed primary, completed lower-secondary, and completed upper-secondary.
        Fertility: For this projection, fertility is considered as a demographic determinant of the projected educa-
        tional proﬁle. Age-speciﬁc fertility rates (ASFRs) were calculated by identifying live births that occurred in
        the 3 years preceding the survey and classifying them by the age of the mother (in 5-year age groups) at the
        time of birth, using data from the 2012 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Côte d’Ivoire. Total fertility
        rates (TFR) refer to the number of live births a woman would have if she were subject to the current ASFRs
        for the duration of her reproductive years (15–49 years), and was likewise estimated using the 2012 DHS.
        Transition: Transition rates were calculated based on the assumption that transitions take place between
        educational levels with the possibility of repetition, but with no reverse transition. This rate was based on
        UNESCO’s formula which used age-grade enrollment patterns. To account for age distortions that arose
        from late entry, a remedial method suggested by IIASA was adopted, which states that the transition rate
        from one level of education to another is distributed by the proportion of age groups relevant to that same
        education level. Detailed procedures can be referenced from Lutz et al. (2007, 2010).
        Age: Five-year age increments groups were used as an input to IIASA’s population projection model for
        Côte d’Ivoire. Given the gap between entry in primary school and labor market entry (approximately 7–10
        years), the projection in this chapter begins in 2015 so that the current stock of human capita is reﬂected,
        while the full impact of policy scenarios can be observed in 2030.
