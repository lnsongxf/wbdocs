  Abstract
 This paper studies long-term impacts of violent conflict,                          and investment. Both channels display wide variation across
 to provide insights into the costs of conflict and policies                        recovery episodes, and are capable of large surges, which can
 to prevent conflict relapse. The findings link evidence on                         in some cases generate rapid recoveries. Where recoveries
 the contemporaneous effects of conflict with its persistent                        lack buoyancy—which is the case for many post-conflict
 impact, especially by combining multiple data sources                              episodes—deeper political constraints appear to be at work,
 such as night lights, indicators of political exclusion, and                       which may ultimately relate to the effectiveness of power
 nutrition. There is a strong level effect on output arising                        sharing. Finally, to highlight the need for more effective

1       Introduction
The danger of internal conﬂict and its potential importance for the process of economic
and social development hardly needs emphasis. The set of countries which are failing
most chronically to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) consists dispro-
portionately of conﬂict-aﬀected states. This has been recognized by the international
community and the analysis of, and initiatives for, fragile and conﬂict-aﬀected states
(FCS) have been growing rapidly. In addition to addressing drivers of conﬂict and
fragility these initiatives, so is the hope, should improve economic development.
    This report tries to understand why some countries fail to recover from conﬂict.
In other words, our goal is to understand how conﬂict aﬀects economic development
beyond the conﬂict period. This is a diﬃcult task. There is most likely a two-way
relationship between conﬂict and development, which has been captured by the idea
of a “conﬂict trap”.1 In addition, there are also factors that impact both conﬂict and
development. Besley and Persson (2008), for example, argue both theoretically and
empirically that the countries aﬀected by internal conﬂicts are those that invest less in
state capacity. In their analysis, low state capacity, conﬂict and lack of development are
driven by factors like the abundance of natural resources and weak political institutions.
The problem of policies for recovery is therefore not only to address diﬀerent channels
through which conﬂict impacts the economy in the long run but to address other
elements which both inhibit development and lead to conﬂict. In short, the two-way
relationship between conﬂict and development and the multitude of confounding factors
such as state capacity make it impossible to develop policy without a clear idea of the
mechanisms at play.
    The aim of this report is not to re-invent the wheel. There is a lot of previous
work in this area which has been summarized, for example, in the World Development
Report 2011 (WDR). The report analyzes the spurs of violence in FCS and explains why
recovery from conﬂict is hard to address. The core message of the WDR is that in order
to break the vicious cycle of violence, FCS should strengthen legitimate institutions
and restore citizen security, justice and job opportunities.
    We add to this through the lens of the most recent wave of research in the area.
The backbone to our analysis is the analysis of the contemporaneous eﬀect of conﬂict
which we present in section 2. We show, using standard panel ﬁxed eﬀect regressions,
that economic growth during conﬂict incidence is signiﬁcantly lower. This is true both
at the country and ethnic group levels. Local disruptions of the economy in conﬂict
seem to play an important role in this loss.
    In section 3 we argue that this impact is also crucial to understand the lack of long
term development in FCS. FCS grow as fast as other countries outside the conﬂict
period, i.e. average growth is not signiﬁcantly lower before a renewed outbreak of
conﬂict. Peace stability is therefore a key factor in explaining a lack of long term
    1
    This is the core idea that supports the World Bank Policy Research Report provided by Collier
et al. (2003). The authors summarize the idea of conﬂict trap as a situation where if development
succeeds, countries become progressively safer from violent conﬂict, making subsequent development
easier. While where development fails, countries are at high risk of becoming caught in a conﬂict trap
in which war wrecks the economy and increases the risk of further war.
development. These ﬁndings are somewhat contradictory to the idea of a conﬂict trap
in which lack of growth and conﬂict reinforce each other. A good development policy
in this context is policy that helps avoid violent conﬂict.
    The remaining sections build on these ﬁndings. In sections 4 and 5 we argue that
the humanitarian crisis triggered by civil war could impact the recovery period in
ways that are not measurable in standard panel regressions. Section 4 discusses the
close relationship between violence and refugees. In the average civil war year, around
500,000 persons leave their country. This is an important ﬁnding as it gives an idea of
the scale of the humanitarian crisis entailed by mass violence. In section 5 we use the
ﬁndings of a relatively new literature to argue that long term labor productivity and,
hence, recovery might be strongly aﬀected through permanent losses in human capital
due to exposure to conﬂict.
    In section 6 we argue that if countries are known to revert to conﬂict this will hin-
der investment. We know from enterprise surveys that ﬁrms react strongly to political
instability. The expectation of future instability will therefore be a critical element in
their decision making. We show in this context that political inclusion and returning
refugees can predict inﬂows of foreign investment in the critical phase after conﬂict. A
causal link is harder to establish here but it seems reasonable to assume that commit-
ments to political inclusion might play a key role in attracting investment.
    Section 7 turns towards a detailed discussion of political exclusion as a factor of
instability. We focus on a channel that has been proposed by the recent literature in this
area. In absence of strong political institutions, political exclusion matters because it
leads to an unequal distribution of economic resources. We ﬁnd quite striking evidence
for this. In addition, we ﬁnd that formal institutions matter in how political power is
reﬂected in economic well-being. These ﬁndings are very much in line with the idea
that political institutions help avoid conﬂict because they prevent a “winner takes all”
dynamic in which loss of political power leads to economic decline.
    Section 8 concludes. In this section we present additional conclusions that arise
from our ﬁndings and the related literature.

2       Conﬂict and Economic Growth
Civil wars aﬀect economic conditions in two stages: during conﬂict and during the post-
war period. We start our analysis by exploring the ﬁrst stage, i.e. the relationship
between violence and economic activity during conﬂict. We then turn towards the
recovery from conﬂict. It turns out that the contemporaneous cost of conﬂict is essential
to comprehend the observed lack of long term development in FCS. This is because
many FCS do not experience stable peace. Economic recovery happens on average but
it does not last long enough. This is why understanding the contemporaneous eﬀects
of conﬂict is essential to understand long term development.
    However, the direct economic cost of conﬂict incidence is not the only channel
through which civil wars impact the development of the aﬀected territories. In this
report we explore two ways in which the detrimental eﬀects of conﬂict spread to the
recovery period: the humanitarian crisis triggered by wars (sections 4 and 5) and the
contraction of investments due to instability (section 6). Both of these eﬀects will force
growth in the recovery period downwards. This is important as it indicates that the
contemporaneous eﬀects we turn towards now might be an underestimate.
    The macroeconomic impact of civil wars has been studied extensively. Collier (1999)
analyzes the eﬀects of violence on GDP growth using cross-county data on internal wars
which occurred between 1960 and 1992. He ﬁnds that civil conﬂict is correlated with a
contemporaneous reduction of GDP per capita growth of 2.2 percent.2 On a regional
level, Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) investigate the economic eﬀect of the Basque
terror campaign and estimate a reduction of the GDP per capita of approximately 10
percent.
    There are several channels through which violence retards development. During
conﬂict there is a direct cost caused by the destruction of resources that would have been
employed in production. This directly impacts contemporaneous economic performance
in the aﬀected territory and can aﬀect recovery as well. In addition, the economic
activity of countries involved in civil conﬂicts is damaged indirectly by an increase
in production costs and insecurity in transport. Fear spreads the economic costs of
conﬂict. We will show, for example, that the number of people running away from
violence is far larger than the number of fatalities. Apart from this very direct impact
of fear there are several indirect eﬀects including the deviation of resources towards
armament or the faltering of investment due to a lack of perspective. All these ideas
have been explored in the academic literature.3
    In what follows we will take an agnostic view regarding the channel through which
the contemporaneous eﬀect of violence on growth arises. Instead, we will simply look
at correlates at the country and ethnic group level. It is nonetheless an important
question whether the eﬀect of violence is coming from the local level or whether the
main channel is the political and state crisis that coincides with civil war. We will turn
towards this ﬁrst.
    2
    This eﬀect is comparable to estimates we compute and discuss in this section.
    3
    See Blattman and Miguel (2010) for a review of the literature. Mueller (2013) provides a recent
review of the literature on the economic costs of violence.

2.1     The Per Capita Model of Violence
Assumptions regarding the main channels through which violence aﬀects the economy
have a direct impact on how the issue needs to be investigated empirically - even at the
macro level. If local eﬀects drive the economic costs of conﬂict then we expect countries
with high per capita violence to suﬀer most economically. If macro eﬀects are most
important, the economy of the whole country will be aﬀected by local violence. The
economic impact of a fatality would then be independent of population size. In other
words, if violence was only a sign of a national fragility which also aﬀected the economy
then we would expect that the same intensity of violence in India and Nicaragua have
the same growth eﬀect. At the same time, local and macro eﬀects call for diﬀerent
policy responses. If eﬀects are predominantly, local then the policy response should
also have a strong local element.
    There are good reasons to believe that both channels are active. Ksoll et al. (2009),
for example, provide an example of local eﬀects in their study of election violence in
Kenya. Their paper provides direct evidence for the increase in labor costs that occur
due to local violence risk. In a recent working paper Amodio and Di Maio (2014)
also provide evidence for similar increases in costs due to break-down in transportation
links caused by violence locally. At the same time the disruption of transport will aﬀect
international trade. Blomberg and Hess (2006) argue that the presence of violence is
equivalent to a 30 percent tariﬀ on trade. Martin et al. (2008) estimate a reduction of
trade with conﬂict of between 20 and 25 percent. In addtion, there are direct state level
eﬀects as well. Collier et al. (2003), for example, show that during civil war countries
increase their military expenditure from 2.8 to 5 percent of GDP. Mueller (2016) argues
that if this is the main channel in which violence aﬀects the economy then it could be
regarded as a pure public bad at the country level. All inhabitants of the country will
suﬀer from the distortion in budgets regardless of their direct exposure to violence or
the population size of the country. However, it can be shown that a per capita model
of violence leads to a better description of the impact of conﬂict on the economy.
    Figure 1 demonstrates that aggregate growth changes with the per capita intensity
of violence. It displays growth averages for diﬀerent levels of violence intensity con-
trolling for country and year ﬁxed eﬀects. Violence intensity in the graph is displayed
as the number of battle-related deaths from UCDP/PRIO per 1000 population.4 Each
observation in the ﬁgure contains 10 percent of all country/year observations which
experienced some violence. The observation at the far right contains the years with
the most intense violence. These countries experienced extreme levels of violence with
more than 2 fatalities per 1000 population (0.002 fatalities per capita). In this group
growth was 5.2 percentage points lower compared to average growth during peacetime
in the same country. Growth in the three next most aﬀected groups was about 3 per-
centage points lower, despite the fact that violence per capita in these groups was only
around 0.2 fatalities per 1000 population. Below this intensity, the eﬀect of violence on
growth cannot be distinguished from zero with this data. A populous country like In-
dia, for example, can grow seemingly uninhibited by constant violence on its territory.
   4
    For a data description see the appendix. The most intense civil war in this regard took place in
the Lebanon which experienced more than 20 fatalities per 1000 population.

                                                 7
However, local economic eﬀects could be just as strong.


                          Figure 1: Violence per Capita and Growth




    The main insight from Figure 1 is that per capita violence provides a good ap-
proximation of the impact of violence on growth which comes mainly from the local
level. New data from the UCDP GED and G-Econ projects for the African continent
allows us to provide even more direct evidence for this. Mueller (2016) shows, using
this data, that the growth damage of violence can be traced to 100kmx100km cells.
Each year with violence in such a cell reduces growth in the cell by more than 2 per-
centage points. High intensity violence of 100+ fatalities reduces growth by about 5.8
percentage points locally.5 At this level, violence seems to be a pure public bad, i.e.
the population size within the cell does not aﬀect how much damage a fatality does to
the economy. An easy way to understand the magnitudes involved here is to go back
to the country level and to use the data on locally aﬀected population from the micro
data.



   In Figure 2 we show the result. The x-axis displays the share of the population in a
country aﬀected by 100+ fatalities in their cell. Again, we generate ten groups deﬁned
   5
    These results are derived with cell and year ﬁxed eﬀects so that omitted variable bias is less likely
to drive the result.
                                                   8
          Figure 2: Locally Aﬀected Population and Growth (African Countries)




by this measure and see how growth in these groups changes with increasing violence
intensity. The group of the 10 percent most aﬀected countries had over 65 percent of
their population aﬀected by violence in the same cell. Growth in these countries was
in free fall - their economies grew by almost 9 percentage points less than average.
    Figure 2 reveals that there is an almost linear relationship between the country
growth rate and the share of population aﬀected by violence locally. As the locally
aﬀected population increases, so does the damage to growth associated with conﬂict.
This suggests that understanding the local impact of violence is therefore key to under-
standing its overall impact. An absolute count of fatalities is then a misleading measure
of violence intensity. Throughout this report we will use this insight and approximate
conﬂict intensity not through fatality counts but through fatality per capita counts.

2.2       Conﬂict Incidence and Economic Performance
As a ﬁrst step into the analysis we run standard panel regressions of growth on conﬂict
incidence. For this purpose we assemble three indicators of country-level economic
performance during the post War World II period. The ﬁrst and the second indices
are GDP per capita growth computed using data provided respectively by Penn World
Tables and World Bank Open Data. The third proxy for economic activity is given
by per capita growth of night light, computed using satellite data from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).6 Night light data has the beneﬁt
  6
      Satellite data is available for a shorter time period, 1992-2013.


                                                     9
of being available on a yearly basis independently of the quality of local statistical
oﬃces and data gathering. While it comes with its own problems it can shed light on
local economic activity where gathering of statistical data is incomplete.7 This makes
it a great ﬁt for measuring growth in a context of civil conﬂict. Conﬂict incidence is
measured through the number of battle-related deaths from UCDP/PRIO dataset.
    We run the following regression for country i at time t:

                               git = β × incidenceit + µi + ηt +        it                           (1)

where git is economic performance per capita growth of country i in year t, incidenceit
is conﬂict incidence, µi and ηt are respectively country and year ﬁxed eﬀects.
    A cross-country analysis as in equation (1) bears considerable potential for both
reverse causality and omitted variable bias. Thus, a priori, a convincing causal link is
hard to establish. However, here we expect the resulting bias to be small for two rea-
sons. First, the cross-country literature has not found that negative, contemporaneous
shocks to growth systematically lead to violence.8 Second, we have run a large number
of robustness checks by adding time trends or lagged growth to our speciﬁcation and
controlling for rainfall shocks directly.9 The upshot from this is not only that results
remain signiﬁcant but also that the estimated coeﬃcients barely change. This does
not mean that a causal link from falling growth to conﬂict can be ruled out. But it is
unlikely to drive the macro relationship we see in the data.
    In order to further explore the relationship between violence and country-level out-
put we run two speciﬁcations of the model described above. In the ﬁrst model conﬂict
in country i at time t is deﬁned by any violence, i.e. if at least one battle related deaths
occurs. In the second speciﬁcation, conﬂict is deﬁned by a higher threshold, by 0.008
deaths per 1000 population.10
    We expect to get diﬀerent results from the two speciﬁcations. From the analysis
of Figure 1 we know that economic damage of civil war increases with the severity of
conﬂict. The estimated impact from the second model should therefore be more acute.
    Table 1, panel A and B, reports the results. Each column contains one of our
measures for economic growth. In all speciﬁcations, conﬂict incidence correlates nega-
tively with country-level economic performance. The estimated coeﬃcients of conﬂict
incidence are statistically signiﬁcant and negative. We also ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients
   7
      For a discussion see Henderson et al. (2012). In order to calculate light per capita we use popu-
lation data that is provided by a World Bank dataset.
    8
      The standard reference here is Miguel et al. (2004). Ciccone (2011) shows that high rainfall levels
three years earlier seem to be best predictors of conﬂict in the reduced form. Miguel and Satyanath
(2011) argue that lagged negative growth shocks are a predictor of conﬂict onset. In any case, there
is no evidence from this literature that contemporaneous growth declines cause conﬂict. Bazzi and
Blattman (2014) corroborate the view that the relationship between income shocks and conﬂict is not
straightforward. They do not ﬁnd evidence of an eﬀect of price shocks on conﬂict onset and only weak
evidence on incidence.
    9
      Results from this are presented in the Appendix.
   10
      We take the threshold from Mueller (2016) who shows that a threshold like this leads to a similar
number of coded civil wars as the threshold of 1000 battle-related deaths often used in the conﬂict
literature. In the context here, this is a conservative approach as it is not the threshold which yields
the biggest diﬀerence between conﬂict and non-conﬂict countries.

                                                   10
reported in panel B are approximately twice as high (in absolute value) as the ones
shown in panel A.
    In Table 1 panel B we ﬁnd that the estimated coeﬃcients of the incidence variable
reported in columns (1) and (2) are fairly similar. According to these results, civil
conﬂict in country i at time t correlates negatively with GDP per capita growth which
ranges from 2 to 3 percentage points. In column (3) we use night light as an economic
indicator. The estimated eﬀect of conﬂict on night light is statistically signiﬁcant and
is equal to -0.075. What does this number mean in terms of GDP per capita growth?
One way to think about this is the estimates from Henderson et al. (2012) who argue
that the relationship between GDP and light can be expressed fairly well in a constant
elasticity model in which an increase of night light by 1 percent implies an increase of
GDP of about 0.25 percent. If we apply this model to our result from Table 1 panel
B, the conﬂict reduces GDP growth by almost 1.9 percentage points. This is strikingly
similar to the 2 percent found in column (1).

    Another way to understand the size of the decline in economic performance with
                                  ˆ in equation (1) to simulate how output in each
conﬂict is to use the estimate of β
country would have developed as a function of the number of years in which the country
was aﬀected by civil conﬂict. For the simulation we focus on the Post War Word II
period, i.e. 1946-2014 and count the number of years each country has been aﬀected
by conﬂict. Call this number Ti . In Table 1 panel B column (1) we estimated that
for each year a country is in conﬂict the GDP per capita will decrease by around 2
percentage points. From this we calculate the total loss for country i as
                                                ˆ)Ti − 1
                             OutputLossi = (1 + β

where βˆ is the estimate of the panel regression (1). This simulation predicts output,
had the country not experienced conﬂict but otherwise kept its growth path.
    The ﬁndings are displayed in Figure 3. Around 70 percent of countries hit by
conﬂict experienced only one or two years of high intensity violence which, according
to our estimates, would have directly lowered their output by 2 to 4 percentage points.
The remaining countries experienced conﬂict for a longer time period. Accordingly, the
total output loss in these groups ranges from around 10 to over 50 percentage points.
These are quite striking magnitudes.

                                          12
    In order to interpret these results it is important to keep in mind that our estimates
are coming from a country ﬁxed eﬀects regression. In this way we are comparing growth
in a country during conﬂict to other years in the same country without conﬂict. The
hope is that factors which aﬀect the country generally are captured by the ﬁxed eﬀect.
However, our empirical strategy also implies that if conﬂict aﬀects growth in the post-
conﬂict period then β  ˆ will provide an underestimate of the true economic costs of
conﬂict. We will return to this point below.

2.3    Economic Impact at the Ethnic Group Level
As a ﬁnal piece of evidence, we draw from economic, population and ethnic conﬂict
data compiled in the GROWup dataset. This dataset provides satellite night light data
as a proxy for economic activity at the ethnic group level. Conﬂict incidence in the
GROWUp data is deﬁned through more than 25 fatalities, i.e. a fairly low threshold, in
ethnic conﬂicts. This dataset provides information on 502 ethnic groups for the period
1992 to 2013. We run a regression of the following form:

                          git = θi + ηt + β × incidenceit +   it


where git is night light per capita growth of group i in year t, incidenceit is conﬂict
incidence, θi are a set of 502 group ﬁxed eﬀects and ηt are year ﬁxed eﬀects. The ﬁxed
eﬀects in this context control for group-speciﬁc growth trends in the data. Note that
we do not use the per capita model in this speciﬁcation as violence seems to be a pure
public bad locally.
    Table 2 reports the results. We ﬁnd a negative and statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect
of incidence on per capita light growth. Light per capita growth is reduced by around
7 percentage points in years a group is engaged in conﬂict. This eﬀect is robust to
controlling for lagged light growth in column (2). In columns (4) and (5) we show that
these reductions in light per capita growth are composed by two factors; light growth
falls dramatically and this is partially oﬀset by a negative eﬀect on population growth.
However, column (3) also shows that there is some evidence for negative spill-overs
from conﬂict at the country level. Conﬂict in other groups in the same country lower
light per capita growth for other groups in the same country by 0.7 percentage points.
    Again we interpret these estimates in terms of GDP growth following Henderson
et al. (2012). If a decrease of night light by 1 percent implies a decrease of GDP of
about 0.25 percent, then our result from column (1) in Table 2 can be translated into
a reduction of GDP growth of about 1.8 percentage points.
    Overall this suggests that local eﬀects are important and comparatively large in
comparison to spill-overs. This is important for our discussion as they deﬁne the
challenge that the country faces in the recovery from civil wars. Local eﬀects of violence
imply that civil conﬂict leaves a legacy of regional economic divergence. Another way
to understand the size of this relative decline is to perform a second simulation of the
GDP loss that focuses on group-level economic performance, following the same steps
described above. Figure 4 displays the distribution of conﬂict lengths in the sample for
which we also have the night light per capita data (years 1992-2012). We estimated

                                           13
that, for each year a group is in conﬂict, GDP per capita in its homeland will decrease
by 1.8 percentage points. As a result, around one half of the ethnic groups is estimated
to have a loss of output that ranges between 10 and 30 percent. If this is not recovered
it will lead to regional imbalances on the country level and could amplify conﬂict.
    In summary, we have shown, using panel data regressions, that economic growth
decreases dramatically when a country or region experiences violence. As the economic
eﬀects of violence are predominantly local this implies that conﬂict might lead to or
amplify regional imbalances.

3      Recovery from Conﬂict
The analysis of the contemporaneous eﬀects of conﬂicts provided in the previous section
is crucial to understand the long term eﬀects that violence has on post-war economic
development. In the present section, by analyzing the economic conditions of FCS
during the recovery period, we will learn that the key element needed for long term
development is peace stability. In fact, during recovery FCS grow as fast as other
countries; while, as we learned in the previous section, during conﬂict period growth
is substantially hampered. Therefore the occurrence of renewed outbreak of conﬂict,
that disrupts the economic conditions of the aﬀected countries and break the recovery
process, is the crucial element on which depends the success or the failure of the
post-conﬂict development. In this section we analyze all the aspects of recovery that,
combined with the evidence provided in the previous section, allow us to draw these
conclusions.
    According to the WDR 2011, one of the most problematic challenges that FCS
face is the occurrence of repeated cycles of violence. On the one hand, they have
a high probability of relapsing into conﬂict within relatively short time periods. On
the other hand political violence might evolve into other forms of violence, such as
organized crime. This transformation can hinder the recovery and the economic and
social development of the areas of interest.
    From the previous section, we know that countries and ethnic groups with conﬂict
experience dramatic economic decline. However, this only leads to a conﬂict trap if 1)
the weakened economy does not recover and 2) if the absence of a recovery leads to
renewed conﬂict.
    Surprisingly, perhaps, there is quite a lot of controversy in the academic literature
regarding the long-term eﬀects of violence on economic activity.11 There are both
theoretical and empirical reasons for this controversy. Theoretically, classic growth
models like the Solow model assume that countries converge to their own steady state
and that countries face decreasing returns to human and physical capital. An exogenous
destruction of production factors through war will therefore result in a more rapid
accumulation of physical or human capital after the conﬂict.12 In its plainest form,
this model predicts that countries will grow much quicker after a negative exogenous
shock. The long term economic costs of conﬂict are therefore less severe.
    Empirically there is some support for this hypothesis from external wars. In an
early contribution, Organski and Kugler (1977) show that output of winners and, more
surprisingly, also losers of the World Wars caught up with non-aﬀected countries after
15 to 20 years. This is supported by additional evidence from the micro level. Davis
and Weinstein (2002) show that Japanese cities that were bombed had completely
recovered their relative size 20 years after the US bombing in World War II. In a
similar vein, Brakman et al. (2004) ﬁnd that bombing of Germany had a signiﬁcant
but temporary impact on postwar city growth in West Germany but a sustained impact
in East Germany. Miguel and Roland (2011) study a whole battery of indicators from
  11
    For an excellent review see Serneels and Verpoorten (2015).
  12
    Collier (1999), for example, uses this logic to argue that longer civil wars will be followed by
stronger recoveries because the capital stock has adjusted downwards.
                                                17
poverty rates, population densities to schooling in Vietnam 25 years after the US
bombing campaign and ﬁnd that the local economy had recovered.
    Of course, the time dimension involved in these ﬁndings is in itself not a reason for
general optimism in a post-conﬂict situation. The evidence on quicker gains is more
mixed - mostly because there is no agreed methodology for how to study recoveries.
Cerra and Saxena (2008) use a method used to study crisis episodes more generally
to study civil wars. In this method the start of an episode is coded as 1 and the
impact over time is studied using forwards and lags. They ﬁnd that, while output
falls steeply immediately after conﬂict (6 percent on average), the economy recovers
relatively soon afterwards. Mueller (2012) shows that this, fairly optimistic, view is
due to a coding error. Economies contract by more than 18 percent in a civil war and
this is not recovered within a decade. However, the problem here is partly one of the
correct coding of recoveries which we will turn to next.

3.1    Empirical Evidence for Economic Recoveries
A simple way to check what happens in the recovery period at the macro level is to
construct a set of dummies that capture the years after violence ends directly. These
can then be used in a regression like the following
                                                  1            2
             gct = θc + ηt + violencect + recoveryct + recoveryct + ... +   ct

                                                                1
where gct is the growth rate of country c in year t and recoveryct is a dummy that takes
the value of 1 in the ﬁrst year after violence ends. Table 3 shows the result using 5
recovery dummies. The result is a striking bounce of the growth rate by about 2.5 to 3
percentage points right after violence ends but otherwise little evidence for prolonged
periods of extraordinary growth. This implies that, in the majority of cases, the output
lost is not completely recovered in the recovery period. In addition, the similar results
for light per capita growth suggest that the lack of an extraordinary growth period at
the country level is not due to measurement issues. Regressions with levels of GDP
per capita on the left hand side conﬁrm this lack of a recovery.
    This is, however, not a contradiction to the ﬁndings of strong recoveries in levels of
output within country in the long run. As a check we use the data on night light at
the ethnic group level as it oﬀers a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of local
economic activity on a yearly basis.
    We run the following regression for group i in year t in country c:

                      ycit = θct + incidencecit + recoverycit +   cit


where ycit is the log of per capita night light, incidencecit is conﬂict incidence and
recoverycit are a set of recovery dummies that capture the period after conﬂict, all
at ethnic group level. The key addition in this regression is a set of of country/year
ﬁxed eﬀects θct which capture average economic activity at the country level in every
year. In this way we compare how the level of economic activity in group i compares to
other groups in the same country c during and after conﬂict. This mimics the existing

literature on within-country comparisons fairly well. Results are in columns (1) and
(2) of Table 4. We ﬁnd that groups in conﬂict receive about 30 percent less light per
capita than other groups in the same country and year.13 Interpreted with the log-
linear-relationship between light and GDP this is equivalent to a diﬀerence of about
8 percent in GDP per capita. During the time after conﬂict this diﬀerence to other
groups narrows. To show this we introduce two sets of dummies. First we introduce
a dummy for the ﬁrst ﬁve years after conﬂict and a second dummy for the remaining
years. We see that light per capita is 20 percent less in groups that come out of conﬂict
and remains signiﬁcantly lower after ﬁve years. Second, we look at the ﬁrst ten years
and ﬁnd, again, that groups coming out of conﬂict receive 20 percent less light per
capita. However, now in the remaining recovery years the diﬀerence is only 5 percent
and is not statistically signiﬁcant. Overall this suggests some catch up a decade after
conﬂict.14
    In summary, there are a series of papers which show a complete recovery following
wars of the most aﬀected regions within 15 to 25 years. We ﬁnd evidence that this
result generalizes to a large cross-section of countries. Recovery at the country level
appears to be much weaker. We ﬁnd little evidence for extraordinary growth periods
after civil war. This is, however, not the ﬁnal word regarding recovery. There is a
  13
     We ﬁnd very similar coeﬃcients when including group and year ﬁxed eﬀects instead of coun-
try/year eﬀects. Groups are not just receiving less light compared to other groups in the same
country but also compared to themselves in other years.
  14
     To check this from a group perspective we also ran growth regressions with dummies indicating
recovery years and ﬁnd that light per capita grows signiﬁcantly after conﬂict. See Appendix Table
A5.

selection problem built into the idea of studying long periods of recovery which we
turn to next.

3.2     Unstable Peace as a Central Selection Problem
In the analysis of recovery provided above we focus on groups, countries or regions that
did not face the resurgence of violence. This is obvious in the existing literature which
is focused on countries like Japan, Germany and Vietnam. It is also true for the data
we use as the dummies in our regressions condition on the length of the recovery period.
In column (1) of Table 4 this implies, for example, that we focus on the recoveries that
have lasted longer than 5 years. Economic performance in the other cases cannot be
studied because they have entered renewed conﬂict. This selection problem means we
are drawing conclusions from countries that have managed to stay peaceful.


   This is a serious concern as most groups do not stay in peace. In Figure 5 we
show the distribution of recovery lengths at the group level. The ﬁgure shows that 151
                                                          20
           Figure 5: Length of Recovery Period on the Ethnic Group Level




groups enter recovery at some stage but only 117 of those recoveries last a second year,
only about half of the sample stayed in peace for longer than 5 years and less than a
third stayed in peace for longer than 10 years. And, indeed, we ﬁnd that fragile peace
is anticipated by a lack of development at the group level. In column (3) of Table 4 we
add a dummy which takes the value of 1 if the group is in the ﬁrst ten years of recovery
but is known to fall back to conﬂict within the next nine years. In this way we separate
groups that experience longer recovery lengths from those that go back to conﬂict. The
ﬁrst thing to note is that the coeﬃcient on the ﬁrst ten years of recovery, which now
covers only groups that keep recovering, rises a little from -20 percentage points to -13
percentage points. In addition, the dummy that shows the diﬀerence between groups
that recover from those that do not is -13 percent. Groups that fall back into conﬂict
are relatively poor during the recovery period.
    In order to understand what is going on we need to take a step back. In Table 5,
Panels A and B we show simple average growth rates of GDP per capita for countries
that experienced conﬂict and compare it to countries that did not. We see that average
growth rates are slightly lower in the conﬂict sample. This sort of evidence has often
been used to argue for a conﬂict trap. We then split up the growth rates in conﬂict
countries into years in which the countries experienced violence (deﬁned by more than
more than 0.008 battle deaths per 1000 population) and years in which they did not.
This allows us to look at both levels of growth across peaceful and fragile countries
and at diﬀerences within violent and peaceful periods.

     “Conﬂict” is deﬁned as a year in which the number of battle related deaths is higher than 0.008 per 1000 population. GDP per
     capita growth rate are computed using data from Penn World Tables and World Bank Dataset. Growth rate of night light per
     capita are computed using data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
    There is a very consistent pattern that arises from the three data series. The average
growth rate in civil war countries during peace gets very close to the average growth
rate of peaceful countries. However, these countries grow much more slowly during
violent periods. In other words, on average they would not fall behind economically if
their recovery period was long enough. In this view it is not recovery in itself that is
the problem but the fact that it does not last.
    Since this is a core ﬁnding we propose several additional ways to illustrate the
importance of fragility. First, we develop a measure for the fragility of peace. One,
extremely simple, way is to calculate:
                                                peace years − war starts
                   persistence of peace =                                                    (2)
                                                       peace years
which provides a number between 0 and 1. This number indicates the likelihood that
a year of peace is followed by another year of peace. If this number is high it means
that peace in the country was very persistent. Low persistence is an indicator of
fragility. Since the calculation of persistence relies on rare events (the start of an
armed conﬂict) it will vary considerably regarding to the sample period and deﬁnition
of conﬂict used. In order to include as much violence as possible we use data on all
internal PRIO armed conﬂicts since the second world war to calculate the persistence
of peace. Figure 6 shows how persistence of peace, deﬁned this way, relates to GDP per
capita now. There is a striking positive relationship. Countries with a high persistence
of peace have a much higher GDP per capita than countries with low persistences. This
relationship holds despite the fact that we excluded a set of relatively rich countries
which never experienced armed conﬂict.
    We use the persistence of peace to explore country variation in GDP per capita.
We run a regression, not reported here, of log GDP per capita in 2013 on the per-
sistence measure.15 The persistence of peace and log GDP are strongly associated:
the estimated coeﬃcient of the persistence measure is around 4 and it is statistically
signiﬁcant. A coeﬃcient of 4 suggests that an increase of persistence of 10 percentage
points is associated with an increase of GDP by about 50 percent. To have a practical
example of what this relationship means, consider the case of Ethiopia from Figure 6.
This country has a persistence of peace of only 0.5. If we interpret the results here
as causal, the change from 0.5 to a value close to 1 would be associated with 6-fold
increase of GDP per capita.



    A stable recovery is so important for economic development that this fact can even
be made visible in a much simpler way. Figure 7 Panel (a) shows GDP per capita in
2014 and the conﬂict history of countries which have experienced at least one year of
violence. The y-axis captures the log of GDP per capita in 2014 while the x-axis shows
the number of years a country has experienced high intensity violence as deﬁned by our
  15
   We exclude countries that never had an armed conﬂict. We also exclude countries with less than
1 million inhabitants.

per capita measure (0.08 battle related deaths per 1000 population). This relationship
is not statistically signiﬁcant. Figure 7 Panel (b) shows the GDP per capita (in logs) in
2014 while the x-axis reports the number of years a country has been in recovery after
the last episode of violence.16 The relationship between these two variables is positive
and statistically signiﬁcant.17 When we use log of night light as proxy of country level
economic activity, the relationship between economic performance and length of the
last recovery is similar to the one displayed in Figure 7 Panel (b).18
    We can also give a closer examination of the relationship between peace stability
and growth by looking at every single country which experienced conﬂict.19 We do
so in Table A8 in the Appendix, where we report the average growth rates of GDP
during four periods: conﬂict years; peace years; ﬁrst ﬁve recovery years and fragile
peace years. A country is in a fragile peace year if it is experiencing one of the ﬁrst ﬁve
years of recovery but will relapse into conﬂict within the next ﬁve years. On average,
the growth rate of GDP per capita during the recovery period which is followed by
  16
     Where again violence is deﬁned as a year with at least 0.08 battle related death per 1000 popu-
lation.
  17
     The estimated coeﬃcient of the linear relationship between GDP and years of recovery since the
last war equals 0.033 and it is statistically signiﬁcant at 1% level.
  18
     The ﬁgure is reported in the Appendix.
  19
     In this case civil conﬂict occurs if there is at least one battle related death in country c during
year t. We restrict the sample to those countries which experienced at least 5 years of conﬂict during
the period 1960-2010.

conﬂict is not lower than the average growth rate during recovery.
    These ﬁndings indicate that a conﬂict trap only exists in the sense that renewed
outbreaks of conﬂict are preventing persistent recovery. We do not ﬁnd any evidence
for the idea that a lack of growth post conﬂict reinforces the trap.20 Countries might
not grow extraordinarily after conﬂict, but they grow normally and, if anything, quicker
before another conﬂict onset.
    A productive avenue for studying the lack of long term development of FCS is
therefore the study of fragility not recovery in isolation. One piece of evidence in this
direction comes from the fact that ethnic groups in fragile peace do not seem to catch
up with average wealth levels in the country. We will return to this after a discussion
of two mechanisms by which conﬂict could aﬀect long run development.




  20
    This does not mean, however, that cross-country diﬀerences in GDP levels might not reinforce
fragility. Figure 7 Panel B illustrates this by showing that countries with the lowest GDP per capita
belong to the “more than one conﬂict” group.

                                                 26
                        Example of a Recovery: Uganda
    In Figure 8, we compare the economic performance, measured by GDP per
capita (in logs), of two neighboring African countries: Kenya and Uganda. While
Kenya has experienced only one year of violence, Uganda has been hit by civil
conﬂict during several years. These episodes of violence are highlighted in the
ﬁgure as red bars. While the output of Kenya looks stable over time, we notice a
severe drop of the Ugandan GDP during civil war.
    However, Uganda also experienced a sharp increase in GDP starting from the
ﬁrst years after the conﬂict period. This recovery has not been inhibited markedly
by other episodes of violence that occurred afterwards. The level of the GDP per
capita in year 2010 exceeds its level before conﬂict by a signiﬁcant margin. Also,
Uganda has not slipped back into mass violence. Within a decade of peace the
Ugandan economy has grown by more than 70 percent.
    Uganda has achieved remarkable growth while at the same time concentrat-
ing power institutionally and informally. Besley and Mueller (2015b) show that,
indeed, the lack of strong institutional checks on the executive can imply both
extraordinary strong growth and a higher likelihood of disasters. In this view,
institutional checks are not a guarantor for high growth but instead a safeguard
against disastrous economic contractions. Violent conﬂict is a possible trigger for
the latter. That said, data from GROWup shows a signiﬁcant drop in the share of
the population that the government excludes from power after 1985 and another
decrease in political discrimination after 2005. This gives some hope that future
political conﬂicts in the country can be resolved without violence.

4      Internal Conﬂicts and Refugees
A particularly serious aspect of internal conﬂicts is the human suﬀering they generate.
This is not only those who are killed or injured in conﬂict but the large number of people
who are forced to leave their homes. The issue of refugees has received particular
attention in Western media in recent years as refugee ﬂows from Northern Africa,
the Middle East and Afghanistan are increasingly reaching Europe. These refugee
streams are linked to a severe humanitarian crisis with considerable funding needs for
international donors and heavy strains on host countries.21 The current refugee crisis,
however, is in no way unique. Civil war has always been closely linked to humanitarian
crisis and refugee streams are one way to capture this.
    In this section we provide a cross-country analysis aimed at investigating how the
stock of refugees evolves when a civil conﬂict hits a country. In the analysis we will
focus entirely on showing changes in the stock of refugees across time to illustrate the
dimensions involved. We will base our later analysis on these population movements.
    We exploit country-level data gathered from several sources. Data about refugees
is provided by the UNHCR Population Statistics Database. The database provides in-
formation about UNHCR’s populations of concern from the year 1951 up to 2014. This
database lists seven categories: refugees, asylum-seekers, returned refugees, internally
displaced persons (IDPs), returned IDPs, stateless persons and others of concern. For
each group the database provides yearly information about their composition by loca-
tion of residence and origin. We exploit only the data on “refugees”.22 In particular,
we are interested in the annual stock of refugees for each country of residence, i.e. how
many people with refugees status have left their home country each year. We focus on
these numbers as they appear to be the most comparable across time and countries.
However, this is likely to capture only the tip of the iceberg in some cases. The number
of IDPs is extremely high in some instances but cannot be captured with the same level
of conﬁdence as refugees generally.23
    Cross-country data about conﬂict is provided by the UCDP/PRIO. As for the
index of country-level economic activity, we use again information provided by the
Penn World Table and World Bank databases.
    As mentioned above, our aim is to explore the dynamics of refugees during conﬂicts.
In other words, we attempt to answer several questions. Do people run away from their
home country when a conﬂict breaks out? Does the seriousness of the conﬂict matter
in this decision? In which phase of the conﬂict do they leave? When do refugees come
back to their home country?
    In order to answer these questions, we look at the impact of conﬂict incidence on
  21
     We will return to these issues in the policy section.
  22
     According to the UNHCR deﬁnition, this category includes “individuals recognized under the
1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; its 1967 Protocol; the 1969 OAU Convention
Governing the Speciﬁc Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa; those recognized in accordance with the
UNHCR Statute; individuals granted complementary forms of protection; or those enjoying temporary
protection; and people in a refugee-like situation”.
  23
     The UNHCR Global Trends Report 2014 provides evidence that conﬁrms this hypothesis. About
59.5 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide by the end of year 2014. Among them, 19.5
million were refugees and 38.2 million were IDPs.

                                                28
the yearly stock of refugees. More formally, we run the following regression for country
i in year t:
                   ref ugeesit = incidenceit + phaseit + δi + δt + it
Our outcome of interest is refugees it , which is the stock of refugees. The variable
incidence it is conﬂict incidence. In one speciﬁcation of the model we use the deﬁnition
from the PRIO dataset of at least 25 battle related deaths caused by an internal conﬂict.
In the other speciﬁcations we use a more stringent deﬁnition of internal conﬂict which
requires at least 1000 battle related fatalities.24
    Variable phase it is a vector of dummies we use to show the dynamics in the stock
of refugees in diﬀerent phases of the conﬂict. In one speciﬁcation we control for the
year before the conﬂict starts and ﬁrst year of conﬂict. Then, we include in succession
dummies for the last year of conﬂict and recovery years up to the tenth year of recovery.
    Finally, δi and δt are respectively country and year ﬁxed eﬀects: the former control
for time invariant country-speciﬁc impact on the change of the number of refugees,
while year ﬁxed eﬀects capture the average state-invariant inﬂuence of each year t on
refugees it .
    Table 6 reports the results. In column (1) conﬂict incidence coincides with the
PRIO deﬁnition of at least 25 battle related deaths, i.e variable 25+ battle deaths. The
estimated coeﬃcient indicates that during conﬂicts more than 144,000 people leave their
home country on average. This average rises markedly when we use the more stringent
deﬁnition of at least 1000 battle related fatalities as conﬂict incidence variable. In
fact, in column (2) the estimated eﬀect of conﬂict incidence on refugees it more than
doubles. Note that in this speciﬁcation we include the dummy 25-1000 battle deaths 25
in order to check whether people have an incentive to leave their country when some
violence occurred, but the situation has not escalated into a conﬂict with more than
1000 deaths in a given year. We notice that during these years a signiﬁcant number
of people leave the country, but this average is very low if compared with the average
stock of refugees during the violent years with more than 1000 deaths. We therefore
focus on dynamics in war period, using as “conﬂict incidence” the tighter deﬁnition of
at least 1000 battle related deaths.
    Column (3) of table 6 adds to the previous model the controls for the initial phase of
the conﬂict, namely year before the war and ﬁrst year of the war. Compared to column
(2), the estimated coeﬃcient of the variable 1000+ battle related deaths increases. On
average, the stock of refugees during conﬂict is more than 487,000 people. But in the
ﬁrst year of conﬂict the average stock is by 384,851 lower, i.e. only 20 percent of the
almost 500,000 refugees leave their country during the ﬁrst year of conﬂict.26 Column
(3) also tells us that there is there is no signiﬁcant departure during the year before
the conﬂict. This suggests that forced displacement of people takes oﬀ with the start
of violence but not before.
  24
     Note, that we now switched to counts of fatalities as our outcome variable is also in absolutes.
Weighting both sides by population would not change the results.
  25
     This dummy takes value one if in country i during year y the registered battle related deaths are
between 25 and 1000.
  26
     The number of 20 percent is obtained by computing (487,968-384,851)/487,968.


                                                 29
    Column (4) includes controls for the last phase of the conﬂict, namely the last year
of conﬂict and ﬁrst year of recovery. Compared to the speciﬁcation of column (3),
the coeﬃcient of conﬂict incidence does not change signiﬁcantly. During the last year
of the civil wars, around one half of refugees are still out of their home country (the
stock of refugees is approximately 210,000 on average). This amount decreases during
the ﬁrst year of recovery. In fact, the estimated coeﬃcient of the variable ﬁrst year
of recovery indicates that, on average, only about 20 percent of the refugees have not
come back into their home country in the ﬁrst recovery year. Columns (5) and (6) add
controls for additional years of recovery, i.e. the two speciﬁcations includes dummies
respectively for ﬁve and ten years of recovery. We can observe that the stock of refugees
decreases with longer recoveries. The estimated coeﬃcient of the variable 10+ recovery
years in column (6) suggests that around 70,000 refugees who left their home country
during civil war have not returned 10 years after the war has ended. These are about
15 percent of all people who leave.27
    We have also performed the same analysis excluding Afghanistan. Given that the
yearly stock of refugees registered in Afghanistan is signiﬁcantly higher than the stock
of any other country, we want to exclude the hypothesis that Afghanistan is driving
the results we described above. We compute the equivalent of Table 6, that we do
not report here. Although coeﬃcients are smaller in size, our main conclusions are left
unchanged. The results are also robust to controlling for famine episodes as shown in
Table A7 in the appendix.28
    These results allow three conclusions. First, our analysis suggests that violence
leads to a severe humanitarian crisis which forces people to leave their country of
origin. Second, residents seem to migrate as refugees when the internal conﬂict breaks
out, in other words, they do not leave the country before the conﬂict has actually
started. After conﬂict, the large majority of refugees returns very quickly, i.e. within
a year after the end of conﬂict, 4 out 5 refugees have returned. However, the average
return ﬂow then slows markedly and ten years after the conﬂict ended 3 out of 20
refugees remain outside their country of origin.




  27
    The number of 15 percent is obtained by computing 73,528/466,418.
  28
    Famine and conﬂict are closely associated in the sense that the risk of a famine more than doubles
with conﬂict. In addition, famine leads to substantial ﬂight. We discuss details in the Appendix.

     followed by a year with at least 1000 battle related deaths. Variables “ﬁrst year of war” and “last year of war”
     are dummies that take a value of one during the ﬁrst and the last year of civil war respectively. Dummies “1st

5       Conﬂict and Long Term Productivity
As argued in section 3 there is no distinct recovery growth period. Countries seem to
return to their average growth level in the absence of conﬂict. While this is good news
in the sense that there is positive growth on average, it is also bad news in the sense
that there seems to be, on average, no adjustment back to steady state once conﬂict
is over. This is in contradiction with ﬁndings on the quick rebuilding of capital stock
found in the literature. However, Barro and Sala-i Martin (2004) predict that the speed
of recovery depends on the type of capital that is destroyed, with a slower recovery if
human capital is destroyed, because it has a higher adjustment cost.
    This is particularly relevant as there is evidence in the literature that exposure to
conﬂict during early childhood or adolescence has a huge and persistent direct eﬀect
on health, education and productivity of children. Leon (2012) shows that the average
person exposed to political violence in Peru before school-age accumulated 0.31 fewer
years of schooling upon reaching adulthood. This suggests that children who were
aﬀected by violence during early childhood suﬀer irreversible eﬀects. Duﬂo (2001)
ﬁnds that the eﬀect of a huge school construction program in Indonesia on school
attainment in the long-run is of a slightly smaller magnitude. Each school constructed
per 1,000 children led to an increase of 0.12 to 0.19 years of education. This means
that if one wanted to mitigate the long run eﬀect of conﬂict in Peru on schooling by
opening more schools, one would need to build more than 8000 new schools.29 This is
a big adjustment cost which supports the claims in Barro and Sala-i Martin (2004).
    Akresh et al. (2012) also identify the long term impact of exposure to conﬂict during
the Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s on health. They ﬁnd that individuals who
where exposed to this conﬂict in their childhood or adolescence have a reduced stature.
Adult stature is a latent stock measure of health and variation in height induced by
childhood or adolescence environment has been documented in the literature as a good
predictor of longevity, education and earnings (Behrman and Rosenzweig, 2004; Case
and Paxton, 2008; Strauss and Thomas, 1998). The impact of pre-adulthood exposure
to conﬂict on height identiﬁed in Akresh et al. (2012) can therefore be viewed as a
permanent labor productivity loss for the exposed individuals.
    Note, that these ﬁndings come from micro level regressions using cohort ﬁxed ef-
fects and therefore face less concerns about reverse causality and omitted variable bias.
Below we will take these ﬁndings at face value and analyze the implications for the
economy, i.e. at the macro level. From a macro perspective, we can infer that in the
years following onset of intense conﬂicts, cohorts of treated individuals (those exposed
to the conﬂict before adulthood) will progressively enter into the labor force in sub-
stitution of older workers. This will progressively increase the aggregate productivity
loss of the country and thus hinder recovery. Therefore, the full consequence of a given
conﬂict occurs when all the exposed children have entered the labor force. This eﬀect
vanishes completely only when none of them belongs to the labor force anymore.
    The existing empirical evidence suggests that this view is not entirely unrealistic.
Ichino and Winter-Ebmer (2004) for instance estimate the long run educational cost of
 29
      The total population of age less than 14 is 8 million in Peru.

                                                   32
World War II. They ﬁnd that individuals who were 10 years old during the conﬂict, or
were more directly involved through their parents in Germany and Austria, received
less education than individuals with comparable characteristics in Switzerland and
Sweden. Aﬀected individuals also experience a sizable earnings loss, some 40 years
later. Blattman and Annan (2010) use the exogeneity in child military conscriptions
into rebel groups in Uganda to provide evidence of widespread and persistent economic
and educational impact of conﬂicts. They ﬁnd that schooling falls by nearly a year,
that skilled employment halves, and that earnings drop by a third among child soldiers
as compared to the control group.
    Conﬂicts aﬀect aggregate productivity directly through physical health but also
indirectly through mental health. Being exposed to violence leads to post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) which aﬀects both adults and children. These mental illnesses
are characterized by hyper-vigilance, ﬂashbacks and nightmares. Individuals who are
exposed to a traumatic event have an increased likelihood of poor self-reported health,
morbidity (as indicated by physical exam or laboratory tests), utilization of medical
services, and mortality. Li et al. (2011) show that people who experience PTSD are
at much higher risk of developing other health problems, including diabetes, heart
ailments, depression and addiction. Sibai et al. (1989) study civilians exposed to the
civil war in Lebanon and ﬁnd that patients with severe coronary artery disease had
more war-related stress than did either patients with normal arteriographic ﬁndings or
hospital visitors. Using female Vietnam veterans, Wolfe et al. (1994) show that war-
zone exposure and PTSD are associated with self-reports of poor health and numerous
physical problems. PTSD in early childhood also makes people more vulnerable in
later life (Economist, ed, 2015).
    Rosen and Fields (1988) were among the ﬁrst to attempt to explain how PTSD could
adversely aﬀect physical health. The potential channels can be divided in 3 groups:
biological, psychological and behavioral channels (Friedman and Schnurr, 1995). From
a biological point of view, PTSD can modify cardiovascular reactivity, disturb sleep
physiology, enhance thyroid function, etc. The psychological channels include depres-
sion, hostility, and poor coping capacity. The behavioral ones include poor health
habits such as smoking and drinking.30
    For the rest of this section, we treat all these eﬀects as a persistent loss in human
capital due to pre-adulthood exposure to conﬂicts. We ﬁrst propose a measure of
aggregate health loss in labor productivity based on pre-adulthood exposure of workers
to conﬂict, that uses the existing micro estimates and combines them with the labor
force composition (which share of labor force experienced violence at a given age before
adulthood). We also explore how this measure correlates with output in a macro
framework and whether it is consistent with micro level estimates of returns to health
in the literature.
 30
    A review of how PTSD could adversely aﬀect physical health can be found in Friedman and
Schnurr (1995).

5.1       A Measure of Aggregate Productivity Loss
In this section we will use the results from the micro level regressions to construct a
measure of aggregate productivity loss. The micro ﬁndings have the advantage that
identiﬁcation is stronger than in cross-country studies. Their disadvantage is that
outside validity is not ensured. We therefore ﬁrst take the micro ﬁndings at face value
and analyze the implications for the macro economy in the long run. We then show
that the cross-country data is consistent with a productivity loss of a size implied by
the micro studies.
    Akresh et al. (2012) provide estimates of the height loss in cm due to exposure to
the Nigerian civil war for diﬀerent age groups between 0 and 16. Females exposed to
the conﬂict between age 0 and 3 lost on average of 0.75 cm in height as compared to
non exposed females. This loss increased to 1.09 cm for the age group 4-6, 2.16 cm for
the age group 7-12 and ﬁnally 4.53 cm for the age group 13-16. Identiﬁcation relies on
a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences model in which authors interact an indicator for war-exposed
ethnicity (the Igbos) with a continuous cohort-based measure of months of exposure
to the war. Based on these relatively well identiﬁed micro level estimates, we propose
an estimate of a long run macro-level productivity loss due to conﬂict.
    Suppose workers enter the labor force at age 17 with diﬀerences in productivity
levels due to previous exposure to conﬂict. Once in the labor market, productivity
dynamics are the same for all cohorts, and workers exit the labor force at age 60. We
assume that if there is a conﬂict at time t in country i, all children of age j suﬀer a
loss that depends on the intensity of the conﬂict.
    We follow three alternative approaches to measure conﬂict intensity and map it
into a persistent productivity loss. First, we proxy conﬂict intensity by the per capita
number of battle related deaths. To mitigate the eﬀect of very intense conﬂicts on our
loss measure, we prefer, however, to categorize conﬂicts in two groups: intense versus
non intense conﬂicts. We use a dummy that takes a value of 1 if the number of per
capita battle related deaths exceeded the level suﬀered in Nigeria during the Biafra
civil war.31 In addition, we use data on the stock of refugees provided by the UNHCR.
We believe that ﬂows of refugees are a good proxy for civilian suﬀering during conﬂict.
We consider therefore a dummy that takes a value of 1 if there is a net outﬂow of
refugees in a given year. However, we are aware that a big challenge of this proxy is
that some conﬂicts by nature cause more internal movements or no movements at all
because people are just not able to ﬂee the aﬀected areas.
    The loss for a worker of age h at year t in country i is calculated as:

                                     losshti = Σ16
                                                j =0 fji (It−h+j,i )                  (3)

and the total loss in country i at year t is given by

                                    Lossti = Σ60
                                              h=17 Shti ∗ losshti

where Shti is the share of workers of age h in total labor force, It−h+j,i is a measure of
 31
      We discuss the eﬀect of a change in the threshold below.

                                                   34
conﬂict intensity in country i, h − j years earlier. fji is a country speciﬁc functional
form that maps conﬂict intensity to a loss for children of age j that are exposed to the
conﬂict in a given year.
   To take this measure to the data using either the second or the third proxy for
conﬂict intensity, we assume that all intense conﬂicts have an eﬀect similar to what
was observed during the Biafra civil war and less intense conﬂicts do not have any
persistent eﬀect. When considering the case with battle deaths per capita, we assume
the following:

       • fji is linear, which means that if per capita conﬂict intensity doubles within the
         same country, the loss of each cohort of exposed children will also double;
       • A given conﬂict intensity will create the same loss on children of age j in all
         countries fji = fj ∀ i

       These assumptions allow us to rewrite equation (3) as

                                              Lossj,biaf ra
                            losshti = Σ16
                                       j =0                 ∗ It−h+j,i                           (4)
                                                Ibiaf ra

    Where Lossj,biaf ra is the cm loss per year of exposure for children exposed to the
Biafra civil war at age j compared to non exposed children. We compute this loss using
estimates in Akresh et al. (2012). We ﬁrst compute a per month cm loss by dividing
the total cm loss for each age group by the average number of months of exposure.
This per month cm loss is then multiplied by 12 to have the equivalent height loss per
year. We ﬁnally attribute the age group loss to each age cohort within a given group.
    To obtain a direct measure of the productivity loss from the aggregate measure of
cm loss, we use micro evidence that estimate the equivalent gain in labor productivity
for an extra cm of height, holding education constant. Well (2007) provides diﬀerent
estimates for this parameter based on diﬀerent studies. According to this paper, an
extra cm increases labor productivity by 3 to 7 percent 32 . Multiplying this coeﬃcient
with our measure of cm loss yields therefore a measure of productivity loss in percent.
    These estimates are however obtained holding constant factor prices and technology
in a partial equilibrium framework. General equilibrium interactions can oﬀset or even
reverse partial equilibrium conclusions. As argued in Acemoglu (2010), one potential
reason for such eﬀect is the imperfect substitution between factors and diminishing
returns leading to a change in factor productivities and prices. It is therefore not clear
whether these ﬁndings would aggregate up after a massive loss of productivity in the
population.
    The ﬁrst two graphs in Figure 9 depict our productivity loss measure for 2 speciﬁc
cases of countries using 7 percent per cm as the marginal eﬀect of height on productivity.
  32
    Based on estimates of the impact of fetal growth on height, schooling and wages derived from
cohorts of twins in Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004) and Black et al. (2007), Well (2007) ﬁnds a
coeﬃcient of 0.034 for the return to an extra cm of height on log wages. Average wage represents
labor productivity according to classic production theory. Well (2007) also found a coeﬃcient of 0.07
when using estimates based on UK long run historical data.

The measure of conﬂict intensity used here is the categorization “intensive” versus “non
intensive” based on the number of battle related deaths per 1000 inhabitants. Loss
measures are given in percentage points of productivity loss.
    The ﬁrst graph reports the pattern of productivity loss and conﬂict history in
Nigeria. The 3 consecutive peaks in battle deaths per capita in late 1960s represent the
Biafra war. The aggregate productivity loss estimate coming from the micro evidence
increases for the ﬁrst 16 years following the conﬂict, as each year a less productive
cohort substitutes the oldest cohort in the labor force. The full impact of the conﬂict
on productivity is reached when all the treated cohorts have moved in the labor force
and we only observe entry of cohorts that were born after the Biafra conﬂict. At this
point, we estimate that the country would have lost around 10 percent of its potential
aggregate labor productivity. More than 40 years after the conﬂict, the oldest treated
cohort exits the labor force and is replaced by a non treated cohort. This leads to a
decrease in the aggregate productivity loss. The productivity loss will only completely
vanish 60 years after the end of the war, when all the treated cohorts have moved out
of the labor force.
    In the second graph, we show the case of Afghanistan which has suﬀered repeated
spells of very intense violence since the world war. We estimate that the country would
have lost up to 80 percent of the productivity of its labor force due to its conﬂict history.

                                             36
   The third graph represents the kernel density of our productivity loss measure for
observations with positive loss, which represents around 11 percent of country-year
observations in our dataset. It gives an idea of the distribution of this variable across
country-years. The distribution shows a long and thin upper tail driven by countries
with repetitive and highly intense conﬂict history like Afghanistan or the Lebanon. The
average productivity loss is 15 percent in this sample and one fourth of all country-year
observations are associated with losses of more than 20 percent of productivity. Even if
these estimates were drastically overestimated they indicate that the long run impact
of mass violence through this channel could be substantial.

5.2    Macro Evidence
In this subsection, we investigate the correlation between the aggregate loss measure
and output. For this purpose, we use the height loss measure from the previous sub-
section to estimate the marginal eﬀect of an extra cm loss on log GDP. This serves
two objectives. First, we explore whether the micro evidence can be used as a conduit
for understanding the long-term damage to output from conﬂict. Second, we check
whether the aggregate loss in output that we get is consistent with the micro estimates
of marginal economic return to health. It is important to stress that the purpose of
the estimation is therefore not to identify the eﬀect of the health loss on productivity
and output but to gauge whether our previous discussion is realistic.
    The theoretical framework we use for this exercise can be described as follows.
Assume output is given by
                                                      1−α
                                 Yti = (Γti Lti )α ∗ Kti                             (5)
where Γti is the aggregate labor productivity level in country i at time t, Lti and Kti
are respectively labor and capital. Productivity is given by:
                             60
                Γti = exp          Shti ∗ (ahti − θlosshti ) + βIti + ηt + δi + tµi      (6)
                            h=16

where ahti is the baseline productivity level in the absence of conﬂict of workers of age
h at year t in country i. Iti is the number of battle related deaths per capita, ηt and
δi are respectively year and country dummies. tµi is a country speciﬁc time trend.
Assuming a small open economy in which capital stock adjusts endogenously, equation
(5) gives:
                                   ∗    1−α α   1

                                 Yti =            ∗ Γti Lti .                         (7)
                                          r
    Taking logs and substituting equation (6) into equation (7) gives:

                            60
        ∗      1     1−α
 log (Yti )=     log     +      Shti ∗ ahti − θLossti + βIti + ηt + δi + tµi + log (Lti ) (8)
               α      r    h=16

   After including the relevant controls, we can estimate θ from equation (8). It
gives us the eﬀect of an extra cm loss on log GDP which is also the marginal eﬀect
                                                 37
on aggregate productivity because of the log-linear relationship between these two
outcomes. This coeﬃcient should be comparable to micro estimates of a return to
health proxied by a cm height which ranges between 0.033 and 0.073 in the literature.
    We take equation (8) to the data after assuming ahti = ati = ai since we do not have
reliable data on cohort speciﬁc diﬀerences in productivity. The term 60    h=16 Shti ∗ ahti
                                                    33
will therefore be captured by country ﬁxed eﬀects. . The regression we run to get an
estimate of θ in our main speciﬁcation is
                       ∗
                log (Yti ) = −θLossti + γlog (Pti ) + βIti + δi + ηt + tµi +       ti


where Pti is the total population size that we use instead of total labor force Lti , δi and
ηt are country and year ﬁxed eﬀects and tµi is a country-speciﬁc time trend. We also
introduce subregion-year and continent-year ﬁxed eﬀects as robustness check.
    Table 7 reports the results. Column (1) shows a speciﬁcation with country and
year ﬁxed eﬀects. We add country speciﬁc time trends to the previous speciﬁcation in
Column (2) and this is our main speciﬁcation. Column(3) allows for non-linearity in
the way our height loss measure is correlated to log GDP by adding a square term.
Columns (4) and (5) are including respectively continent-year and subregion-year ﬁxed
eﬀects to the main speciﬁcation. In other words, θ in this speciﬁcation captures whether
our loss measure captures diﬀerences in log GDP compared to other countries in the
same region.
    All ﬁrst ﬁve columns use a dummy that equals 1 if the number of battle deaths
per 1000 inhabitants exceeds 0.2 to construct the loss measure.34 Columns (6) and (7)
show results of our main speciﬁcation using respectively the number of battle deaths
per capita and outﬂows of refugees as measures of conﬂict intensity.
    The negative correlation between log GDP and aggregate loss in stature is signif-
icant and robust to all these speciﬁcations. Column (2) suggests that an extra cm
aggregate height loss is associated with a 10.3 percentage point decrease in output.
Columns (6) and (7) suggest a decrease in the output level of respectively 7.9 and 3.4
percentage points. All these numbers are remarkably consistent with the micro-level
estimates in Well (2007).35 The loss measures depicted in 9 are not unrealistic.
    The results presented in this section imply that mass violence triggers long term
losses for countries which pull down the economy decades after the event. The magni-
tudes involved are quite large in some cases as we have shown in the previous section.
Even a 10 percent loss of output triggered by a persistent health loss (equivalent to
  33
     We could also assume a constant growth in labor productivity which would be captured by the
parameter tµi
  34
     The number of battle deaths per 1000 inhabitants in Nigeria was 0.27 in the ﬁrst year of Biafra
conﬂict. We pick a threshold that will consider this level of intensity as a treatment and that will
be high enough to have a persistent eﬀect. Around 15 percent of all conﬂict/years are above this
threshold. We move this threshold for robustness check and our results hold, up to a threshold of 0.08
per 1000 inhabitants, which corresponds to 24% of conﬂict-years observations. It vanishes for lower
thresholds.
  35
     This is also in line with Bloom et al. (2005) who ﬁnd that the estimated macroeconomic eﬀects
of health on economic growth are positive, and not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the microeconomic
estimates.

                                                 38
1 cm) implies a total output loss several times as large as yearly GDP. Identiﬁcation
in the macro regressions is obviously not water-tight. But the existence of the micro
ﬁndings and the fact that their aggregation leads to very similar estimates at the macro
level indicates that loss of health in childhood could be an important channel through
which violence aﬀects the economy far beyond the short-term.
    Figure 10 gives an illustration of what output in Nigeria would be if it did not
experience the Biafra war. According to our estimates, GDP would have shifted from
1.406 billion USD to 1.527 billions USD on average. This is a diﬀerence of over 120
million US dollars a year for several decades. In this light, avoiding a humanitarian
crisis is therefore a long-term investment in labor productivity.
    One way of mitigating/preventing such persistent losses after a conﬂict is to make
sure that people who are ﬂeeing violence have access to health and education for their
children. Improving living conditions of both internal and external refugees will there-
fore support recovery.

6     The Role of Expectations for Investment
An important factor in ensuring recovery is capital accumulation in the post war period.
It is here that political risk of the resurgence of violence could have a very direct impact.
If potential investors believe that future disruptions through violence are likely then
they will stay back.36 The lack of investment then makes the economy less resilient.
     Measuring expectations and their impact is diﬃcult. We therefore approach the
topic in four ways. First, we discuss the literature which has found a direct impact of
changes in expectations and asset prices and investment. Second, we turn towards four
cases of strong recoveries and show their that economic activity is strongly correlated
with the return of refugees to the country. Third we show, using several surveys, that
ﬁrms report political risk and political instability as a major obstacle to their economic
activity. There is some evidence that the perception of this risk is related to past
violence. Forth, we use a model of expected violence to show that this can explain
patterns of foreign investments in a post conﬂict context quite well.37

6.1     The Literature
It is an accepted truth in macroeconomics that expectations are an important driver
of economic activity. Empirical work has, for example, used news shocks to identify
their eﬀect. Ramey (2011) argues, for example, that economic activity reacts to the
news about government spending shocks. Taking news into account is therefore crucial
to understand the eﬀect of these spending shocks. Bruckner and Pappa (2015) analyze
bidding for the Olympic Games using panel data for 188 countries during the period
1950-2009. They argue that the bid attracts considerable inﬂows of investment several
years before the Games. In other words, it is not the Olympic games that drive
an improvement in economic activity but the expectation of the Games coming to a
country.
    More speciﬁcally, there is mounting evidence for the role of expectations in the
context of episodes of violence. Zussman et al. (2008) and Willard et al. (1996) show
that asset prices during conﬂict react to important conﬂict events like battles or cease-
ﬁre agreements. Events that change expectations on the ﬁnal outcome of conﬂict
therefore have direct economic eﬀects. Abadie and Dermisi (2008) show that following
the 9/11 terrorist attacks oﬃce vacancy rates increased at the three main landmark
buildings in downtown Chicago relative to nearby buildings. Markets also diﬀerentiate
events according to how they aﬀect an ongoing conﬂict. Zussman and Zussman (2006)
show that the Israeli stock market does react strongly to the assassinations of senior
leaders of the Palestinian terrorist organizations: negatively in the case of political
leaders but positively in the case of military leaders.

      In this perspective, Appel and Loyle (2012) analyze the role of Post Conﬂict Justice (PCJ) in-
stitutions have in attracting FDI in post conﬂict countries. They argue that post-conﬂict states that
adopt PCJ are more likely to receive higher levels of FDI compared with post-conﬂict states that
refrain from implementing these institutions.

insurgency which occurred between 1981 and 1993 as a case study. In districts aﬀected
by terroristic attacks, the long-term yearly investments in agricultural technology is
reduced by around 17 percent. This contraction turns in to an average reduction of
farmers’ income of 4 percent.
    Besley and Mueller (2012) study the eﬀect of violence on house prices in Northern
Ireland. They show that the peace process and its corresponding decline in violence led
to an increase of house prices in the most aﬀected regions compared to other regions.
Their paper oﬀers a way to understand the heterogeneity of these changes across regions
which directly link to the role of expectations. They ﬁnd that house prices in Belfast
increased by 6 to 16 percent due to changes in expected violence in the peace process.

6.2    Political Risk in Enterprise Surveys
Political risk consistently features as a crucial constraint to economic activity in enter-
prise surveys. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), for example,
provides surveys for a number of years each of which show that multinational en-
terprises report political risks as a key factor for investment in developing countries.
Especially for economic activity which requires a mid-term perspective of three years
and more political risk is crucial. However, the term political risk captures “the prob-
ability of disruption of the operations of multinational enterprises by political forces or
events” which is clearly related to political violence but not necessarily larger in con-
ﬂict countries. In this regard MIGA (2011) is particularly useful as it collected data
particularly for risk in Conﬂict-Aﬀected and Fragile (CAF) economies. The report
stresses that these countries are ranked as particularly risky. The three main channels
of transmission of political risk to foreign investors in CAF countries are:

   • the possible destruction of assets resulting from conﬂict itself;

   • the unavailability of inputs and adequate human resources;

   • abrupt declines in domestic demand, leading to lasting impoverishment that per-
     sists beyond the end of hostilities.



    For investors in CAF states, past losses appear directly related to divestment: 22
percent of MNEs surveyed say that political risk in CAF countries has resulted in
scaling back, canceling or delaying their investments.
    Perhaps more surprisingly political risk and insecurity also appear to be important
constraints for local ﬁrms. The enterprise survey conducted by the World Bank in a
large set of countries asks whether political instability is an obstacle to the operations
of the respective establishment. Only 35 percent of all establishments report that
political instability is no constraint. Ten percent report that political instability is the
worst constraint they face, i.e. more important than about 10 other factors including
ﬁnance, corruption or regulation. Furthermore, the tendency of enterprises to report
that political instability is an obstacle to their operations is positively associated with
                                            43

civil conﬂict. Countries with more intense violence in their past are much more likely
to host ﬁrms that report being constrained by political instability. We illustrate this
in two ﬁgures. Figure 11 shows the share of ﬁrms reporting that political instability
is no constraint on the y-axis and the log of the sum of past battle related deaths per
capita on the x-axis. Firms in countries like India, Turkey or Ethiopia with past violent
episodes that were small compared to their population, report constraints close to the
overall average. In these countries more than 50 percent report that instability is not
a constraint on their activity. This changes dramatically in countries that were heavily
aﬀected by violence in the past. Firms in Yemen, South Sudan and Afghanistan are
almost all somewhat constrained by political instability. In Figure 12 we show the
share of ﬁrms reporting that political instability is the worst constraint. The share
is increasing in past violence and, strikingly, is higher than 20 percent in the most
heavily aﬀected countries. We will return to this data after we have discussed a model
of expectations in the following section.

6.3     Foreign Investment During Recovery
Data on internal investments is quite patchy or nonexistent in a post conﬂict context.
We therefore approach this issue from a foreign investment perspective. Foreign invest-
ments are both a proxy for investment more general and for the particular interest of
foreigners in the local economy. We use four diﬀerent datasets on foreign investments:
a unique data set from the Dutch Central Bank, data from the OECD, data from the
UNCTAD and data from the World Bank. Details are discussed in the appendix.
    In what follows we focus on net-ﬂows of foreign investments. These are relatively
noisy compared to gross ﬂows but we stick to them nonetheless for two reasons. First,
it ensures comparability across investment from the diﬀerent sources we use. Second,
results can be interpreted directly as the net amount of foreign investment attracted
by the country.
    To give a ﬁrst impression of investment ﬂows Figure 13 plots mean positive net
ﬂows in conﬂict and recovery periods. The blue line shows the average investment
in countries that were in their ﬁrst ten years of recovery, i.e. after conﬂict ended.38
The red line shows the average investment ﬂow in the same set of countries but instead
during the last ten years of conﬂict, i.e. before conﬂict ends.39 The most obvious feature
of this comparison is a large uptick in investment ﬂows during recovery episodes after
2005. Average positive investment ﬂows from OECD countries was over 500 million
USD for most of this period and reaches a peak of 2.5 billion USD in year 2008. In
contrast, average inﬂows during conﬂict episodes is generally lower than the average
  38
      The deﬁnition of conﬂict we use here is based on battle related deaths PRIO/UCDP. A country
is deﬁned as being in conﬂict if it suﬀers more than 0.00008 deaths per capita. The recovery period
is deﬁned as the ﬁrst 10 peacefull years after a conﬂict ends. Results are robust to variations of this
period.
   39
      We use the last ﬁve years as this autmatically means that the end of the conﬂict is in the sample
period which makes the two curves comparable. The picture does not change qualitatively if we look
a the entire conﬂict period. In order to make conﬂict ﬂows more comparable to the recovery period
we show the four-year lag of ﬂows during conﬂict, i.e. the number for 2004 refers to average ﬂows
during the year 2000.

positive investment ﬂow during recovery. Moreover, the large boom in inﬂows in the
post 2005 period is less marked. Note, that the deviation between the two groups
rises around a time in which globalization took oﬀ, i.e. countries in recovery joined a
globalized network of production and expanding multinational ﬁrms.



    However, this is obviously not conclusive evidence for the role played by recovery
from conﬂict as the samples of these two groups changes slightly across time. In order
to get around this problem we will use country ﬁxed eﬀect regressions. Country ﬁxed
eﬀects regressions allow us to look at changes of inﬂows in the same country across
time. Figure 14 displays the example of Uganda. The graph shows battle-related
deaths as red bars and investment ﬂows as a blue line. The timing of the increase in
inﬂows coincides quite clearly with the end of violence. Fixed eﬀects regressions help
to identify this sort of dynamics.

                         Foreign Investment and Refugees
    Figures 15 and 16 display four case studies: Uganda, Sierra Leone, Nicaragua
and Cambodia. All four countries experienced extreme levels of violence and are
relatively poor. In order to highlight the role of refugees as both a symptom and
driving force of recoveries we compare the stock of refugees who lived outside of
these countries to time-series of a) GDP per capita and b) foreign investment
inﬂows.
    Time series of the stock of refugees and GDP are in the top panels in Figures
15 and 16. GDP per capita is displayed as a red line and is on a log scale. Refugees
are meant as refugee stocks outside the country and are displayed as a blue line.
We indicate the last peak of refugee stocks by a dashed line. In Uganda the stock
of refugees gets to its last peak in 1985 and it falls sharply during the following two
years. In the bottom we display total foreign investment inﬂows from all OECD
countries together with refugees. Inﬂows are given relative to the average ﬂows in
the same year to prevent results driven by the waves of globalization in the 1990s
and 2000s.
    There is a striking pattern in all four countries. The point of return for refugees,
marked by the dashed line, anticipates any noticeable economic recovery in most
cases except Cambodia. Foreign investment only really picks up after the number
of refugees has decreased signiﬁcantly. The timing here is quite stark and happens
with a signiﬁcant delay to the recovery in GDP per capita.

    We follow Besley and Mueller (2015a) and analyze international investment ﬂows
in a ﬁxed eﬀects Pseudo Poisson framework. The investment ﬂow at the country level
is given by
                      E {xit } = exp (αc + γ0 ∗ peaceit + log Xt )              (9)
where xit is the inﬂow of investment in country i in year t. We use the exposure model
which controls for global investment ﬂows through Xt . The regression with total inﬂows
as an exposure variable can be thought of as modeling the annual rate of investment
inﬂows into a country in each year.40 The variable peaceit is a dummy that takes a
value of 1 in all years with peace. We lag this variable by one year to allow for the fact
that investment needs some planning and will not react immediately to changes in the
host country. We expect γ0 > 0 if inﬂows increase after the end of conﬂict.
    It is likely that eﬀects of violence will be most visible if the conﬂict has been intense
in terms of battle related deaths per capita. Yet, the right cut-oﬀ for the peace dummy
is a priori not clear. India, for example, is coded as in conﬂict throughout the period if
we choose a very low threshold. Choosing a higher cut-oﬀ means we treat low intensities
as experiencing no conﬂict. In order to understand the role of threshold we use the fact
that we have seven diﬀerent data sets on investment ﬂows from four diﬀerent sources.41
We can therefore take a pragmatic approach and run regressions at diﬀerent cutoﬀs
with all the diﬀerent data sets we have and discuss the results jointly. Results are
presented in Figure 17. Each point in the graph is a point estimate of γ0 .42 The Y-axis
displays the magnitude of this coeﬃcient.



    The message from Figure 17 is quite clear. The end of civil war is associated
with large positive changes in foreign investment inﬂows - regardless which dataset
we use. Estimates vary somewhat but lie around 0.5 which implies that investment
inﬂows increase by 50 percent on average. The second observation is that at a cut-oﬀ
between 0.005 and 0.02 battle-related deaths per 1000 population all point estimates
move up and very close together. In other words, across a large variation of investment
measures results are fairly similar.43 This means that at these cutoﬀs we have divided
countries with similar experiences above and below the threshold. In what follows we
focus on the threshold of 0.008 battle related deaths per 1000 population. Observations
below this threshold are, for example, from China, the United Kingdom, the Russian
Federation, India and Bangladesh. In all these cases violence probably did not aﬀect
the entire economy notably. In what follows we focus on positive net ﬂows, i.e. we
subtract outﬂows from inﬂows and code negative numbers as 0s. Our results are robust
to using gross inﬂows but as these are not provided by all sources.
  40
      See Frome (1983) for a discussion of using the Poisson model to study rates. For a general discus-
sion of count data models, see Cameron and Trivedi (2013). Our results are also robust to using year
ﬁxed eﬀects instead of exposure.
   41
      The reason is that the OECD data, the Dutch Central Bank data and the UN data allows us to
distinguish between net ﬂows and gross ﬂows.
   42
      We also distinguish two diﬀerent ways of calculating the cut-oﬀ of intensity using contemporaneous
and average population in a country. In total we therefore have 14 diﬀerent estimates per cut-oﬀ.
   43
      Each coeﬃcient is also estimated quite precisely at this cut-oﬀ.
                                                  50
       Figure 17: Peace and Foreign Inﬂow Across Cut-oﬀs and Data Sources




    The basic results are in Table 8 which shows results for equation (9) using the
threshold of 0.008 battle-related deaths per 1000 population. According to this the
investment from OECD countries was almost 70 percent larger in peacetime than during
conﬂict. The ﬂows from other data sources shows an increase of between 35 and 50
percent. The consistency of this result across very diﬀerent datasets is striking. Note
also that the average change in inﬂows implied by these rates is very large. In 2012,
average inﬂows in the World Bank dataset were over 9.5 billion USD and over 3 billion
USD in the OECD data. Our estimates therefore imply a gain of between 2 billion and
4 billion USD in yearly inﬂows for countries which emerge from conﬂict.

    In order to understand the dynamics of recovery it is useful to understand the
dynamics of this change around the end of conﬂict. For this purpose we add a set of
dummies to the equation above. We construct a dummy that indicates the start of
recovery and add three forward and lag dummies to trace average investment around
this date. As before we always lag the explanatory variables by one year. Results
for the OECD data are shown in Figure 18. Each point of the solid line displays the
inﬂow of investments compared to an average conﬂict year. The dashed lines display 90
percent conﬁdence intervals around this line. The graph shows that the last three years
of conﬂict are not very diﬀerent from the average conﬂict years in terms of investment
inﬂow. A year after the end of conﬂict, inﬂows increase dramatically and stay up
thereafter. Three years after the end of conﬂict inﬂows have about doubled compared
to the last years of conﬂict.

    In summary, foreign investment soars with the end of conﬂict. The size of the eﬀect
is very large and suggests that there could be signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts from the
end of conﬂict. While this is an interesting ﬁnding on its own right it does not reveal
anything about the possible link to expectations regarding recovery. Before we discuss
this issue we introduce a basic model to guide further results.

6.4     Expectations and Investment: A Model
Investments are actions that lead to costs in the present and, potentially, returns in the
future. As such they are a key mechanism by which resurgent violence, if anticipated,
can aﬀect economic activity even during peace. Besley and Mueller (2012) propose
a model to think about future expectations of violence and ﬁnd that it can explain
housing prices in Northern Ireland quite well.44 Their main idea is to model violence
as a two-states Markov Chain.
    The model supposes that there are two states: conﬂict and peace. Conﬂict in
country i in year t is denoted sit = 1 and peace is denoted sit = 0. Assume that
countries are characterized by two probabilities which are assumed constant across
time. The ﬁrst probability pi determines how likely it is that a period of conﬂict is
followed by another period of conﬂict. Analogously the probability qi captures the
likelihood that a period of peace is followed by another period of peace. The following
table captures the whole model.

                                    conﬂict next year peace next year
                  conﬂict this year         pi            1 − pi
                   peace this year       1 − qi              qi

If there is conﬂict in country i this year then there is a likelihood of pi that the country
will be in conﬂict next year as well. There will be a probability 1 − pi that conﬂict
has ended and the country is in peace. Similarly, if country i is in peace this year
there is a probability of 1 − qi that the country will experience conﬂict next year. The
stability of peace is qi in this model. Low levels of qi imply that country i cannot keep
the peace for long periods in a row. If investors know this then investment might stay
away despite the fact that a country is in peace.
    To see the impact of pi and qi on investment, note that the likelihood of peace next
year is given by

                    Pr(peace next year) = (1 − pi ) ∗ sit + qi ∗ (1 − sit )

which is saying that the probability of peace next year switches from 1 − pi to qi when
a country transitions enters recovery. That is, expectations change more in transition
if pi and qi are large. We expect, for example, little changes in investments if investors
can anticipate peace to be unstable (low qi ).
    In practice qi could obviously vary by time as well. This will depend on what factors
are taken into account by investors. If forecasts of instability are based on factors like
political institutions, ethnic composition, climate or the availability of natural resources
then we do not expect qi to vary with time as these factors are ﬁxed or only slowly
moving. However, given our discussion of refugees, for example, we expect at least
some factors to be time-varying.
  44
    Besley and Mueller (2015a) show that an adaption of the same model can make sense of investment
data more generally.

6.5    The Role of Expectations: Evidence
From the model presented in the previous section we expect changes in investments
to be largest if pi and qi are large. The simplest possible way to calculate these two
values is to calculate
                               conﬂict years - transitions to peace
                        pi =
                                          conﬂict years
and
                               peace years - transitions to conﬂict
                        qi =
                                           peace years
for each country i. We then interact the peace dummy in (9) with these values to
see whether there is any heterogeneity with regard to the persistence of peace and
war. Table 9 shows the result in columns (1) and (2). Indeed, transitions to peace are
particularly beneﬁcial in terms of investment ﬂows if peace in the country is persistent,
i.e. if qi is high. Somewhat surprisingly, pi is not associated with any heterogeneous
eﬀects. This pattern is fairly robust across the other FDI data sources (except for data
from the UN) and exclusion of outliers like Israel. It is also economically meaningful.
If we take the coeﬃcient in column (1) we get that a change of persistence by 10
percentage points, from say 0.9 to close to 1 raises investment ﬂows in peacetime by
about 15 percent.
    What drives this heterogeneity? Up until now we assumed qi to be constant over
time and both forward and backward looking. If investors have an understanding of
the conditions in the respective country then this might not be the best model of
expectations. Instead, it could be that investors have a model to forecast instability
which is taking factors like the quality of a cease-ﬁre agreement into account. Investors
could know, for example, that the stability of peace (qit ) rises sharply with the duration
of peace - from only 72 percent in the ﬁrst year after conﬂict to about 90 percent ﬁve
years later. This implies that the ﬁrst ﬁve years after conﬂict feature a particularly
high risk of relapsing, i.e. low qit . Only about 40 percent of all recoveries last longer
than ﬁve years. To explore this, we construct a dummy that takes a value of 1 in the
ﬁrst ﬁve years of recovery. In column (3) we show that the dummy takes on a negative
sign but is insigniﬁcant. In light of Figure 18 this is not surprising. If investors would
systematically wait with their investments we would expect slowly increasing ﬂows in
recovery which is not what we see.
    However, if investors are able to distinguish situations which are stable from those
that are not then we expect investment to be linked to actual future outcomes. In
column (4) we test this by adding an additional dummy which takes a value of 1 if
the country is during its ﬁrst ﬁve years of recovery but will re-enter conﬂict within the
next ﬁve years. This dummy captures the actual fragility of peace in the crucial ﬁrst
ﬁve years of recovery. Adding this leads to a striking result, inﬂows are signiﬁcantly
lower in situations which are fragile. Without fragility, the increase in inﬂows is now 80
percent instead of 66 percent. Inﬂows in years of fragile peace are 40 percent lower. Of
course, reverse causality is a serious concern here: perhaps it is that investment inﬂows
secured stable peace and not the other way around. However, given the interview
                                             54
results discussed above it appears at least plausible that forward looking multinationals
develop a notion of the risk of reversal to conﬂict and react to it.

  gression with an exposure variable capturing global positive net investment ﬂows in the OECD sample. “Peace”
  is a dummy that takes a value of 1 in country i during year t there is no civil war, deﬁned as violence above an
  intensity of 0.008 battle-related deaths per 1000 inhabitants. “Persistence of peace” is the likelihood, calculated
  at the country level that a year of peace is followed by another year of peace. “Persistence of conﬂict” is the like-
  lihood that a year of conﬂict is followed by another year of conﬂict. “First ﬁve years of peace” is a dummy that
  indicates if the end of the most recent conﬂict has been less than ﬁve years ago. “Fragile peace” is a dummy that
  takes a value of 1 if a year is peaceful, within ﬁve years of the last conﬂict and reverts back to conﬂict within the
  next ﬁve years.



    We illustrate this channel by estimating an actual risk model for the critical period
of the ﬁrst ﬁve years after conﬂict and bringing this model to the FDI data. The
technique we deploy is akin to a two stage least squares IV estimation. We ﬁrst
estimate a risk model and then use the ﬁtted values of this model to explain investment.
However, the aim here is not to provide identiﬁcation but to illustrate the plausibility of
the idea that multinationals build expectations based on observables and are inﬂuenced
by these in their decision to invest. The model we use is based on two variables
highlighted in this report: “political exclusion” and “refugees”. In Table 10 column (1)
we use the share of the population that is excluded from political power, the share of the
population that is discriminated, the number of refugees per capita and a dummy that
indicates the absence of refugees to predict fragility. In this regression we focus on all
years that were ﬁve years after conﬂict and use our explanatory variables to distinguish
the years that are followed by a relapse to conﬂict from those that do not. All variables
have the expected sign and are signiﬁcantly correlated with conﬂict relapse. The ﬁtted
values from this risk model vary between 0.12 and 0.88 and have a mean of 0.25.
    In columns (2) to (5) of Table 10 we bring these numbers to the various foreign
investment data. We use the ﬁtted values instead of the actual fragility dummy and set
all years outside of the ﬁrst ﬁve years after conﬂict equal to zero. Expected fragility,
estimated with refugees and political exclusion, explains foreign direct investment ex-
tremely well. An increase by 10 percentage points in the estimated fragility is associated
with a reduction of ﬂows by about 50 percentage points. In Table 11 we use FDI data
from OECD dataset. We show that this result is robust to adding a large set of controls
like democracy scores, log-GDP and growth of GDP. What is more, we can even add
                                                          55
the original variables used to predict fragility as controls without changing results. It is
only in the post-war period that exclusion and refugees become a factor that inﬂuences
foreign investment ﬂows. Finally, the results we ﬁnd are robust across all datasets of
foreign investment we use.
    These results make it at least plausible that political exclusion and refugees matter
because they predict a relapse to more intense violence. As ﬁnal piece of evidence
for this idea we use data on political short and mid-term credit risk from the Belgian
insurer Delcredere Ducroire (ONDD). We collected data on political risk evaluations
from ONDD who, according to their annual report, insured transactions worth about 7
billion EUR in 2011. The variable we use measures the risk of a credit default for rea-
sons beyond the control of the debtor, i.e. due to political or ﬁnancial macroeconomic
events. We choose this variable because it provides the most consistent time-series
in the ONDD data. ONDD measures both short- and mid-term risk on a scale from
1 (low risk) to 7 (high risk). Table 12, columns (1) and (4) show that risk ratings
are decreasing in peacetime. Note that, as before, we control for country ﬁxed eﬀects
which implies that we look at changes within country. Within-country risk falls signif-
icantly in peacetime. The eﬀect is also economically meaningful - about one quarter
of a standard deviation in the case of short term risks. In columns (2) and (5) we
show the speciﬁcation in which we add a dummy for the ﬁrst ﬁve years of recovery and
fragile peace. The coeﬃcient on fragile peace is positive and of similar size in both
cases. Mid-term risk is evaluated signiﬁcantly higher in periods that are followed by
conﬂict. In columns (3) and (6) we include the ﬁtted values gained from a regression
of fragility on refugees and political exclusion. Again the ﬁtted values predict higher
risk evaluations by ONDD. The estimate is not very precise but quantitatively large
both for short- and mid-term evaluations. A rise in the ﬁtted risk by 10 percentage
points coincides with an increase in risk evaluations by 0.08 to 0.16. Evaluations like
this have real-life repercussions as they are used to decide on insurance premiums.
    Our results signal a clear margin for policy. Attracting foreign investment appears
to be a lot harder if a government excludes or even discriminates against parts of the
population and refugees have not returned to their homes. We argue that this is true
even if investors only care about stability. In this view, investment can be attracted to
a country through policies that de-escalate conﬂict and commit the warring parties to
peace in the period right after violence stops.

7      Access to Power and Institutions
Inequality across ethnic groups has been documented in the literature as one of the
main potential sources of conﬂict. Besley and Persson (2011) present a theoretical
framework in which ﬁghting for control of the state is an important reason for conﬂict.
Cederman et al. (2010) provide quantitative evidence suggesting that outbreaks of
armed conﬂicts are the result of competing ethnonationalist claims to state power.
Cederman et al. (2013) ﬁnd also that disadvantaged and advantaged ethnic groups
have higher propensity of entering into conﬂict but only where there is also political
exclusion. Buhaug et al. (2014) show that countries with very poor (compared to
the national average) ethnic groups and those with large discriminated groups from
national politics are more likely to experience an armed conﬂict.
    What are the sources of this inequality across ethnic groups? Burgess et al. (2015)
provide an answer to this question by exploring the link between access to power,
political institutions and inequality in the allocation of public investments. They show
evidence for strong ethnic favoritism using variation in political leadership and data on
road building in Kenyan districts across the 1963-2011 period. Most importantly, they
show that this favoritism in road investments vanishes during periods of "democracy".
The authors argue that in the African context where presidential power is based on
ethnicity, even weak democratic institutions translate into a decrease in favoritism
towards groups in power as political leaders are forced to share public goods across
the wider population. Hodler and Raschky (2014) also ﬁnd that sub-national regions
have more intense night light when being the birth region of the current political leader
and this favoritism is most prevalent in countries with weak political institutions and
poorly educated citizens.45
    At the country level, institutions have often been linked to diﬀerences in mean
economic performance. However, the fact that strong institutions keep conﬂict from
escalating will obviously also have an impact on volatility. In this aspect our work
relates to recent research that shows that growth volatility is higher for countries with
weak institutional constraints. Besley and Mueller (2015b) show that countries with
weak executive constraints have a chance of experiencing negative growth which is
about 50 percent higher compared to countries with strong constraints. Also they are
more than twice as likely to have a growth rate below -5% and are over three times
more likely to experience a growth rate below -10%. The authors argue that this eﬀect
is driven by the fact that weak executive constraints increase the risk of observing
a prolonged period of economic contraction. In the absence of strong executive con-
straints, we expect the misallocation of public goods suggested by Burgess et al. (2015)
to translate into cross ethnic group inequalities. These inequalities lead to a higher
risk of conﬂict outbreak as shown in Alesina et al. (2015) which in turn increases the
risk of a prolonged period of contraction. The conﬂict mechanism is valid even when
a country does not actually experience two-sided violence. For example, massive in-
vestments in state repression capacity by ethnic groups in power might keep the lid on
  45
    They use a panel of 38,427 sub-national regions from 126 countries with yearly observations from
1992 to 2009.


                                                60
violent conﬂict. Besley and Mueller (2015a) argue that foreign investors seem to know
that growth volatility changes with strong executive constraints and therefore react
signiﬁcantly to their adoption.
    In summary, the literature suggests that a lack of constraints on executive power at
the country level could play a key role in building inequalities across regions and ethnic
groups. In the absence of strong executive constraint, we expect regions populated
by ethnic groups that have access to executive power to perform better relative to
others due to ethnic favoritism. Conversely, excluded ethnic groups should experience
relatively worse economic performance compared to other groups in the absence of such
constraints. 46
    To test these hypothesis we use data on ethnic groups’ access to executive power
and night light intensity from the GROWup Research Front-End (RFE Release 2.0)
dataset and executive constraint data from the Polity IV dataset. We use night light
intensity as a proxy for economic activity at the ethnic group level.47 Night light
data has the beneﬁt of being available on a yearly basis and of being measured at the
local level where there is poor availability of statistical data. As in previous sections
we follow Henderson et al. (2012) who argue that the relationship between GDP and
night light at the country level can be expressed fairly well in a constant elasticity
model in which an increase of night light by 1 percent implies an increase of GDP of
about 0.25 percent. Hodler and Raschky (2014) also look at the relationship between
log nighttime light intensity and log GDP at the regional level using the panel data of
regional GDP per capita assembled by Gennaioli et al. (2013) 48 and they conﬁrm that
the relationship is linear and also ﬁnd an elasticity of around 0.3.
    Access to political power is ranked on a scale from 1 to 7 in the GROWup dataset.
Ethnic groups are "powerful" (monopoly of power or dominant group in power), have
access to central power through a formal system of power sharing (as "Senior" or "Ju-
nior" partner) or are “excluded” from power (self excluded, powerless or discriminated).
    Strong executive constraint is measured as a dummy indicating whether or not we
have executive parity or subordination of the executive at the country level, a value 7
for “xconst” variable in Polity IV dataset.
    Our main empirical speciﬁcation to test our hypothesis is as follows :


 log (lightpc)i,j,t = β ∗ P ower_Statusi,j,t + γ ∗ P ower_Statusi,j,t × exconsthighi,t
                    + Ci,t + ηj + i,j,t

   Where log (lightpc)i,j,t is the logarithm of per capita night light intensity for ethnic
group j in country i at time t. The variable exconsthigh is a dummy for strong
executive constraint at the country level. P ower_Status is the power access status
(powerful or excluded) of the diﬀerent ethnic groups. Ci,t is a set of country/year
dummies to control for shocks and changes that are common to all ethnic groups within
a country/year, as well as for changes in satellites and their sensor settings. We also
 46
    The discussion in this section relies on Mueller and Tapsoba (2015).
 47
    We divide night light by (interpolated) ethnic group population size to have a per capita variable.
 48
    They provide regional GDP per capita for 1,503 regions from 82 countries.
                                                 61
include ethnic group ﬁxed eﬀects to control for ethnic groups’ permanent unobserved
characteristics.
    The results in table 13 show that, in absence of strong executive constraints, being
an excluded ethnic group decreases night light intensity by 8.2% on average, which is
equivalent to a decrease of 2.5% in GDP per capita.49 However, this eﬀect vanishes
when strong executive constraints are present. Discriminated groups do not system-
atically perform worse compare to other groups in countries with strong constraints.
These results are robust to the inclusion of lagged dependent variable as control in
column (3).50
    Our interpretation of these ﬁndings is that having less political to power from one
period to another does not make powerful ethnic groups poorer than others. How-
ever, it makes them fall behind relatively to other groups. Conversely, groups that
were previously excluded from access to power will not be immediately richer than
other groups in the same country, but they will see a signiﬁcant improvement in their
economic activity.
    Column (2) shows that being dominant or having a monopoly on executive power
increases per capita light intensity by 8.5% corresponding to a 2.6% increase of GDP per
capita only when executive constraints are weak. This eﬀect also vanishes completely
with strong executive constraints. Column (4) shows that these estimates are robust
to the inclusion of lagged night light as well.
    Hence, our results conﬁrm the absence of ethnic favoritism (at least as captured by
levels of night light) in countries with strong executive constraints. These results go
beyond the ﬁndings in Burgess et al. (2015) and suggest that ethnic favoritism is a gen-
eral phenomenon. This makes executive constraints a key mediating factor in conﬂict.
In this context it is useful to come back to the main argument in Besley and Persson
(2011) who ﬁnd that factors which do otherwise predict political violence lose their bite
in the presence of strong political constraints. Their explanation is that government
has to distribute rents more equally in the presence of strong executive constraints.
The results presented in this section lend a lot of credibility to this argument.




  49
     Henderson et al. (2012) estimated elasticity between log GDP and log Night light intensity to be
around 0.3.
  50
     Results including group ﬁxed eﬀects and lagged dependent variables suﬀer however from the well-
known bias (Nickell, 1981). The presence of auto-correlation in error term here make it impossible
to have consistent estimates with both lagged dependent variables and group ﬁxed eﬀects. Angrist
and Pischke (2008) recommend estimating a speciﬁcation with ﬁxed eﬀects (but no lagged dependent
variable) and one with the lagged dependent variable (but no ﬁxed eﬀects) in case of doubt and argue
that the true eﬀect should lie between these two estimates. Here we believe more in the group ﬁxed
eﬀects speciﬁcation.

8     Conclusions
Economic growth before and after conﬂict seems, on average, only marginally lower
than in non-conﬂict countries. Cycles of violence are the single most important reason
for the lack of long term development in these countries. Interestingly, this is what
Aguiar and Gopinath (2007) ﬁnd for emerging markets more generally: the cycle is the
trend. In this respect political violence could be regarded as a leading cause of extreme
volatility. This focus on conﬂict has led to a particular angle on the recovery process.
In what follows we describe the corollaries of this view in more detail.

8.1    Measure Expectations
As the section on expectations and foreign investment illustrates, expectations could be
a crucial factor in explaining economic activity in recovery. The change from a situation
which appears stable to one which does not can make the diﬀerence between a doubling
of investment inﬂows and no change at all. This means a crucial role in policy making
goes to measuring expectations. Otherwise feedback to policy is impossible. Standard
possibilities are stock markets and exchange rates. Our research adds refugee streams
as an additional possibility.
    Apart from these beneﬁts the return of refugees can also be regarded as the ultimate
measure of success for policy makers. Our ﬁndings throughout the report indicate that
the return of refugees is closely associated with contemporaneous and future economic
growth. At the same time, the return of refugees is a strong predictor of capital
inﬂows. Our interpretation of these facts is that individuals hold information about
the conditions at their former homes which are useful to policy makers. Government
policies of reconciliation and recovery work if people decide to return.

8.2    Alleviate the Humanitarian Crisis
Our results point to a special role of played by the humanitarian relief eﬀort especially
targeted at the development of children. The evidence suggests that this relief eﬀort
helps not only help in the short run but has long run eﬀects on economic development.
We have shown that humanitarian crisis of the dimensions experienced in Afghanistan
or Syria imply that labor productivity in the aﬀected population is lowered signiﬁcantly,
irreversibly and for the duration of a whole generation. Our results suggest that the
economic costs caused at the micro level are so big that they show up at the macro
level.
    This is important because humanitarian relief eﬀorts are currently not suﬃcient
to help refugees adequately. For example, the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan
(3RP) in Syria, an appeal for funding by UN agencies and NGOs, lists a funding
gap of USD 3.47 billion in March 2015. At the time a preliminary analysis of the
Comprehensive Food Security Monitoring Exercise (CFSME) in Jordan indicated that
the proportion of Syrian refugee households considered food insecure or vulnerable to
food insecurity had risen from 47 percent in 2014 to 86 percent in 2015. According to
the report, underfunding of the 3RP would include further cuts to food assistance to

                                           64
1.6 million people across the region. A staggering 1.7 million refugees would face the
winter without heating fuel, insulation or extra blankets and 752,000 Syrian refugee
children would continue to not participate in education. The report stresses the dire
situation of children more generally pointing out that between 13 to 40 percent of
refugee households in the region admit sending their children to beg or work as an
emergency coping strategy.
    The attention of Western Media to the case might have prevented a worsening
of the situation. However, with 14 million refugees worldwide in 2014 the funding
requirements are enormous and will probably depend crucially on the respective case.
    Mental health is another mechanism which should be addressed. In a recent study
Kaysen et al. (2013) report on the adoption of Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT),
an empirically supported treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to the
population in Kurdistan, Iraq. The adaptation process included addressing training
needs of therapists with little to no training in cognitive–behavioral or manualized
treatments and tailoring CPT for the high rates of illiteracy in the client population
and the speciﬁc beliefs and structures of Kurdish culture. CPT seemed to be well
tolerated by clients and their symptoms appeared to improve.

8.3     Ensure Stability
A ﬁrst, clear priority which emerges from our study is that eﬀorts should be targeted
at preventing violent conﬂict and working towards disabling the root causes of the
respective conﬂict.
    Foreign actors have often a very dubious role in ensuring stability. Foreign policy,
foreign aid and military operations are not, generally, used in the name of stability.51
International coordination and transparency in foreign interventions would therefore
likely lead to a signiﬁcant increase of stability. This implies that there are clear advan-
tages in using multilateral organizations and clear rules for these eﬀorts.
    In what follows we will discuss particular angles on policy arising from the focus
on stability. Remember that the large majority of conﬂicts re-emerge within ﬁve years.
This cycle needs to be broken if economic development is to be ensured. We can
distinguish two key stages in recovery from conﬂict.52 In the ﬁrst stage fear of imminent
attacks has to be replaced by non-violent coexistence of the parties in conﬂict. In the
second stage conﬁdence and trust has to be built. It is important to distinguish these
two as they clearly require diﬀerent policy responses.

8.3.1    The Role of Aid in Stabilization
Donors need to keep in mind that aid ﬂows are rent ﬂows which do not rely on the
capacity of the state as discussed in Besley and Persson (2011). Rent ﬂows have
  51
     Typically, research on this issue has focused on the United States. Dube et al. (2011) present
evidence that US interventions beneﬁt private enterprise. Albornoz and Hauk (2014) ﬁnd that civil
wars around the world are more likely under Republican governments and that the probability of civil
wars decreases with the U.S. presidential approval rates.
  52
     See Sørensen et al. (2003).

                                                65
the eﬀect of increasing incentives to engage in conﬂict unless local actors regard the
distribution of rents as unchangeable. This condition is clearly violated in a conﬂict
situation.
    The literature has found strong support for this. Recent evidence by Nunn and Qian
(2014) shows that the provision of aid can become a source of conﬂict. Their analysis
exploits time variation in food aid shipments due to changes in US wheat production
and cross-sectional variation in a country’s tendency to receive any US food aid. They
ﬁnd that an increase in food aid of 1000 MT by the US raises the likelihood of conﬂict
incidence by 0.3 percentage points. However, they do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant eﬀects during
the recovery period. We conﬁrmed this in our data. If anything, food aid shocks seem
to play a positive role after civil war - at least if we control for the fact that countries
that are more likely to receive food aid are more unstable.
    But even if aid itself works it might increase violence. Crost et al. (2014) estimate
the causal eﬀect of a large development program on conﬂict in the Philippines through
a regression discontinuity design that exploits an arbitrary poverty threshold used to
assign eligibility for the program. They ﬁnd that barely eligible municipalities expe-
rienced a large increase in conﬂict casualties compared to barely ineligible ones. This
increase is mostly due to insurgent-initiated incidents in the early stages of program
preparation. According to Crost et al. (2014) this is because insurgents try to sabotage
the program because its success would weaken their support in the population. A more
optimistic view on aid in the post-conﬂict context comes from the results in Fearon et
al. (2009). They study the impact of a Community-Driven Reconstruction (CDR) pro-
gram which was implemented by a major international nongovernmental organization
in 42 communities in Northern Liberia. They ﬁnd that recipients of the programme
provided more resources in a public good provision experiment that was played later.
    A lot of recent research has taken place in the context of ongoing insurgencies with
US military involvement. This research points towards a complementarity of aid and
security. Beath et al. (2012) study the eﬀect of development aid program on well-
being, attitudes towards the government, and levels of security in surrounding areas in
Afghanistan. They ﬁnd that the program has a positive eﬀect on all three measures
in relatively secure regions, but no eﬀect on attitudes and security in areas with high
levels of initial violence. Research in Berman et al. (2013) on Iraq suggests that it is
the interaction between troop strength and (some) aid programs that reduces violence.
They ﬁnd that spending is more violence-reducing as the number battalions stationed
in a district increases. They also ﬁnd that the presence of Provincial Reconstruction
Teams, their proxy for development expertise, increases the eﬀectiveness of spending
signiﬁcantly.
    This highlights that aid is a double-edged sword. It can clearly have a role but its
eﬀect will depend crucially on whether it can be captured and how well peace can be
kept while it is distributed. A big problem is that foreign interventions and aid are often
not actually driven by needs in the recipient country. Foreign aid is an arm of foreign
policy in many countries and research has demonstrated this quite unambiguously.53

8.3.2    The Role of Peace Missions
UN peacekeeping missions are an important instrument for external actors in the re-
covery period. Here there are no instruments or randomized control trials, which makes
clean identiﬁcation more diﬃcult. Doyle and Sambanis (2000) argue that peace mis-
sions can contribute to peace. Collier (2008) ﬁnds a signiﬁcant correlation between
higher peace duration and peace missions controlling for a large set of economic and
political controls. Doyle and Sambanis (2006) conclude that the deeper the underly-
ing hostility and the shallower the residual state capacity in the aﬀected country, the
greater the international eﬀort required for any successful peace building.
    A main concern for identifying the eﬀect of peace missions is selection which, ac-
cording to Fortna (2008), exerts a downward bias on estimates. Peace missions are
selecting into hard cases so that the eﬀects that are found are a lower bound. However,
there is no consensus in the literature regarding this so that unobserved heterogeneity
remains a concern.54 Gilligan and Sergenti (2007) use matching techniques on a sam-
ple of UN interventions in post-Cold-War to correct for non random assignment of UN
peacekeeping missions and ﬁnd that UN interventions are eﬀective in the sample of
post-civil conﬂict interventions. However, there is no causal eﬀect of UN interventions
while civil wars are still ongoing.
    Disarmament is an obvious element leading over from short term stabilization to
a sustainable peace.55 In 31 months, the Sandinista National Liberation Front in
Nicaragua was reduced from 90,000 members to just 15,520 active soldiers. A staggering
370,000 combatants were demobilized in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the ﬁve years following
the Dayton peace settlement, leading to a noteworthy reduction in the number of
arms in circulation. In Sierra Leone, expectations were even exceeded. Although
previous estimates suggested that 45,000 combatants needed to be demobilized from
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the Civil Defence Forces (CDF) and other
militant groups, in practice no fewer than 75,490 combatants handed in their weapons.
All three countries experienced economic recoveries thereafter.
    There are, however, few reliable studies of the impact of these initiatives. An ex-
ception is Blattman and Annan (2015) who study the importance of job provision
through a randomized experiment in Liberia. They conclude that work training pro-
grams supported by capital inputs decrease the incentives for ex-ﬁghters to pursue
illegal activities.
    The World Bank is committed to DDR and has, for example, been heavily involved
in the planning and implementation of a multi-country demobilization and reintegration
program in the Great Lakes region.56 In its ﬁnal report the Bank writes From the outset
of the MDRP, greater consideration should have been given to the political dimensions
of DDR, which hampered key programs such as in the DRC from moving ahead. (World
  54
     See Fortna (2008) for an excellent discussion.
  55
     For a detailed discussion of DDR’s see Banholzer (2014).
  56
     Of the seven countries involved, Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo (ROC), Rwanda and Uganda, the ROC stands out as
relative failure in the demobilization eﬀort followed by the DRC. It is striking that these are also the
countries with the worst performance of recovery.

Bank (2010), p. 3) This point brings us to one of the core issues of this report. Politics
is at the heart of stable peace and recovery.

8.3.3      Political Exclusion
We ﬁnd both at the country and ethnic group levels that the share of excluded popu-
lation as measured by the GROWup can predict conﬂict. Other recent studies support
the idea that political exclusion has real eﬀects on the distribution of resources, i.e. it
could be part of a latent conﬂict within countries. Exclusion implies huge risks as it
ampliﬁes economic imbalances and could in this way increase the willingness to engage
in violence. In the GROWup data we ﬁnd that countries which exclude more than 20
percent of their population from power are markedly more likely to experience violence
and destabilization. This is particularly interesting as it ﬁts perfectly to the observa-
tion made by Rodrik (1999) more than a decade ago: sudden economic reversals can
be explained by how societies deal with internal conﬂict.
    Strikingly, political exclusion is also a key variable in a recent literature in polit-
ical science that tries to forecast conﬂict out of sample. Goldstone et al. (2010), for
example, come up with a list of risk factors which predict the risk of conﬂict onset
when comparing two countries on the same sub-continent. The list includes state-led
discrimination. A more recent project, the International Crisis Early Warning System
(ICEWS), provides a 3 month prediction of the incidence of events like rebellions, ethnic
conﬂict and insurgencies. Again, the structural variables identiﬁed in this forecasting
exercise include the number of excluded groups and the share of excluded population.
    But can this mechanism be actually addressed by policy? A lot of research has
gone into showing that institutions are essential ingredients for economic development
generally and the results in this report also indicate that they might be key mediating
factors. However, in a post-conﬂict setting changes in formal institutions might not
appear possible or even risky.57 It might then still be possible to introduce informal
institutions. Blattman et al. (2014) study the role of new institutions in support
of the formal ones in the development of Liberia. They argue that the promotion
of “Alternative Dispute Resolution” institutions for the protection of property rights
inhibits local violence.
    The codebook published for the EPR data reveals how these variables are coded.58
All politically relevant ethnic groups were categorized according to the degree of access
to central state power by those who claimed to represent them. State power refers
to executive power only, disregarding access to legislative and judicial institutions.
Depending on where political power is eﬀectively exercised, this can be the presidency,
the cabinet, and senior posts in the administration in democratic regimes; the army
command in military dictatorships; or the ruling party leadership in one-party states.
The three categories included in excluded groups are

       • powerless : Elite representatives hold no political power (or do not have inﬂuence
  57
     Flores and Nooruddin (2009), for example, argue that post conﬂict democratizations hinder growth
because they reduce commitment power.
  58
     See codebook for Vogt et al. (2015).

                                                 68
        on decision making) at the national level of executive power – although without
        being explicitly discriminated against.

   • discriminated : Group members are subjected to active, intentional, and targeted
     discrimination by the state, with the intent of excluding them from political
     power. Such active discrimination can be either formal or informal, but always
     refers to the domain of public politics (excluding discrimination in the socio-
     economic sphere).

   • self-exclusion : The special category of self-exclusion applies to groups that have
     excluded themselves from central state power, in the sense that they control a
     particular territory of the state which they have declared independent from the
     central government.

    From this perspective it should be clear that policy changes are possible on this
dimension. Discriminating policies in particular appear to be part of a political sit-
uation that can escalate into violence. Amending this could be easier than formal
institutional changes. Discrimination by the ethnic group in power could, of course,
be endogenously determined. One part of this is inter-ethnic trust which has received
a lot of attention in recent research.

8.3.4     Trust and Conﬂict
Figure 19 shows the share of people of people who report that "Most people can be
trusted" in the World Value Survey (the alternative is "You can’t be too careful."). The
blue line shows the distribution in countries that have not experienced civil conﬂict
in the sample. The red line shows the distribution of trust in countries that have.
Countries with a conﬂict history show drastically lower levels of trust.
    These ﬁndings are taken up by Rohner et al. (2013b) who argue that this pattern
could be explained by a three-way relationship between interethnic trust, trade and
conﬂict. Low levels of trust lead to low levels of economic interactions which, in turn,
makes conﬂict more likely. Conﬂict, on the other hand, destroys trust. The incidence
of conﬂict can be reduced by policies abating cultural barriers, fostering inter-ethnic
trade and human capital, and shifting beliefs. In this view peacekeeping forces by
themselves or externally imposed regime changes, have no enduring eﬀects.
    Rohner et al. (2013a) bring this idea to data on trust and ethnic identity in Uganda.
Using individual and county-level data, they document large causal eﬀects on trust and
ethnic identity of an outburst of ethnic conﬂicts in 2002–2005. Using data from the
Afrobarometer and ACLED they ﬁnd that more intense ﬁghting decreases generalized
trust and increases ethnic identity. Controlling for the intensity of violence during
the conﬂict, they also document that post-conﬂict economic recovery was slower in
ethnically fractionalized counties. Again, the interpretation of this fact is that trust is
needed for economic activity and that this trust breaks down across ethnic groups.

                   Figure 19: Trust and Conﬂict in the Cross Section




    The problem with a lack of trust and strong group identities is that they penetrate
and pervert formal institutions. The ethnic politics analyzed by Burgess et al. (2015)
is just one example. Shayo and Zussman (2011), for example, use data from Israeli
small claims courts to show that Arab and Jewish judges displayed signiﬁcant judicial
ingroup bias. Furthermore, this bias is strongly associated with terrorism intensity in
the vicinity of the court in the year preceding the ruling. Conﬁdence-building is also a
crucial ingredient for the establishment of a fertile investment climate, which in turn is
a trigger of economic development post conﬂict. This is the core message of the World
Bank Report by Mills and Fan (2006).
    An important role of increasing trust doubtlessly goes to the media. It has been
shown, for example, that hate radio in Rwanda played a critical role in the extent of
ethnic violence during the genocide.59 Other research has shown that media coverage
can have strong eﬀects on political preferences more generally.60 Perhaps the most
direct proof of the crucial role played by the media in the post-conﬂict situation comes
from DellaVigna et al. (2014). The authors exploit variation in radio reception of na-
tionalistic Serbian radio in border regions in Croatia. The authors argue that Croats
listened to Serbian radio for its consumption value but reacted negatively to national-
istic messages intended for Serbian ears. Election results and street surveys are used to
elicit preference for extremist nationalist parties among Croats who are able to listen
to Serbian radio and those that do not. The authors ﬁnd that 3 to 4 percent of those
  59

    See, for example, Enikolopov et al. (2011) and DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) who ﬁnd large
eﬀects on voting shares.

                                             70
Croatians who received the signal radicalized politically. This a relatively small eﬀect
but it nonetheless demonstrates that media messages sent in the aftermath of conﬂict
aﬀect attitudes and behavior.
     Quantitative studies of reconciliation eﬀorts are less common. Staub et al. (2005)
evaluate a training of reconciliation they give to individuals in Rwanda who would then
use this training in their communities. The eﬀects of the training were evaluated not on
the participants in the training, but on people in community groups they subsequently
worked with. The participants in the trained group showed a signiﬁcant reduction in
trauma symptoms, both over time and in relation to the control groups, which showed
slight deterioration. Bert and Marijke (2015) argue that the post conﬂict trials in
Rwanda (gacaca) played an important role in building inter ethnic trust. Trust here
is measured through structured interviews in which respondents are asked to tell their
life. Respondents are also asked for every year to recall their level of trust towards
the other ethnicity. This allows the researchers to construct time series of reported
trust and at the same time link changes in trust to speciﬁc factors. They ﬁnd a robust
recovery in trust in the period 2007-2010 which relates to the unfolding and ending of
the gacaca.
     The impact of justice on stability can even be traced back to our ﬁndings regarding
foreign investment. Appel and Loyle (2012) analyze the role of Post Conﬂict Justice
(PCJ) institutions in attracting FDI in post-conﬂict countries. They show that post-
conﬂict states that adopt PCJ are more likely to receive higher levels of FDI compared
with post-conﬂict states that refrain from implementing these institutions.

Appendix
A1. Robustness Check on Conﬂict Incidence and Economic
Performance
In this appendix we show several robustness checks of the models described in equa-
tion (1). In Table A1 we add to the model described in equation (1) the ﬁrst lag of
GDP/night light per capita growth rate and results are robust to this.61 In order to
exclude the hypothesis that the measured impact is driven by time varying charac-
teristics of the country-level economy rather than conﬂict itself, we ran speciﬁcations
that include country-speciﬁc time trends. Table A2 reports the results. Again, the
estimated coeﬃcients of the “conﬂict incidence” variable are very close to the ones
reported in Table 1.

    Tables A3 and A4 report results obtained from a subsample of countries, i.e. data
used in Miguel and Satyanath (2011) . Table A3 Panel A shows results of the regres-
sion model of equation (1), while Panel B includes the rainfall shocks variables used
in Miguel and Satyanath (2011). Speciﬁcations reported in Table A4 Panel A and
B include country-speciﬁc time trends. Again, results are completely robust. This
suggests that when controlling for the most common instrument for GDP shocks di-
rectly nothing happens to the correlation between violence and GDP growth. This to
us indicates that our results stem from a causal chain that must run the other direction.




  61
    However, this speciﬁcation is not correct, strictly speaking, as it is aﬀected by the so-called “Nickel
bias”. From Nickell (1981) we learn that the demeaning process implemented in ﬁxed eﬀect regressions
creates a correlation between regressors and error.

A2. Recovery after Civil Conﬂict at the Local Level
We explore economic impact of conﬂict and recovery from a group perspective, using
GROWup dataset. This dataset provides satellite night light data at the ethnic group
level. Data is provided on 502 groups for the period 1995-2010. We use night light
as a proxy of economic activity. Conﬂict incidence is deﬁned through more than 25
fatalities in ethnic conﬂict. We run the following regression:

                             git = θi + ηt + βincidenceit + γrecoveryit +                   it


    where git is night light per capita growth of group i in year t, incidenceit is conﬂict
incidence, recoveryit controls for the years that follow the end of the conﬂict, θi and ηt
are group and year ﬁxed eﬀects respectively.
    Table A5 reports the results. In columns (1) and (2) we ﬁnd a negative and sta-
tistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of incidence on per capita light growth. The speciﬁcation of
column (2) suggests a signiﬁcant catch up during the three years after the conﬂict ends.
This recovery is not driven by any speciﬁc phase of the recovery. In fact, this is not
driven by a particular year as shown in column (1). The estimated coeﬃcient of vari-
ables ﬁrst-second-third-fourth year after conﬂict, are all positive but not statistically
signiﬁcant. In columns (3) and (4) we show that the reduction and the increase in light
per capita growth are composed by two factors; light growth falls (raise) during con-
ﬂict (recovery) and this is partially oﬀset by a negative (positive) eﬀect on population
growth.

Figure A1 shows the country-level log of night light in 2013 while the x-axis reports
the number of years a country has been in recovery after the last episode of violence
(violence is deﬁned as a year with at least 0.008 battle related death per 1,000 popula-
tion. We can observe the same pattern shown in Figure 7:62 the relationship between
night light and length of the last recovery is positive.

A4. Robustness Check on Internal Conﬂicts and Refugee Flows
In this appendix, we consider famine episodes as alternative source of refugee move-
ments and we check robustness of the estimates in table 6 when accounting for it.
In the data, we indeed observe a strong correlation between presence of conﬂict and
famine. Descriptive statistics shown in table A6 suggest that we have famine episodes
0.4% of all country-year observations without conﬂict versus 4.2% for country-year
observations with conﬂict (10 times higher).

          Table A6: Descriptive Statistics: Conﬂicts and Famine Episodes
             Variable                            Obs    Mean    Std. Dev.   Min   Max
             Famine incidence without conﬂict   11470   0.004     0.061      0     1
             Famine incidence with conﬂict       1314   0.042     0.200      0     1




    This diﬀerence also holds within countries. When regressing famine incidence on
conﬂict controlling for country ﬁxed eﬀects, the coeﬃcient obtained is positive and
signiﬁcant. This means that even within the same country, famine episodes are more
likely to occur during conﬂict years and this may lead to substantial bias in estimates
shown in table 6.
    However, even after controlling for famine incidence, table A7 shows that these
estimates do not change substantially suggesting that the direct eﬀect of famine on
refugee ﬂows is orthogonal to the eﬀect of conﬂicts on refugee ﬂows.

A5. Recovery after Conﬂict and Peace Stability
Table A8 reports GDP per capita growth rates of a subset of countries. We exclude
countries that, during the observed time period, never had an armed conﬂict and
countries which experienced less than 5 years of recovery. In Panel A we report growth
rates of GDP during four periods: conﬂict years; peace years; ﬁrst ﬁve recovery years
and fragile peace years.63 Panel B reports information about countries that experienced
at least one year of armed conﬂict, but that cannot be classiﬁed as “fragile peace”
countries. As mentioned in the main text, on average, the growth rate of GDP per
capita during recovery period which is followed by conﬂict is not lower than the average
growth rate during recovery.




  63
     A country is in a fragile peace year if it is experiencing one of the ﬁrst ﬁve years of recovery but
will relapse into conﬂict within the next ﬁve years.

     GDP per capita growth rates are computed using data from Penn World Table over the time period 1950-2010. Information is pro-
     vided for a subset of countries. “Conﬂict” is deﬁned as a year in which the number of battle related deaths is greater than zero. In
     Panel A and Panel B countries are sorted by the average growth rate of GDP per capita during the ﬁrst ﬁve years of recovery.
Data Appendix
D1. Uppsala Conﬂict Data Program Battle-Related Dataset
The Uppsala Conﬂict Data Program (UCDP) collects information on a large number
of aspects of armed conﬂicts occurred since 1946. The UCDP provides several datasets
that allow to explore diﬀerent features of armed conﬂicts. In this report we make a large
use of the UCDP Battle-Related Dataset. This dataset provides yearly information on
country-level number of fatalities related to combat, the time period covered is 1946-
2014.
    The data on battle-related deaths is collected through the use of news sources. All
reports which contain information about individuals killed or injured in ﬁghting are
gathered and coded manually into an event-year level dataset. For every event, several
details are recorded and translated into variables: the date and location of the event,
the reporting source, the primary source, the actors involved, what happened, and
three estimates of fatalities caused by the event (low, high, and best estimate).
    For the purpose of the present report, we focus on three variables provided by the
UCDP Battle-Related Dataset that we describe below. These variables describe the
type of the violent event, its location and the estimate of the number of fatalities.

Type of conﬂict
The UCDP/PRIO Armed Conﬂict Dataset identiﬁes four diﬀerent types of conﬂict.
For each conﬂict event coded in the dataset we can distinguish among:

  1. Extra-systemic conﬂict: occurs when a government of a state is ﬁghting to retain
     the control of a territory outside the state system.

  2. Interstate conﬂict: occurs between two or more diﬀerent states.

  3. Internal conﬂict: occurs when the government of a state ﬁghts against one or
     more internal groups. In this type of conﬂict there is no intervention from other
     states.

  4. Internationalized internal conﬂict: occurs when the government of a state ﬁghts
     against one or more internal groups and external states intervene to support one
     or both sides.

   Given that in this report we analyze civil conﬂicts, we only focus on two types of
conﬂict reported in this dataset, namely internal conﬂict and internationalized internal
conﬂict, i.e. conﬂict of types 3 and 4.

Location
In order to assign a location to conﬂict events, we make use of the variable locationinc,
that reports “the name of the country/countries whose government(s) has a primary
claim to the object in dispute”. In case that more than one country name is included,
                                           92
the location is assigned to the country where the conﬂict is fought. If the territory over
which the conﬂict is fought covers more than one country (e.g. the ﬁghting takes place
on the border between two countries), the same estimate is assigned to each country
that is covered by the territory.

Number of battle-related deaths
The UCDP Battle-related deaths Dataset provides three estimates of the number of
fatalities that each violent event implies. These variables are:

   • bdlow : this variable provides the low estimate of the occurred battle related
     deaths for each conﬂict event and year. This estimate is the results of the aggre-
     gation of low estimates for all the fatalities related to battle-related incidents.

   • bdhigh : this variable results from the aggregated high estimates for all battle-
     related incidents in a given conﬂict event and year.

   • bdbest : the estimate consists of the aggregated most reliable numbers for all
     battle-related fatalities in a given conﬂict event and year. If diﬀerent reports
     provide diﬀerent estimates, the estimate provided by the most reliable source is
     provided. If no such distinction can be made, the lowest among these numbers
     is used.

   In this report we mainly use variable bdbest.
   Recall that in the analyzes where we use this data the unit of observation is country-
year. Since the UCDP Battle-related deaths Dataset provides information at conﬂict
event-year level, we aggregate bdlow, bdhigh and bdbest by summing them for each
country year.
   To sum up, we make a three step re-coding of the dataset. We ﬁrst exclude the
observations that are not related to internal conﬂicts. We then locate each observation
to one (or more) country. Finally we sum the estimated battle related deaths by
country-year. We end up with a panel that reports three estimates of battle related
deaths.

D2. Geographical Research on War, Uniﬁed Platform (Growup )
Dataset
Growup federated data platform provides access to disaggregated, integrated and spa-
tially explicit conﬂict related data. It oﬀers research-ready data on ethnic groups
and intrastate conﬂict compiled from various sources and provided in group-year and
country-year format.
    The sample universe of ethnic groups in the RFE group-level data is adopted from
the EPR (Ethnic Power Relations) Core dataset (Cederman et al., 2010). It covers all
countries between 1946 and 2013 except failed states, overseas colonies and countries
with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants. Newly independent states are included in the
dataset beginning with the year of independence. From this country-year list, the EPR
                                           93
Core dataset deﬁnes ethnicity as "any subjectively experienced sense of commonality
based on the belief in common ancestry and shared culture". Only politically relevant
ethnic groups are included in the dataset. An ethnic group is classiﬁed as relevant if
"at least one political organization claims to represent it in national politics or if its
members are subjected to state-led political discrimination". This yields 817 politically
relevant ethnic groups in 141 countries in the EPR Core dataset.

Access to Power
Access to state power at national level for diﬀerent ethnic groups is taken from the
EPR dataset. In this dataset, state power refers to executive power only and disregards
access to legislative and judicial institutions. The coding also focuses on absolute access
to power, rather than under- or over-representation relative to demographic size. EPR
measures power access with a roughly ordinal scale composed of three main categories.
Ethnic groups either control power alone, share it with other ethnic groups, or are
excluded from executive state power. Each of these categories can be divided into
several sub-categories that rank power access on a scale from 1 (discriminated) to 7
(monopoly); self-exclusion ranks at 3. They are described as follows in the EPR 2014
codebook:

   • The group rules alone:

        – Monopoly: Elite members hold monopoly power in the executive to the
          exclusion of members of all other ethnic groups.
        – Dominance: Elite members of the group hold dominant power in the execu-
          tive but there is some limited inclusion of "token" members of other groups
          who however do not have real inﬂuence on decision making.

   • The group shares power:

        – Senior Partner: Representatives of the group participate as senior partners
          in a formal or informal power-sharing arrangement. By power sharing, we
          mean any arrangement that divides executive power among leaders who
          claim to represent particular ethnic groups and who have real inﬂuence on
          political decision making.
        – Junior Partner: Representatives participate as junior partners in govern-
          ment.

   • The group is excluded:

        – Powerless: Elite representatives hold no political power (or do not have inﬂu-
          ence on decision making) at the national level of executive power- although
          without being explicitly discriminated against.



                                            94
           – Discrimination: Group members are subjected to active, intentional, and
             targeted discrimination by the state, with the intent of excluding them from
             political power. Such active discrimination can be either formal or informal,
             but always refers to the domain of public politics (excluding discrimination
             in the socio-economic sphere).
           – Self-exclusion: The special category of self-exclusion applies to groups that
             have excluded themselves from central state power, in the sense that they
             control a particular territory of the state which they have declared indepen-
             dent from the central government".

Ethnic Conﬂicts
The information on ethnic conﬂicts in the RFE group-level data is compiled from two
diﬀerent sources: The ACD2EPR dataset (Wucherpfennig et al., 2012), the UCDP
Actor Dataset (Uppsala Conﬂict Data Program 2014), and the Uppsala/PRIO Armed
Conﬂict Database (ACD) (Gleditsch et al., 2002). The conﬂict data focuses on ethnic
civil wars (Internal, and Interna- tionalized Internal Conﬂicts). For all conﬂict onset
and incidence variables in the RFE group- level dataset, a conﬂict episode is only con-
sidered terminated if there is no conﬂict-related activity in the following two calender
years where "Conﬂict-related activity" refers to the UCDP threshold of at least 25
battle deaths per annum.

Geographical Data
Geographical data (night light intensity and population) at ethnic group level are raster
derived data, created by overlaying the GeoEPR 2014 settlement polygons with geospa-
tial raster datasets. Night light intensity data is taken from DMSP-OLS 64 Nighttime
Lights Time Series (Average Visible, Stable Lights, and Cloud Free Coverages). All
nightlights within the group polygon are aggregated.

D3. Polity IV Dataset
The Polity datasets aim at coding authority characteristics of states in the world system
for purposes of quantitative analysis. The Polity IV dataset covers all major (around
167 countries), independent states in the global system over the period 1800-2014.

Location of the data
This dataset covers a very extended time period, thus it provides information about
countries that do not exist anymore. In particular, in this report we deal with three
countries (confederation of countries) that separated in the early 1990’s, namely the
Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and CzechoSlovak Republic. For each country belonging to
these confederation, we do not have distinct information until year 1990-1991. For
example, until year 1990, we have observations for CzechoSlovak Republic, but not for
 64
      Defense Meteorological Satellite Program.

                                                  95
Czech Republic or the Slovak Republic. We deal with this issue in a very simple way:
we impute to each member state the observations made on the confederation, until
the last year the confederation existed. Hence, until year 1991, we assign to Czech
Republic and Slovak Republic observations made on CzechoSlovak Republic. We ap-
ply the same procedure for each member state of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.
Hence, until year 1990-1991 observations made on the Soviet Union will be assigned
to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia,
Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbek-
istan and information on Yugoslavia will be imputed to Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia
and Montenegro and Slovenia.

Variable xconst
In this report we use variable xconst to build our measure of strong executive con-
straint as in Besley and Mueller (2015b). This variable is on a seven point scale and
the manual explains its construction as follows: “Operationally, this variable refers to
the extent of institutionalized constraints on the decision making powers of chief exec-
utives, whether individuals or collectivities. Such limitations may be imposed by any
“accountability groups”. In Western democracies these are usually legislatures. Other
kinds of accountability groups are the ruling party in a one-party state; councils of
nobles or powerful advisors in monarchies; the military in coup-prone polities; and in
many states a strong, independent judiciary. The concern is therefore with the checks
and balances between the various parts of the decision-making process.” [p. 24, Polity
IV Dataset Users’ Manual 2010]
    We create a dummy that takes value 1 when xconst equals 7 following Besley and
Mueller (2015b). The highest score of the variable xconst is only allocated if important
legislation can be initiated by a parliament which holds the executive to account.

D3. FDI data
We use four diﬀerent datasets on foreign investments: data from the OECD, data from
the UNCTAD, data from the World Bank Database and a unique data set from the
Dutch Central Bank.

OECD data
This data is provided by OECD international direct investment database. The dataset
reports information on FDI ﬁnancial ﬂows (inward and outward) of the 34 OECD
members over the time period 1985-2013.
    Our goal is to have information on FDI ﬁnancial ﬂows regarding each single country
in the world. We thus invert the point of view from which this data is interpreted. To
do so, for each listed partner country and year we sum the inﬂows (outﬂows) received
by (transferred to) OECD countries. The variable inﬂows is created by summing
information on FDI outward ﬂows from OECD countries. Conversely, the variable


                                          96
outﬂows is generated by aggregating information of FDI inﬂows received by OECD
countries.
    As mentioned above, the data covers a time period that goes from 1985 to 2015.
The dataset provides information on three countries that stopped existing in 1990-
1991, namely Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and CzechoSlovak Republic. We deal with
these three countries (confederations of countries) in a very simple way: we impute
to each member state the observations made on the whole confederation until the last
year the confederation existed. Hence from year 1985 to 1990-1991:

   • information on CzechoSlovak Republic is imputed to Czech Republic and Slovak
     Republic;
   • information on Soviet Union is imputed to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Esto-
     nia, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova,
     Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan;
   • information on Yugoslavia is imputed to Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Mon-
     tenegro and Slovenia.

UNCTAD data
UNCTADstat provides yearly country-level information FDI inﬂows and outﬂows. The
time period covered is 1970-2013. As the OECD dataset, the UNCTAD dataset pro-
vides information on three countries that stopped existing in 1990-1991, namely Soviet
Union, Yugoslavia and CzechoSlovak Republic. We implement the same “rule” we used
with OECD data. Again, from year 1970 to 1990-1991:

   • information on CzechoSlovak Republic is imputed to Czech Republic and Slovak
     Republic;
   • information on Soviet Union is imputed to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Esto-
     nia, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Republic of Moldova,
     Russia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan;
   • information on Yugoslavia is imputed to Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Mon-
     tenegro and Slovenia.

Wold Bank data
The World Bank database provides information at the country level on net inﬂows of
FDI. The time span covered goes from 1970 to 2014.

Dutch Central Bank data
The data comes from the Dutch central bank, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). This
dataset provides information about investment inﬂows at country/year/sector level
over the time period 1982-2013. We aggregate the data into sectors to avoid having
too many zeros.
                                         97
D4. Refugees data
We exploit country-level data gathered from several sources. Data about refugees is
provided by the UNHCR Population Statistics Database. The database provides in-
formation about UNHCR’s populations of concern from the year 1951 up to 2014.
This database lists seven categories: refugees, asylum-seekers, returned refugees, inter-
nally displaced persons (IDPs), returned IDPs, stateless persons and others of concern.
For each group the database provides yearly information about their composition by
location of residence and origin. We exploit only the data on refugees.
    According to the UNHCR deﬁnition, refugees are “individuals recognized under
the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; its 1967 Protocol; the 1969
OAU Convention Governing the Speciﬁc Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa; those
recognized in accordance with the UNHCR Statute; individuals granted complementary
forms of protection; or those enjoying temporary protection; and people in a refugee-
like situation”.
    In particular, we are interested in the annual stock of refugees for each country of
origin, i.e. how many people with refugees status have left their home country each
year. Hence, for each country of origin we sum the stock of refugees reported in each
host country. The resulting number will be the variable refugees.
