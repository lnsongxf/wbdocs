This is the fourth in a series of snapshot reports presenting results from a large-scale Early Childhood
Education (ECE) Study conducted in the northern provinces of Lao PDR. The ECE Study was initiated to
evaluate the Early Childhood Education Project. The results presented here represent data collected on
the availability of, and community access to, services and facilities, and how these relate to early child
development, prior to the implementation of the project. Data will be collected again after the project
has finished to see if the project has improved outcomes for children. This snapshot highlights that
while the coverage of and access to early education services are not sufficient, where they are available
these services are related to better levels of early child development.

 Universal health care and education coverage is crucial
 in supporting the health and development of a nation.
 Access to quality health care services, as well as the
 opportunity to participate in quality ECE, gives children
 the best start in life and the foundation they need to
 enjoy learning at school. Lao PDR has made significant
 improvements in the coverage, quality, infrastructure,
 delivery and financing of health and education services
 throughout the past decade. Early education services,
 such as kindergarten and pre-primary class, have
 received less attention. Further efforts are needed for
 the country to achieve targets under the United Nations
 Sustainable Development Goals 3.8 and 4.2. SDG 3.8 is
"by 2030 achieve universal health coverage, including
 financial risk protection, access to quality essential
 health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality
 and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all".
 SDG 4.2 is "by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys have
 access to quality early childhood development, care and
 pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary
 education".

THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION
PROJECT
The ECE Project seeks to support the expansion of
quality ECE services with the objective of improving the
overall development and school readiness of children
aged 3-5 in disadvantaged villages across the northern
provinces of Lao PDR (for further information, refer to
Snapshot One: Project Background and Baseline Data
Demographics). Up to 250 pre-primary classrooms will
be built, more than 70 community child development
groups will be created, and the quality of ECE services
will be improved through training for teachers, caregivers
and community members, the development of training
materials, and the provision of support services such as
disability screening and school lunches.

Baseline data was collected to provide information on
the current status of child outcomes, and to provide
information on the existing levels of service provision and
facilities available to a child’s family. Below are the findings
on the availability of village facilities, health services and
early education services on child development, derived
from data collected from 7,520 children and their
caretakers throughout Northern Lao PDR.
