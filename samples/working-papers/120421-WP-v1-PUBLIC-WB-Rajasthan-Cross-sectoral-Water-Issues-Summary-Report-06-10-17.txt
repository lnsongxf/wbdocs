  Key Findings

The key objective of the study is to analyze whether Rajasthan can achieve its economic
growth targets with its available water resources and current water allocation pattern. In
the above context, the study analyses the water use in agriculture, domestic and industrial
(including power) sectors of Rajasthan. It identifies the water allocation patterns in different
sectors and calculates the water intensity in each of these sectors. It brings out the constraints
that the available water may pose towards achieving the economic growth targets of the
State and suggests various strategic options and interventions that policy makers may
consider to meet the economic growth target.
The study relies on secondary sources of information including reports of Government
of Rajasthan on water resources assessment. A summary of the key findings of the study
analysis are presented below.

Water Use Intensity Analysis
The study examines the existing water resources availability and the water allocation
pattern with respect to the economic sectors in Rajasthan to calculate the water intensities
for each sector:
     Water Resources Availability in Rajasthan1: The overall availability of blue water
       resources in the State is 38.24 BCM for year 2010. This includes 15.67 BCM of surface
       water availability at 50% dependability; 10.61 BCM of ground water and 12.96 BCM
       of inter-state water allocation (net import). Blue water availability for the year 2013-14
       is 38.85 BCM (derived).
     Water Allocation Pattern for Agriculture, Industry and Service (drinking water)
       Sector: The allocation of blue water to agriculture, industry and services (drinking
       water) sector for the year 2013-14 is 86%, 3% and 11% respectively. In addition to blue
       water, about 53.23 BCM of green water is also utilized by the agriculture sector based
       on annual average availability.

     Water Use Intensities of Agriculture, Industry and Services (drinking water)2
       Sector: The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of agriculture, industry and services
       (drinking water) sector in the year 2013-14 is INR 497 billion (USD 8.15 billion), INR
       699 billion (USD 11.47 billion) and INR 1,254 billion (USD 20.58 billion) at constant
       2004-05 prices. Based on water allocation/usage and the contribution to GSDP by
       each sector, the water intensities of agriculture, industry and services (drinking
       water) sector work are 174.29, 1.90 and 3.35 litres/INR (10,621, 116 and 204 litres/
       USD) respectively. The agriculture sector’s water intensity is significantly higher than
       that of the industry and services sectors.

Diagnosis of the Water Challenge
The water use intensities were applied to economic growth targets of Rajasthan to arrive at
the demand-supply gap for water in the year 2024-25.
     Economic Growth Targets of Rajasthan: Rajasthan has set itself an economic growth
       target of 7.70% in the 12th Five Year Plan. The targeted sectoral annual growth rates
       are 9.5% in services sector, 8% in industries and 3.5% in agriculture. If these growth
       rate targets are assumed up to the year 2024-25, the GSDP of the State will more than
       double to ~INR 5,759 billion (USD 95 billion) as against the present GSDP of INR
       2,450 billion (USD 40 billion) at constant (2004-05) prices.
     Water Demand in 2024-25 based on Business as Usual: In order to achieve the
       targeted GSDP for the year 2024-25 based on current water intensities in each sector,
       the requirement of blue water will increase from 38.85 BCM in the year 2013-14 to
       87.63 BCM in the year 2024-25, a significant increase of 126%.3

2  WATER USE AND REALLOCATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
Need for strategic options and interventions
The analysis shows that if the present water usage and allocation pattern continues,
the State will have a challenge in meeting its economic growth targets. Therefore,
Rajasthan needs to look at strategic options to better manage its water resources and augment
the water availability to support its economic growth aspirations.
A basket of strategic cross-sectoral options has been examined to reduce the demand-supply
gap for water and the summary of analysis is presented below.

A. Technical Interventions for improving water intensities and augmenting supply
The potential for improving water-use intensity was analyzed for agriculture, industries
and services (drinking water) sectors. In addition, the potential for supply augmentation
measures were also examined. The technical interventions were analyzed from two
perspectives: (a) potential of water saved and or made available by the application of the
intervention, and (b) per unit cost of the intervention.
These technical interventions were mapped as a ‘Water-Cost-Curve’. A technical
intervention in the cost curve is represented by a block in the chart where the horizontal
width is the potential of water saving/availability while the vertical height is per unit cost
of water saved/made available.

4  WATER USE AND REALLOCATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
B. Intra-sectoral changes for reducing water demand
This option presents scenarios on how a shift to less water intensive use within the sectors
of agriculture and industry could reduce the demand for water.

Agriculture sector: Impact of change in cropping pattern on irrigation (blue) water
requirement
The present cropping pattern of Rajasthan has been analyzed taking into consideration
the water requirement and the value of output. An analysis of an alternate scenario of
cropping pattern-mix, from the current pattern to less water intensive crops, keeping the
value of output constant, shows that the irrigation water demand can be reduced by 12%.
This translates to 4 BCM water savings for the year 2013-14. The snapshot of illustrative
cropping pattern resulting in the reduction of irrigation water requirement is presented
below.

Industry Sector: Impact of change in composition of industries on water requirement
An analysis of an alternate scenario of a change in composition of industry mix, keeping
the gross value added constant, shows that the water requirement could potentially reduce
from 134 million cubic metres to 113 million cubic metres i.e. a reduction of 21 million
cubic metres. This represents a 15.3% reduction in water requirement for the selected
industries.

The technical interventions and intra-sector composition changes result in reduction of
water requirement for agriculture, industry and service (drinking water) sectors as well
as possible augmentation of blue water supply. These in turn result in reduction of water
intensities in each of the sectors. The blue water demand-supply gap can be reduced by
55% for the year 2024-25 based on the implementation of select technical interventions and
intra-sector composition options.

C. Inter-sectoral water re-allocation and impact on GSDP
As 45% of the demand-supply gap for blue water in the year 2024-25 remains even after
implementation of the technical interventions and intra-sector composition changes,
Rajasthan will need to look at the option of inter-sectoral water re-allocation to support the
GSDP aspirations of the State. Inter-sectoral water re-allocation analysis presents various
scenarios which show that such a measure can help support the State in achieving and
exceeding its targeted GSDP. Two sets of such scenarios have been analyzed.
                   Allocation as per prioritization in State Water Policy: The blue water availability
                     considered for this scenario is 38.85 BCM. The water allocations and impact on GSDP
                     are presented on the next page.
It can be seen from this scenario, that if Rajasthan implements the technical interventions,
intra-sector composition changes, and allocates water as per the State’s Water Policy, it is
possible to support a higher growth rate for the State’s GSDP.

The overall GSDP growth rate of 6.98% can be supported by available water in the State by
taking into consideration the water allocation priorities as per State Water Policy.

Scenario for supporting additional growth, exceeding the targeted GSDP: This scenario
takes in to consideration the additional water (6.59 BCM) which could be made available
through the supply augmentation measures. These are presented as part of technical
interventions.

in different proportions. It is assumed that the agriculture sector continues to receive its
share as per the base scenario. The chart presents the range of GSDP growth rates (including

Summary of impact on the GSDP of Rajasthan based on technical interventions,
intra-sectoral changes, and inter-sectoral water re-allocation
The GSDP of Rajasthan in the year 2013-14 is INR 2,450 Billion (USD 40.2 Billion) with
the overall state growth rate of 4.6%4. With the implementation of strategic options
i.e. technical interventions, intra-sector composition options and inter-sectoral water
re-allocation, a higher overall state growth rate in the range 6.98% to 9.22% can be supported
by the available water in the State. The indicative annualized cost implications and the
GSDP growth scenarios are presented in the chart below.

of water reallocation options. Taking this forward, the actionable program in three broad
categories is also presented.

 Prioritize cross-sectoral water efficiency initiatives: The analysis presents
   the prioritization of select technical interventions through a ‘water cost curve’.
   Rajasthan can use this cost curve to identify the most cost-effective interventions for
   implementation across sectors and drive water use efficiency programs in agriculture,
   industry and the drinking water sectors.
   Rajasthan can also design specific incentives and policies to facilitate the intra-sector
   composition changes as these have significant impact on the water requirement.
   The analysis presents scenarios for water allocation to different sectors based on
   the economic growth targets. The analysis can be further expanded to develop a
   detailed water allocation policy for the State. Several parameters can be considered
   while developing the detailed water allocation policy, including water allocation
   prioritization factors such as social considerations, regional favorability, climatic
   conditions, water-use efficiencies, financial sustainability, etc.
 Strengthen water governance systems and institutions: Presently, the data on water
   supply to agriculture, industry and service (drinking water) sector is available from
   the perspective of water allocation. However, the actual supply and consumption
   at the end-point is not captured or recorded for all uses. Similarly, data relating to
   economic outputs and water consumption is not captured in a manner that facilitates
   easy analysis. Therefore, it is important to develop robust data collection, analysis
   and monitoring system related to water use and GSDP contribution for each sector or
   sub-sector. This should be taken up at an appropriate level i.e. either the basin or the
   sub-basin level.


                                                                                Summary Report  9
      It is important to strengthen the institutional framework and establish clear
      accountabilities to streamline implementation of the technical interventions
      for water-use efficiency improvements and decisions on water re-allocations.
      Accordingly, Rajasthan may consider establishing a ‘Water Regulatory Authority’
      on matters related to water allocation, tariff rationalization, etc. It can also consider
      creating a ‘Bureau of Water-use Efficiency’ to advise on water efficiency measures.
    Create enablers for transformation: Rajasthan may consider creating a forum to
      bring together the multiple stakeholders to guide the transformation in the water
      sector. The forum could be headed by senior officials from the Government along
      with working groups to evaluate policies, technologies, projects, etc. The cross-
      sectoral forum may also comprise working groups to advise on specific policy issues,
      oversee results of water efficiency improvement measures, and evaluate innovative
      technologies.
