Key Characteristics of Aggregation Case Study
                          ALFÖLDVÍZ, HUNGARY
Context                  •	 High-income country

                         •	 Aggregation covering urban and rural areas

                         •	 High level of water supply and sanitation (WSS) performance

Purpose                  Economic efficiency, performance, professionalization
Scope                    WSS functions and services
Scale                    •	 Administrative boundaries

                         •	 Localities covered: 131 for water and 81 for wastewater

                         •	 Population covered: 564,000 inhabitants for water and 399,000 for wastewater

                         •	 Coverage: 100% for water; 71% for wastewater

                         •	 Connections: 257,557 for water and 191,359 for wastewater

                         •	 Network length: 4,580 km for water and 2,680 km for wastewater

Process                  Top-down
Governance               •	 Delegated

                         •	 Public company

                         •	 Decision making: municipalities and the Hungarian state are the utility’s shareholders

                         •	 Asset transfer: assets remain the property of municipalities and are transferred to the operator for the
                          duration of the delegation contract; municipalities receive rental fee in return for this transfer

                         •	 Liability: liabilities and debts from previous operators are not taken over by aggregated utility

                         •	 Staff transfer: all staff was transferred

                         •	 Clear entry and exit rules

Outcome                  Positive, with decreased water operating expenses but increased wastewater operating expenses (because of
                         network expansion); slight improvement in performance
Findings                 A merger project team has been created that is dedicated to expansion of the service area, ensuring
                         relationships with future member municipalities; many municipalities insist on using their own water resources
                         (which are costly) instead of using water from the integrated system; aggregation appears beneficial,
                         especially for service quality and sustainability in small municipalities
