Context                 •	 Upper-middle-income country

                        •	 Aggregation covering rural areas

                        •	 Low level of WSS performance

Purpose                 Professionalization, performance, economic efficiency

Scope                   WSS functions and services

Scale                   •	 Watershed limits

                        •	 Localities covered: 239 for water and 74 for sanitation

                        •	 Population covered: 304,000 inhabitants for water and 138,000 for sanitation

                        •	 Connections: 101,280 for water and 45,900 for sanitation
