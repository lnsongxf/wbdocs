EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of Macedonia experiences a low level,
concentrated HIV epidemic. The small number of people currently living with HIV is
attributable, in part, to an effective HIV response to date.

There is increasing HIV prevalence among certain key population groups, particularly
men who have sex with men (MSM) and male sex workers (MSW). This recent trend warrants
early attention.

MSM accounted for 64% of newly diagnosed people living with HIV in 2014. In that same
year, programs specifically targeting MSM accounted for only 2.4% of HIV spending. This
suggests under-coverage of this key population.

HIV prevalence amongst MSM was estimated at 2% in 20141 and according to Optima
projections, is predicted to increase to approximately 6% by 2030. Given the projected
increase in HIV incidence and prevalence among MSM, increasing resources to, and
coverage of, MSM programs would increase the effectiveness of the HIV response.

The HIV epidemic in the general population in FYR Macedonia is expected to remain at a very
low level―increasing slightly from an estimated 0.004% in 2014 to 0.010% in to 2030 among
women, and from 0.002% in 2014 to 0.005% in 2030 for men. The small expected increase in
HIV prevalence amongst females is largely attributed to increasing HIV prevalence amongst
MSM, many of whom also have female partners (64.9%2 in 2014 and 77% in 20103). As such,
prevention and treatment programs targeted at MSM should provide a cost-effective
strategy for minimizing new infections in the general population.

HIV prevalence amongst female sex workers (FSW) and their clients is predicted to
increase only slightly from an estimated 0.05% in 2014 to 0.06% by 2030 for FSW, and
0.005% to 0.007% for their clients when assuming that current conditions of behaviours and
levels of program coverage are sustained.

HIV prevalence amongst MSW is expected to increase from an estimated 3.4%4 in 2014 to
approximately 7% by 2030 under current conditions. Whilst the MSW population is small, HIV
prevalence is relatively high and therefore interactions between MSM and MSWs remain an
important driver of HIV transmission in this setting. The MSW population should therefore
be the primary focus of sex worker HIV programs, although the wider sexual and
reproductive health needs of FSW remain an important public health priority.

x                             Optimizing investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s HIV response



    HIV prevalence estimates from IBBS studies and NGO testing data indicate a decline in
    HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID), from 0.42% in 20065 to 0.12%
    in 20146. Needle sharing rates have also decreased from 9.7%7 in 2009 to 3.6% in
    20148. This suggests that programs targeted at this population have been effective. The
    model suggests that this downward trend may continue unless there is a substantive change in
    the risk factors for this population. However, given the relatively high cost of Opiate
    Substitution Therapy (OST) in FYR Macedonia, further technical efficiency analyses may be
    beneficial in identifying ways to reduce the cost of this program without compromising the
    scope of delivery.

    Optimizing current spending could reduce HIV deaths and new infections substantially,
    and potentially avert a predicted future increase in the epidemic. The allocative
    efficiency of FYR Macedonia’s current programs could be improved by increasing investment
    in ART and MSM programs (Figure E1). If the current annual budget of around 5.59 million
    USD were allocated optimally among key populations and programs, an additional 860 new
    infections and 290 additional deaths could be prevented by 2030.

    Optimized allocations require substantial increases in funding for ART from US$ 0.3 to
    1.3 million and for MSM programs from US$ 0.1 to 0.3 million. As the optimization
    analysis was related to HIV outcomes only and based on current epidemic trends, programs for
    other populations were less critical. Funds for HIV prevention in the general population could
    be entirely reprogrammed into ART and MSM programs. Programs for female sex workers and
    needle-syringe programs will still be important for prevention of other infections and wider
    public health objectives. Also, our model is based on country-specific epidemic dynamics and
    due to mobility of key populations such as FSW and PWID, risk in these populations might
    change. Therefore programs for FSW as well as harm reduction for PWID including both OST
    and NSP should be continued.

    The burden of HIV in FYR Macedonia is increasing from a low base. Without improvements in
    the allocative efficiency of HIV programming, the model predicts that overall HIV incidence will
    increase from 0.002 in 2014 to 0.006 in 100 person years by 2030. With an optimized
    allocation of current resources, the number of new HIV infections could be reduced by
    as much as 85%.

    Current annual spending will be enough to achieve National HIV Strategic Plan and
    international targets, but only if allocated optimally. With an optimized allocation of
    funding, annual future spending commitments attributable to new infections may be reduced.

    Although funding for HIV in FYR Macedonia has increased since 2008, international donors
    have financed much of this increase. Prevention programs and programs targeted at key

    international funding, without a concurrent increase in domestic funding, will have a
    significant negative impact on the HIV epidemic in Macedonia. Therefore, transitional funding
    mechanisms need to be explored with the aim of raising domestic funding to at least the level
    of the current total budget for the HIV response. International donor funding must be

programs targeted at key populations and the scale up of ART delivery.

Preparing for domestic financing of programs for key populations will also require the
decision on and development of contracting mechanisms for NGOs reaching out to key
populations, in particular MSM. This is required to ensure that there are strong linkages
between community-based prevention, demand generation for HTS and ART.

1.           BACKGROUND: WHY ALLOCATIVE
             EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS NOW?
1.1          FYR Macedonia’s health and health financing context
1.1.1. Burden of disease
The leading cause of burden of disease in 2013, measured by disability adjusted life years
(DALYs) in FYR Macedonia is lung cancer, followed by diabetes and ischemic heart disease10.
In the age group most affected by HIV, i.e., 15-49 years, the leading cause of burden of disease
is musculoskeletal disorders, mental and substance use disorders and other non-
communicable diseases (NCDs)11. NCDs are the leading cause of burden of disease in FYR
Macedonia, making up 81% of DALYs amongst 15-49 year olds, followed by injuries (14%) and
communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases (5%). The burden of disease due
to HIV and Hepatitis (A, B and C) are similar with 66 and 63 DALYs respectively, whilst
tuberculosis accounts for 554 DALYs amongst 15–49 year olds in FYR Macedonia12.

1.1.2. Health care financing and expenditure
The health system of the FYR Macedonia is financed primarily through compulsory health
insurance. In this context, compulsory health insurance provides universal coverage, and its
basic benefits package including both treatment and prevention services, is considered
comprehensive. Insurance contributions are collected through a payroll-based system,
collected and managed by the Health Insurance Fund. The state budget from non-hypothecated
sources and patients’ co-payments in form of out of pocket expenses, constitute additional
sources of financing13.

According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates for 201314, total health expenditure
as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in FYR Macedonia was 6.4%, showing a
reduction of around 30% since 2000 (see Table 1.1). This figure is lower than the WHO
Europe regional average (8.0%) and significantly lower than most other ex-Yugoslav countries
such as Serbia with 10.6%, Bosnia and Herzegovina with 9.6% and Slovenia 9.2% (see Figure
1.1). In 2013, per capita health care expenditure was US$ 312 and nearly 70% of health
expenditure was funded from public sources (see Table 1.1). Expenditure from public sources
has increased by almost 20% since 2000, while out-of-pocket payments have decreased from
42% to 31% of total health expenditure (see Table 1.1).

1.2 The HIV epidemic appears to be slowly growing in FYR
Macedonia
FYR Macedonia has a low level HIV epidemic. Since the detection of the first case of HIV in
1987, 236 people have been diagnosed with HIV15 and 75 registered AIDS deaths were
recorded by 1 December 201416. However, the number of people diagnosed has increased in
recent years, with 39 out of the 236 registered people living with HIV (PLHIV), diagnosed in
2014 alone (Figure 1.2). The HIV epidemic in this context is concentrated among males (80%),
and 64% of newly diagnosed PLHIV in 2014 were men who have sex with men (MSM)17. There
have also been small numbers of new diagnoses among other key populations, including male
sex workers (MSW) and people who inject drugs (PWID). Cases amongst the general
population are low in number.

A significant proportion of PLHIV are not aware of their status as indicated by the late
diagnoses in 2014, where 41% of newly diagnosed PLHIV already had AIDS18. Poor detection
leads to late presentation for treatment. This in turn adversely affects treatment outcomes,
significantly increases short-term mortality risk and reduces the cost effectiveness of
treatment. The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced mortality amongst
PLHIV over recent years, but these data suggest that earlier detection could significantly
improve the effectiveness of ART.

1.3                          Financing the HIV response in FYR Macedonia
1.3.1. HIV response has been heavily dependent on donors contribution
Total HIV spending in FYR Macedonia increased by nearly 80% between 2008–13 (Figure 1.3).
Most of this increase is due to substantial growth in international funding (Figure 1.4). The

    Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) has been the country’s
    major international donor, contributing around 90% of all donor funds in 2013.

    In 2013, domestic funding (combined state and private spending) was marginally higher than
    international funding (with 53%). Domestic funding has increased around 70% since 2008,
    almost entirely due to the substantial growth in public HIV funding. It should be considered
    that private spending in this context only includes contributions made from charitable
    organizations and do not include household (out-of-pocket) spending, and is therefore likely to
    be underestimated.

    The current National Strategy for HIV/AIDS will expire at the end of 2016, together with the
    financial support of the Global Fund. A new national strategic plan for 2017–21 is thus being
    developed in a new funding climate, amid concern for the sustainability of FYR Macedonia’s
    HIV response. In response, a sustainability and transition plan is being simultaneously
    developed to identify transitional funding mechanisms and facilitate the shift from
    international to domestic financing of HIV programs.

    Current reliance on international donors for a substantive portion of HIV financing, coupled
    with a substantial expected reduction in international assistance in the short-term, are key
    challenges to the sustainability of HIV programming in FYR Macedonia. These challenges will
    be compounded if HIV incidence continues to rise. Further reducing of FYR Macedonia’s
    dependence on external donor funding may require the establishment of transitional funding
    mechanisms to supplement and redirect public funding sources.

1.4                   A need for allocative efficiency
In the current environment of increasingly limited resources for HIV epidemic responses,
focused design and efficiency in program delivery are essential to ensure that programs can do
more with less.


21     Public funds include both the state and health insurance funds. Private funds for social protection were HIV
       specific income generation activities funded by an NGO. Other international funds mainly include funds from
       United Nations agencies, and other organizations such as International Planned Parenthood Federation. HIV care
       includes all inpatient and outpatient care excluding ART.
6                              Optimizing investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s HIV response



    A shift towards investment thinking in the design of HIV responses is being promoted by
    UNAIDS and co-sponsors globally, in order to maximize the impact of program investment and
    best realize the long-term health and economic benefits of HIV programs. Investment cases
    are currently being developed by a number of countries to understand HIV epidemics as well
    as to design, deliver and sustain effective HIV responses. In support of HIV investment cases, a
    group of countries in the ECA region are in the process of conducting allocative efficiency
    analyses. In 2014 and 2015, allocative efficiency analyses were carried out in Armenia,
    Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan22, Ukraine23 and
    Uzbekistan24. This report summarizes the results of a similar allocative efficiency analysis for
    FYR Macedonia.

    In addition, this report provides insights on the progress made towards reaching key
    international commitments. In the 2011 UN Political Declaration, countries agreed to reduce
    sexual and injection-related transmission by 50%, virtually eliminate HIV mother-to-child-
    transmission, initiate 80% of eligible PLHIV on treatment and end HIV-related discrimination
    by 201525. The 2014 Gap Report26 illustrated that substantial additional effort will be required
    in most countries to achieve these targets. Against this background, UNAIDS globally defined a
    Fast-Track27 strategy in order to achieve the goal of Ending AIDS by 2030. This includes new
    initiatives such as the 90-90-90 targets28. These set out to ensure that 90% of all PLHIV are
    diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed PLHIV are on ART and 90% of PLHIV on ART are virally
    suppressed. The Fast-Track approach also emphasizes the need to focus on the geographical
    areas and communities most affected by HIV and recommends that resources be concentrated
    on the programs with the greatest impact.

    In the context of this report, the investment case is complemented with a human rights-based
    approach to health care. FYR Macedonia is one of the countries in ECA to have signed up to the
    2004 ‘Dublin Declaration of Partnership to fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia’29. As
    confirmed in the current national strategic plan30, a universal approach based on upholding
    human rights and non-discrimination is to be adopted, including prevention, treatment, care
    and support services.

    1.4.1. Allocative efficiency in HIV
    The concept of allocative efficiency refers to the maximization of health outcomes, with the
    least costly mix of health interventions, within a defined budget envelope. HIV allocative
    efficiency studies generally try to answer the question “How can a given HIV funding amount be

optimally allocated to the combination of HIV response interventions that will yield the highest
impact?”

There is wide consensus that better outcomes could be achieved in many settings with a given
amount of HIV funding, or that given outcomes could be achieved with less HIV funding, if
resources were distributed optimally or if resources were used in the most efficient ways.
Mathematical modeling is one way to determine optimized HIV resource allocation within
defined budget envelopes. The HIV allocative efficiency (AE) analysis in this study was carried
out using the Optimization and Analysis Tool (Optima). The results can be utilized to serve the
needs of decision-makers and health planners seeking to improve the allocative efficiency of
their HIV financing.
2.     HOW WILL THIS REPORT ANSWER KEY
       POLICY QUESTIONS?
This report summarizes how FYR Macedonia may be able to better allocate current HIV
spending, to maximize health outcomes and minimize new HIV infections and HIV related
deaths. The findings of this report can assist the government in further strengthening its HIV
investment case, through which it attempts to increase the effectiveness of HIV investments
and define corresponding priorities, strategies and impacts of the HIV response. This is
pertinent in the current context of sustainability financing, with a need to shift from
international to domestic funding.

2.1    The Optima Model
To assess HIV epidemic trends we use Optima’s epidemic module, which consists of a
mathematical model of HIV transmission and disease progression. Optima uses best-practice
HIV epidemic modeling techniques and incorporates evidence on biological transmission
probabilities, detailed infection progression, sexual mixing patterns and drug injection
behaviors. Data relating to programs and costs associated with programs are used in an
integrated analysis to determine an optimized distribution of investment under defined
scenarios.

Data from the Global Fund concept note, bio-behavioral surveys, and clinic registries were
supplemented with published data and information from national registers to populate the
Optima model. The model was then used to project the likely trajectory of the HIV epidemic in
FYR Macedonia and to suggest how the epidemic may best be contained and treated with
available financial resources. Optima is calibrated to HIV prevalence data points available from
the different sub-populations (e.g., FSW, MSW, PWID, MSM), at specific time points, as well as
to data points on the number of people on ART, and data surrounding registered PLHIV. This
was performed in consultation with experts on the country’s epidemic. Section 2 and Appendix
2 provide further details regarding the calibration process.

To assess how incremental changes in spending affect HIV epidemics and thus determine the
optimized funding allocation, the model parameterizes relationships between the cost of HIV
intervention programs, the coverage level attained by these programs and the resulting
outcomes. These relationships are specific to the country, population and program being
considered. Using the relationships between cost, coverage and outcome―in combination with
Optima’s epidemic module―it is possible to calculate how incremental changes in funding
allocated to each program, will impact overall epidemic outcomes. Furthermore, by using a
mathematical optimization algorithm, Optima is able to determine the “optimal” allocation of
funding across different HIV programs.

To tailor the model to a given context, analysts selected a number of parameters that describe
the country population, levels of expenditure, programs to be included or excluded, time
frames and the baseline scenario. The parameters appropriate to the FYR Macedonian context
are listed in Table 2.1.

     a constraint was establish by putting a limit of 0% reduction in OST budget allocation (i.e. not reduce the funding

     2.3       Calibration
     A key stage in the Optima modeling process is a stage known as ‘calibration’. Calibration
     represents a model validation process in which Optima-projected trends are aligned with the
     historically observed trends in HIV prevalence in different population groups in a given
     context. Given the challenges inherent in fitting epidemiological and behavioral data, the
     calibration for FYR Macedonia was performed manually (i.e., by varying relevant model
     parameters in order to attain a best-fit between model-projected and historic HIV prevalence
     across different population cohorts). Where data was limited, these trends were compared
     with the registered new diagnoses. Once the Optima model is calibrated, it can project future
     expected trends in the HIV epidemic as described in Section 3.

     2.4       Cost-coverage-outcome relationships
     The relationship between program spending and coverage is shown in the left panel of Figure
     2.1. This relationship describes the level of output achieved with a specific level of financial
     input. In the context of these analyses, output is defined as the availability of a service to a
     specific proportion of the target population. Coverage refers to the number of the population
     reached. For example, this relationship would describe how many MSM can be provided with
     a standard package of services with an investment of 0 to 1,000,000 USD. The relationship
     between coverage levels and outcome is shown in the right panel. This relationship describes
     the proportion of people who will adopt a specific behavior (such as condom use or consistent
     use of ARVs leading to viral suppression). These analyses were produced in collaboration with
     FYR Macedonian experts and the full set of figures can be seen in the Appendix 2.




     34   Costs for indirect programs, also called enablers and synergies, have not been optimized but instead were fixed at
          agreed amounts (as they do not have measurable epidemic impact or because the expenditure is central systems
          expenditure that is essential for several program areas). Spending on Hepatitis C was removed from the analysis.

The cost-coverage-outcome relationships are utilized, together with the calibration
projections, to run the optimization and scenario analyses described in Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8.

2.5       Allocative Efficiency Analysis
Efficiency analyses must be informed by local priorities. FYR Macedonia is currently drafting a
new national HIV strategy for 2017-2021. Based on the strategy for 2012–16, the primary aim
is to maintain low HIV prevalence levels in FYR Macedonia36. This is to be achieved via a
universal approach including prevention, treatment, care and support services - all based on
upholding human rights and non-discrimination.

To support these national priorities and assist FYR Macedonia in the context of sustainability
planning, this report will answer the following five questions: 1) What is the trajectory of the
epidemic under different scenarios, in comparison to the currently predicted epidemic trends
under the current HIV response? 2) How can FYR Macedonia optimize the allocation of HIV
funding, and how close will the country get to minimizing new HIV infections and HIV-related
deaths? 3) With changes to HIV budget allocation, how can FYR Macedonia optimize the
allocation of HIV funding, and how close will the country get to minimizing new HIV infections
and HIV-related deaths? 4) What is the minimum spend required to achieve possible National
Strategic Plan targets if resources are allocated optimally? 5) How much funding is required to
achieve National Strategic Plan targets if resources are allocated optimally?

Each of these questions is the subject of an analytical module as described in more detail
below.

Analysis 1: What is the trajectory of the epidemic under different scenarios, in
comparison to the currently predicted epidemic trends under the current HIV
response?

This analysis compares the trajectory of the epidemic and key outcomes under the current
allocation of resources (section 3) with different scenarios (section 5). These include:

     1. Test and treat: In this scenario it was assumed that by 2020, 90% of PLHIV will be aware of
        their status and 90% of diagnosed PLHIV will be on ART37.
     2. Attaining global targets for all key populations: In this scenario, the trajectory of the HIV
        epidemic is assessed if the country aims for reaching global goals for all key populations.
     3. Defunding all preventive programs: In this scenario, possible impacts of defunding all
        prevention programs for the key populations (including HTC programs) is explored.
     This scenario analysis explores different levels of achievement of program outcomes. In this
     section we analyzed the epidemic impact if specific outcome levels or targets are achieved,
     regardless of cost and coverage considerations.

     Analysis 2: How can FYR Macedonia optimize the allocation of HIV funding, and how
     close will the country get to minimizing new HIV infections and HIV-related deaths?

     This analysis compares the trajectory of the epidemic and key outcomes under the current
     allocation of resources, against an optimized allocation of resources. For the purposes of this
     analysis, funding remains at current levels and is not varied. Only the way that funding is spent
     changes. The aim is to determine how FYR Macedonia might better allocate available
     resources to achieve maximum impact, and how close that maximum impact will be to possible
     National HIV Strategic Plan targets.

     This analysis asks the following specific question:

          If funding is kept at the same level but resources are allocated differently, what then will be
           the expected annual levels of HIV incidence, HIV prevalence, and AIDS-related deaths? The
           results of this analysis are described in Section 6.
     Analysis 3: With changes to HIV budget allocation, how can FYR Macedonia optimize the
     allocation of HIV funding, and how close will the country get to minimizing new HIV
     infections and HIV-related deaths?

     This analysis explores the likely outcomes of potential decreases or increases in the available
     budget. The previous analyses assumed fixed amounts of available funding and explored an
     optimized allocation of those funds, to see what reductions in deaths and new infections could
     be achieved with the current budget. In contrast, this analysis aims for the maximum possible
     reduction of new deaths and infections under different budget envelopes (i.e., 50%, 75%, 90%,
     110%, 125%, 150% and 200% of current funding), with allocations optimized. The results of
     this analysis are presented in Section 7.

     Analysis 4: What is the minimum spend required to achieve possible National Strategic
     Plan targets if resources are allocated optimally?

     This analysis identifies the minimum resource requirements to achieve possible national
     strategy targets. As the new national HIV strategic plan targets have not yet been identified,
     analyses were run to establish how much funding is required to a) maintain current outcomes
     and b) to reduce new infections and deaths by 50%? The results of these analyses are
     presented in Section 8.

     Analysis 5: What are the long-term financial commitments to the HIV response?

     This analysis reviews the impact of current investment choices on long-term financial
     commitments. Specifically, this analysis compares the commitments one would expect to

result from the current allocation of the 2013 budget, against the optimized allocation of the
2013 budget described in Section 6. The findings from this analysis are presented in Section 9.

2.6      Limitations of the analysis
All mathematical models have their strengths and limitations. Results should therefore be
interpreted with the necessary caution. In particular, it is important to note that:

   All model forecasts are subject to uncertainty. Therefore, point-estimates are indicative of
    trends rather than exact figures. This limitation is highlighted particularly in the context of
    FYR Macedonia, where the low level epidemic results in small population sizes and greater
    uncertainty in the model estimates.
   The model calibration depends as much on the quality of input data as on the quality of the
    model itself. The country and study teams have done everything possible to ensure the
    best possible data quality but it is never possible to have a complete, or completely certain
    dataset. The best model calibration will rarely achieve an exact match of historical data,
    but will mirror as closely as possible the key trends of them.
   There were some data gaps in FYR Macedonia. Missing data are most common for the
    general population and for clients of sex workers. Estimates of HIV prevalence in the
    general population were derived from registered cases amongst the heterosexual
    population. There was no data available for clients of sex workers. Therefore an assumed
    population size of 10% of the general adult male population (15 –49 age group) was used
    and HIV prevalence amongst the client population was assumed to be ten times lower than
    HIV prevalence amongst FSW.
   The modeling approach used to calculate relative cost-effectiveness between programs
    includes assumptions about the impact of increases or decreases in availability of funding
    for programs. These assumptions are based on unit costs and observed ecological
    relationships between outcomes of program coverage or risk behavior and the amount of
    money spent on programs in the past, assuming that there would be some saturation in the
    possible effect of programs with increases in spending.
   The cost-coverage-outcome relationships were derived from actual cost and coverage
    values for 2013.
   The analysis presented in this report does not determine the technical efficiency of
    programs as this was beyond the scope of the analysis. However, gains in technical
    efficiency may lead to lower unit costs and would therefore affect the optimized resource
    allocation described in this report.
   Modeling the optimization of allocative efficiencies depends critically on the availability of
    evidence-based parameter estimates of the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of individual
    interventions. Interventions/programs for which these parameter estimates do not exist,
    such as for many of the critical enablers, will be excluded for the mathematical
    optimization analysis. However, this does not mean that these programs should not
    receive funding. In addition, there are uncertainties around parameter estimates of some of
    the critical clinical interventions (e.g., ART and the parameter estimates such as the
    preventive effect of ART), which may distort the results.
   Effects of the programs outside the HIV endpoints including, for example, the wider health
    and non-health benefits of OST (beyond those directly related to HIV) and the effects of
    needle exchange programs on Hepatitis, are not included in this model. Given that, in the
    case of OST, there are significant benefits beyond HIV outcomes, the optimized budget
14                        Optimizing investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s HIV response



         allocation was prevented from removing or reducing allocations to OST, by putting a limit
         on reduction in OST budget allocation.
        Along the same lines, the Optima modeling approach does not seek to quantify the human
         rights, stigma and discrimination, ethical, legal or psychosocial implications of providing or
         withdrawing care. The authors acknowledge that these are important aspects to consider.
        Other models may produce different projections than those produced by Optima. This is
         an underlying property when using theoretical mathematical frameworks. Different
         designs of the framework may generate different outcome projections. The analyses
         presented in this report have made use of the best available country data, experience
         gained from applying the Optima model in over 20 countries, and comparisons within the
         ECA region for the validation and contextualization of inputs and findings wherever
         possible.
3.        WHAT ARE THE EXPECTED TRENDS IN THE
          EPIDEMIC IF CURRENT SPENDING IS
          MAINTAINED?
In this section, the modeled projections of the HIV epidemic are described. These results are
based on the calibration process and assume that current (2013) spending levels are
maintained. Further calibration results are provided in the Appendix.

3.1       Current situation of the epidemic
The HIV epidemic in FYR Macedonia is a concentrated epidemic with 236 people diagnosed
with HIV and 75 registered AIDS deaths cumulatively recorded by 1 December 201438. As
previously mentioned, there has been an increase in number of new infections, especially in
the previous year. MSM make up 64% of newly diagnosed HIV infections. Input data on
population size and HIV prevalence for key populations at higher risk of HIV exposure, are
outlined in Table 3.1.

With current levels of funding and current allocations to HIV intervention programs
maintained, the model projects that the epidemic will remain at a low level. However, the total
number of PLHIV is projected to increase from a model-estimated 307 in 2014, to 438 by 2020
and 846 by 2030 (Figure 3.1). This increase is primarily a consequence of the expected
increase in HIV incidence. As Figure 3.1 shows, 73% of PLHIV are projected to be MSM in 2020
and 78% in 2030. The same figure shows that PWID are likely to constitute 5% of all PLHIV in
2020 and 2% in 2030, while MSW are expected to constitute 5.1% of PLHIV in 2020 and 4.6%
in 2030. Females in the general population are projected to comprise 11% of PLHIV in 2020
and 10% of PLHIV in 2030.

3.2       HIV prevalence is expected to increase
Overall HIV prevalence is projected to increase off a low base, from modeled-estimates of
0.018% in 2014 to 0.026% in 2020 and 0.050% by 2030 (Figure A3). The largest increases in
HIV prevalence are projected to occur amongst MSW and MSM. In the MSW population, the
model projects a steady increase in HIV prevalence from an estimated 3% in 2014 to 4% by
2020 and approximately 7% by 2030. On a similar trajectory, HIV prevalence amongst MSM is
expected to increase from almost 2% in 2014 to just less than 3% by 2020 and approximately
6% by 2030. These projected figures are indicative only, as changes in risk behaviors, mobility
or interactions with epidemics in neighboring countries may influence future HIV prevalence

     trends. Projections within small populations such as those in this context will always be more
     sensitive to small changes in risk factors than projections calculated for larger scale epidemics.

HIV prevalence amongst FSW is projected to remain stable around 0.06%. It should be noted
that, as the FSW population size is small, this translates into around two HIV positive female
sex workers. As HIV prevalence amongst the client population is significantly influenced by
HIV prevalence amongst FSW, there is also a very small increase in this population from
0.004% in 2014 to 0.005% in 2020 and 0.007% in 2030.

HIV prevalence amongst PWID is projected to decline slightly from an estimated prevalence of
0.24% in 2014, to 0.19% in 2020 and 0.16% by 2030. Using available data on HIV prevalence
and behavior, Optima projects further reductions in HIV prevalence and incidence amongst
PWID. This suggests that the country epidemic amongst PWID is under control, but the model
does not account for changes in behavior or interactions with HIV epidemics amongst PWID in
neighboring countries, which may negatively influence the epidemic trajectory.

Whilst HIV prevalence in the general population is very low, the model projects that there will
be a steeper increase amongst adult females than amongst adult males. HIV prevalence in
adult women is projected to increase from 0.004% in 2014 to 0.005% by 2020 and 0.01% by
2030. In contrast, the model predicted HIV prevalence amongst adult men is approximately
half of that of women, increasing from 0.002% in 2014 to 0.003% by 2020 and 0.005% by
2030. This difference is likely explained by the fact that most men at high risk are included in
the MSM, MSW, client and PWID populations―who in turn may infect their female sexual
partners.

3.3        HIV Incidence is increasing
Underpinning the small increase in HIV prevalence described above, is a predicted increase in
HIV incidence (Figure A4), mainly in the MSM population. The model predicts that, with the
current allocation of funds, overall HIV incidence will increase from 0.002% to 0.006%
between 2014 and 2030. New infections are projected to increase from an estimated 28 new
infections per year in 2014 to 47 per year in 2020 and to have doubled by 2030, with an
estimated 107 new infections per year (Figure 3.2). The majority of new HIV infections are
predicted to be amongst MSM; from 64% of registered new cases in 2014, to a model
estimated 78% of new infections in 2020 and 80% by 2030.

Much of the expected increase in HIV incidence is driven by the share of transmission
attributed to unprotected sex between MSM and their partners. Low condom use of 46.8%48
amongst MSM and casual partners is a particular concern, as is relatively low condom use with
commercial partners i.e. 84% for MSW compared with 93% for FSW49. Therefore interactions
between MSW and MSM remain important. Furthermore, 77% of MSM in the 2010 IBBS survey
and 64.9% of MSM in the 2014 IBBS survey50, reported having sex with a female in the past 12
months. The high probability of sex with female partners raises concerns about the potential
role of MSM in ‘bridging’ HIV transmission to their sexual partners within the female adult
population.

     3.4       AIDS-related deaths are low but predicted to increase
     Until 2014, the number of AIDS-related deaths were estimated to have been relatively stable at
     10 per year across all populations, reflecting the low-level epidemic of the 1990s. Overall
     however, the number of deaths attributable to HIV is predicted to increase to 17 in 2020 and
     36 by 2030 if PLHIV are not diagnosed promptly and put onto treatment51 (Figure 3.3). In
     addition to a projected increase in the estimated annual number of deaths (Figure 3.3), the
     model-estimated death rate i.e., the change in deaths over time, will also increase (Figure 3.4).

3.5 The number of people requiring HIV treatment will
increase
At the end of 2014, 96 people were receiving HIV treatment. However, with the predicted
increase in new infections, demand for treatment will rise. Furthermore, at the time of the
model analysis, FYR Macedonia only provided treatment when the CD4 count was less than
350cells/mm3. However, 2015 WHO guidance recommended commencing treatment for
adults at any CD4 count53. If the FYR Macedonia is to adhere to international guidelines for HIV
treatment, additional registered PLHIV will require treatment and more PLHIV may be newly
diagnosed.

4.     WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF PAST AND
       CURRENT SPENDING?
4.1    Prevention receives the majority of current funding
Prevention is the largest component of HIV spending in FYR Macedonia, at an average of
77% of total spending since 2008 (Figure 4.1). Within prevention, the largest share of
spending has been on interventions targeting PWID, including OST, NSP and Hepatitis C
prevention. Since 2008, interventions targeting PWID comprise on average 61% of
prevention spending. In 2013, 63% of prevention spending and 51% of total HIV spending
was allocated to harm reduction programs.

In contrast to PWID interventions, investment in other preventive programs targeting the
general population or other key populations such as MSM and SWs, has been relatively low.
These investments have also varied substantially over time, suggesting a fragile financing
climate for individual programs. In 2013, targeted programs for MSM, SWs and the general
population SBCC program were allocated 3%, 4% and 8% of prevention funding,
respectively.

By comparison, HIV care and treatment spending constituted 7% of total spending in 2013.
Spending on ART is funded entirely by public sources with approximately 50% of ART costs
being met by the Health Insurance Fund, and the remainder by other resources from the
National Ministry of Health. Specifically, ARVs and key monitoring tests (i.e. viral load and
CD4 count) are funded by the Ministry of Health through the National HIV Program, whereas
other spending related to treatment and medical care are funded by the Health Insurance
Fund. Spending on ART has increased by approximately 76% since 2008.

Program management, the main indirect cost category in this context, has constituted an
average of 14% of total HIV spending since 2008. Although this proportion was reduced to
9% in 2013, this proportion remains higher than spending on HIV care and treatment
spending.

     4.2 Investment could be better targeted within and between
     key populations
     Current investments in HIV prevention and treatment may not be benefiting those most in
     need (Figure 4.2). Model-based estimates suggest that, with exception of PWID, incidence
     and prevalence are increasing among key high-risk populations and MSM in particular. This
     suggests that prevention could be better targeted. If the potential role of MSM in ‘bridging’
     the epidemic between MSW and general population women is further considered, then the
     case for better-targeted prevention is compelling as it is likely to yield benefits for both high-
     and low-risk populations. Current investment in prevention programs targeting MSM is low,
     as described previously.

What is the impact of past and current spending?                                                                            23



Although the prevalence and incidence of HIV amongst PWID has been decreasing and may
decrease further or remain stable at a low level, the analyses suggest that there remains a
need to invest in programs for PWID, including needle-syringe programs (NSP) and opiate
substitution therapy (OST). Past investment in these programs have contributed
substantially to the downward trend of the HIV epidemic in this population and projections
are based on the continuation of current programs.

Using the cost-coverage relationships, the cost per person reached at 2013 spending levels
were estimated. This basic analysis demonstrates that costs for many programs, in particular
ART and OST, are high when compared with data for other comparable countries in the
region (Table 4.1).

A more detailed review of unit costs and a targeted technical efficiency analysis may identify
ways of reducing average OST, NSP and other costs - resulting in substantial savings to the
overall budget. If high unit costs are reduced, without compromising the quality of
programs, then an efficiency gain is achieved and ‘saved’ resources can be more effectively
used to combat the epidemic through reallocation to other programs.

While the data in Table 4.1 may identify the potential for technical efficiency savings, a
number of cautions in interpreting these data should be noted. In particular:

1. Although all expenditure data has been extracted from NASA/GARPR reports, which
   follow a standard methodology, individual countries may not have classified all costs in
   the same way.
2. Coverage definitions and packages for each program may differ between countries. For
   example, in FYR Macedonia, HTC programs mainly cover testing for key populations and
   testing was not included in the program packages for the key populations.
Consequently, this table does not provide substantive information about which countries
deliver services more efficiently. Instead, this analysis seeks only to highlight which
programs may benefit from a further, more robust review of the potential for technical
efficiency gains.




54   Note: Table 4 reflects how costs were categorized by countries for this analysis. The method is not based on
     detailed matching of classification of inputs, but on how countries had actually classified expenses using the
     detailed available guidance for NASA and GARPR reports. Although this guidance is detailed and specific,
     differences cannot be ruled out, particularly regarding cross-cutting costs such as HR costs. In addition, even if
     costs are classified consistently, the comprehensiveness of service packages may differ. The completed Optima
     data matrixes for 7 ECA countries (including Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and
     Ukraine) were compiled by the study team from a range of country-specific data sources during 2014–15.
     These data are based primarily on coverage data from program records for 2013/2014 and total HIV spending
     for a program area per 2013/2014 GARPR and NASA reports.

     4.3                               Current HIV investment averts infections and deaths
     Model–based projections of the epidemic demonstrate that current spending on HIV
     prevention and treatment programs will continue to avert new infections and deaths. In the
     absence of any spending on the HIV epidemic, the model estimates that 97 more deaths
     would occur and 539 more people would be infected by 2030 (Figure 4.3). Furthermore,
     under a ‘no spending’ condition, the total number of PLHIV is projected to increase to 1329
     by 2030, an increase of 30% compared with the epidemic trajectory under current spending.
     This highlights the need to continue investing in an HIV response.

     55          ‘No spending’ assumes that there is no spending on the HIV response. ‘Current spending’ assumes that current
                 funding levels and allocations remain stable and achieve coverage in line with the cost-coverage-outcome
                 curves defined in the model.
5.         PREDICTING THE TRAJECTORY OF THE
           HIV EPIDEMIC: COMPARING HIV
           RESPONSE SCENARIOS
In the previous section, we compared current spending levels and allocations, against a ‘no
spending’ scenario. Figure 4.3 demonstrated that the current response to the epidemic is
significantly reducing HIV incidence and HIV-related mortality from the levels one would
expect in the absence of interventions. The Optima model predicts that this positive impact
is likely to persist, and even grow, in the time period to 2030. In this section, we ask whether
reaching pre-specified targets regardless of the budget required, could potentially reduce
HIV prevalence, new infections and AIDS related mortality further. Here we compare the
trajectory of the HIV epidemic by 2030 in FYR Macedonia under the current HIV response
against three alternative response scenarios that are not constrained by a budget but are
determined solely by targets. These scenarios were identified through consultation with
local stakeholders and a range of experts. The epidemic trajectory is predicted for each of
these scenarios and compared with the trajectory under current programs, without
determining the overall budget envelope required to achieve defined targets in each
scenario.

The three response scenarios used for comparison were:

1. Test and offer treatment: In this scenario it is assumed that by 2020, 90% of PLHIV will
   be aware of their status and 90% of diagnosed PLHIV will be on ART56
2. Attaining global targets for all key populations: In this scenario, the country aims to
   reach global goals for all key populations
3. Defunding all preventive programs: In this scenario, the possible impact of defunding all
   prevention programs for key populations, including HTC, are explored
Table 5.1 presents detailed information on parameters and targets specified in the
alternative scenarios.

The model-predicted evolution of annual HIV prevalence, new infections and deaths (2000–
30) under these conditions are shown in Figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. Figure 5.4 shows the
expected HIV incidence amongst MSM for the same period for each scenario57. Overall, with
the level and allocation of funding maintained as for 201358,HIV prevalence and the number
of new infections and deaths are expected to increase. This is mainly driven by rising
incidence amongst MSM, as described earlier.


56   Treatment efficacy in reducing new infections for PLHIV on ART was assumed to be 70%.
57   The curve covering the historical period until 2015 in all scenarios is an output of the model calibration.

     These analyses predict that Scenario 1, testing and offering treatment, will substantially
     reduce new infections and deaths compared with the current strategy. Scenario 1 is
     estimated to result in 72% or 636 fewer infections, and 80% or 246 fewer deaths by 2030,
     compared with current conditions.

     The findings also show however, that reaching global targets for all key populations
     (Scenario2), is even more effective in reducing the number of new infections and deaths than
     only testing and offering treatment (Scenario1). Scenario 2 is projected to achieve an
     estimated 86% reduction in both new infections and deaths, with an estimated 757 fewer
     infections and 264 fewer deaths by 2030. The analysis shows that Scenario 2 is also the
     most effective in reducing incidence amongst MSM, with an estimated reduction of 72%
     (Figure 5.4).

Findings from these analyses shows that defunding all prevention programs ( Scenario 3) is
expected to increase overall prevalence, the number of new infection and deaths by 9%,
19% and 5% respectively, compared with the current HIV response.

In reducing the number of deaths and new infections over time, Scenarios 1 and 2 are
significantly more effective than the current HIV response. Therefore, whilst investment in
key population groups remains key in the context of FYR Macedonia’s concentrated
epidemic, it remains essential to ensuring high treatment coverage for all PLHIV. It should be
noted that in this section we analyzed the epidemic impact if specific outcome levels or
targets are achieved, regardless of cost and coverage considerations. This approach is
different from the optimization analysis in the next section, which is based on the cost-
coverage outcome curves (CCOCs). In the optimization analysis presented next, we consider
the effect of different levels of spending on programs, which then translate into coverage and
outcomes according to the CCOCs.

6.        WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED BY OPTIMIZING
          THE ALLOCATION OF CURRENT FUNDING?
An optimization analysis was conducted comparing the allocation of the 2013 budget of
$5,154,74359 and an optimized allocation of the same budget for the time period 2015 –30.
This section presents the findings of this analysis.

Findings of model-based analyses suggested that the current distribution of funding is
different from the model optimized allocation of the 2013 budget aiming to minimize both
new infections and deaths (Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1). The optimized allocation of the 2013
budget averts an estimated 856 (85%) additional HIV infections predominantly among MSM,
and 294 (87%) additional deaths between 2016 and 2030. To achieve these gains, the
following key changes are proposed:

     ART coverage should be increased to meet current need
      ∙ The analysis suggests that ART investment should be significantly increased from 5%
        to approximately 23% of the annual HIV budget (Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1), assuming
        all diagnosed PLHIV are eligible for ART. This high shift in spending reflects the
        relatively high effectiveness of ARVs as both treatment and prevention, since PLHIV
        on treatment have significantly reduced viral load resulting in reduced
        transmissibility. This intervention will reduce HIV incidence and prevalence across
        all key population groups. Where funding is diverted from programs that target these
        key groups, some of the optimized budget is ‘re-incorporated’ here
     HTC coverage amongst key populations should be increased
      ∙ ART cannot be scaled up unless HIV infections are diagnosed. It is therefore
        necessary to ensure that adequate funding is allocated to testing in key population
        groups. The model suggests an increase from an estimated 3.6% to 4.8% of the
        annual HIV budget
     Investment in MSM programs should be increased
      ∙ The analysis suggests that investment in MSM programs should be substantially
        increased, from 2.4% to 6.2% of the annual HIV budget (Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1).
        The MSM population group makes up the highest number of PLHIV in the FYR
        Macedonian context and individuals from key populations such as MSM may infect
        partners in low-risk populations. Targeting key populations therefore has benefits
        for both high- and low-risk populations but constitutes a more efficient financial

59   This figure does not include spending on Hepatitis C (around 1 $million). Moreover, only direct programs such
     as key population programs (FSW, MSM, PWID), ART, SBCC and HTC programs are included in the
     optimization analysis. The indirect programs or cost items such as program management, enabling
     environment, blood safety etc. were not included in the optimisation analysis.

           investment. Since the epidemic in the low-risk, general population is too small to be
           self-sustaining without the increased risk from ‘bridging’ individuals in key, higher-
           risk populations, the most effective strategy is likely to be targeting new infections
           among key populations such as MSM
        Coverage of PWID programs should be maintained, but cost-efficiency of programs
         should be reviewed.
         ∙ Low needle-sharing rates and a decreasing or stable HIV epidemic amongst PWID are
           at least partly attributable to the strong historical focus on this key population. These
           outcomes can only be sustained with sustained engagement
         ∙ However, as the cost per person reached in this population appears higher than in
           other comparable countries, a review of these costs may be needed to maximize cost-
           efficiency and ensure the future sustainability of PWID programs
        Coverage of SW programs should be maintained, but cost-efficiency of programs
         should be reviewed
         ∙ Under the optimized allocation, the 2013 budget for SW programs is reduced. This is
           due to the fact that the model only takes HIV-related economic considerations into
           account, and HIV prevalence amongst FSW is currently extremely low. However, the
           wider sexual and reproductive health needs of FSW remain critical and any
           suggestion to defund these programs should be treated with caution
         ∙ SW programs aim also to target the MSW population, and this population group
           needs increased prioritization within sex worker programs
         ∙ As with programs targeting PWID, the cost per person reached in this population
           appears higher than in other comparable countries, suggesting that a review of these
           costs may be needed to maximize cost-efficiency and ensure the future sustainability
           of SW programs
        Investment should be shifted away from SBCC and programs targeted at the
         general population
         ∙ HIV prevalence among the low-risk, general population in FYR Macedonia is still very
           low and programs targeting this population are not effective or cost-effective
           compared with programs targeting key population groups
         ∙ An optimized allocation suggests shifting resources from the low-risk general
           population, toward key population programs -especially MSM programs in the
           context of FYR Macedonia. This shift would benefit both the key population in
           question, and the low-risk, general population
        Recommendations for OST spending should be interpreted with caution
         ∙ OST is defined by UNAIDS and the WHO as one of the essential service components
           for PWID HIV harm reduction programs. As described in Section 2, the Optima model
           considers only benefits to HIV patients and as such, service components such as OST
           that have significant wider benefits to the PWID population and to national public
           health, may be undervalued
         ∙ OST has therefore been constrained in the model at 100% of 2013 spend, to ensure
           that this program is not defunded
         ∙ Wider public health arguments, independent of the HIV discourse, suggest that OST
           should be sustained and expanded
         ∙ Programs such as NSP are likely to have a significant preventive effect in HIV epidemics
           and not all PWID will access OST. OST is therefore not a replacement for NSP
What can be improved by optimizing the allocation of current funding?                              33



The model suggests that allocating current funding differently, could further reduce the
spread of the epidemic when compared to the current budget allocation. However, with a
larger budget envelope it may be possible to avert additional new infections and deaths. The
potential gains to increased investment in HIV programming, and effects of a decreased
investment, are described further in the following section.

7.      WHAT ARE THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF
        CHANGING HIV SPENDING AND
        ALLOCATION?
In this analysis, optimized allocations to programs and the corresponding impact are
estimated and compared for different levels of funding. Specifically, this analysis considers
what could be gained by increasing HIV spending from 2013 levels of provision. Conversely,
the analysis also considers which programs would have the largest impact on the epidemic if
less funding was available and the response needed to be further rationalized.

If 75% to 90% of 2013 funding is available, optimization analysis suggests that ART, OST and
MSM programs should be given priority (see Figure 7.1). This finding is the result of a
combination of factors. ART is essential to minimize deaths, while contributing also to
reduced incidence. For further prevention, increasing condom use amongst MSM is an
important behavioral strategy in the FYR Macedonian context. OST remains a priority as the
model construct protects 100% of the funding for OST services. This is based on the
rationale that nobody on OST should stop receiving treatment. Similarly, no one on ARV
treatment would have treatment withdrawn. OST also has substantial benefits outside of
HIV prevention, as explained in the remarks on the model in Section 2 and therefore all OST
spending was protected in the optimized allocations. As OST funding is both protected and
relatively expensive compared with some other prevention strategies, efforts should be
made to ensure the high unit costs of OST are reduced as far as possible - without
compromising the quality of care. Savings achieved through OST efficiency gains could be
used to sustain other programs for PWID, in particular needle and syringe programs.

If 100% to 200% of 2013 funding is available, optimization suggests that investment should
continue to be focused on ART and OST. Funding for MSM programs should also increase in
this scenario. This analysis suggests that with a larger budget, a significant share of funding
should be allocated to HTC programs for key populations. Spending on programs for the
low-risk, general population (such as SBCC), are only recommended at higher multiples of
the current budget i.e. when the optimized spending budget is approximately 200% of 2013
spending.

This analysis shows that increased and optimally allocated spending on HIV programs may
continue to yield some gains in terms of infections and deaths averted (see Figure 7.1).
However, the most substantial gains can be made in optimizing the allocation of the current
budget (i.e., 2013 spending), with proportionately smaller gains made by increasing the
current spend further.

It should be noted that the following figures present increases in spending for program
budgets to 120%, 150% and 200% of 2013 levels respectively. These increases do not
correspond to the same proportional increase in the total HIV response budget as it was

     assumed that the indirect costs of management, infrastructure and other enabling factors
     would be stable. These indirect costs were therefore fixed within the HIV budget.

8.      HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO ACHIEVE
        PROPOSED NATIONAL HIV STRATEGIC
        PLAN TARGETS?
This analysis identifies the minimum annual resource requirements to achieve the proposed
national strategy targets, as described in Section 2. The analyses in Section 6 assumed a
fixed amount of available funding and explored an optimized allocation of those funds to
minimize new infections and deaths. In Section 7, the analyses explored the likely gains
from increased investment in the HIV response. In contrast, the analyses in this section aim
for the full achievement of possible national HIV strategic plan targets, and determine the
minimum investment required to achieve those goals with an optimized allocation. As the
final national HIV strategic plan targets have not yet been confirmed in FYR Macedonia, this
analysis will assess the funding required to a) contain current incidence and death rates, and
b) reduce new infections and deaths by 50%.

Figure 8.1 shows the current allocation of 2013 spending, the optimized allocation of 2013
spending and the minimum spending required, with an optimal allocation, to achieve the
two targets described above. Benefits of optimizing the 2013 allocation are fully described
in Section 7. The model results presented here suggest that $5.1 million would need to be
invested annually to achieve the first target of maintaining current incidence and death
values. This includes the programmatic spending shown in Figure 8.1 and the fixed indirect
costs mentioned previously in Section 7. This total budget is slightly less than the 2013
budget of $5.5 million. Similarly, this analysis estimates that reducing of new infections and
deaths by 50% could be achieved with annual spending of around $5.4 million, which is not
significantly different to the 2013 budget.

These findings reinforce those of the previous section that the greatest efficiency gains can
be achieved through better allocation of the current budget, after which gains to increasing
the total budget are modest. In order to achieve both targets, the model findings
recommend increased investments in ART and MSM programs: around three times more
than the current spend to stabilize outcomes and around four times more to reduce
incidence and deaths by 50%. This funding would be reallocated primarily from SBCC,
PWID-NSP and SW programs.

This analysis reviews the long-term impact of current and optimized investment choices,
assuming the annual 2013 spend of $5.5 is maintained. Long-term impact refers to all long-
term financial liabilities arising from the commitment to provide HIV and related health
services to PLHIV in the future. In monetary terms, a financial commitment is the
discounted cost of providing HIV services for PLHIV in a particular year. It includes HIV
treatment costs, HIV related health care costs and social mitigation costs.

Figure 9.1 describes the annual costs for HIV treatment and HIV-related care, derived from
the expected number of PLHIV from 2016 to 2030. The current allocation of 2013 spending
is compared with the optimized allocation described in Section 6. The results of the analysis
predict that HIV response costs will rise gradually under both allocations, driven by the
expected increase in the total number of PLHIV. The model estimates that optimizing
current allocations will nearly double the cost of the annual HIV response compared to the
current, non-optimized allocation. This is a result of the fact that the optimized allocation
will increase uptake of ART and keep more PLHIV alive for longer through substantially
increasing ART coverage, which is currently very low. This increases the total long-term
cost of the response for all PLHIV. However, the model predicts that financial commitments
caused by new infections each year i.e. life-time HIV care costs for newly diagnosed cases
under the optimized allocation of current spending, will be 85% lower than under the

10. SUSTAINING AN EFFECTIVE HIV
    RESPONSE
Historically, the Global Fund was the primary source of funding for prevention and
treatment programs in FYR Macedonia. Recently however, the National Ministry of Health
took responsibility for the funding of some programs previously funded by the Global Fund -
including the provision of Methadone for OST since 2008, and ART and supportive treatment
for PLHIV since 201060. However, as FYR Macedonia prepares for the full withdrawal of
Global Fund support at the end of 2016, there remains a substantial funding gap that will
need to be met if the current HIV response is to be sustained. This funding gap is most
significant for prevention programs. This section uses the analyses described previously in
this report, to highlight the specific challenges and recommendations for successful
transition to national ownership of a sustained and effective HIV response.

10.1 Allocative efficiency gains should help FYR Macedonia
‘do more with less’
The allocative efficiency gains described elsewhere in this report, should enable the Ministry
of Health to achieve greater health impact with a sustained or slightly smaller HIV budget.
Allocative efficiency gains in this context will primarily be achieved by increasing funding to
programs targeted at prevention in key populations, reducing spending on prevention in the
general population where the risk of new infections is low, and increasing spending on ART.
Key populations to target include MSM and MSW. Scaling up ART delivery will benefit both
key populations and the general population.

The National Ministry of Health currently finances ART and associated treatment from the
Health Insurance Fund and other Ministry of Health resources as described earlier. As
coverage expands, so too will the funding needs of this program. As the Health Insurance
Fund currently only partly funds ART provision, the Ministry may seek to expand
contributions from this source to meet or reduce the funding gap.

10.2 Technical efficiency gains could be further explored in
future work
As mentioned previously, the unit costs of programs such as OST are higher in FYR
Macedonia than in other comparable countries in the region. A thorough review of potential
strategies to reduce costs, whilst maintaining the quantity and quality of service provision,
should therefore be considered.

     It is positive to note that drug prices for ARVs have reduced between 2014 and 2015.
     Further savings may also be achieved by exploring opportunities to switch from branded to
     generic drugs, moving towards single drug regimens where appropriate, engaging with
     pooled procurement schemes or changing the drugs prescribed to cheaper, equally effective
     alternatives.

     As yet, no comparable reduction in OST costs has been observed. It may be important to
     note in this case that 16% of those on OST treatment in 2014 were on Buprenorphine.
     Buprenorphine is substantially more expensive then methadone, while studies from other
     settings found no difference in effectiveness61,62. As such, Buprenorphine may be less cost-
     effective63 when compared with methadone and a change in the drug used may yield
     significant technical efficiency savings. Aside from any changing drug regimens, achieving
     further technical efficiency gains in drug pricing may be difficult for FYR Macedonia due to
     low economies of scale, but with increasing coverage enhanced price negotiations could be
     explored. Pooled procurement processes may warrant further exploration in this context, as
     suggested earlier.

     In addition to high cost programs such as ART and OST, technical efficiency gains could also
     be considered for other prevention programs targeting key populations. This may require
     further collaboration between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for providing
     preventive care, or further integration of HIV testing with other elements of the existing
     basic care package. There may also be scope for NGOs who support different key
     populations, to collaborate further to improve technical efficiency.

     SW and MSM programs are almost entirely funded by the Global Fund and sourcing
     alternative funding for these programs remains critical. With the transition to national
     ownership, programs serving these populations may need to explore new co-funding
     opportunities and possible income generating activities. Service models may need to be
     reviewed when considering how to meet the needs of the epidemic after the transition from
     international to domestic funding. Mechanisms for the government to contract and manage
     NGOs need to be decided upon and developed.

     Program management and administration, the main indirect cost category in this context,
     constituted 9% of total HIV spending in 2013. This is lower than some other countries in the
     region but it is higher than HIV care and treatment spending, which constituted 7% of total
     HIV spending in 2013. Although these indirect costs have been fixed in the analyses
     presented in this report―future work may explore opportunities to rationalize program
     management and administration costs, with the savings then allocated to the direct costs of
     the HIV response.

     Finally, further analysis may explore whether HIV services could be further integrated into
     existing services. This includes STI, reproductive health, tuberculosis and other services.
     One of the strengths of the FYR Macedonia’s HIV response is the coordination of its services

11. CONCLUSIONS


1
      The FYR Macedonian government has implemented an effective HIV response to
      date, maintaining a very low level HIV epidemic. The FYR Macedonian
      government could allocate future HIV spending optimally to further minimize HIV
incidence, prevalence and HIV-related deaths.



2
        To assess HIV epidemic trends, this report used Optima’s epidemic module, calibrated
       to HIV prevalence data points available for different sub-populations in FYR Macedonia,
       including key populations. The model was also calibrated to data points for the number
of people on ART from available data sources, and in consultation with FYR Macedonian
experts. Analyses using this model highlight a strong risk that prevalence and incidence
will increase overall in FYR Macedonia, mainly amongst MSM, in spite of current efforts
to contain the epidemic.



3
        The expected overall increase in the epidemic appears to be driven by increasing
        incidence and prevalence among MSM, a key population that currently only
        receives a small portion of HIV funding. High-risk behavior in this group, including
low condom use, calls for significant strengthening of interventions targeting this population.
Increasing the use of condoms with casual and commercial partners is likely to be an effective
preventive measure. Additional programs such as Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) may also
be considered for MSM and MSW at highest risk, although current rates of HIV incidence are
still substantially below 3 in 100 person years, which WHO has suggested as an indicative level
for PrEP to be cost-effective. Only a very small subset of MSM and MSW might be at such high
risk.



4
       Funding allocations that prioritize improved condom use, higher HIV testing rates
       among MSM and MSW, and scale up of ART to all populations in need - will be
       most effective in containing the epidemic overall. An optimized allocation of current
funding may increase longer-term financial commitments to the HIV response by increasing
uptake of ART, but will substantially decrease financial commitments caused by new
infections, which would decline with optimized allocations.



5
      Presentation for testing and treatment is currently delayed for some people living
      with HIV, thus increasing costs and reducing positive outcomes on treatment.
      These delays are likely to be caused by multiple factors in the FYR Macedonian context,
including possible fear of stigmatization and discrimination amongst MSM and MSW. These
deterrents to effective care-seeking may add the additional risk of weak adherence to
treatment. Risk factors such as these are best addressed with a rights-based approach to care.

     6
           These analyses suggested that reallocating funding towards prevention amongst
           MSM and MSW, would improve the efficiency of current spending . Our estimations
           and contextual data suggest that the HIV epidemic amongst PWID and FSW is relatively
     well contained in FYR Macedonia, due to significant and prolonged efforts to target these
     populations. However, due to the risk of rising HIV infection amongst PWID in the future as
     experienced in other countries of the region and due to the risk of transmission of other, more
     prevalent infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C, it is essential that coverage levels of NSP
     and OST are sustained. It is also an important public health priority that the wider sexual and
     reproductive health needs of FSW continue to be met.



     7
            Comparing the unit costs of care in FYR Macedonia, with data from other
            countries in the region, suggests that greater efficiency in spending might be
            achieved through strategies to reduce the average spend per person reached.
     These strategies should not intentionally or unintentionally compromise the current quantity,
     quality or scope of prevention or treatment programs. Further analyses of technical efficiency
     are needed before more robust conclusions can be reached.



     8
            Current annual spending should be sufficient to achieve potential national HIV
            strategic plan and international targets if optimally allocated. By describing the
            likely trajectories of the HIV epidemic under different conditions, highlighting areas of
     particular risk in the short- to medium-term, and suggesting ways to incrementally improve
     the efficiency of current spending, these suggestions should assist FYR Macedonia in
     optimizing their current HIV response. Modeling the epidemic in the absence of HIV program
     spending highlighted the significant gains already achieved from current spending in the
     form of new infections and deaths averted. However, analyses of what is needed to achieve
     possible targets set by the National HIV Strategic Plan have identified the need for continued
     investment in an optimized HIV response in FYR Macedonia.



     9
            Mapping of key populations will be essential in planning for scaling-up
            recommended programs. This is particularly true in the case of the MSM and
            MSW populations. As the findings show, the number of new infections is increasing
     amongst the MSM population and it is important to increase coverage of MSM programs. The
     MSM population is a hard to reach group for a number of reasons, with a large proportion of
     this group remaining ‘hidden.’ Fear of stigmatization and discrimination may prevent affected
     individuals from accessing health services and undergoing testing – as demonstrated by the
     fact that only 19% of MSM had an HIV test in 201464. This group is also not homogenous and
     many have female partners, while a significant proportion pay for commercial sex. Condom
     use also varies significantly in this group (46.8% with a casual partner and 83.7% with paid
     partner in 2014). The ability to meet male partners over the Internet adds an extra challenge
     to measuring and reaching this population. Current service models could potentially be
     reviewed in light of the role of Internet dating in moving MSM out of current ‘hot -spots’ and
     these factors will need to be taken into account when considering scale-up of these programs.



     10
                      MSW remain a challenging group to reach. MSW can face stigmatization and
                      discrimination both for having sex with men, and for having commercial sex65.
                      MSW are at a high risk of contracting HIV for biological, behavioral and structural

reasons―yet in many settings around the world, this group has not received adequate
attention66. In the case of FYR Macedonia’s MSW population, this group should be a central
focus of the HIV response. As mentioned above, programs for sex workers may need to
consider innovative ways to better map and scale up programs targeted at the MSW group.
Further research specifically amongst this group would be beneficial and ongoing work to
change the structural determinants of discrimination and stigma needs to be a core focus.

              Additional domestic resources will be needed to sustain the HIV response
              after the withdrawal of Global Fund support. Although funding for HIV in FYR
              Macedonia has increased since 2008, international donors have financed much of
this increase. Preventive programs and programs targeted at key populations are primarily
funded by international donors. As such, the withdrawal of international funding without a
concurrent increase in domestic funding, will have a significant negative impact on the HIV
epidemic in Macedonia. Transitional funding mechanisms need to be explored with the aim of
raising domestic funding to at least the level of the current total budget for the HIV response.
International donor funding must be replaced with alternate funding.

APPENDIXES
APPENDIX A TECHNICAL SUMMARY OF OPTIMA
Appendix A provides a brief technical overview of Optima. A more detailed summary of the
model and methods is provided elsewhere (Kerr and others 2015). Optima is based on a
dynamic, population-based HIV model. Figure A.1a summarizes the populations and mixing
patterns used in Optima. Figure A.1b shows the disease progression implemented in the
model. Optima tracks the entire population of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across 5 stages
of CD4 count. These CD4 count stages are aligned with the progression of the World Health
Organization (WHO) treatment guidelines, namely, acute HIV infection, >500, 350 –500, 200–
350, 50–200, and 50 cells per microliter. Key aspects of the antiretroviral therapy (ART)
service delivery cascade are included: from infection to diagnosis, ART initiation on first-line
therapy, treatment failure, subsequent lines of therapy, and HIV/AIDS-related or other death.
Figure A.1a Example population groups and HIV transmission-related interactions in Optima

The model uses a linked system of ordinary differential equations to track the movement of
PLHIV among HIV health states. The full set of equations is provided in the supplementary
material to a summary paper on the Optima model. The overall population is partitioned in
two ways: by population group and by HIV health state. Individuals are assigned to a given
population group based on their dominant risk.67 HIV infections occur through the
interactions among different populations by regular, casual, or commercial (including
transactional) sexual partnerships; through sharing of injecting equipment; or through
mother-to-child transmission. The force-of-infection is the rate at which uninfected individuals
become infected. The rate depends on the number and type of risk events to which individuals
are exposed in a given period (either within their population groups or through interaction
with other population groups) and the infection probability of each event. Mathematically, the
force of- infection has the general form:



where λ is the force-of-infection, β is the transmission probability of each event, and n is the
effective number of at-risk events (that is, n gives the average number of interaction events
with HIV-infected people through which HIV transmission may occur). The value of the


67 However, to capture important cross-modal types of transmission, relevant behavioral parameters can be set to
   non-zero values (for example, males who inject drugs may engage in commercial sex; some MSM may have
   female sexual partners).


                                                      51
52                               Optimizing investments in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s HIV response



     transmission probability β varies across CD4 count compartments (indirectly reflecting the
     high viral load at early and late stages of infection); differs for different modes of transmission
     (intravenous drug injection with a contaminated needle-syringe, penile-vaginal or penile-anal
     intercourse, and mother-to-child); and may be reduced by behavioral interventions (for
     example, condom use), biological interventions (for example, male circumcision), or ART.
     There is one force-of-infection term for each type of interaction, for example, casual sexual
     relationships between male sex workers and female sex workers (FSW). The force-of-infection
     for a given population will be the sum of all interaction types.68 In addition to the force-of-
     infection rate, which is the number of individuals who become infected with HIV per year,
     there are seven other ways by which individuals can change health states.69 The change in the
     number of people in each compartment is determined by the sum over the relevant rates
     described above multiplied by the population size of the compartments on which they act.70




     68   For sexual transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in partner populations
             Average number of casual, regular, and commercial homosexual and heterosexual acts per person per year
             Proportion of these acts in which condoms are used
             Proportion of men who are circumcised
             Prevalence of sexually transmissible infections (which can increase HIV transmission probability)
             Proportion of acts that are covered by pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis
             Proportion of partners on antiretroviral treatment (art)
             Efficacies of condoms, male circumcision, post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure prophylaxis, and art at
              preventing HIV transmission.
          For injecting-related transmission, the force-of-infection is determined by:
             HIV prevalence (weighted by viral load) in populations of people who use a syringe and then share it
             Number of injections per person per year
             Proportion of injections made with shared equipment
             Fraction of people who inject drugs on opioid substitution therapy and its efficacy in reducing injecting
              behavior.
          For mother-to-child transmission, the number of-infections is determined by:
             Birth rate among women living with HIV
             Proportion of women with HIV who breastfeed
             Probability of perinatal HIV transmission in the absence of intervention
             Proportion of women receiving prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), including ART.
     69   First, individuals may die, either because of an average background death rate for that population (which is
          greater for older populations or for people who inject drugs) or because of HIV/AIDS (which depends on CD4
          count). Second, in the absence of treatment, individuals progress from higher to lower CD4 counts. Third,
          individuals can move from undiagnosed to diagnosed states based on their HIV testing rate, which depends on
          CD4 count (for example, people with AIDS symptoms or primary HIV infection may have a higher testing rate)
          and population type (for example, FSW may test more frequently than males in the general population). Fourth,
          diagnosed individuals may commence ART at a rate depending on CD4 count. Fifth, individuals may experience
          treatment failure due to lack of adherence to therapy or development of drug resistance. Sixth, people may
          initiate second and subsequent lines of treatment after treatment failure. Finally, while on successful first- or
          second-line treatment (that is, effective viral suppressive therapy), individuals may progress from lower to
          higher CD4 counts.
     70   For example, the change in the number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–350
          cells per microliter is:




          where UFSW2002350 is the current number of undiagnosed HIV-positive FSW with a CD4 count between 200–
          350 cells per microliter; UFSW3502500 is the same population but with higher CD4 count (350 –500 cells/mL); t
          is the disease progression rate for the given CD4 count (where 1/t is the average time to lose 150 CD4 cells/mL);
          m is the death rate; and h is the HIV testing rate. (Note: This example does not consider movement among
          populations, such as FSW returning to the general female population and vice versa —something which is
          included in Optima.)

Note: Each compartment represents a single population group with the specified health state. Each arrow
represents the movement of numbers of individuals among health states. All compartments except for
“susceptible” represent individuals living with HIV. Death includes all causes of death.

Each compartment (Figure A.1b, boxes) corresponds to a single differential equation in the
model, and each rate (Figure A.1b, arrows) corresponds to a single term in that equation. Table
A.1 lists the parameters used in Optima; most of these are used to calculate the force of
infection. The analysts interpret empirical estimates for model parameter values in Bayesian
terms as previous distributions. The model then must be calibrated: finding posterior
distributions of the model parameter values so+ that the model generates accurate estimates
of HIV prevalence, the number of people on treatment, and any other epidemiological data that
are available (such as HIV-related deaths). The calibration can be performed automatically,
manually, or a combination. Model calibration and validation normally should be performed in
consultation with governments in the countries in which the model is being applied.

     HIV Resource Optimization and Program Coverage Targets
     A novel component of Optima is its ability to calculate allocations of resources that optimally
     address one or more HIV-related objectives (for example, impact-level targets in a country’s
     HIV national strategic plan). Because this model also calculates the coverage levels required to
     achieve these targets, Optima can be used to inform HIV strategic planning and the
     determination of program coverage levels. The key assumptions of resource optimization are
     the relationships among (1) the cost of HIV programs for specific target populations, (2) the
     resulting coverage levels of targeted populations with these HIV programs, and (3) how these
     coverage levels of HIV programs for targeted populations influence behavioral and clinical
     outcomes. Such relationships are required to understand how incremental changes in
     spending (marginal costs) affect HIV epidemics.71 Logistic functions can incorporate initial
     start-up costs and enable changes in behavior to saturate at high spending levels, thus better
     reflecting program reality. The logistic function has the form:




     where L(x) relates spending to coverage; x is the amount of funding for the program; A is the
     lower asymptote value (adjusted to match the value of L when there is no spending on a
     program); B is the upper asymptote value (for very high spending); C is the midpoint; and D is
     the steepness of the transition from A to B. For its fits, the team typically chose saturation
     values of the coverage to match behavioral data in countries with heavily funded HIV

     71   A traditional approach is to apply unit cost values to inform a linear relationship between money spent and
          coverage attained. This assumption is reasonable for programs such as an established ART program that no
          longer incurs start-up or initiation costs. However, the assumption is less appropriate for condom promotion and
          behavior change communication programs. Most HIV programs typically have initial setup costs, followed by a
          more effective scale-up with increased funding. However, very high coverage levels have saturation effects
          because these high levels require increased incremental costs due to generating demand and related activities for
          the most difficult-to-reach groups. Optima uses a logistic function fitted to available input data to model cost –
          coverage curves (Appendix 2).

responses.72 To perform the optimization, Optima uses a global parameter search algorithm
called Bayesian adaptive locally linear stochastic descent (BALLSD). BALLSD is similar to
simulated annealing in that it makes stochastic downhill steps in parameter space from an
initial starting point. However, unlike simulated annealing, BALLSD chooses future step sizes
and directions based on the outcome of previous steps. For certain classes of optimization
problems, the team has shown that BALLSD can determine optimized solutions with fewer
function evaluations than traditional optimization methods, including gradient descent and
simulated annealing.

While all HIV interventions have some direct or indirect non-HIV benefits, some programs
including opiate substitution therapy (OST) or conditional cash transfers, have multiple
substantial proven benefits across different sectors. Such additional benefits were reflected by
using the approach of a cross-sectoral financing model to effectively distribute the costs in
accordance with the benefits. By adapting standard techniques from welfare economics to
attribute the benefits of OST programs across the benefiting sectors, it was estimated that
average HIV-related benefits are approximately only 10 percent of the overall health and social
benefits of OST. Therefore, only 10 percent of the OST cost was included in the optimization
analysis.

Uncertainty Analyses
Optima uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing automatic
calibration and for computing uncertainties in the model fit to epidemiological data. With this
algorithm, the model is run many times (typically, 1,000–10,000) to generate a range of
epidemic projections. Their differences represent uncertainty in the expected epidemiological
trajectories. The most important assumptions in the optimization analysis are associated with
the cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves. To incorporate uncertainty in these curves,
users define upper and lower limits for both coverage and behavior for no spending and for
very high spending.73




72   Program coverage for zero spending, or behavioral outcomes for zero coverage of formal programs, is inferred
     using data from early on in the epidemic or just before significant investment in HIV programs. Practically, the
     team also discussed the zero and high spending cases with local experts, who could advise on private sector HIV
     service delivery outside the governments’ expenditure tracking systems. For each HIV program, the team derived
     one set of logistic curves that related funding to program coverage levels and another set of curves (generally,
     linear relationships) that related coverage levels to clinical or behavioral outcomes (the impacts that HIV
     strategies aim to achieve).
73   All available historical spending data and achieved outcomes of spending, data from comparable settings,
     experience, and extensive discussion with stakeholders in the country of application can be used to inform these
     ranges. All logistic curves within these ranges then are allowable and are incorporated in Optima uncertainty
     analyses. These cost-coverage and coverage-outcome curves thus are reconciled with the epidemiological,
     behavioral, and biological data in a Bayesian optimal way, thereby enabling the calculation of unified uncertainty
     estimates.

In the calibration process, model parameters were varied in order to obtain the most accurate
fit from the available IBBS data for the MSM, MSW, FSW and PWID populations. Data for the
clients and general populations were very limited and therefore assumptions were made
based on number of diagnosed HIV cases. Furthermore, data from registered new cases was
also used to predict the trends in the epidemic. There was a large spread in the historic data,
especially in the MSM HIV prevalence data. In deriving an estimate for the MSM curve, the
lower-bound estimates were used and curves for the MSW and PWID populations go through
averages of the data points (See Figure B2).

     uncertainty bounds. The solid curve is the best fitting simulation of total ART patient numbers.

The combination of relatively late diagnosis, together with low testing rates suggests that there
is a higher number of PLHIV than currently diagnosed.

APPENDIX E           GLOSSARY
Allocative          Within a defined resource envelope, AE of health or HIV-specific
efficiency (AE)     interventions provides the right intervention to the right people at the
                    right place in the correct way to maximize targeted health outcomes.
Behavioral          Discourages risky behaviors and reinforces protective ones, typically by
intervention        addressing knowledge, attitudes, norms, and skills.
Biomedical          Biomedical HIV intervention strategies use medical and public health
intervention        approaches to block infection, decrease infectiousness, and reduce
                    susceptibility.
Bottom-up           Costing method that identifies all of the resources that are used to provide
costing             a service and assigns a value to each of them. These values then are
                    summed and linked to a unit of activity to derive a total unit cost.
Cost-               Form of economic analysis that compares the relative costs and outcomes
effectiveness       (effects) of two or more courses of action.
analysis (CEA)
Effectiveness       Degree of achievement of a (health) outcome in a real-world
                    implementation setting.
Efficiency          Achievement of an output with the lowest possible input without
                    compromising quality.
Financial           Ability of government and its partners to continue spending on a health or
sustainability      HIV outcome for the required duration and to meet any cost of borrowing
                    without compromising the government’s, household’s, or other funding
                    partner’s financial position.
HIV incidence       Estimated total number (or rate) of new (total number of diagnosed and
                    undiagnosed) HIV infections in a given period.
HIV prevalence      Percentage of people who are infected with HIV at a given point in time.
Implementation      Set of measures to ensure that programs are implemented in a way that
efficiency          achieves outputs with the lowest input of resources. In practical terms,
                    improving implementation efficiency means identifying better delivery
                    solutions. Doing so requires improving planning, designing service
                    delivery models, and assessing and addressing service delivery
                    “roadblocks.” Implementation efficiency will improve the scale, coverage,
                    and quality of programs.
Incremental cost-   Equation commonly used in health economics to provide a practical
effectiveness       approach to decision making regarding health interventions. ICER is the
ratio (ICER)        ratio of the change in costs to incremental benefits of a therapeutic
                    intervention or treatment.
Model               Computer system designed to demonstrate the probable effect of two or
                    more variables that might be brought to bear on an outcome. Such models
                    can reduce the effort required to manipulate these factors and present the
                    results in an accessible format.
Opioid              Medical procedure of replacing an illegal opioid, such as heroin, with a
substitution        longer acting but less euphoric opioid. Methadone or buprenorphine
therapy (OST)       typically are used, and the drug is taken under medical supervision.

Opportunistic infection   Treatment given to PLHIV to prevent either a first episode of an OI
under medical             (primary prophylaxis) or the recurrence of infection (secondary
(OI prophylaxis)          prophylaxis).
Pre-exposure              Method for people who do not have HIV but are at substantial risk of
prophylaxis (PrEP)        acquiring it to prevent HIV infection by taking an antiretroviral drug.
Program effectiveness     Program effectiveness incorporates evaluations to establish what works
                          and impacts disease and/or transmission intensity, disseminating
                          proven practice, and improving the public health results of programs.
Program sustainability    Ability to maintain the institutions, management, human resources,
                          service delivery, and demand generation components of a national
                          response until impact goals have been achieved and maintained over
                          time as intended by the strategy.
Return on investments     Performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment
(ROI)                     or to compare the efficiency of a number of different investments. To
                          calculate ROI, the benefit (return) of an investment is divided by the cost
                          of the investment; the result is expressed as a percentage or a ratio.
Saturation                Maximum level of coverage that a program can achieve.
Technical efficiency      Delivery of a (health) service in a way that produces maximum output at
                          the lowest possible unit cost while according with operational quality
                          standards.
Top-down costing          Costing method that divides total expenditure (quantum of funding
                          available) for a given area or policy by total units of activity (such as
                          patients served) to derive a unit cost.
Universal health          Universal health coverage (UC), is defined as ensuring that all people
coverage (UC)             have access to the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and
                          palliative health services that they need, of sufficient quality to be
                          effective, while ensuring that the use of these services does not expose
                          the user to financial hardship.
