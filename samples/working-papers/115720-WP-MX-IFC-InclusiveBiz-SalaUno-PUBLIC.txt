2.3 million people in Mexico suffer from cataracts, making untreated cataracts the number one
cause of blindness in the country.1 With an aging population and a high incidence of diabetes,
that number is only expected to rise.2

volume of patients, and waiting times could be as high as
a year. Patients with other pathologies—such as diabetic
retinopathy and glaucoma—had even lower access to care,
leaving 70 percent of glaucoma cases undiagnosed and up
to 7 percent of diabetic patients blind.4 Private providers
offered better quality and more timely services, but at
prices that were too high for much of the population.5


Carlos Orellana and Javier Okhuysen founded the eye care
provider salauno to create a cost-efficient, high-quality
solution to this growing problem. salauno’s mission is
to “eliminate needless blindness in Mexico” by providing
affordable and accessible eye care services to patients of
all income levels. In the first five years since its founding in
2011, the company has provided eye care to over 230,000
people and grown from one surgical center in Mexico City
into a network of ten mid-sized Diagnostic Centers with a
staff of over 200, offering a range of services throughout
the Mexico City Metropolitan Area and the broader Valley
of Mexico.6

government hospitals performed an estimated 67 percent
of cataract surgeries, non-profit hospitals 11 percent, and
private practices 22 percent.9 Okhuysen and Orellana felt
that they could carve out a significant market share if they
could drive costs down and guide patients from diagnosis
to health outcome at a very large scale.


For the next few years, the entrepreneurs worked on their
business plan for a private eye hospital while holding on
to their day jobs and other pursuits. In December 2010,
Orellana finished his master’s degrees and Okhuysen left
his job in private equity. They traveled to India for a six-
week course at the Lions Aravind Institute of Community
Ophthalmology, a university founded by Aravind, so that
they could learn more details about Aravind’s business
model. When they returned, Orellana and Okhuysen set up               private practices, work for a government hospital where
