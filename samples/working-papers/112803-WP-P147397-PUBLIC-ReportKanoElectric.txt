Preface

This Volume was produced under the Nigeria Electrification Access Program Development (NEAPD) Tech-
nical Assistance project for the Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO), which provides electricity
services to the States of Kano, Katsina and Jigawa in North West Nigeria. The Volume is combined by two re-
ports: a GIS-based Least-Cost Plan and a related Investment Prospectus. Together, they present a technically
sound electrification and investment plan for the achievement of universal access to electricity services in the
Kano service area by 2030. Both the Geospatial Plan and the Investment Prospectus were produced in close
collaboration with KEDCO, and the NEAPD project also strengthened the utility’s capacity through train-
ing for the geospatial mapping of the electricity infrastructure and for distribution planning with GIS tools.
    The Least-Cost Plan provides a geospatial and quantitative frame for the design and detailing of a well-co-
ordinated and harmonized implementation program for grid and off-grid electrification over a fifteen-year
timeframe (2015–2030). Building on the findings of the geospatial plan and a rapid readiness assessment, the
Investment Prospectus proposes a year-by-year electrification program up to 2030 (including connections
for schools and clinics) and details the investment needs, financing gaps and possible sources of funding with
a focus on the first five years of implementation. The Prospectus also identifies key sector obstacles (related
to the policy, institutional and financing frameworks) for the implementation of an access rollout plan and
suggests possible areas requiring capacity strengthening through Technical Assistance.
    As demonstrated by best practices in international experience, investments alone will not be sufficient
to achieve universal access by 2030. They must be complemented by timely and effective enabling actions
on several other fronts, especially the establishment of an enabling policy, targeted fixes to the institutional
framework, and capacity strengthening of the key agents and institutions whose effective engagement is
essential. Besides KEDCO, the Federal Government of Nigeria (Ministry of Power and of Finance, and the
Office of the Vice President), the Regulator, and several other key stakeholders have a key role to play if elec-
tricity services are to be provided to over 80 million Nigerians currently living in the dark and ensure shared
well-being across the country.
    While the analysis and recommendations presented in this Volume reflect and respond to the operating
context and specific characteristics of the KEDCO utility, they also provide an input for the completion of
the bold sector reform launched by the Federal Government of Nigeria in 2010. While highlighting the make
or break challenges for scaling up access in the Kano service area, the Volume also provides a roadmap for
expanding access across the country in an efficient, effective, and timely manner.

  Based on census data, rural households have 6.1 persons on average vs. 5.8 for urban households. For simple computations and where the ratio of urban and rural households is
unknown, 6 persons per household is assumed.

  It is assumed that population growth from 2015–2030 among those who currently have grid access (components A and B) will lead to net formation of new households that will
need new connections requiring LV intensification (component C), MV grid extension (component D) or off-grid access.
c
  Average household costs are calculated by summing all CAPEX costs across all program components and dividing by the total number of households served.

unknown, 6 persons per household is assumed.

  It is assumed that population growth from 2015–2030 among those who currently have grid access (components A and B) will lead to net formation of new households that will
need new connections requiring LV intensification (component C), MV grid extension (component D) or off-grid access.

     Key Data
     Exchange rate, September 2015: US$ 1 = Naira 200. Calculations were made in 2015 and starting in January
     2016 the exchange rate experienced major fluctuations (as of June 2016 the official exchange rate dropped to
     US$ 1 = Naira 280 and the unofficial rate is still lower).
     Price datum: mid-2015 (Costs are based on the prices and exchange rate of mid-2015. It is assumed that
     subsequent movements in the exchange rate will eventually feed through into local prices and costs and
     purchasing power parity will prevail.)

  Based on census data, rural households have 6.1 persons on average vs. 5.8 for urban households. For simple computations and where the ratio of urban and rural households is
unknown, 6 persons per household are assumed.
b
  It is assumed that population growth from 2015–2030 among those who currently have grid access (components A and B) will lead to net formation of new households that will
need new connections requiring LV intensification (component C), MV grid extension (component D).
c
  Average household costs are calculated by summing all CAPEX costs across all program components and dividing by the total number of households served.

  Note, the electrification rate declines between 2015 and 2018 because, despite some electrification in 2018, this has not kept pace with the growth in the number of households.
The same is not true of social institutions where the total number of institutions is assumed to be fixed (instead the size of the schools and clinics grow as the population grows).

a
  Based on census data, rural households have 6.1 persons on average vs. 5.8 for urban households. For simple computations and where the ratio of urban and rural households is
unknown, 6 persons per household are assumed.
b
  It is assumed that population growth from 2015–2030 among those who currently have grid access (components A and B) will lead to net formation of new households that will
need new connections requiring LV intensification (component C), MV grid extension (component D).
c
  Average household costs are calculated by summing all CAPEX costs across all program components and dividing by the total number of households served.
*Least-cost grid coverage is 97 percent.

  Note, the electrification rate declines between 2015 and 2018 because, despite some electrification in 2018, this has not kept pace with the growth in the number of households.
The same is not true of social institutions where the total number of institutions is assumed to be fixed (instead the size of the schools and clinics grow as the population grows).
