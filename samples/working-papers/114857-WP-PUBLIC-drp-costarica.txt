   What is at risk in Costa Rica?
   Economic assets such as residential and
   non-residential buildings are at risk. These
   assets that are exposed to natural disasters
   are referred to as a country’s Building

  What are the potential losses in Costa Rica?
  These charts show the estimated potential future losses to Costa Rica that could be caused by earthquakes and
  hurricanes that could occur within a given return period. In 1910, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck Costa Rica. If this
  historical event were to happen in 2015, it would cause losses of US$ 3,800M, amounting to 8% of GDP.
