The Philippines Economic Update (PEU) summarizes key economic and social developments, important
policy changes, and the evolution of external conditions over the past six months. It also presents findings
from recent World Bank analysis, situating them in the context of the country’s long-term development
trends and assessing their implications for the country’s medium-term economic outlook. The PEU covers
issues ranging from macroeconomic management, financial-market dynamics to the complex challenges
of poverty reduction and social development. It is intended to serve the needs of a wide audience,
including policymakers, business leaders, private firms and investors, and analysts and professionals
engaged in the social and economic development of the Philippines.
The PEU is a biannual publication of the World Bank’s Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global
Practice (MFM), prepared in partnership with the Poverty & Equity, Finance & Markets, and Social
Protection & Labor Global Practices (GPs). Birgit Hansl (Lead Economist and Program Leader) and Ndiame
Diop (Practice Manager for the MFM GP) guided the preparation of this edition. The team consisted of

                               EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Philippine economy continues to perform well relative to its regional peers. The Philippines
grew in the first half of 2017 faster than Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, but slower
than China. Following strong growth in the immediate two quarters after the new administration
assumed office in July 2016, the economy had a slower start in the first half of 2017. The country’s
economic growth rate fell gradually from 7.0 and 6.8 percent in the first and second half of 2016,
respectively, to 6.4 percent in the first half of 2017. Private consumption resumed its position as
the main engine of economic growth in the first half of 2017, and a rebound in exports
contributed to growth. Despite an improving external environment and continued
accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, both government consumption and capital
formation growth slowed in the first half of 2017, partly due to a slowdown in public spending
and investments that were initiated during the 2016 election period.

Fiscal and monetary policies remain supportive of growth. In the first half of 2017, the
government continued to pursue an expansionary fiscal policy which led to significantly higher
expenditures while the government missed its revenue target. As a result, the fiscal deficit
widened from 1.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2016 to 2.1 percent of GDP in the first half of
2017. Higher expenditures are in line with the government’s push to advance on the country’s
investment agenda, and are planned to be financed through a gradual expansion of the revenue
base, which is at the heart of the priority tax reform. Meanwhile, the central bank has maintained
its key policy rate at 3.0 percent since June of last year. Inflation climbed to an average of 3.1
percent and was in part driven by higher food prices, which disproportionally affect poor
households. Inflationary pressures also continue due to the pass-through effect of the
depreciating Philippine peso and rising demand-side pressures, as the economy is operating near
capacity. Higher inflation started to not only dampen consumer and business sentiments, but
likely contributed to consumption and investment growth moderating.

Although external demand picked up, output growth is slowing and sentiments are weakening.
A favorable external environment helped to increase exports from 10.4 percent, year-on-year, in
the first half of 2016 to 20.0 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, which was the fastest
half-year growth since the second half of 2010. However, manufacturing activity slowed in the
first half of 2017, and manufacturing output contracted in July for the first time since June 2015.
At the same time, business confidence declined to its lowest level in three years. Consumer
sentiments, which reached record highs in the first half of 2017, have also recently moderated.
Rising concerns among businesses and consumers go beyond a weaker peso and higher inflation.
They extend to the conflict in Mindanao, limited income increases, and the fact that
unemployment increased from a historic low of 4.7 percent in 2016 to 5.6 percent in July 2017.

The Philippines’ medium-term growth trajectory remains positive. The economy is projected to
expand at a slower rate in 2017 compared to 2016, and the growth rate will likely end up at the
lower end of the government’s target of 6.5-7.5 percent of GDP. The World Bank projects the
Philippine growth rate at 6.6 percent of GDP in 2017 and 6.7 percent of GDP in 2018 and 2019.
Exports are expected to increase to the country’s main trading partner, while imports are


                                                 VI
estimated to remain elevated due to high demand for intermediate and capital goods. Steady
consumption growth is projected to continue to provide the main base for growth, sustained by
an increase in remittances, an expansion of credit, and improved income levels. Higher capital
outlays and construction activities are expected to boost investment growth as the government
speeds up the implementation of its infrastructure program. Slower economic growth may
reduce the pace of poverty reduction, but the poverty rate is expected to fall, as the economy
continues its structural transformation.

Risks to the outlook are increasing. The ongoing U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes could lead to a
further depreciation of the peso and continued capital outflows from the Philippines. Rising
protectionism in some advanced economies increases the risk of lower levels of remittance and
foreign trade. The government made significant progress in building a pipeline for the planned
infrastructure program, however, a slow implementation of the infrastructure investment plan
could pose a risk to growth. Furthermore, there is a need to improve the management of public
finances and preserve fiscal sustainability when government infrastructure spending increases,
including improving revenue administration and collection. Despite these risks, the
administration is in a strong position, as macroeconomic fundamentals remain intact. However,
both the fiscal and monetary space to address risks can quickly diminish and limit the
government’s ability to mitigate those risks.

Policymakers need to confront downside risks while fostering long-term growth. The short-
term risks to the country’s outlook include increased trade protectionism, the possibility of
financial market disruptions, and elevated economic policy uncertainty. In the longer term,
weaker growth potential remains the main risk. Consistency in the government’s policies to
achieve stable inflation, fiscal stability, and security will help preserve consumer and business
confidence. For the Filipino consumer, it will be important that inflation remains at moderate
levels. This will warrant careful inflation management by the central bank authorities to anchor
expectations. As long as it is consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability, an expansionary
fiscal policy could support short-term growth. The successful and timely implementation of the
government’s fiscal program, including its ambitious infrastructure plan and efforts to generate
more revenue, would signal a strong commitment to the government’s policy priorities. Key
issues, such as mining regulations and regional development in Mindanao, will require policy
certainty to preserve both external and domestic confidence in the Philippine economy.

Implementing structural policies that support investment and trade will be critical to boost
productivity and potential growth in the long-term. These policies would require the
government’s commitment to reforms that promote competition in key sectors, secure property
rights, lessen regulatory complexities, and improve doing business in the country. Longer-term
policy priorities also include training and job search programs and other measures to support
workers most affected by sectoral shifts in employment and share the dividends of growth and
gains from globalization more widely. Sustained investment in human capital development and
in sectors that create quality employment are needed to safeguard the country’s progress on
delivering inclusiveness.

Part I:        RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS

The Philippine economy continues to perform well relative to its regional peers. Following strong
growth in the immediate two quarters after the new administration took over in July 2016, the
economy had a slower start in the first half of 2017. Capital formation growth eased to 9.7
percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, compared to its rally of 30.9 percent, year-on-year,
in the first half of 2016 when rapid economic expansion was spurred by a stimulus from election-
related spending and investment. Positive consumer sentiment, coupled with robust remittance
growth, boosted domestic consumption. A favorable external environment pushed export growth
from 10.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 20.0 percent, year-on-year, in the first
half of 2017. The services sector remained the principal engine of growth, and the agriculture
sector recovered strongly as farm output benefitted from favorable weather conditions. Fiscal
and monetary policies remained supportive of growth. The government executed its programmed
budget in the first half of 2017 despite lower revenues, and the central bank kept its policy rate
steady despite climbing inflation. The Philippine peso continued to weaken in the first half of 2017,
impacted by the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes. The balance of payments turned into deficit in the
first half of 2017, driven by higher capital outflows. Sustained economic growth increases the
likelihood that poverty reduction has continued.

1.1      Growth: Consistent Performance

The Philippine economy had slow start in the first half of 2017. Consumer demand remained
consistently robust while capital formation growth decelerated, and net exports rebounded
alongside improving external demand.

1.      The Philippines remained a consistent growth performer in the East Asia region,
although growth moderated in the first half of 2017 (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The Philippines grew
in the first half of 2017 faster than Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, but slower than
China. Following strong growth in the immediate months after the new administration assumed
office in July 2016, the economy had a slow start in the first half of 2017. The GDP growth rate
was 6.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, compared to 7.0 and 6.8 percent in the
first and second half of 2016, respectively. Both the growth in government consumption and
capital formation weakened significantly on an annual basis, partly due to the slowdown in the
large election-related spending and investments initiated in the first half of 2016. Private
consumption resumed its position as the main engine of economic growth, and a rebound in
exports contributed to growth. However, consumption and investment growth slowed in the first
half of 2017 compared to the second half of 2016 despite an improvement in the external
environment and continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.

2.     Firming global economic activity improved the country’s net exports performance.1 The
economic recovery in both advanced economies as well as in emerging markets and developing
economies2 led to a strong boost in the demand for the Philippines’ main export commodities
(Box 1). Exports increased from 10.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 20.0
percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, which was the fastest half-year growth since the
second half of 2010. Electronics components, especially semiconductors, which comprise half of
the country’s total exports of goods, expanded significantly.3 Meanwhile, import growth
moderated to 18.6 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, compared to from 23.2
percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016. A 25.8 percent year-on-year increase in the
imports of intermediary electronic goods, particularly components and semiconductors which
grew by 36.2 percent, drove the growth in imports in the first half of 2017.

3.      Private consumption remained the main engine of economic growth, although it
weakened in the first half of 2017. Household consumption growth decreased from 7.3 percent,
year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 5.8 percent in the first half of 2017. However, it remained
in line with the average growth of 5.7 percent during 2010-2016. Consumption growth was
supported by an accommodative monetary policy stance which kept the key policy rates low. The

in the balance of payments section, where net exports are assessed based on values at current prices.

economies. Please refer to World Bank (2017b) for a list of all advanced economies.

  Exports of electronics components increased by 25.7 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, up from 8.7
percent in the previous year. This was fueled by the growth of semiconductor exports, which expanded by 24.2
percent, year-on-year, over the same period.

                                                           2
low interest rate environment led to a sustained increase in consumer loans, which together with
remittances from overseas Filipinos expanded by 5.5 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months
of 2017, further boosting household purchasing power. Moreover, the Filipino consumer
confidence index registered record-high levels during the first half of 2017 and only weakened
recently (Box 2). However, inflation levels increased from an average of 1.3 percent in the first
half of 2016 to 3.1 percent in the first six months of 2017.

4.      Growth in capital formation dropped sharply in the first half of 2017 following unusually
strong investment growth during the election year. Fixed capital formation growth decelerated
from 29.3 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 12.1 percent in the first half of 2017
(Figure 3). Investment growth in durable equipment moderated to 13.2 percent, year-on-year, in
the first half of 2017, compared to from 41.3 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016.
Moreover, the construction sector grew by 8.8 percent, year-on-year, in the first sixth months of
2017, considerably slower than the 16.7 percent, year-on-year, recorded in the first half of 2016.
Similarly, public construction grew by only 9.0 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017,
down from 34.9 percent during the same period in the previous year. This marked slowdown in
investment growth was in part due to the high base in the first half of 2016, when large election-
related spending significantly boosted capital spending.4 Furthermore, the slowdown in capital
formation was a result of the slow start in the implementation of the government’s infrastructure
program in the first half of 2017.

5.      On the production side, the services sector remains the principal contributor to
economic growth in the Philippines, although growth in both the services and industry sectors
slowed significantly in the first half of 2017 (Figure 4). The services sector, which constitutes 60
percent of the country’s output, contributed 3.7 percentage points to overall growth in the first
six months of 2017. The sector grew by 6.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017,
compared to 7.9 percent during the first half of 2016. Growth in wholesale and retail trade and
real estate remained the principal growth drivers in the services sector. The expansion in the
industry sector also moderated in the first half of 2017 to 6.8 percent, year-on-year, compared
to 8.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016, as growth in the construction sector slowed
due to a combination of base effects from the previous year and the slow start to the
government’s public infrastructure program in the first quarter of 2017.5 The manufacturing
subsector continued to drive growth in industry, with growth remaining at over seven percent in
the first half of 2017. However, overall manufacturing output weakened and contracted in July.
Meanwhile, the three other industry subsectors all posted weaker performance in 2017
compared 2016, including the mining sector, which contracted by 1.2 percent, year-on-year,
during the first half of 2017, a reversal from the 2.7 percent growth registered during the first six
months of 2016 (Box 3Error! Reference source not found.).

  Pre-election investment frontloading played a key role in the strong expansion of capital formation in the first half
of 2016. The stimulus from election-related spending led to an acceleration in the growth of fixed capital formation
from 13.5 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2015 to 29.3 percent in the same period in 2016.

  Growth in the construction sector dropped from 13.8 percent in the first half of 2016 to 7.4 percent in the first half
of 2017. Its contribution to growth in the industry sector declined from 29 to 20 percent during the same period.

6.      The country’s agricultural sector expanded during the first half of 2017. The sector grew
by 5.6 percent, year-on-year, reversing a contraction of 3.2 percent recorded during the same
period in the previous year. A low base year and more favorable conditions for farm output, as
the effects of the El Niño phenomenon largely dissipated, contributed to the recovery in
agriculture.

                Box 1. The global economic recovery solidified in the first half of 2017
Global activity is firming broadly as international trade is picking up. Global economic growth firmed
in the first six months of 2017 and contributed to an improvement in confidence worldwide, and
industrial activities recovered, as global trade picked up after two years of slow growth. Output gaps
are narrowing and inflation rates are converging with central bank targets, as the modest recovery in
major advanced economies continues. The demand for imports has also strengthened, further
contributing to the recovery in global trade. Meanwhile, in emerging market and developing
economies, obstacles to growth among commodity exporters are gradually diminishing, while activity
in commodity importers remains generally robust. Given the improved confidence and less policy
tightening in some commodity-exporting countries, domestic demand is leading the global economic
upturn.
Advanced economies experienced solid economic performance in the beginning of 2017, with
investments and exports regaining momentum after subdued growth in 2016. Private consumption
decelerated somewhat in early 2017 despite improvements in labor markets. In the United States, a
deceleration in consumer spending temporarily held back market activity, but it was partly offset by an
increase in private investment. In the Euro Area, manufacturing activity and the exports of goods have
been lifted by strengthening global trade and investment at a time when the unemployment rate fell
to 9.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017, about 2.5 percentage points below its peak in 2013. Economic
growth also accelerated in Japan, supported by an increase in exports, investments, and capital
spending.
As international conditions improved, growth in emerging markets and developing economies
accelerated in 2017 after reaching a post-crisis low of 3.5 percent in 2016. Following years of near
stagnating growth, a gradual recovery in commodity-exporting countries is supported by firming
commodity prices, recovering industrial activity, stabilizing investments, and improving confidence.
This recovery is broad-based, impacting nearly 70 percent of commodity exporters in 2017. For
commodity importers, economic growth continues to be robust, supported by accommodative policies
aimed at increasing domestic demand and a recovery in global trade which is bolstering export growth.
Returns on assets in emerging markets and developing economies posted solid gains throughout the
first half of 2017 but started to fall in July. Global financing conditions continue to be primarily driven
by shifting expectations about monetary policy in the United States and the Euro Area. U.S. long-term
yields decreased throughout much of the second quarter of 2017, reflecting disappointing inflation
outcomes and diminished expectations of substantial fiscal stimulus. However, yields shifted upward
in June 2017, reflecting the renewed pace of monetary policy normalization. As a result, capital flows
and bond funds in emerging markets and developing economies registered net outflows in July – the
first time in 2017. Moreover, currencies have suffered from tightening, especially for higher-risk and
commodity exporters.

                                Box 2. Confidence in the Philippine economy
    Even though the confidence of the Philippine business community improved as the economy grew
    over recent years, consumer optimism has been lagging. The government’s commitment to
    macroeconomic stability and good governance helped accelerate economic growth and earned the
    country international recognition.6 For the private sector, this prolonged period of improved
    macroeconomic management has translated into a persistent trend of positive business sentiments7
    since 2007.8 However, there has been a long-term negative trend in the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’
    overall consumer confidence index since the consumer expectations survey launched in 2007. The fact
    that past high economic growth rates did not quickly translate into more inclusive growth might have
    contributed to a delay in improving consumer confidence.9
    Consumer confidence surveys registered a positive value for the first time in the third quarter of
    2016, but weakened since then. Even though consumer sentiments reached record highs in the first
    half of 2017, they have recently moderated, but still remain above 2016 levels.10 The gradual
    improvement in consumer sentiments was based on perceived positive prospects for the economy,
    improvements in household incomes due to a healthy job market, and government social protection
    programs (Figure 5).11 In particular, perceived improvements in peace and order fueled higher
    consumer confidence among Filipinos.12, 13 However, recent data from the third quarter 2017 Consumer
    Expectations Survey show that consumer confidence is demonstrating signs of renewed weakness,
    similar to that of recent business confidence indicators. The overall consumer confidence index fell
    slightly from 13.1 percent in the second quarter of 2017 to 10.2 percent in the third quarter of 2017
    due to concerns over higher inflation and unemployment and limited increases in income. Concerns
    over the conflict in Mindanao have likely also dampened overall consumer sentiment.

  The country is now rated at investment grade by the three major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s Global
Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings.

  Business confidence is measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ overall business confidence index. The
index is calculated as the percentage of firms that answered in the affirmative minus the percentage of firms that
answered in the negative in a given indicator. A positive confidence index indicates a favorable view. For more
information, see: http://www.bsp.gov.ph/publications/regular_business.asp.

  The only significant dip in business confidence occurred during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.
9
  Consumer confidence is measured through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ overall consumer confidence index.
The overall consumer confidence index is computed as the percentage of households that answered in the
affirmative less the percentage of households that answered in the negative in a given indicator. A positive
confidence        index       indicates       a     favorable      view.  For      more       information,    see:
http://www.bsp.gov.ph/publications/regular_consumer.asp.
10
   By the second quarter of 2017, the overall consumer confidence index reached 13.1, a record high for the
Philippines, and was the fourth consecutive quarter wherein the overall consumer outlook was positive.
11
   Record high levels of consumer confidence were also observed in the three component indicators of consumer
confidence in the second quarter of 2017: i) confidence in the country’s economic condition, ii) confidence in the
family’s financial situation, and iii) confidence in family income.
12
   The survey covering the second quarter of 2017 was conducted from April 1 to 12, 2017, which was before the
Marawi events and the declaration of Martial Law in Mindanao. However, the recent conflict in Marawi City was
among the factors cited in both the consumer and business expectations surveys as among the reasons for the
weakening in overall confidence.
13
   These were consistently the main reasons for overall positive consumer sentiment based on the Consumer
Expectations Survey from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017.

 There has been a recent weakening of business confidence (Figure 6). Based on the third quarter 2017
 results of the business expectations survey, overall business confidence declined to 37.9 percent from
 43.0 percent in the second quarter, the lowest level in three years. 14 The weak peso, higher inflation,
 and the ongoing conflict in Mindanao contributed to diminished business confidence. The Nikkei
 Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index15, which appears to be a reasonable predictor of the
 Philippines’ main output indicators, remained in expansion territory in the first eight months of 2017.
 However, it has weakened since May 2017 in line with the worsening of business sentiment since the

                          Box 3. Regulation and investments in the mining industry
 The Philippines is the fifth most mineral-rich country in the world for gold, nickel, copper, and
 chromite. It has an estimated US$840.0 billion worth of untapped mineral resources, and about 9
 million hectares of land have a high mineral potential. The metal and non-metal deposits in the
 Philippines are estimated at 21.5 billion and 19.3 billion metric tons, respectively.18
 In recent years, changes in government regulations and policy uncertainties have limited foreign
 investment in the mining industry. Despite the 1995 Philippine Mining Act, which opened up the
 country’s mining sector to 100 percent foreign ownership, foreign direct investment in the mining
 industry remain subdued (Figure 8). As a result, growth in the sector has been uneven with occasional
 periods of contraction (Figure 7). Government efforts to improve the mining industry face the difficult
 task of attracting new investments while protecting the environment and communities. In 2012,
 Executive Order no. 79 was enacted to reform the Mining Act by establishing mineral reservations 19,
 expanding areas closed to mining operations, creating a Mining Industry Coordinating Council to help
 enforce mining laws, and imposing a moratorium on new mineral permits until legislation can be
 enacted to rationalize existing revenue sharing schemes. However, legislation has yet to be introduced
 in Congress, and the moratorium is still in place five years later.
 Mining is increasingly financed by domestic sources. Domestic corporate lending in the industry
 increased steadily since June 2014, and it surpasses foreign direct investment by a wide margin (Figure
 9). Outstanding domestic credit grew 31.3 percent annually between June 2010 and June 2017. Based
 on data from five major mining companies, capital expenditures and debt refinancing constitute the
 bulk of outstanding credit for major industry players in the long term, while short term debt for working
 capital requirements makes up a smaller portion.20

    A reading of above 50 for the Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) indicates economic
expansion while a reading below 50 points to a contraction.

   Likewise, the Philippine Institute of Supply Managers, which releases its own PMI data for a broader set of sectors,
including manufacturing, services, and wholesale and retailed trade, mirrors the overall trend seen in the Nikkei
Manufacturing PMI, suggesting an expansion of output from firms in these sectors. Data from the PISM PMI was
accessed        through         the       BSP’s     selected       economic       and       financial       indicators:

There remains uncertainty in the policy environment surrounding the mining industry. In the first half
of 2017, the former environment secretary ordered the closure of 23 of the Philippines’ 41 mines, the
cancellation of 75 mining contracts in watershed areas, and banned prospective open-pit mines. In
addition, the 2012 moratorium on new mining permits under the Executive Order no. 79 has yet to be
lifted, and mining firms that were suspended still await the review of their appeals. This uncertainty is
a challenge for investors who seek policy consistency and make business decisions based on an analysis
of risks and potential returns. There are discussions in Congress about new legislation dealing with
responsible mining practices, mining taxation, and revenue-sharing schemes. The push towards
responsible mining should address concerns over the environmental and social impacts of mining. The
most cited negative environmental impacts involve land and water contamination, such as the 1996
contamination of the Boac river from a tailing dam failure, and destruction of forest, farmlands, corals
reefs, and deep rifts due to mining pollution. Social impact concerns include the relinquishment of
ancestral domains of indigenous people and reports of intimidation.

1.2      The Exchange Rate and The External Sector: Weakening Balance of Payments


While the Philippines’ current-account deficit remained stable, the peso was impacted by the
Federal Reserve’s rate hikes and continued to weaken, and the country’s balance of payments
turned into deficit because of increasing capital outflows.


7.       The Philippine peso further depreciated in the first half of 2017. In nominal terms, the
peso depreciated by 6.5 percent, year-on-year, to average Php/US$49.93 in the first half of 2017,
from an average of Php/US$46.88 in the same period last year (Figure 10). The real effective
exchange rate depreciated from a 3.2 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 3.7
percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017. The real depreciation of the peso has been larger
compared to other regional currencies (Box 4). There were two episodes of a marked
depreciation of the peso’s nominal exchange rate in the first half of 2017. It depreciated 0.9
percent, month-on-month, in February and 1.2 percent, month-on-month, in June. In both
instances, the expectations of and actual U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes led to capital outflows
from the Philippines.21 In addition, strong imports raised the demand for the U.S. dollar and
weakened the peso. In July, the central bank reportedly intervened to temper excessive volatility
in the foreign-exchange market. As a result, gross international reserves slipped from US$85.5
billion in July 2016 to US$81.3 and US$80.8 billion in June and July 2017, respectively. At its
current level, the reserves cover 8.6 months’ worth of goods imports, payments of services, and
primary income. It is also equivalent to 5.5 times the country’s short-term external debt based
on original maturity and 3.7 times based on residual maturity.

8.       The current-account deficit slightly moderated in the first half of 2017. It registered a
US$233.6 million (0.2 percent of GDP) deficit in the first half of 2017, slightly lower than the 0.3
percent of GDP deficit recorded in the first half of 2016 (US$423.9 million). The current account
was stable in the first year of the new administration.22 The trade balance continued to widen
from 11.8 percent of GDP (US$18.2 billion) in the first half of 2016 to 12.9 percent of GDP
(US$19.4 billion) in the first half of 2017. However, the growth of the trade deficit slowed, from
82.1 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 11.9 percent, year-on-year, in the first half
of 2017 (Box 5). Exports grew at an annual rate of 14.6 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of
2017, compared to 6.3 percent, year-on-year, contraction in the first half of 2016. Import growth
continued to grow but at a slower rate of 10.1 percent in the first six months of 2017, compared
to 21.8 percent in the first half of 2016 (Figure 11).23 Services exports weakened in the first half
of 2017, including export revenues for business process outsourcing services. The growth in
personal remittances remained robust at 5.5 percent annually and reached US$15.4 billion in the
first half of 2017, compared to 4.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 (Box 6).

   As of August 2017, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised the interest rate twice for the year: on March 16 and June

   The current-account deficit stood at US$530.0 million (0.3 percent of GDP) in the second half of 2016.

   The discussion of net exports in this section assesses values at current prices. This differs from the discussion of
net exports in the growth section, where net exports assess values at constant 2000 prices.

9.       Increasing capital outflows led to the balance of payment swinging into deficit (Figure
12). The capital and financial accounts deteriorated in the first year of the administration, posting
net outflows of US$81.9 million (0.1 percent of GDP) in the first half of 2017 after US$1.1 billion
(0.7 percent of GDP) net outflows in the second half of 2016. This compared to the net inflows of
US$1.5 billion (1.0 percent of GDP) in the first half of 2016. This can be partially explained by the
ongoing U.S. Federal Reserve rate tightening cycle and recovery in advanced economies which
made foreign assets more attractive, leading to foreign equity outflows from the Philippines and
a weakening of the country-specific investment sentiment. In the first half of 2017, there was a
net outflow of US$3.0 billion in portfolio investments which was exacerbated by a net outflow of
US$0.5 billion in other investments.24 Foreign direct investments, which represent long-term
investments, also moderated from registering US$4.2 billion in net inflows during the first half of
2016 to a net inflow of US$3.6 billion in the first six months of 2017. The deterioration in the
capital and financial accounts overrode the modest improvement in the current account. As a
result, the country’s balance of payments remained in deficit for the entire first year of the new
administration, registering a deficit of US$705.7 million (0.5 percent of GDP) in the first half of
2017. This was a reversal of the US$633.7 million (0.4 percent of GDP) surplus registered in the
first half of 2016 but an improvement from the US$1.1 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) deficit in the
second half of 2016 (Table 1).

  Other investment accounts consisted of domestic deposits in foreign banks and non-residents net loans from local
banks.

                      Box 4. Opportunities and challenges of a weaker currency
In line with other regional currencies, the Philippine peso has steadily weakened since January 2013.
The Philippine peso slid in nominal terms from Php/US$40.00 in 2013 to Php/US$50.58 in July 2017. Its
performance in the past four years is comparable with other regional currencies and performed slightly
better than the Malaysian ringgit and Indonesian rupiah (Figure 13). However, the peso was the
weakest performer in the region during the first six months of 2017, and it dropped to a fresh 11-year
low in August at a time when other regional currencies had gained strength.
The depreciation of the country’s real effective exchange rate creates a relative price advantage that
the Philippines can explore. The real effective peso exchange rate depreciated at a moderate pace of
3.1 percent, year-on-year, in first half of 2017, which made it the worst regional performer with the
exception of China’s yuan (Figure 14). The depreciation of the peso has made it relatively cheaper to
produce and export Philippine goods, improving the country’s export competitiveness in the region.
This could help explain the country’s strong export performance over the past six months, as firms with
established export products and sufficient production capacity to increase output in the short-term
were in a position to immediately take advantage of the price advantage. However, initial investments
might be required for companies to take advantage of opportunities in more competitive markets.
Global developments, such as the ongoing U.S. policy rate normalization and Brexit, have contributed
to the depreciation of the peso. The anticipation of U.S. Federal Reserve rate increases and uncertainty
surrounding Brexit caused capital outflows from emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region, as
investors moved funds to safer markets and U.S. assets regained attractiveness. In the Philippines, the
stock exchange endured stock sell-offs in the last quarter of 2016 (US$357.0 million in September and
US$383.0 million in November 2016) and in February 2017 that brought volatility in the foreign-
exchange market and the continued deterioration of the peso. Since then, stocks in the Philippines have
rebounded in line with top performing major stock indices in the region, and the country’s stock market
reached a record-high of 8,321 in September 2017. However, the peso exchange rate has remained at
relative low levels, with the market expecting further depreciation.
Widening current- and fiscal-account deficits and the continuing depreciation of the peso are
weighing heavily on investor sentiments and preserving confidence will be important. There are
concerns over the anticipated current-account deficit in 2017, the first in 14 years, and the ambitious
public infrastructure investment plan that is expected to lead to a budget deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP
over the next five years. There is a risk of overheating the economy if investments in new production
capacity do not keep pace with demand, which could result in a higher inflation rate and a further
weakening of the peso. Although the public infrastructure investment plan is consistent with the
country’s development needs and will require greater capital formation and capital imports for some
time, it will also need to be carefully managed to mitigate risks.

The Philippines trade balance has been in deficit for the past five years (Figure 15). Goods exports
grew at an annual rate of 2.6 percent, while merchandise imports grew at the faster annual rate of 5.7
percent between 2011 and 2016. On average, the trade deficit was around 7.9 percent of GDP in 2011-
2016, but rose to 8.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2017.
Exports rebounded in early 2017 after two consecutive years of weak growth. Goods exports
expanded by 14.6 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017, compared to a 6.3 percent,
year-on-year, contraction in the same period in 2016. Leading the rebound was the exports of electronic
products, including semiconductors and electronic data processing machines, which accounted for
more than two-fifths of the growth, followed by the exports of forest, mineral, and petroleum products
which constituted about a quarter of the growth. The exports of agriculture-based products and other
manufactured goods also increased compared to last year’s contractions, in part due to the general
improvement in the external environment. Yet given the slower growth of exports compared to
imports, the continued adoption of policies to further improve the country’s export competitiveness
remains important.
Even though the recent rise in imports exacerbated the trade deficit, a sizable share of the imports
was capital goods. Capital goods, which used to constitute about a quarter of the total import bill
during 2011-2015, made up about a third of total imports since 2016 (Figure 16). Imports of capital
goods grew at an average rate of 12.4 percent in 2011-2016. In the first half of 2017, they grew by 5.5
percent, year-on-year, driven by the imports of power generating and specialized machines,
telecommunication equipment, and office and electronic data processing machines. Since capital goods

are necessary inputs to build production capacity, their import growth is a welcome development to
secure the country’s potential and future growth.
Raw materials and intermediate goods imports increased as they are key inputs in the production of
Philippine exports. In 2011-2016, the imports of raw materials and intermediate goods grew at an
annual rate of 4.6 percent. They grew from 8.8 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 9.9
percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017. Materials for the manufacturing of electronic equipment
constituted a key share among intermediate goods (23.1 percent) and are important for the country’s
main exports of semiconductors and electronic products.
Consumer goods imports rose alongside increasing domestic incomes. As income levels rise in line
with rising GDP levels, the propensity to consume imported goods is likely to continue to be strong. In
2011-2016, the imports of consumer goods grew at an annual rate of 15.5 percent, and they grew by
6.5 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017, largely as a result of an increase in imports of
both non-durable goods, such as food items, and durable goods, such as passenger cars and home
appliances. In the first half of 2017, 16.8 percent of total imports were consumer goods while about
38.6 percent were raw materials and intermediate goods.

 Remittances continued to increase in the first six months of 2017, helped by the improving global
 economy and the continued strong deployment of overseas Filipinos. Personal remittances sent by
 overseas Filipinos expanded 5.5 percent, year-on-year, and reached US$15.4 billion (10.2 percent of
 GDP) in the first half of 2017, outpacing the 4.4 percent, year-on-year, expansion registered during the
 same period in the previous year (Figure 17). Meanwhile, cash remittances increased by 4.7 percent,
 year-on-year, over the same period to reach US$13.8 billion (9.2 percent of GDP), in line with the central
 bank’s projection of US$28.0 billion for 2017. Preliminary data from the Philippine Overseas
 Employment Administration reveal that a total of 1.1 million Filipinos were deployed overseas, on track
 to surpass the 2.1 million overseas Filipinos recorded in 2016.
 The source of remittances in the first half of 2017 broadly reflected the Filipino diaspora. Cash
 remittances from the North and South America accounted for the largest share of remittance inflows
 (Figure 18), comprising 36.6 percent of total remittances, 90 percent of which were from the United
 States. The Middle East remained the second largest source of remittances, with a 28.3 percent share
 in the first half of 2017, followed by Asia (18.3 percent) and Europe (13.8 percent). These trends
 mirrored the distribution of around 9.2 million overseas Filipinos in 2016, with the United States
 accounting for the largest share of Filipino migrants at 39.5 percent (land-based), followed by the
 Middle East (24.8 percent), Asia and the Pacific (21.6 percent), and Europe (7.2 percent).25

 The term "Net unclassified items" is a balancing figure. There are two methods of computing the BOP position: the first approach uses the change in net
international reserves due to transactions, while the second approach computes the sum balances of the current account, capital account less financial
account. The two measures do not necessarily tally. The BSP uses the first approach to determine the overall BOP position.




1.3          Financial Markets and Monetary Policy: Inflation Peaked and Remains Sticky


Inflation peaked in April and remained at elevated levels. Monetary policy remained
accommodative to growth and domestic credit continued to expand. The financial system remains
stable and well capitalized.


10.     In the first half of 2017, inflation climbed to 3.4 percent and continued to stay at around
three percent since. The average headline inflation rate stood at 3.1 percent in the first eight
months of 2017, compared to 1.5 percent average of the same period last year. It has been
steadily increasing since 2016, from a low of 0.9 percent, year-on-year, in February 2016 to a
peak of 3.4 percent, year-on-year, in April this year. However, it remained within the central
bank’s target range of 2-4 percent and decelerated in June 2017 to 2.8 percent before picking up
again in August to 3.1 percent (Figure 19).

11.     The price of food has been the main driver of the country’s high inflation rate , as higher
prices for staple food items caused about half of the initial average increase in the inflation rate.
Rice prices also increased towards the second quarter of 2017 in line with the end of the main
harvest season coupled with lower production in certain provinces because of pest infestation
and floods (Box 7). Food prices increased to a maximum of 4.3 percent in April. Between May
and July 2017, food prices declined only to climb back up to 3.7 percent in August due to the


                                                                                        17
adverse effects of the recent typhoons. Throughout the first eight months of 2017, energy prices
remained higher than in 2016, reflecting higher local electricity costs and elevated global crude
oil prices. Core inflation accelerated to an average of 2.8 percent in the first eight months of 2017,
compared to 1.7 percent in the same period last year. This was partly the result of the pass-
through effect of the two peso depreciation episodes. It peaked in April at 3.0 percent, eased
back to 2.6 percent in June before climbing back to 3.0 percent in August. The authorities have
maintained the key policy rate at 3.0 percent since June 2016, as the inflation rate remained
within the target range.

12.     The financial market remained characterized by ample domestic liquidity and strong
credit growth. In the first seven months of 2017, domestic liquidity growth remained robust at
12.3 percent, year-on-year (the same growth rate as in the first seven months of 2016), and
averaged Php9.6 trillion. Credit growth, i.e. loans of commercial banks, net of reverse repurchase
placements, grew from 17.7 percent, year-on-year, in the first seven months of 2016 to 19.7
percent, year-on-year, in the first seven months of 2017. Loans to firms, net of reverse
repurchase placements, dominate the banks’ loan portfolio and constitute 88.7 percent of the
aggregate loan portfolio. They grew on average 18.1 percent, year-on-year, in the first seven
months of 2017 compared to 16.7 percent, year-on-year, in the first seven months of 2016. The
credit expansion to businesses was primarily driven by lending to the real estate, electricity and
gas, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing sectors (Figure 20). Loans to households grew
from 17.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first seven months of 2016 to 23.6 percent, year-on-year,
in the first seven months of 2017, with motor vehicle and salary loans constituting the bulk of
new loans. Compared to neighboring countries, the Philippines’ domestic credit -to-GDP ratio is
low at 44.7 percent in 2016 (Figure 21).26

13.     The Philippine banking sector was stable and profitable in the first half of 2017. The
financial system remained stable with nonperforming loans maintained at 2.0 percent of the total
loan portfolio by end-July 2017, down from 2.2 percent at end-July 2016 (Figure 21). Banks
maintained a strong capital adequacy ratio of 15.3 percent on average as of March 2017, well

stable with an average net interest margin of 3.3 percent and net interest income at 73.8 percent
of total income throughout the first half of 2017. The return on assets averaged 1.2 percent and
the return on equity 9.9 percent over the first six months of 2017. Starting on July 1 st, the
appointment of a new central bank governor became effective after the term of the previous
governor ran out. The newly appointed central bank governor promised a commitment to policy

                                    Box 7. Rice policies and food inflation
 In the Philippines, fluctuations in the price of rice have a significant influence on food inflation (Figure
 22). Rice is a staple food among Filipinos and covers about a quarter of the food in the Consumer Price
 Index (CPI) basket or 8.9 percent of the total CPI basket. As a result of the global rice crisis in 2008,
 Philippine rice prices rose by 35-40 percent in 2008-2009, and food inflation peaked at 17.3 percent in
 July 2008. Following the domestic rice shortage in 2013, the price of rice rose by 15-20 percent in 2013-
 2014, and food inflation peaked at 8.3 percent in August 2014. Historically, the negative impact of food
 inflation weighs more heavily on the poor. Poor households spend about 70 percent of their income on
 food, with 23 percent on rice, while families in the middle and upper classes spend only 30 percent of
 their income on food.29

 Timely rice imports and responsive rice stock management are critical to smoothing rice prices. Rice
 imports are largely controlled by the National Food Authority (NFA) which is mandated to maintain a
 30-day stock during lean season and a 15-day stock at any given time.30 However, restrictions on rice
 imports in recent years left the rice supply inadequate at times, and the mistiming of imports has caused
 a number of price hikes. For instance, domestic rice prices increased in 2014 because of importation
 lags, even as world rice prices fell.31 There have been improvements in rice stock management since
 2015, in part through higher and timelier imports. Total imports reached 1.5 million tons in 2015 which
 supplemented local supply and managed to keep the rice price inflation at a low single digit.
 The NFA’ level of rice stocks has raised concerns over potential shortages and price hikes during the
 lean July-September season. The NFA is currently expediting its stock replenishment. In May, it shifted

by a collective limit of 805,000 metric tons per year and levied with 35 percent tariff rates.

 its import scheme from government-to-government procurement to government-to-private
 procurement32, allowing private foreign firms to participate in the bidding process, a move seen as
 more competitive and transparent. The bids for 250,000 metric tons of rice were awarded in July and
 will be delivered on a staggered basis from August to September. Meanwhile, the government has also
 approved private sector imports of 805,200 metric tons of rice in an auction that is expected to take
 place during the last quarter of 2017.
 The Philippine government recently extended the quantitative restriction (QR) for rice imports for
 three more years until June 30, 2020. QRs on rice imports violate the agreement with the World Trade
 Organization that the government signed on January 1, 1995. However, as a transition rule, the World
 Trade Organization allowed the Philippines to impose a 10-year rice import QR system in 1995, which
 was extended four times in 2004, 2012, 2014, and 2017. The new administration’s economic team
 actively promotes the lifting of rice import restrictions to attract more private sector participation. The
 Department of Agriculture, however, supports an extended grace period before the restrictions are
 removed to give farmers more time to adjust. The Philippines plans to offer trade concessions for
 several products for three more years in exchange for an extension of the QRs on rice imports. 33
 Meanwhile, a bill has been filed in the Senate for the tariffication34 of rice imports and the creation of
 a competitive enhancement fund that will benefit rice farmers.
 In the long term, effective rice import and stock management needs to be complemented with
 improvements in agricultural productivity and logistics. Liberalizing rice imports and improving rice
 stock management are not the only tools for managing domestic rice prices. Only 6 to 7 percent of total
 global rice production is traded internationally.35 As a result, the Philippines is likely to remain
 vulnerable to covariate shocks in regional exporting countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand. In the
 Philippines, the rice supply chain has high milling, drying, storage, and transportation costs, reflecting
 insufficient investments in roads and postharvest facilities as well as policy distortions. Increasing
 productivity and rice yields, including lowering the cost of transportation, would contribute to an
 improvement in the management of the country’s rice prices. Key to improving agricultural productivity
 is addressing the binding constraints to Mindanao’s agricultural sector, which contributes the largest
 share to the country’s agricultural output. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to Part III:
 Unlocking Mindanao’s Potential.




32
   This new scheme still allows foreign public sector entities to participate in the bidding process.

   The list of products for trade concessions has not yet been determined.

   Tariffication refers to the replacement of non-tariff barriers to trade, such as import quotas, with their estimated
tariff equivalent.

1.4                          Fiscal Policy: Staying on an Expansionary Path


In the first half of 2017, the government’s pursuit of an expansionary fiscal policy led to
significantly higher levels of public expenditures while revenues fell short of their targets. As a
result, the fiscal deficit increased to 2.1 percent of GDP.
14.     A second consecutive year of expansionary fiscal policy led to a further increase in the
fiscal deficit in the first half of 2017 (Figure 23 and Figure 24). The fiscal deficit increased in
nominal terms by 28.4 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017, widening the fiscal
gap from 1.7 percent of GDP in the first half of 2016 to 2.1 percent of GDP in the first half of 2017.
However, the fiscal deficit in 2017 was smaller than the deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP recorded in
the second half of 2016, when expenditures grew while revenues fell primarily due to seasonal
factors. In order to finance the deficit, the government continued to rely on mainly domestic
sources of financing. In the first half of the year, net domestic financing, which accounted for
92.9 percent of total financing, expanded to Php365.7 billion, more than triple the amount of
domestic financing registered in the first half of 2016. Moreover, net external financing nearly
quadrupled from Php7.2 billion in the first half of 2016 to Php28.2 billion in the first half of 2017.
This was a sharp reversal from the contraction of Php31.3 billion in foreign financing during the
second half of 2016. Despite an increase in borrowing, the overall debt-to-GDP ratio did not
worsen. It registered 42.5 percent of GDP in the first half of 2017, slightly down from 42.9 percent
in the same period a year ago, as nominal GDP growth outpaced the growth in the government
debt stock.

15.     After a slow start of the year, the government made significant progress in executing its
programmed budget in recent months (Table 2). Actual government expenditures amounted to
99.6 percent of programmed spending in the first half of 2017. This constitutes a significant
increase compared to previous years, when the government failed to execute its budget in a
timely manner, leading to significant underspending. Government expenditures increased by 9.0
percent, year-on-year, in nominal terms in the first half of 2017 to reach 17.7 percent of GDP,
which was the same level registered in the first half of 2016.36 This was slightly higher compared
to the second half of 2016 when expenditures reached 17.5 percent of GDP. Major expenditure
items in both capital outlays and recurrent expenditures, such as personal services and subsidies
to government corporations,37 drove the increase in government spending in the first half of
2017. Spending on personal services grew nearly three times, from 4.4 percent, year-on-year, in
the first half of 2016 to 13.1 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017, propelled by an
increase in salaries of government employees and uniformed personnel as well as hiring in key
agencies, such as the Department of Education and the Department of Health.38
16.      Despite the government’s infrastructure push, growth in capital outlays moderated in
the first half of 2017. It slowed from 47.2 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 31.8
percent, year-on-year, in the second half of 2016 and to finally 12.3 percent, year-on-year, in the
first half of 2017. A similar moderation can be seen in infrastructure and other capital outlays,
which grew by 8.8 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017 compared to 52.4 and 35.5
percent, year-on-year, in the first and second half of 2016, respectively. Meanwhile, growth of
capital transfers to local government units accelerated from 15.6 percent, year-on-year, in the
first half of 2016 to 37.1 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017.39
17.    Even though the government missed its revenue target, public revenue grew at a
healthy rate in the first half of 2017. Revenue growth accelerated under the new administration,
from 1.4 percent, year-on-year, in nominal terms in the first half of 2016 to 7.0 and 6.8 percent,
year-on-year, in nominal terms in the second half of 2016 and the first six months of 2017,
respectively (Table 3). However, revenue declined from 16.0 percent of GDP in the first half of
2016 to 15.6 percent of GDP in the first half of 2017, as non-tax revenue declined for the second
consecutive year and GDP grew faster than revenues. In the first half of 2017, non-tax revenue

   The national government recorded total spending of 17.5 percent of GDP in the second half of 2016.
37
   Subsidies to government corporations, although relatively small compared to other expenditure items, increased
by nearly 60 percent to fund the various programs of the NFA, the National Irrigation Administration, the Philippine
Health Insurance Corporation, and the National Housing Authority.
38
   The increase in salaries of government employees was a part of the second tranche under the implementation of
the adjustment of the compensation structure of government personnel under Executive Order No. 201 s. 2016.
Meanwhile, the adjustment of combat pay and incentives for uniformed and military personnel is pursuant to
Executive Order No. 3 s. 2016.
39
   The expansion in infrastructure and capital outlays was used to fund road construction, repair, and rehabilitation,
and flood control projects under the Department of Public Works and Highways, as well as the purchase of big-ticket
expenditure items under the modernization program of the Philippine military. Allotments and capital transfer to
local government units were used to repair, rehabilitate, and improve local roads under the conditional matching
grant      of    the      Local     Government       Support     Fund.     Source:     http://www.dbm.gov.ph/wp-

declined in nominal terms by 9.0 percent, from 1.7 percent of GDP in the first six months of 2016
to 1.4 percent of GDP, as total income from the Bureau of Treasury fell by 17.2 percent, year-on-
year.40 Moreover, tax revenue grew at a slower pace in nominal terms, from 10.1 percent, year-
on-year, in the first half of 2016 to 8.8 percent, year-on-year, in the first six months of 2017, as
no new tax policies were enacted and the country’s main revenue-generating agencies failed to
meet their collection targets. The Bureau of Internal Revenue, which is responsible for around 80
percent of tax revenue, fell short of the government’s target by 4.0 percent , and the Bureau of
Customs, which is responsible for around 20 percent of tax revenue, missed its target by 3.0
percent. As a result, the country managed to collect 14.2 percent of GDP in the first six months
of 2017, compared to 14.3 percent of GDP in the first half of 2016.
18.      On May 31, 2017, the first package of the government’s tax reform program successfully
passed in the House of Representatives on its third and final reading. The current version of the
bill estimates the revenue intake at Php119.4 billion (0.7 percent of GDP), compared to Php157.2
billion (0.9 percent of GDP) in an earlier version of the bill. On September 21, 2017, the Senate
of the Philippines filed its own version, Senate Bill No. 1592. Deliberations on SB 1592 are ongoing
as of the first week of October. Preliminary estimates by the Department of Finance reveal that
SB 1592 would yield lower additional revenue of Php59.9 billion (around 0.3 percent of GDP),41
as the Senate version reduced the threshold for personal income tax exemption, reduced the
removal of value added tax exemptions to 36 lines from 70 in the DOF version of the bill, and
restructured excise taxes on fuel, automobiles, and on sugar-sweetened beverages.42 The Senate
is proposing to pass Senate Bill 1592 on the third and final reading before regular session ends in
October. Differences between the Senate version and the House of Representatives will then be
settled in a bicameral conference, which the government hopes to conclude in November.
19.     The government submitted its proposed 2018 national budget of Php3.77 trillion to
Congress, with expenditure priorities broadly in line with the 2017 budget. The president
submitted the proposed 2018 national budget after the president’s second State of the Nation
Address on July 24, 2017. The budget is equivalent to 21.6 percent of GDP and is 12.4 percent
larger than the 2017 budget of Php3.35 trillion. It focuses on the government’s priorities of
increasing investment in human capital and infrastructure (Box 8). The House of Representatives
passed the proposed budget, House Bill No. 6215 or the General Appropriations Bill, on its third
and final reading on September 26, 2017. The General Appropriations Bill was then forwarded to
the Senate of the Philippines, where parallel deliberations are ongoing for its own version of the
budget. Once the Senate of the Philippines passes its own version of the budget, differences
between the lower house and upper house version will be settled through a bicameral
conference.

The 2018 national budget builds on the new administration’s development agenda as embodied in
the 0-10 Point Socioeconomic Agenda, through the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022 and the
AmBisyon Natin 2040. The proposed 2018 national budget of PhP3.77 trillion represents a 12.4 percent
increase over the previous year’s PhP3.35 trillion budget and aims to reduce poverty and boost shared
prosperity. Funding to social services, which would receive the largest share of the budget, would
increase by 7.3 percent, year-on-year, to Php1.45 trillion, as the government continues to prioritize the
development of the country’s human resources through increased investments in education, health,
and service delivery. Meanwhile, the proposed budget for the economic services sector is planned to
expand by 25.0 percent to reach PhP1.2 trillion, anchored on the country’s continued push for strategic
infrastructure development.
The proposed 2018 national budget prioritizes investment in both human and physical capital,
maintaining the government’s key policy priorities from the previous year’s national budget ( Figure
25). With an allocation of Php691.1 billion, funding to the education sector43 would increase by 6.4
percent compared to 2017, which would ensure that the sector remains the largest component of the
national budget (18.3 percent of the total budget). Meanwhile, the government is planning to raise the
budget for infrastructure by 27.8 percent, year-on-year, from Php858.1 billion (5.3 percent of GDP) to
PhP1.1 trillion (6.3 percent of GDP), with a focus on improving logistics connectivity by upgrading the
country’s road, air, and sea transport networks. The significant rise in the proposed infrastructure
budget is a part of the government’s Build, Build, Build program where the government plans to invest
approximately Php8.1 trillion in strategic infrastructure development from 2017 to 2022.

Despite the expansionary nature of the new budget, the government remains committed to
maintaining fiscal discipline. The recent transformation from a fiscal program under constant threat to
one that is resilient underpins the country’s robust economic growth performance. Cognizant of the
importance of prudent fiscal policy, the government has maintained a deficit target for the next five
years, but raised it from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2017 to 3.0 percent of GDP in 2018. Central to the
government’s efforts to maintain fiscal discipline is its objective to improve the country’s tax policy and

 to begin in 2018, which is expected to boost tax revenue by Php133.8 billion in its first year of
 implementation, increasing the government’s projected revenue effort from an estimated 15.2 percent
 of GDP in 2017 to 16.3 percent of GDP in 2018.

1.5           Employment and Poverty: Progress but with new challenges

Unemployment levels increased in the first half of 2017, as many temporary jobs created during
last year’s election-related stimulus disappeared. Longer-term growth in wage jobs, particularly
for households in the bottom 40 percent, and the shift of employment out of agriculture continue
to drive the observed decline in poverty.

20.     The country’s employment rate is close to historic low levels, although it decreased
slightly in the first half of 2017. The employment rate stood at 94.4 percent in July 2017,
compared to 94.6 percent in July 2016. The employment rate peaked at 95.3 percent at end-2016
after a rapid but temporary creation of jobs occurred during the election year. The
unemployment rate of 5.6 percent in July 2017 is an indication that the economy is close to full
employment. While this is slightly higher than the historic low unemployment rate of 4.7 percent
reached in 2016, it remains 1.3 percentage points below the average in 2007-2017 (Figure 26).
Changes in unemployment are similar across regions. The unemployment rate in Metro Manila
increased from 6.4 percent in 2016 to 7.9 percent in July 2017, marking an increase for the first
time since 2013. Even though other regions also experienced an increase in the unemployment
rate, there is still a declining trend over the past decade. Unemployment remains higher among
men than women at 5.7 and 5.4 percent, respectively. Youth unemployment increased from 13.5
percent in 2016 to 15.3 percent in July 2017, but has been gradually declining in the past decade.
However, the underemployment rate45 retreated from 17.3 percent in 2016 to a 10-year low of
16.1 percent in early 2017, before settling at 16.3 percent in July (Figure 26). Since the
underemployed are more likely to work in the informal sector, the underemployment rate is an
indicator that there is still a large prevalence of informal jobs in the Philippines.

  The underemployed is defined by the Philippine Statistics Authority as employed persons who express the desire
to have additional hours of work in their present job or an additional job, or have a new job with longer working
hours.

                                                                                            27
21.      In the first half of 2017, the labor participation rate dropped and the number of new
jobs created was lower compared to 2016. The labor force participation rate continued its
downward trend and decreased from 63.3 percent in 2016 to 60.6 percent in July 2017 (Figure
27), the lowest rate observed in the past decade. The decline was slightly larger for women,
falling from 49.0 percent in 2016 to 45.6 percent in July 2017, and women constitute 69.1 percent
of the non-working labor force. The drop in the labor force participation rate reflects in part a
slower pace in net job creation compared to a year ago. There were 1.9 million net jobs created
in the first half of 2016, compared to a net loss of 0.6 million jobs in the first half of 2017. The
agriculture46 and services47 sectors lost 0.5 and 0.3 million jobs, respectively. In contrast, the
industry sector generated 0.2 million jobs in the first half of 2017, 185,000 of which came from
construction. Manufacturing and construction have been driving employment growth in the
industry, and the latter grew at an annual rate of 11.1 percent over the past decade.

22.      Philippines’ youth accounted for most of the drop in the country’s labor force
participation rate. The labor force participation rate among 15 to 24 year olds dropped from 42.1
percent in 2016 to 38.8 percent in July 2017. This is equivalent to a 0.7 million decline in the labor
force. This may be attributed to the implementation of the K-12 program which commenced
during the 2016-2017 school year. Based on enrollment records by the Department of Education,
1.5 million students were admitted to grade 11 in June 2016, of which 1.45 million had finished
grade 10.48 Prior to the implementation of the senior high school program, a proportion of these
students would have joined the labor market. There were also about 54,000 returning students
who took advantage of the additional two years of free basic education.49

23.     Household incomes in the Philippines have increased over time as more people have
transitioned into wage employment (Box 9). However, adjusting for inflation, wages have been
largely flat over time, translating into only modest gains for those already in wage employment.
Median wages grew by an annual rate of only 1.1 percent between 2007 and 2017, before picking
up slightly to 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2017. Until recently, public sector wages grew
more rapidly than their private sector counterparts (Figure 28).50 Between 2007 and 2017,

46
   Employment in agriculture has been steadily declining. Its share in total employment has gone down to 25.2
percent in July 2017, a drop of 9.3 percentage points from a decade ago.
47
   The recent push for the Security of Tenure Bill (one of the priority bills endorsed by the Legislative-Executive
Development Advisory Council) may have started to affect the hiring decisions of firms particularly in the services
sector.
48
   This is equivalent to a high school graduate in the old curriculum. The Department of Education reported a 98
percent progression rate from grade 10 to grade 11.
49
   The boost in senior high school enrollment may have resulted from the senior high school voucher program where
almost half (about 0.7 million people) of grade 11 student beneficiaries enjoyed free tuitions in private high schools.
This was an interim solution to the shortage of public schools.

   Two laws on the public sector salary standardization were implemented in the last 10 years. The first was Joint
Resolution No. 4 by the Fourteenth Congress that authorized former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to modify
the compensation package for government, military, and uniformed personnel. The revised compensation took
effect a year after it was signed in July 2008 for employees in national government offices and after eighteen months
for employees in local government. The salary increase was implemented in equal tranches over four years. Another

median wages in the public sector grew by 1.6 percent, year-on-year, and there were significant
increases in public sector wages between 2010 and 2015. However, wages in the public sector
declined by 3 percent, year-on-year, in the first half of 2017. Private sector wages were mostly
flat between 2007 and 2014, before starting to move upwards in the beginning of 2015. In the
first half of 2017, wages in the private sector increased by 4.0 percent, year-on-year.

24.    Higher wage income, particularly for households in the bottom 40 percent, constituted
the main driver of recent poverty alleviation. The national poverty rate dropped from 25.2
percent in 2012 to 21.6 percent in 2015. Transfers from the government’s social programs, which
increased from 0.1 percent in 2006 to 3.8 percent in 2015, have contributed to the faster pace of
poverty reduction recent years.

round of salary standardization through Executive Order No. 201 took effect in July 2016. This legislation ensured
comparability of wages in government particularly management level positions with prevailing rates in the private
sector. This new adjustment wages will take effect in stages through 2019. Another important wage legislation is the
Domestic Workers Act or Kasambahay Law, which regulates wages given to household employees and enforces the
provision of social and other benefits. Wages of those working in private households have grown on average by 4.2
percent annually since the law was passed in January 2013.

                                                                                             29
                      Box 9. Increasing wage employment and household wage incomes
 Wage employment is becoming more common in the Philippines, accounting for more than half of
 the country’s total workforce. In the first half of 2017, 57.1 percent of both public and private sector
 workers held wage jobs, up from 56.7 percent in the first half of 2016 (Figure 29). Public sector jobs
 constituted only 7.8 percent of wage jobs, and this share remained roughly constant in the past decade.
 As a result, the growing share of wage jobs is due to employment growth in the private sector. While
 the number of wage jobs has increased in the agricultural and services sectors, the industrial sector has
 seen the most rapid growth in wage employment. Industrial wage jobs grew by 63 percent between
 2007 and 2017, from the 4.1 million wage jobs in 2007 to 6.7 million jobs in April 2017. There has also
 been a decline in the share of unpaid family workers to 6.7 percent of the total employed in April 2017.
 Moreover, the share of workers who are self-employed declined from 30.5 percent in April 2007 to 27.2
 percent in April 2017 (Figure 29).

 The share of wages in household income increased from 44.8 percent in 2006 to 47.4 percent in 2015
 (Figure 30).51 The share of non-agricultural wages constituted the biggest change and increased from
 41.9 percent in 2006 to 44.4 percent in 2015. The shift to non-agricultural wage income was particularly
 noticeable among households in the bottom 40 percent of the population. 27.5 percent of the income
 in these households came from non-agricultural wages in 2015, up from 21.3 percent in 2006 (Figure
 31). This shift away from agricultural income has made domestic remittances more important for
 households in the bottom 40 percent, which constituted 8.5 percent of their income in 2015, up from
 6.7 percent in 2006 (Figure 32).52

Part II:       OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The Philippine economy is projected to expand by 6.6 percent, year-on-year, in 2017 before
growing by 6.7 percent, year-on-year, in 2018 and 2019. Investment growth has been moderating
partly because of a slower than envisioned implementation of the government infrastructure
program, softening the growth prospects for 2017. However, the medium-term growth outlook
remains positive, as stronger expected growth in the Philippines’ main trading partners would
lead to higher external demand. Imports are expected to remain elevated due to a high demand
of intermediate and capital goods. As the public infrastructure program gains traction, capital
outlays and construction activities are expected to rise. Consumption growth is expected to
remain firm, contingent on sustained remittances and expanding credit to households. The local
elections in 2019 will likely boost domestic activities as early as the second half of 2018. The rate
of Filipinos living on less than US$3.20-a-day is projected to decline to 22.9 percent in 2018. The
pace of poverty reduction may drop slightly in the face of lower overall economic growth, but the
poverty rate is expected to continue to fall as the economy continues its structural transformation.
Short-term risks to the country outlook include increased trade protectionism, elevated economic
policy uncertainty, and the possibility of financial market disruptions. Weaker potential growth
remains the main long-term risk to the Philippines. An expansionary fiscal policy could help
support growth in the short term, as long as it is consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability.




                                                 32
2.1    Growth Outlook

The economy is projected to grow at a slower pace in 2017 compared to 2016. Fiscal and
monetary policies are likely to remain accommodative to growing the economy, and recovering
exports and strong consumption growth are expected boost economic growth. Higher investment
growth could push the country’s growth rate towards the upper end of the government’s target
of 6.5 to 7.5 percent of GDP, but this is contingent on whether or not the public infrastructure
program gains full traction.

25.     The Philippines’ medium-term growth trajectory remains positive, but the growth rate
for 2017 is likely to end up at the lower end of the government’s target of 6.5 -7.5 percent of
GDP. The economy is projected to expand by 6.6 percent, year-on-year, in 2017 and 6.7 percent,
year-on-year, in 2018 and 2019 (Figure 33). This projection reflects a downward revision from
the 2017 and 2018 forecasts of 6.8 and 6.9 percent, respectively, in the July 2017 edition of the
Philippines Monthly Economic Development. However, the growth outlook remains positive and
exports are projected to grow at a robust rate as stronger growth is expected in the Philippines’
main trading partners. Imports are expected to remain elevated due to high demand for
intermediate and capital goods. Moreover, a steady consumption growth is projected to provide
the main base for economic growth, sustained by an increase in remittances, an expansion of
credit, and improved income levels. Higher capital outlays and construction activities are
expected to boost investment growth as the government speeds up the implementation of its
infrastructure program. The local elections in 2019 will likely lead to increased domestic activities
as early as the second half of 2018.

26.      The growth in global trade is expected to rebound to 4.0 percent in 2017 from a post
crisis low of 2.5 percent in 2016, despite rising trade policy uncertainty (Box 10). The recovery
in global trade, which began in the second half of 2016, has been supported by stronger industrial
activity. Since the slowdown in the growth of global investments was an important factor behind
the deceleration of global goods trade, the increase in international investment flows may
improve global trade in 2017.53 Chinese exports have benefited from the recovery, resulting in
increased demand for intermediate products across regional and global value chains, including
the Philippines. Moreover, the trade in services, both globally and in the Philippines,
demonstrated resilience throughout 2016, supported by robust global consumer spending,
particularly in major advanced economies. The ongoing recovery in the goods trade may also
boost services exports, which could benefit the Philippines as they are less volatile and pro-
cyclical than goods exports.54

27.     An improvement in the external environment is expected to benefit the Philippine
economy. This constitutes one driving assumption of the World Bank projection. Global
economic activity is projected to accelerate in 2017 and 2018 and firm in the medium term. The
Philippines’ main trading partners among advanced economies demonstrated solid economic
performance in the beginning of 2017, resulting in increased demand for Philippine exports.
Economic growth is expected to pick up in the United States and Japan and remain broadly stable
in the Euro Area. Economic forecasts for several major economies have also been upgraded. 55

   Collectively, advanced economies in the Euro Area are expected to grow by 1.7 percent in 2017, while Japan is

the January round of the 2017 Global Economic Prospects.

                               Box 10. The Global Economic Outlook
Despite substantial policy uncertainty, global growth is projected to accelerate in 2017-2019. The rate
of global economic growth is projected to increase from a post-crisis low of 2.4 percent, year-on-year,
in 2016 to 2.7 and 2.9 percent, year-on-year, in 2017 and 2018-19, respectively (Table 4). The short-
term outlook for advanced economies has generally improved due to firming business and investment
activities despite elevated policy uncertainty in the United States and the euro area. In 2017, advanced
economies are projected to grow by 1.9 percent, year-on-year, before moderating to 1.8 and 1.7
percent, year-on-year, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In emerging-market and developing economies,
annual growth is predicted to reach an average of 4.1 percent in 2017 and 4.6 percent in 2018-19
(Figure 34). Obstacles to growth for commodity exporters have diminished while activity in commodity
importers has continued to be robust.

Global trade growth is expected to recover at a robust pace in 2017. Global trade growth is expected
to rebound from 2.5 percent, year-on-year, in 2016 to 4.0 percent, year-on-year, in 2017, its fastest
pace since 2010 (Figure 35). This growth is aligned with the global recovery in manufacturing activity
and coincided with the bottoming out of global investments. It is supported by stronger import demand
from major advanced economies, increased trade flows to and from China, and a diminished drag from
weak import demand from commodity-exporting emerging-market and developing economies. Policy-
induced infrastructure spending, specifically in China, will continue to support demand for industrial
commodities, benefiting countries that export raw materials. The services trade will remain resilient
and play a stabilizing role since it is less volatile and pro-cyclical than the goods trade. Nevertheless,
trade growth will continue to be held back by structural impediments, such as maturing global value
chains and a slower pace of trade liberalization.
There are downside risks to the global economic outlook. Risks, such as trade protectionism and
potential financial market disruptions dominate the outlook, despite the possibility of more
expansionary fiscal policies in advanced economies. A number of factors weigh on the long-term growth
prospects of emerging-market and developing economies, including structural headwinds to global
trade, worsening demographics, slowing productivity growth, and governance and institutional
challenges. Moreover, even if the expected modest rebound in investment across emerging-market

                                                   35
 and developing economies materializes, slowing capital accumulation in recent years may already have
 reduced potential growth.
 Over the long term, structural policies that support investment and trade are critical to boost
 productivity and potential growth. Emerging-market and developing economies will need to continue
 to pursue structural reforms to improve their long-term growth prospects, diversify their economies,
 and develop domestic as well as foreign markets. These include policies to improve the business
 climate, support investment in human and physical capital, and enhance regional and global trade
 integration. Central banks in advanced economies will gradually normalize monetary policy as inflation
 increases and economic slack diminishes. While the U.S. tightening cycle is well ahead of other major
 advanced economies, it is proceeding at a substantially slower pace than in the past.

28.     The fiscal policy assumption of the projection is a continued expansionary path.
However, purposeful budget execution would require addressing important implementation
limitations. The delivery of large new infrastructure projects had been slow in the recent past.
The government plans to finance to a large extent the development and implementation of
infrastructure initiatives while contracting out operations and maintenance activities to the
private sector. The implementation of the public infrastructure plan is expected to intensify over
the next five years. To accomplish this, the government has proposed to increase the national
budget in 2018 by 12.4 percent, year-on-year, to Php3.8 trillion, up from Php3.4 trillion in 2017
(Box 8). The proposed infrastructure budget is programmed to increase by 27.9 percent, year-
on-year, to reach Php1.1 trillion or an estimated 6.3 percent of GDP in 2018. Moreover,
infrastructure spending for the next four years is set to increase by an average of 14.8 percent,
year-on-year, to reach Php1.9 trillion or an estimated 7.4 percent of GDP in 2022. The
government will need to ensure prudent spending, efficiency, and careful debt management if it
is to deliver on its ambitious infrastructure targets.

29.    The implementation of the government’s investment program is expected to be slower
than outlined in the medium-term budget proposal. In the first half of 2017, the government
was able to execute its programmed budget, focusing on road repairs, irrigation projects, school

                                                     36
construction, and military equipment. However, there was a slower than envisioned start in the
implementation of large-scale public infrastructure projects, which are key to the government’s
Build, Build, Build agenda. As a result, the projected spending increase in the World Bank forecast
is lower than in the medium-term budget proposal, and the fiscal deficit is estimated at 2.4 and
2.5 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Faster economic growth is projected to bring
down the debt-to-GDP ratio from 41.8 percent in 2017 to 41.2 percent in 2018.56 Going forward,
long-standing implementation constraints are likely to impact the administration’s investment
plans.57 The government needs to improve project planning and the implementation cycle to
resolve bottlenecks in the project approval process and ensure that large expenditure increases
translate into productive investments. Furthermore, a successful and timely passage of the
administration’s tax policy reform packages, and the budget management reforms, will be
needed to guarantee sustainable financing of planned infrastructure investments.

30.     Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, with the central bank’s target
annual inflation remaining at an average of 2 to 4 percent in the medium term. The inflation
rate is projected to rise from an average of 1.8 percent in 2016 to 3.0 percent in 2017 before
slowing to 2.6 percent in 2018 and settling at 2.8 percent in 2019. These projections are in line
with those of the central bank which estimate the inflation rate to settle near the midpoint of
the its target range of 3.0 percent +/- 1.0 percentage point in 2017 to 2019. After headline
inflation reached an average of 3.1 percent in the first eight months of 2017, high base effects
are expected to temper average inflation in the remaining four months of 2017. High base effects
are also likely to spill over into 2018 and moderate inflation rates then despite an anticipated rise
in energy prices. The benchmark crude oil price is projected to recover from US$42.8 per barrel
in 2016 to US$52.0 and US$54.0 per barrel in 2017 and 2018, respectively.58 There may be a need
to manage inflation expectations, as the public investment push is expected to spur domestic
demand, leading to higher inflation in the second half of 2018 and into 2019. However, the
central bank is expected to maintain its current policy stance as the projected inflation rates
remain within its target range.

31.     The Philippines’ medium-term growth outlook is anticipated to be boosted by stronger
growth in external demand. The growth in net exports is expected to recover in 2017, but import
growth is projected to outpace export growth, as an increase in infrastructure spending would
raise the demand for intermediate and capital goods. Global trade growth is expected to rebound
to 4.0 percent, year-on-year, in 2017, its fastest pace since 2010. An improvement in the external
environment is expected to benefit Philippine exports, supported by stronger import demand

56
   The government’s planned budget deficits are 3.0 percent in 2017 -2020. The debt-to-GDP forecast is 40.6 percent
for 2017, 40.5 percent for 2018, and 39.8 percent for 2019.
57
   Procurement issues and implementation bottlenecks, which delay and complicate the administration’s delivery of
its public investment program, include bidding failures, legal challenges brought by losing parties, difficulties in
securing permits, clearances and right-of-way issues, and contractors’ non-compliance or submission delays of
documentary requirements. See Fiscal Risks Statement 2017 (DBM).
58
   Meanwhile, international price for key food item particularly rice is expected to drop from US$396/mt in 2016 to
US$385/mt in 2017 then rise to US$389/mt in 2018. Price for wheat is also expected to drop from US$167/mt to
US$150/mt in 2017 and US$156/mt in 2018. World Bank commodities prices forecast, April 2017.

                                                        37
from its major trading partners, such as China, the United States, Japan, and the European Union.
Business processing outsourcing services are expected to drive services exports. Meanwhile,
import growth is likely to strengthen as rising domestic incomes would lead to greater demand
for imported consumer goods. The government’s infrastructure investment push is also
projected to lead to greater demand for capital goods.

32.     The current account is expected to remain in deficit over medium term, partly owing to
a larger trade deficit. The current-account deficit is projected to grow from 0.2 percent of GDP
in 2017 to 0.3 and 0.5 percent of GDP in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This is consistent with an
expected increase in investments alongside the government’s infrastructure investment push.
The share of capital goods increased from about a quarter of total imports before 2016 to a third
in 2016. This is expected to rise even further in the coming years as the government’s
infrastructure investment plans gain traction. An increase in capital accumulation is expected to
enhance the economy’s production capacity and lay the foundation for future economic growth.

33.     The Philippines’ medium-term growth outlook depends on the country’s level of
investment growth. While the growth of private investments is projected to remain robust, the
growth level will depend on the public investment program gaining traction and the
government’s ability to remove bottlenecks in the infrastructure project planning and
implementation process. However, the implementation of the government’s infrastructure
program was slower than expected during the first half of 2017, contributing to moderate fixed
capital-formation growth and a softening of growth prospects for the year. The World Bank’s
projection assumes a more gradual acceleration in the implementation of the public investment
plan which is expected to lead to 12.2 percent, year-on-year, growth of fixed capital formation in
2017. Gross fixed capital formation is projected to grow from 12.2 percent, year-on-year, in 2017
to 14.7 and 16.1 percent, year-on-year, in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

34.     Following exceptional growth in 2016, private consumption growth is expected to
moderate around its five-year average in the next couple of years. Household consumption is
expected to grow only moderately from an average of 5.9 percent annually between 2011 and
2015 to 6.0 percent in 2017 before rising to 6.1 and 6.3 percent in 2018 and 2019, respectively
(Table 5). This follows a 7.0 percent, year-on-year, growth rate in 2016 which was spurred by
election year stimulus spending. The Philippine economy has historically been consumption-
driven, with household consumption representing roughly two-third of total expenditures, and
consumption is expected to remain the main base of growth in the medium term. The prospect
of strong consumption growth in the medium term is supported by a number of factors. First,
income levels in the Philippines are gradually increasing as more people move into wage jobs and
employment conditions improve. Second, the number of middle-income households, which have
a higher propensity to consume, is gradually growing because of sustained economic growth and
changing demographics. Finally, the flow of remittances appears to be resilient and is expected
to remain around current levels in the coming years.

35.     The services sector is projected to sustain its recent expansion and remain the main
driver of output growth. The sector is projected to grow at 6.8 percent, year-on-year, in 2017
and 7.0 percent, year-on-year, in 2018-2019. An expanding economy, coupled with a rising
middle-income class and strong remittance receipts from overseas Filipinos, is expected to drive
strong demand for real estate properties and financial services. The finance and insurance
subsector has also been the favorite destination of foreign direct investments, receiving 57.2
percent of net foreign direct investments in the first half of 2017, which is expected to boost
services-sector growth in the medium term. Meanwhile, credit growth has been generous in the
real estate and construction (20.1 percent of total domestic loans in the first seven months of
2017) and the wholesale and retail trade subsectors (15.2 percent), which is expected to
continue. The information technology and business process outsourcing industries continue to
enjoy strong growth prospects with revenues expected to increase from US$22.9 billion in 2016
to US$38.9 billion in 2022, overtaking remittances as a major source of dollar receipts.59

36.     Manufacturing activities are projected to remain robust in the short term, but
investment is needed in the medium-term to expand production capacity. The Volume of
Production Index for manufacturing has sustained its growth since mid-2015 while the
Purchasing Manager’s Index remained in expansion territory in the first eight months of 2017 but
has weakened since May (Box 2). Factory activities can likely be sustained in the short run,
although capacity utilization inched up to 83.8 percent in July 2017, slightly up from 83.5 percent
a year ago. Even though investment in durable equipment to support manufacturing is increasing,
only a third of these investments have been for general and specialized machineries, leaving
room for more investment. Efforts to create a more business-friendly environment, such as
implementing business-friendly reforms, revisiting the negative investment list, reducing tariffs
on key manufacturing inputs such as chemicals and cements, improving micro, small and medium

enterprises finance, and enhancing market competition, would encourage higher investment
levels and create more productive capacity and jobs.

37.     Growth in the agriculture sector is projected to recover somewhat in in the medium
term, but the sector remains vulnerable to weather-related events. The sector is set to rebound
with an expected 4.2 percent annual growth rate in 2017, primarily due to an improvement in
weather conditions60 and a low base in 2016. Agricultural growth in succeeding years is expected
to moderate, as the Philippines has yet to address longstanding structural weaknesses in the
agricultural sector, particularly in Mindanao.

38.     Decades of underinvestment and a long history of policy distortions have depressed
growth in agricultural productivity.61 These structural weaknesses are most apparent in
Mindanao, the agricultural basket of the country, which produces more than a third of the
Philippines’ total agricultural output. Despite possessing a comparative advantage in
agriculture,62 the Philippines has so far been unable to unlock the sector’s full potential, as low
agricultural productivity among smallholders reflects a number of well-known policy, investment,
and institutional deficits, which tend to be magnified in Mindanao. As a result, implementing a
successful regional development strategy for Mindanao is key to unlocking the potential of the
country’s agricultural sector and ensuring its transition into a sector marked by high productivity
and low vulnerability.63

2.2      Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Poverty reduction will likely continue as the country’s growth outlook remains positive and
inclusive growth policies are pursued.

39.    Sustained economic growth increases the likelihood that poverty reduction has
continued since 2015. The World Bank tracks poverty rates in the Philippines using an
international poverty line which is equivalent to US$3.20-a-day in purchasing power parity
terms.64 Using this measure, the poverty rate for the Philippines is projected to have dropped
from 27.0 percent in 2015 to 24.2 percent in 2017, implying that around 1.0 million Filipinos

60
   Weather conditions in 2017 will generally be milder compared with conditions during the past two years. The state
weather bureau reported that there was a bleak chance for the occurrence of rain-driving La Niña in 2017, while the
El Niño phenomenon has already dissipated in mid-2016 after impacting the country from late 2015 to early-2016.
The country will still be visited by seasonal typhoons that may impact farm outputs.
61
   Examples include protectionist policies, such as the rice self-sufficiency policy, large subsidies for inputs, and
distortions in institutions that prevent broad and secure access to land by small landholders.
62
   Mindanao is blessed with good agro-climatic conditions, as most of its provinces lie below the typhoon belt and
has rich natural resources, such as i) fertile soil and wide range of elevation suitable for a variety of crops, ii) large
deposits of minerals such as gold, copper, and nickel, iii) extensive forests, albeit of secondary growth, and iv) vast
marine wealth.

   This is the median of the national poverty lines among lower middle-income countries which is slightly higher than
the Philippines’ national poverty line.

exited poverty each year since 2015. The projection is based on the Philippines’ growth forecast
under the assumption that the responsiveness of the poverty rate to economic growth follows
the observed historical average.65 As economic growth remains robust in the short-term, the
poverty rate is projected to decline further to 22.9 percent in 2018 (Figure 36).

40.     Progress in the economy’s structural transformation is expected to contribute to
poverty alleviation. The share of agriculture in total employment decreased from about 37.0
percent in 2006 to 25.2 percent in July 2017, while the share of the services sector rose from
about 49.0 to 55.4 percent during the same period. The gradual transition of workers from
agriculture to more productive sectors is expected to contribute to poverty reduction, as even
lower-end industry and services jobs pay more than agriculture jobs.66 Nevertheless, there is a
need to improve the productivity of the agricultural sector which is only one sixth of the
productivity of the industry sector. Agriculture is central for the country to achieve inclusive
growth, as the sector employs a disproportionate share of the poor, and its output has a
significant influence on food prices which heavily impacts the poor.

41.     Government investment policies and a public commitment to the inclusive growth
agenda are expected to have a decisive impact on poverty. The Philippine conditional cash
transfer program (Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino), which reaches one-fifth of the population,
increases the income necessary for beneficiaries to afford basic needs and helped reduce the
income gap of beneficiaries by up to 6.0 percentage points in 2015.67 Improving the conditional
cash transfer program and other social assistance programs would shore-up consumption among
poor households and promote greater human capital accumulation to improve long-term
economic prospects. Aside from social sector spending, the government is pursuing a large
infrastructure agenda, which is expected to boost poverty reduction in the medium term by
generating employment opportunities in the construction sector.




65
   Specifically, it is assumed that the elasticity of GDP per capita with poverty reduction is equal to the average value
observed over the period 2006-15.

2.3    Risks and Policy Challenges

Both external and domestic risks to the country outlook remain substantial and are increasing.
Policymakers face the challenge of confronting downside risks while fostering long-term growth.

42.     External risks remain prominent while domestic challenges are growing. The ongoing
U.S. Federal Reserve rate hikes could result in new episodes of peso depreciation and capital
outflows from the Philippines, increasing volatility in the foreign-exchange market. Rising
protectionism in some advanced economies also constitutes a risk that could impact the country
through lower levels of remittances and trade. Domestic challenges include a slower than
envisioned implementation of the government’s infrastructure investment plan. As
infrastructure spending increases, there is also a growing need to more prudently manage public
finances and preserve fiscal sustainability, including improving the revenue administration and
collection. Despite these risks, the administration is coming from a position of strength as
macroeconomic fundamentals remain intact. However, both the fiscal and monetary space to
address external and domestic risks can quickly diminish and limit the government’s policy
options to mitigate those risks (Figure 37).




                                                                     42
                         Figure 37. Macroeconomic fundamentals

                         Source: BSP, PSA, World Bank staff estimates


43.     Expectations of international interest-rate tightening may lead to an acceleration of
capital outflows and renewed volatility in the foreign-exchange market. A faster-than-expected
normalization of policy rates in advanced economies constitutes the most significant external risk
to the Philippines. A further increase in U.S. yields, driven by a sudden reassessment of U.S.
monetary policy expectations, could lead to renewed tightening of financing conditions. The
higher interest-rate environment risks raising the country’s borrowing costs at a time when the
government is also considering sourcing foreign funds to finance its infrastructure program. Both
expectations of and actual Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes may lead to higher portfolio
outflows from emerging markets, including the Philippines, as U.S. assets become more
attractive. This will insert more volatility in the foreign-exchange market and could lead to a
further depreciation of the peso. In July, the central bank reportedly smoothened the volatile
exchange-rate market by using foreign-exchange reserves. A depreciating peso has the unwanted
effect of an inflationary pass-through, as some major commodities, such as rice, wheat, animal
feeds, and fertilizers, are partially imported.

44.     Potential protectionism in some advanced economies raises concerns over a retreat
from an open world economy which could impact the Philippines through lower trade and
remittances. Protectionist sentiments in the United States and elsewhere have not yet translated
into actual policies that directly impact the Philippine economy. However, American protectionist
measures can likely lead to lower levels of trade and remittances, especially since the United
States is the primary source of remittance inflows to the Philippines, accounting for more than a
third of cash remittances (Box 6). Meanwhile, a slowdown in global trade may directly or
indirectly affect the Philippines’ export of commodities, such as electronics and semiconductors,
because of the country’s linkages with the global value chain.


                                                  43
45.     Reforms related to public financial management and the budget process are crucial to
ensure the timely and successful implementation of the infrastructure agenda. As the medium-
term growth prospect hinges on the infrastructure investment program, failure to address
implementation and delivery bottlenecks may result in lower infrastructure spending.68 An
upside risk in this context would be that if such constraints are successfully removed, there would
be the potential of pushing growth towards the upper end of the government target of 6.5-7.5
percent. Progress is being made to fully use the programmed budget, but the government needs
to ensure that recent achievements are sustained. House Bill 5590 or the Budget Reform Bill,
which the administration hopes will pass before year end, aims to strengthen government
accountability for the use of public funds through greater transparency and more efficient public
financial management. The bill is expected to increase actual spending through new schemes
that include a shift from obligation- to cash-based budgeting, shortening the validity of
appropriations from two years to one, the introduction of an extended payment period, and the
establishment of a unified accounts code structure. There are also plans to create an Office of
Comptroller General, with internal auditing duties, under the Office of the President to speed up
assessments and compliance.69

46.     The successful passage of the government’s tax reform package will help to ensure the
sustainability of the government’s fiscal balance. An expansionary fiscal policy in the medium
term, including growing public sector wages, will continue to put pressure on public finances and
overall fiscal health if the level of government revenues remains unchanged. The timely passage
of the government’s tax reform package is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the
government’s fiscal accounts in the medium term, which is a key component of the country’s
solid macroeconomic fundamentals. The first package of the government’s tax re form program
was successfully passed in the House of Representatives on its third and final reading on May 31,
2017. The Senate of the Philippines is currently conducting its own set of deliberations on its own
version of the bill, and is expected to last until October 2017. Should the first package of tax
reforms pass before the end of the regular session of congress in 2017, implementation of the
new tax policy is scheduled to start in 2018. The Department of Finance estimates an increase in
revenue by Php119.4 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in its first year of implementation, while
preliminary estimates on the Senate version of the bill are estimated at least Php59.9 billion (0.3
percent of GDP), a downward revision from an earlier version of the bill which had estimated
additional revenues of Php157.2 billion (0.9 percent of GDP).

68
   In previous years, ambitious increases in the government’s budget resulted in underspending, as fundamental
issues in budget execution were not addressed. Structural weaknesses within key departments and agencies, such
as poor planning, weak program and project design, and procurement difficulties, prevented the government from
fully executing its programmed budget. From 2011 to 2015, actual disbursements by the national government fell
short by around 10 percent per year, despite the ample fiscal space afforded to the national government (Monsod,
2016).

   See House Bill no. 5590, An Act to Reform the Budget Process by Enforcing Greater Accountability in Public
Financial Management (PFM), Promoting Fiscal Sustainability, Strengthening Congress’ Power of the Purse,
Instituting an Integrated PFM System, and Increasing Budget Transparency and Participation, and for Other
Purposes.

47.     Commitment to the government’s policy goals of achieving stable inflation, fiscal
stability, and security and rule of law will help preserve consumer and business confidence.
Maintaining positive consumer and business sentiments will support growth in both
consumption and private investment, which are expected to be the primary growth drivers of the
Philippine economy in the medium term. For Filipino consumers, it will be important that
inflation remains at moderate levels. This will warrant careful inflation management by the
central bank authorities to anchor expectations. There are a number of emerging key risks to
inflation in the near-term, stemming from exchange-rate volatility, the price effects of the
government’s tax reform policy, and demand-side pressures from an increase in infrastructure
spending. The successful and timely implementation of the government’s fiscal program,
including its ambitious infrastructure plan and efforts to generate more revenue (including the
passage of the first package of the tax reform program), would signal a strong commitment to
the government’s policy priorities. Key issues facing the country, such as mining regulations (Box
3), the government’s response to the ongoing conflict in Marawi City (Box 11), and regional
development in Mindanao, will require policy certainty to preserve both external and domestic
confidence in the Philippine economy.

48.    Policymakers face the challenge of confronting downside risks while fostering long-term
growth. The short-term risks to the country outlook include increased trade protectionism,
elevated economic policy uncertainty, and the possibility of financial market disruptions. In the
longer term, weaker potential growth remains the main risk. An expansionary fiscal policy could
support short-term growth as long as it is consistent with medium-term fiscal sustainability.
Securing monetary and fiscal space to deal with potential risks should also be a policy priority.
Continued macroeconomic improvements in the Philippines provide a window of opportunity to
address underlying vulnerabilities and long-term structural issues. Over the longer term,
structural policies that support investment and trade are critical to boost productivity and
economic growth. This will require the government’s commitment to reforms that promote
competition in key sectors, secure property rights, lessen regulatory complexities, and improve
doing business in the country. Other long-term policy priorities include training and job-search
programs and other measures to support workers most affected by sectoral shifts in employment
and share the dividends of growth and gains from globalization more widely. Sustained
investment in human capital development and in sectors that create quality employment are
needed to safeguard the country’s progress on delivering inclusiveness.

                                     Box 11. The Marawi City Crisis
 Marawi, a relatively small city in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), is an
 important economic and cultural hub in the region. Although Mindanao is an important part of the
 Philippine economy, Marawi City and the province of Lanao del Sur make up a relatively small share of
 Mindanao’s formal economy. The ARMM region, which Lanao del Sur is a part of, constitutes only 0.7
 percent of the Philippines’ GDP and 4.8 percent of Mindanao’s GDP. Meanwhile, Marawi City is the
 least economically vibrant city in Mindanao.70 It ranks last in terms of taxes on business income among
 the 33 cities in Mindanao, as taxes on business revenue amounted to only Php0.5 million or 0.01
 percent of business tax revenue among cities in Mindanao. Given the limited scope of Marawi City’s
 economy, it has a small direct impact on the Philippines’ formal economy. However, Marawi City still
 plays an important role in the region as the economic hub of Lanao del Sur and as a cultural hub in
 Mindanao. It is strategically located in the region due to its proximity to Lake Lanao, as a center of trade
 and commercial activities to nearby towns and municipalities, and hosts the Agus 1 and Agus 2 hydro-
 power plants. Marawi City and Lanao del Sur are also important gateways to the provinces and cities of
 the Northern Mindanao region, providing an important link to the transport and flow of goods
 throughout Mindanao.
 Although the direct impact of this conflict on the country’s formal economy may be limited, the social
 development impact on the citizens of Marawi and nearby areas is more severe. Mindanao has some
 of the highest poverty rates in the entire Philippines, especially in conflict-affected areas, and the
 province of Lanao del Sur had the highest poverty incidence among provinces in the Philippines at 71.9
 percent in 2015. Marawi City itself had a poverty incidence of around 60 percent in 2012. The ongoing
 conflict has resulted in the displacement of nearly 400,000 citizens from Marawi71 and caused
 significant damage to local infrastructure, agricultural resources, and other sources of livelihood for its
 citizens and nearby towns. In the short term, the continued timely response by the government is
 needed to ensure that those displaced receive appropriate humanitarian assistance, as internally
 displaced persons are vulnerable to various health risks. Over the medium term, careful coordination
 among various government agencies is required to ensure the rehabilitation of Marawi City is successful
 once the conflict is resolved.
 In addition, the Marawi conflict brings uncertainty to the completion of the peace process that is
 expected to end the almost five-decade violent conflict which large parts of Mindanao has suffered.
 The region’s history of widespread conflict has led to weak economic growth, low job creation, anemic
 poverty reduction, and a massive displacement of the population. But the Marawi city crisis has
 different characteristics than the previous conflict. First, it points to a convergence of different terrorist
 groups. Second, the scale of the disruption is different, with armed terrorist forces taking hold of an
 entire city and leading to a complete evacuation. Finally, it has potential spillover effects into
 neighboring areas and brings uncertainty to the completion of the Mindanao peace process, which is
 likely to adversely affect national consumer and business sentiments.

Part III:        UNLOCKING MINDANAO’S POTENTIAL72
Economic progress in the Philippines will depend on the success of economic development in Mindanao,
as it is hard to see how the country can achieve sustained and inclusive growth without progress in this
region. Like the rest of the Philippines, the central policy challenge for Mindanao is how to accelerate
inclusive growth—the type that creates more and better jobs and reduces poverty. But this is more difficult
in Mindanao than in Luzon or Visayas because of longstanding armed conflict in the region. Although
progress has been made in making growth more inclusive, Mindanao still trails the rest of the Philippines
in terms of shared prosperity. This is compounded by the weakness of the Mindanao economy, resulting
from decades of not only armed conflict but also a narrow growth strategy. This special focus note, which
is based on the main findings of the World Bank’s Philippines Mindanao Jobs Report, proposes a
comprehensive strategy for unlocking Mindanao’s potential, including interventions in the region that will
support sustainable peace and development and job creation. The strategy is built on three main
components that aim to (1) raise agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2)
boost human development; and (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility and strengthen institutions in
ARMM and conflict-affected areas.

  This special focus note was prepared by Birgit Hansl. The analysis is based on a World Bank Report (2017):
Mindanao Jobs Report - A Strategy of Mindanao Regional Development with contributions from a large team of
World Bank staff based in various Global Practices, and experts from the Philippines, in particular from Mindanao.

                                                       47
3.1 Introduction

49.     Boosting economic development in Mindanao is essential for the economic progress of
the entire Philippines. 37 percent of the country’s poor population lives in Mindanao, although
the region only represents about 25 percent of the country’s population. As a result, reducing
poverty in Mindanao will be key to reducing it nationally. Moreover, increasing agricultural
production in Mindanao could reduce food and input prices nationally, improve public welfare,
and heighten the competitiveness of the Philippines’ agricultural sector since the region is
considered the country’s agricultural food basket (Box 12). Achieving successful economic
development in Mindanao will be a major test of the country’s ability to a chieve its long-term
vision of rapid, sustained, and more inclusive growth.

50.    Resolving the conflicts in Mindanao rests on addressing the root causes of conflict and
providing jobs and economic opportunities as alternatives to violence. There are both economic
and political drivers of the conflicts, and attaining a just and lasting peace will require political
solutions to address the causes of conflict, such as injustice, weak governance, land conflicts, and
discrimination. The peace agreements that have been signed in the past have not been enough
to put all of Mindanao on a path to inclusive growth. Peace can only be secured by addressing
the sources of conflict and creating jobs and economic opportunities. Fostering economic
development is necessary to stabilize the region, as jobs can provide opportunities to those who
have not previously experienced the benefits of economic growth.

51.     This special focus note is based on the World Bank’s Philippines Mindanao Jobs Report73
which followed an inclusive approach of engaging with a broad-based group of stakeholders.
The goal of the report was to generate ownership among Mindanawons through consultations
that were guided by mostly local technical experts. The report is also unique in that it deals with
all of Mindanao and looked for ways to grow the entire regional economy, as most previous
research has focused on only conflict-affected areas or specific economic sectors. Conflict and
non-conflict areas in Mindanao are closely interconnected through economic trade routes.
Because non-conflict areas and cities serve as consolidation stations for produce from conflict
areas, developments in the latter have profound implications for the rest of Mindanao and vice
versa. Mindanao’s jobs challenge can only be effectively addressed if the development strategy
seamlessly connects conflict and lagging regions to growth poles so that all of Mindanao can
benefit. Addressing constraints in any area will therefore improve economic activity and job
creation throughout Mindanao.

52.     Jobs and economic opportunities are central to stabilize the region and achieve peace.
Conflict affects nearly 60 percent of all Mindanao’s local government units. Breaking the cycle of
insecurity and reducing the risk of its recurrence will require a virtuous spiral of restoring
confidence in collective action and transforming institutions so they can provide sustainable

security, justice, and jobs.74 Jobs offer a stake in society to groups that might otherwise receive
more respect and recognition from engaging in armed violence rather than lawful activities.

53.      The World Bank is proposing a strategy for regional development with concrete policy
recommendations. The three main components aim to (1) raise agricultural productivity and
improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2) boost human development; and (3) address drivers of
conflict and fragility and strengthen institutions in ARMM and conflict-affected areas. The World
Bank engagement in Mindanao will be based on this strategy. Policy recommendations are made
in four separate categories: (i) increasing agricultural productivity by improving extension and
irrigation services along with price reforms to realize Mindanao’s agriculture potential; ( ii)
building up logistics and transport connectivity by improving road networks and the efficiency of
shipping services to reduce trade costs; (iii) improving the supply of reliable power and the speed,
affordability, and quality of information and communications technology (ICT) services by
fostering competition; and (iv) supporting private investment by addressing the growing skills
gap and the high regulatory burden for businesses and improving financial inclusion and land
governance.

3.2 The Development Challenge in Mindanao

54.     Achieving rapid and sustainable growth in Mindanao constitutes a difficult challenge. In
the region, productivity in agriculture is low except for a few export crops, manufacturing is
constrained by weak infrastructure, and a low-productive and low-skilled services sector has
become the catch basin for excess agriculture workers who cannot find jobs in the cities. Lack of
competition in key sectors, insecure property rights, complex regulations, severe
underinvestment in infrastructure, education, and health, and weak institutions have led to an
anomalous growth pattern for Mindanao, resulting in low-quality jobs for the majority of its
population and substantial emigration of many of its talented people. Decades-long conflict has
caused untold human suffering and severely constrained economic growth in conflict-affected
areas (about 60 percent of Mindanao’s cities and municipalities are directly affected by conflict)
while reducing confidence and discouraging investment throughout Mindanao.

Slow Economic Growth

55.     Mindanao has fallen behind the rest of the Philippines. Even though its per capita
income was once similar to Luzon’s and triple that of the Visayas, Mindanao’s growth rate is now
far below those of these two island groups. The region’s GDP increased by 3.4 percent annually
between 197575 and 2014, compared to 4.1 percent in Luzon, translating into a 30 percent higher
growth rate for Luzon (Figure 38). By 2014, Mindanao’s per capita GDP was only about half that
of Luzon’s. Compared to neighboring countries with a similar comparative advantage in
agriculture, Mindanao was as rich as Thailand and richer than both Indonesia and Vietnam until
1980. In 2014, per capita GDP in Mindanao was 30 percent of Thailand’s, 50 percent of

Indonesia’s, and 87 percent of Vietnam’s. Moreover, the ability of economic growth to generate
employment has declined steadily in the region. Between 1975 and 1996, employment only grew
between 1.04 and 1.72 percent for every 1 percent Mindanao’s economy grew. Moreover, the
elasticity fell to 0.43 between 1997 and 2008 and to 0.31 between 2009 and 2014, suggesting
that higher growth in recent years did not create a commensurate number of jobs.

From 1978 to 2014,76 the contribution of physical and human capital to Mindanao’s growth was
comparable to that of Luzon, but growth in output per worker was minimal and the contribution
of total factor productivity 77 was negative (Table 6). Conflict is probably the cause for Mindanao’s
negative total factor productivity contribution, which tends to undermine institutions, the rule
of law, and incentives to innovate and grow. The number of conflict-related deaths and
incidences of negative total factor productivity from 1986 to 2004 are positively correlated.78




76
   1977 is the earliest year all data were available. Two years are needed to measure initial capital formation, and
2014 data are the most recent available.
77
   Total factor productivity is the residual of growth after accounting for the contributions of capital and labor,
adjusted for educational attainment. On average, statistical errors should equal zero so that the negative residual
likely reflects a lack of technological and institutional change.
78
   Sufficient data are available only for these years.

57.      However, more recently, Mindanao’s economic performance has started to improve.
From 2010 to 2014, the region’s annual growth rate averaged 6.1 percent of GDP, on a par with
Luzon and the Visayas. Key cities in Mindanao, like Davao and Cagayan de Oro, are the region’s
new engines of growth. Similar to the rest of the country, Mindanao’s growth trajectory reflects
the increase in investments over the past six years. It also reflects public policies, such as the
partial liberalization of the cabotage regime, and resources, such as a tripling of the infrastructure
budget, devoted to growing Mindanao’s economy and improving investor confidence.

The Labor Force: Opportunity and Challenge

58.     There is a considerable and rising demand for quality jobs that can raise real income
and lift people out of poverty. In 2014, some 2.4 million Mindanawons were either unemployed
(about 460,000) or underemployed (1.9 million).79 Moreover, Mindanao’s relatively young
population means that an expected 392,000 workers will enter the labor force each year between
2016 and 2022, totaling 5.2 million by 2022. For the region to benefit from the availability of its
young workers, which is an enormous potential resource that can boost growth, it will require
productive jobs that pay decent wages. Also, enabling workers to transition from the informal
sector, which currently represents 70 percent of employment in Mindanao, to formal sector jobs
could improve their welfare and increase productivity.

59.     The sources of Mindanao’s economic growth have not generated enough high-quality
jobs. Unlike in Luzon and the Visayas,80 which have more diversified, innovative, and labor-
intensive economic structures (e.g., higher-value exports, such as electronics and furniture, and
fast-growing formal services, such as information technology (IT) and business process
outsourcing (BPO), Mindanao’s growth was driven by plantation crops (e.g., rubber, abaca,
banana, and pineapple) and forestry, mining, and heavy manufacturing (e.g., steel) supporting



79
 About one in five Mindanao workers would like to work more, but many jobs are only temporary or part-time.
80
 The rapid growth in the Visayas is also explained by large investments in the Leyte province under Ferdinand
Marcos, whose wife, Imelda, comes from there.


                                                               51
an import substitution program.81 These capital-intensive sectors required little local processing,
resulting in little local reinvestment of profits and low local multiplier effects. Furthermore,
infrastructure funds have not focused on building the intra-Mindanao logistics network which
has discouraged intra-regional trade. Instead, funds have been used to connect the region’s
plantations to its cities and ultimately to Manila and Cebu. While Mindanao’s growth sectors did
contribute to high GDP per capita between the 1960s and the 1980s, they did little to create jobs
or reduce poverty. This growth pattern concentrated power and wealth which entrenched deep
inequalities and ultimately contributed to the region’s conflicts, as few benefits reached the
Muslim population and indigenous peoples.

High Incidence of Poverty

60.     The poverty rate is higher in Mindanao than in Luzon and the Visayas. According to the
2015 Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 36 percent of the population of Mindanao lived
below the poverty line, compared to 13.1 percent in Luzon and 28 percent in the Visayas. Poverty
is particularly high in rural Mindanao. In 2012, there were 1.2 million food-poor farmers and
fisherfolk (27 percent of the total) and 1.1 million (25 percent) living between the food and
poverty thresholds. Another 1.4 million (31 percent) lived close to the absolute poverty line (20
percent above), making them highly vulnerable to fall back into poverty. As a result, a total of 3.7
million farmers and fisherfolk lived in or near poverty,82 leaving only 0.7 million (16 percent)
famers and fisherfolk with regular marketable surplus to generate savings for the next planting
season (Figure 39 and Figure 40). In part, the high poverty rate reflects unequal economic and
political power. When one person or firm controls the land, labor, credit, and product markets,
or any combination thereof,83 that person can drive farmers to subsistence by exploiting
interlocking markets or even blocking access to markets.84 Consultations and research
undertaken for this study suggest that these practices thrive in Mindanao and lock some farmers
and fisherfolk into a vicious spiral of poverty and indebtedness.




81
   Between the 1950s and 1980s, an import substitution policy was implemented to support local manufacturing. In
Mindanao, Iligan City was a center of heavy manufacturing (e.g., steel production).
82
   Based on the 2012 FIES. In 2012, the average annual per capita food poverty line in Mindanao was PHP 13,453 and
the poverty line was PHP 19,291, both slightly higher (1.4 percent) than that of Luzon despite Mindanao being less
developed. People falling below the provincial per capita food thresholds are considered food-poor, while those with
per capita income equal to or above the provincial per capita food thresholds but below the provincial per capita
poverty thresholds are considered poor. Those with per capita income equal to or above the per capita poverty
thresholds but below the 50th population percentile (agricultural workers tend to have lower income) are
considered near-poor.
83
   For instance, in a Mindanao town, the datu (local chieftain) can control local politics, own the only rural bank, have
a monopoly of security services and wide influence over labor and land allocation.

61.    Poverty is highest in conflict-affected areas. At 59 percent, ARMM has the highest
poverty incidence among cities and municipalities in Mindanao which is 18 percentage points
higher compared to the region as a whole in 2012.85 Municipal poverty incidence deteriorated in
ARMM between 2003 and 2012 and is correlated with the incidence of rido, inter-clan feuds.

62.    Poverty among workers is higher in Mindanao than elsewhere in the country. Thirty four
percent of workers in the region live below the poverty line, compared to 12 percent in Luzon in
2012. The incidence of in-work poverty is highest among less educated and less skilled workers,
especially for those who hold temporary or involuntary part-time jobs. The self-employed are
more likely to be poor than wage earners, and self-employment often reflects a lack of
opportunity rather than an entrepreneurial drive. Underemployment, not temporary
unemployment, is the main reason for in-work poverty. The key to reducing in-work poverty in
Mindanao is to provide better education and skills training and increase productive job
opportunities by making the investment climate more attractive.

Mindanao’s Agriculture
63.     Mindanao is the agriculture center of the Philippines, producing diverse crops and
livestock, including many high-value commodities. It contributes 40 percent of the country’s
agricultural products (Figure 41), with significant shares of rubber, cacao, coffee, coconut (small
farms), bananas and oil palm (mid-sized farms), and pineapple (large farms) (Figure 42). The top

  Small area estimates of poverty were used to determine municipal and city level poverty incidence in the
Philippines. The latest available data from the Philippines Statistics Authority was in 2012.


                                                                       53
three Philippine exports are coconuts (38 percent of world export volume in 2014), bananas (33
percent of world export volume in 2014), and pineapples (28 percent of world export volume in
2014).86

64.    Since most workers in Mindanao rely directly on agriculture, transforming the sector
could be significant for generating jobs. In 2012, the agriculture and agricultural produce value
chain accounted for 60 percent of Mindanao’s value added and 57 percent of its employment .87

65.    Mindanao’s agriculture sector is dominated by smallholder farming. About 60 percent
of farms in Mindanao cover less than 2 hectares (smallholders) and another 33 percent are 2 to
5 hectares (mid-size farmers). Mindanao also has a large proportion of landless agricultural
workers—estimated at over a million or about a third of all farm workers.

66.    Despite the promise of agriculture, many Mindanawons end up in low-paying services
jobs in urban areas. Limited job creation in agriculture has had economy-wide implications.
Because of slow agricultural growth, millions of workers have joined the informal services sector

  Of which 30 percent came from the farm (crops/livestock), fishery and forestry sectors (primary sector) and the
balance (30 percent) from, various industrial and services sectors that add value to farm produce.

where jobs are low-pay, low-skill, and of low-productivity. Services generates 44 percent of
Mindanao’s economic output, but half of these jobs are informal, such as in petty retail trade,
public transportation, and personal services. Also, many workers who escaped unproductive
agricultural jobs in depressed rural and conflict-effected areas are struggling to find better-paying
jobs in urban areas.

67.      Poor public policies, investment deficits, and institutional shortcomings constitute
current constraints to realizing the transformative potential of the agricultural sector. Some of
the drivers and causes of the poor performance in the sector are insecure and disputed property
rights, ineffective farmer organizations, fragmented agricultural research and tenuous research-
extension linkages, limited access to and low quality of agricultural services, and continued
weaknesses in the devolution of services to local government units. There are also problematic
gaps in rural infrastructure, especially farm-to-market roads and irrigation systems, and access
to capital is a continuing problem. Finally, there is an extensive unfinished agenda of
complementary reforms, primarily relating to agricultural price and trade-policy distortions

Improving Logistics and Transport Connectivity

68.       Lowering logistics costs would significantly benefit Mindanao’s agriculture value
         88
chains. An efficient logistics system is essential if Mindanao’s potential of becoming a global
supplier of basic and value-added produce is to be realized. Ensuring a seamless logistics network
from farm to markets will entail (1) connecting farms to towns by investing in village roads; (2)
connecting towns to ports by investing in major roads; (3) promoting competition in the domestic
shipping industry; (4) liberalizing cabotage; (5) modernizing the major ports; and (6) streamlining
export and import procedures. Because the logistics chain is only as good as its weakest link,
partial reforms will not lead to lower prices and better service. For instance, reforming domestic
shipping and cabotage without modernizing ports and improving roads will not lower shipping
cost; shipping lines will not upgrade to larger ships to increase scale if the movement of cargo
will still be delayed on the road and at the port.

   The Philippines Mindanao Jobs Report discusses the domestic and foreign market for Mindanao’s agricultural
products. In particular, unlocking the agricultural sector in Mindanao and addressing logistics and connectivity issues
will strengthen the contribution of Mindanao’s agricultural output to the nation’s food security, particularly
increasing rice and maize supply to the other island regions. In addition, there opportunity to expand the production
of exportable agriculture products: aquatic, coffee, and coconut products. Here the challenge will be mainly to more
closely link farmers with enterprises.

69.     Improving transport connectivity from farm to market would have numerous positive
effects on economic development. Without a well-developed transportation network, farmers
must deal with higher input costs and lower prices for their produce. Because there are few
marketing options, farmers’ lack of bargaining power further reduces prices. Poor-quality roads
may also limit access to extension services and lower the quality of produce that reach their
destinations because of the multiple transport modes needed to reach markets, from animal-
drawn carts to trucks. As a result, poor transportation options reduce the opportunities for
farmers to diversify into higher-value perishable crops and invest in productivity or quality-
enhancing improvements. Also, a large portion of produce is wasted because it is not possible or
economically feasible to transporting it without access to quality roads.89 Improved connectivity
would also benefit rural societies by facilitating the access to social services and encouraging
higher school attendance. In the Philippines, road investment complemented by investments in

  For example, coconut water is dumped to lighten the coconuts carried by horses or people in Mindanao. In Sulu,
because of poor roads and the high cost of shipping, many fruits are left to rot on farms despite high urban demand
(e.g., mangosteens).

education has had a significant direct and indirect impact on the welfare of the poor.90 Agro-
enterprises in areas with limited connectivity have higher costs for collecting produce, higher
physical and product quality losses, and greater difficulties in achieving the scale required for the
efficient use of processing facilities. Consumers relying on these producers are confronted by
higher food prices, reduced scope for dietary diversity and good nutrition, and increased
exposure to food safety risks.

Improving Power and ICT Infrastructure

70.     Daily power outages, together with logistics problems and armed conflict, are a huge
cost to businesses and cited as a top binding constraint for investing in Mindanao. Scheduled
power outages due to insufficient generation averaged three hours a day in major cities in 2015.
Occasional unscheduled shutdowns and maintenance of power plants can add up to four hours,91
and transmission repairs due to bombings can take weeks.92 Besides disrupting work, power
outages and fluctuations can damage machinery and equipment. The total cost for three months
of power outages during the peak of the 2013 Mindanao power crisis amounted to an estimated
Php600 million for businesses in Zamboanga City,93 and the cost was estimated at Php42 billion
(0.3 percent of Philippine GDP) for power outages in Davao City in 2015.94

   For an extensive discussion, see Balisacan and Pernia 2002.
91
   For example, in early 2016, a seven-day corrective maintenance of a unit of the Therma South coal-fired plant in
Davao City led to daily brownouts lasting three to four hours (Lacorte 2016).
92
   For example, the November 2015 bombing of transmission lines in Marawi City shut out power from the Agus-1
and Agus-2 hydroelectric power plants for more than two weeks (Manar 2015).
93
   This is double the amount of business taxes paid by Zamboanga businesses in 2014. A major hospital spends an
additional Php600,000 a month on generators (http://www.zamboangachamber.com/home/articles/172--the-cost-
and-effect-of-the-power-crisis-on-businesses-and-residents-of-zamboanga-city).
94
   The Chamber of Commerce estimates the hourly cost of power outages at Php80 million, as reported in the
Inquirer article by de Quiros (2016). The cost for 2015 assumes two hours of power outages a day x 260 work days x
Php80 million = Php41.6 billion.

71.    Efficient and affordable Internet service has the potential to transform Mindanao in the
same way it transformed Manila. Davao has emerged as Mindanao’s IT-BPO hub95 and Cagayan
de Oro has been identified as a potential destination. In 2015, there were 104 firms involved with
IT-BPO in Davao and Cagayan de Oro, employing a total of 35,389 workers. Other major cities,
such as General Santos and Iligan, are marketing themselves to attract technology firms. Yet
internet speeds in Mindanao are much lower than in the rest of the country and significantly
lower than in Metro Manila.96 In cities throughout Mindanao, average Internet speeds range
from 141 kbps in Marawi97 to 2.4 mbps in Cagayan de Oro, compared to 3.6 mbps in Makati.98 It
appears that Davao users have to pay about 1.5 times more to get the same speed as in Makati,
and Marawi users have to pay 26 times more. A dedicated line can cost up to Php20,000 per
month for each additional 1 mbps of speed, compared to Php700 for a residential line with no
speed guarantee.




95
   The 2015 Tholons top 100 outsourcing destinations in the world ranked Davao 69th among 100 cities. Davao is also
in the 10 “next wave” cities for the IT-BPO industry. This recognition has already helped it attract a number of large
IT-BPO firms.
96
   In the absence of official data, a third-party website (www.testmy.net) was used to record Internet speeds.
Individual speed-test results from each city are averaged. This method depends on the plan of each user who
conducted the speed test. The plans are assumed to be fairly similar.

Access to Finance, and Improving Land Management

72.     Despite heavy demand, skills shortages are slowing the expansion of the IT-BPO
industry. The Davao ICT council estimated about 5,000 job vacancies in 2015, but the industry
could not fill them even though 20,000 students graduate from college99 in Davao City and
surrounding provinces every year.100 Most applicants in Davao are rejected for lack of both soft101
and technical skills.102 This results in a supply gap of 70 percent in Davao’s ICT sector and 40
percent in Davao’s BPO industry.103 This is less of a problem In Cagayan de Oro because its
industry is much smaller. A shortage of engineers is also affecting manufacturing, construction,
and utility firms in Mindanao.104 The construction sector is hard-pressed to find civil, electrical,
design, planning, and contract engineers. Moreover, the manufacturing sector is seeking
mechanical, chemical, and industrial engineers. Business chambers confirm a lack of engineers in
Mindanao, as the few engineering graduates tend to leave Mindanao for jobs in Manila or
overseas. As leading cities in Mindanao transform into manufacturing and high-skill services
economies, skills will become even more important. The major causes of these skills shortages
are too little investment in basic education, inadequate training programs, and the migration of
skilled workers.

73.     As in the Philippines in general, cities in Mindanao tend to perform worse on Doing
Business indicators than other East Asian cities. For instance, the two best performers in
Mindanao, General Santos and Davao, ranked 124th and 125th, respectively, among 151
economies (Quezon City was 128th) for starting a business (Singapore was 1st, Thailand 59th, and
Malaysia 71st). A number of reasons explain the high cost of starting and maintaining a business.
First, many government agencies at both the national and the local levels are involved in starting
a business, and several private sector providers (e.g., bookstore, banks, etc.) are also involved,
but there is lack of coordination. Second, one-stop-shops and process automation are limited,
especially in Mindanao where internet service is slow. Third, several steps, such as securing an
import permit and getting Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval, take several days
because processing is done in Manila or in a regional center (e.g., SEC registration of Iligan firms
is done in Cagayan de Oro, which is 90 km away). And fourth, most agencies have yet to shift

   Since 2010, the average number of graduates in the Davao Region (Region XI) is around 20,000 (CHED Higher
Education Facts and Figures: http://www.ched.gov.ph/central/page/ched-statistics).
100 High attrition rates are also a problem. A study by IBPAP and TeamAsia (2014) estimates the attrition rate of IT-

BPO firms at 15 percent. In addition, about 18 percent of employees leave the industry as a whole each year (IBPAP).
101 Soft skills include critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. Results of the Global Competitiveness

Assessment Tool, an industry-benchmarked assessment system used by BPO companies, show that the average
scores of most schools are below the industry benchmark range. In particular, schools score below the range in
learning ability, English language proficiency, perceptual speed and accuracy, and behavioral skills. On basic skills,
60 percent of test takers score below the 30th percentile. On behavioral skills, 70 percent of test takers score that
low.

businesses.

74.      Mindanao’s economy constitutes 15 percent of the national GDP but receives only 3
percent of total credit granted in the country. Eighty seven percent of credit granted by banks
in the Philippines is concentrated in the national capital regi on. Mindanao’s low share of credit
compared to its contribution to GDP is similar to the situation in the Visayas and Luzon. Bank
credit tends to be concentrated in metropolitan areas which are also centers of economic
activity. This pattern is repeated in Mindanao, where Davao receives 27 percent of all credit in
the region, and Davao, Cagayan de Oro, and General Santos together represent up to 52 percent
of all credit in Mindanao. However, statistics on credit reported by banks may not fully reflect its
geographical destination because many banks process loans, especially for large commercial
borrowers, in their regional or main offices.

75.      Residents in Mindanao are on average less likely to use financial services by banks and
instead rely more on microfinance organizations and cooperatives. Forty three percent of
Fillipinos report having used a bank in Mindanao, including ATMs, compared to 57 percent in
Luzon and 35 percent in the Visayas. In Mindanao, 36 percent of residents use microfinance
organizations and 21 percent use cooperatives.105 However, 34 percent of residents report using
informal credit and 28 percent have some savings, which suggests a possible demand for formal
financial services.

76.     Agricultural businesses throughout the country have similar financing problems, but
instability in Mindanao is an additional deterrent. There is high risk involved in providing finance
to smallholder agriculture, especially when land rights are not secure. While changes in national
policies could increase lending to the agricultural sector nationally, several specific policies could
help increase lending in the conflict-affected areas of Mindanao.

77.     Financial inclusion and better access to financial services constitute one element of the
broader development effort envisaged to lift economic performance in the ARMM. The
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion, which was adopted in 2015, creates a framework for
efforts to boost financial inclusion throughout the Philippines. A range of policy and regulatory
actions, financial education, and consumer protection programs and advocacy initiatives can
improve prospects for financial inclusion in ARMM. However, there is also a need for
interventions specifically tailored to the region considering its specific challenges.

78.     Inadequate land use planning and zoning is impairing the quality of life in Mindanao’s
fast-growing cities. The region’s city centers are becoming congested and polluted, and informal
settlement enclaves are multiplying. Public administration is finding it hard to cope with the
growing demand for services, and infrastructure investments and regulation of land use for
housing, commerce, and industry is becoming more challenging to coordinate. While several of
Mindanao’s cities are beginning to proactively update their comprehensive land use plans, recent

accelerated growth will require more regular updates than the five years mandated by the Local
Government Code.

79.     The registry of land transactions does not reflect reality. An estimated 10 to 20 percent
of transactions are not registered mainly because of the high costs (formal and informal) of
transferring106 and registering a property. In 2011, the time and cost involved in registering a
property in Mindanao’s cities were the highest in the Philippines. Moreover, access to reliable
and current information from the registry is costly. The Land Titling Computerization Project has
ironically made accessing land records very expensive even for government offices fulfilling their
mandates, and it has contributed to delays in registering new titles and transactions. The result
is missing, outdated, inaccurate, and costly land records that reduce incentives to develop land,
hold back formalization, prevent small and medium-sized enterprises from accessing formal
credit, slow infrastructure projects with right-of-way issues, and complicate community
mortgage programs for buying land.


3.3. Economic Policies to Reduce Conflict


80.     Though the long-standing armed conflicts affecting parts of Mindanao can only be
resolved by a political solution, economic policies can help reduce conflict. Dealing with
historical injustices and recognizing cultural minorities is essential for peace and reconciliation.
However, the government’s peace and development roadmap sets out ways to also overcome
the drivers of conflict. This section offers a series of recommendations to tackle these drivers as
a complement to a political solution.

81.     Violent conflict in Mindanao is complex and affects large areas. The state is engaged in
peace processes with two groups: Moros fighting for self-determination and communists fighting
for ideology and against poverty and inequality.107 Violence can occur between political
dynasties, communities (e.g., Moros versus indigenous peoples, Christians, or other Moros), and
clans, and with criminal, terrorist, kidnap-for-ransom, and other armed groups. Of Mindanao’s
six regions, conflict is most prevalent in the ARMM, the Zamboanga Peninsula Region, and the
Caraga Region. Almost 60 percent of Mindanao’s 455 cities and municipalities and 13.6 million
people (62 percent of the population) are directly affected by conflict.108 In conflict areas, farmers
often produce at subsistence levels and businesses remain small to escape being noticed.109


106
    This was estimated by local registrars and accessors. The cost is driven by a number of taxes and fees: capital
gains, transfer, and documentary stamp taxes, and registration and survey fees. Often, the magnitude of back taxes
deters people from registering.
107
    Some groups, however, are little more than extortionists fronting as a communist insurgency.
108
    Sources include the Bangsamoro Conflict Monitoring System (BCMS), supplemented by field consultations and
research.
109
    Fear of kidnapping or extortion keeps businesses small and capital mobile. Most produce is sent to processing
centers outside of ARMM to places like Davao, Cebu, and Zamboanga. In 2015, there were only 13 large companies
registered in mainland ARMM; they were engaged in agricultural planting and processing, or biomass energy


                                                        62
About 63 percent of the people in areas affected by conflict live below the poverty line, 110 and
ARMM has the highest poverty incidence among Mindanao’s regions. The provinces that became
part of the ARMM decades ago were once the richest region of Mindanao but are now the
poorest.111

82.     Land disputes result in conflict.112 Two factors explain the prominence of land disputes
among Moros and indigenous people: (i) the legacy of resettlement and land programs from the
1900s to the 1980s113 and (ii) magnified effects of overlapping land law frameworks. The first
largely affects the Moro people and the second the indigenous people. Dispossession of the
original inhabitants of Mindanao came in four waves: (1) from the end of Spanish rule in 1898 to
the end of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1946; (2) the early years of the third republic from
1946 to the late 1960s; (3) the martial law years from the 1970s to the mid-1980s; and (4) the
comprehensive agrarian years from the late 1980s to the present. Each was characterized by a
policy instrument driven by the political and economic agenda of the central government. The
magnified effects of overlapping land legal frameworks grew from Mindanao’s unique socio-
geology that creates multiple rights over the same plot. The Philippines has eight separate land
laws, with significant overlaps and no clear rules of precedence, that are the responsibility of five
offices in four agencies, often without coordination.114 The situation is exacerbated by unique
socio-geological features that disproportionately impact indigenous people.

83.     Land dispossession and conflict are aggravated by policies and developments that have
disregarded traditional institutions based on communal ownership of land. Among them are
(1) poor land administration and management that results in the approval of conflicting and
multiple rights over the same plots (all with legal anchors, although not all are necessarily seen
as fair); (2) cadastral surveys that cause conflict; (3) land dispute systems favoring
“confrontational” judicial mechanisms that ignore customary approaches such as mediation by
leaders; (4) excessive accumulation of land by the new political elite and commercial interests in
mining and logging; and (5) displacement of people due to violent conflict and environmental
factors. There is a strong case to be made to complement, or even trump, conventional solutions

production (data provided by the ARMM Regional Board of Investments; a large establishment is defined as one that
employs at least 200 persons).

    World Bank staff estimates based on the BCMS, census of population and housing, and small area estimates of
poverty.
111
    Growth in the Caraga and Davao regions has been higher than in the ARMM due to less intense conflict, a more
predictable conflict environment, and a mining boom.

    Unlike the Spanish and American colonization of the Philippines, the “colonization” of Mindanao by Ma nila was
fairly recent, and there are people still alive who speak of how their land was taken from them.

    These are the Public Land Act of 1936 (Commonwealth Act 141), Forestry Code of 1975 (Presidential Decree 705),
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 (Republic Act 6657), People’s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 (RA 7076),
Local Government Code of 1991 (RA 7160), National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992 (RA 7586),
Mining Act of 1995 (RA 7942), and Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act of 1997 (RA 8371). They are implemented by the
Land Management Bureau and Forest Management Bureau in the DENR, Land Registration Authority in the
Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), and the National Commission on Indigenous
Peoples (NCIP).

to land problems by solutions that address the core reason for grievances and are sympathetic
to local customs.

84.     Mass displacements have exacerbated the welfare impact of conflict. In August 2014,
there were almost a million internally displaced persons in Mindanao according to the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Some 41 percent of the population in mainland ARMM
and adjacent provinces have been displaced at least once, with many suffering far more often.
Millions have migrated from Basulta and central Mindanao to safer areas in the Philippines and
neighboring Sabah in Malaysia. The Malaysian government estimates that there were 470,000
Filipinos in Sabah in 2015. However, unofficial sources put this number at about a million, of
which 25 percent were considered “stateless”, i.e., they did not have birth certificates or
passports to prove their nationality, which reduces their access to jobs and services and increases
their vulnerability to exploitation.

85.     Violent conflict has had a major impact on growth and poverty levels throughout
Mindanao. Concerns over security have depressed tourism and boosted the emigration of skilled
workers. The reputational damage caused by insecurity has even reduced investment in areas
relatively unaffected by violence. These areas also bear the fiscal burden of coping with displaced
persons. On the other hand, more peaceful areas have benefited from opportunities to process
agricultural produce from conflict-affected areas, where processing facilities are rare. And many
skilled workers from conflict-affected areas have migrated to other regions of Mindanao.

86.     Economic policy can support the resolution of conflicts. The issues at the root of the
conflicts, in particular a deep sense of injustice as a result of greatly unequal political and
economic power and longstanding grievances over land dispossession, can only be resolved by a
political settlement. It is clear, however, that poverty and economic hopelessness in conflict-
affected areas help perpetuate conflict, as individuals without land or work opportunities are
driven to join armed groups to survive or to seek social status. Discontent arising from social
injustice and discrimination in the distribution of economic opportunities and development
resources can also fuel violence. Thus, this report focuses on two major supports for peace:
providing alternative income sources and improving the delivery of basic services, particularly in
areas that have been neglected. Although such policies cannot on their own resolve conflicts,
they can facilitate peace by creating economic opportunities and demonstrating that the
government can be effective in improving welfare.

3.4 A Regional Development Strategy for Mindanao

87.    Reducing poverty and delivering on the new Philippine Government Strategic
Framework for Mindanao Peace and Development will demand a new form of engagement in
Mindanao. The strategic framework recognizes that there are “two Mindanaos”: one that can be
characterized as relatively stable and prosperous and another one that is suffering pervasive
poverty, violent conflict, and poor governance. To address the goal of a peaceful, cohesive,
secure, and inclusively developed Mindanao, the framework calls for five linked strategic
outcomes: resilient communities built; effective governance promoted; inclusive economic


                                                64
growth and jobs ensured; security environment stabilized; and the consensus for peace
strengthened.

88.     The World Bank has created a strategy for regional development in Mindanao. This
builds on a dialogue with the Philippine government and local stakeholders. The three main
components are: (1) raise agricultural productivity and improve farm-to-market connectivity; (2)
boost human development; and (3) address drivers of conflict and fragility while building up
institutions in ARMM and other conflict-affected areas.

89.     Mindanao’s comparative advantage lies in agriculture, yet its full potential is not being
realized, mainly because productivity remains low. Agriculture and related services and
industries account for 60 percent of Mindanao’s GDP and 57 percent of its employment.
Mindanao accounts for 40 percent of the country’s total agricultural output and 60 percent of all
agricultural exports. However, only 16 percent of Mindanao farmers produce a marketable
surplus and more than half of farm households are poor. Also, rural underemployment is high,
and many farmers are neither organized nor linked to value chains. With a few exceptions (e.g.,
bananas) the sector’s once vibrant growth has stalled.

90.    There is domestic and foreign market potential for Mindanao’s agricultural products
(Box 12). First, there is scope to supply more rice and maize to the other islands of the Philippines
as food or feed ingredients. Although Mindanao accounts for a high proportion of national food
production, it is only tenuously linked to the national market, limiting its contribution to national
food security. This is a missed opportunity for both Mindanao and the country. There is also an
emerging opportunity to cater to growing urban demand within Mindanao for higher-value
perishable meat and vegetables. Realizing the domestic market potential will depend on
addressing limited connectivity to give farmers better access to markets both within Mindanao
and beyond. Finally, there is an opportunity to expand the production of exportable agriculture
products: aquatic, coffee, and coconut products. This involves linking farmers more closely with
enterprises, as it is primarily agribusinesses that have the opportunity to differentiate or diversify
product lines.

91.     Limited connectivity constitutes a major constraint for growing the agricultural sector.
Farmers are disconnected or misconnected with technical service providers, agro-enterprises,
markets, and consumers, a problem that has multiple consequences (Table 7). Many roads are in
bad condition or congested, resulting in rejected agricultural produce, especially perishable
commodities like bananas and other fruits and vegetables. Beyond the lack of adequate farm to
market roads, there is a need to prioritize modernization to relieve congestion on roads accessing
ports for more connectivity beyond Mindanao. Moreover, Mindanao ports lack economies of
scale: there are some 690 ports in the region, yet the top four ports handle only 17 percent of
domestic cargo and 12 percent of foreign. Many ports are owned by private companies and are
closed to smaller farmers.




                                                 65
                         Box 12. The Market Potential of Agriculture in Mindanao
Mindanao is considered the agricultural basket of the Philippines, producing a diverse set of
crops and serving both local and international markets. Of the three island regions, it accounts
for the largest share of agricultural production and contributes significantly to national food
security. For example, it produces about 50 percent of national corn production. Also, it produces
most of the country’s high-value crops: about 80 percent of bananas and coffee and over 60
percent of coconuts. In addition, Mindanao contributes a significant share of the country’s key
commodity contributions to total world export volume. Its bananas, pineapples, and coconuts
comprise about a third of world export volumes.115 However, Mindanao’s agricultural sector has
not realized its potential.
A number of Mindanao’s agricultural products could extend their shares in both domestic and
international markets. An analysis of about two dozen value chains in Mindanao reveals that
some products, such as coffee, aquatic products, seaweed, and coconut, appear to have
considerable market potential, either for more effectively serving nearby urban centers or for
expanding in markets abroad.
Ramping up coffee production in Mindanao could also address the demand for domestic
consumption of currently imported coffee products. In recent years, domestic coffee
consumption rose significantly to about 130,000 metric tons of coffee in 2015 —more than
double the consumption in 2007. Until the 1990s, the Philippines was a major exporter of coffee
beans, but domestic production steadily fell following a sharp decline in prices. Today, green
coffee is among the country’s top 10 agricultural imports. For Mindanao, where about two -thirds
of national coffee production takes place, there is a potential to expand to coffee processing,
such as the production of instant coffee, given that 95 percent of all domestically consumed
instant coffee is imported.
Aquatic products like milkfish, tilapia, and seaweed could serve wider domestic and
international markets. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the Philippines ranks
among the top 20 global producers of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, accounting for about 1
percent of total global production; Mindanao contributes already nearly half of total domestic
production. Domestically, milkfish and tilapia are central items in the Filipino diet, yet Mindanao’s
contribution to milkfish and tilapia production is about 15 and 7 percent, respectively.
In terms of the aquatic export markets, seaweed has the most market potential for Mindanao.
The Philippines ranked 3rd globally in production of aquatic plants with 5.7 percent of total world
production in 2014. Mindanao accounts for more than half of total Filipino production and most
of it takes place in the ARMM. Moreover, seaweed, as an aquatic export, is second only to tuna
in terms of value, accounting for US$202 million—about 20 percent of total export earnings for
fisheries in 2015. There is heavy demand from international markets for seaweed, from which
carrageenan is extracted for use as an additive, binder, and emulsifier in the food,
pharmaceutical, beverage, and cosmetic industries.

The coconut industry represents a growth opportunity for Mindanao and a chance for its
poorest farmers to establish linkages with enterprises. The Philippines is the second largest
producer of coconuts in the world. In 2015, coconuts accounted for about 40 percent of total
export earnings and over 60 percent of those coconuts came from Mindanao. In recent years,
international demand has outstripped supply because of the proliferation of coconut byproducts,
such as virgin coconut oil, coco sugar, and copra. As a result, there is an opportunity to expand
Mindanao’s coconut-related agribusiness for both domestic and export markets.

92.     Customs procedures are a major bottleneck to trade facilitation, especially for
agricultural products. On the Doing Business indicator for Trading Across Borders, the Philippines
ranked 95th in 2016116, one rank lower than in 2015. The World Bank Logistics Performance Index
ranks the country at 71st, down from 85th in 2014, with a ranking of 78th for Customs and Border
Management, 31 points lower than in 2014.

93.     Protracted land disputes and conflict have deterred investments in agriculture, slowing
job creation and poverty reduction. Favorable climatic conditions, the presence of Lake Lanao
and the Liguasan Marsh, and the impact of climate change elsewhere in the country have
encouraged large firms based in Davao and Cagayan de Oro to extend their operations to Lanao
del Sur and Maguindanao through contract-growing agreements with smallholders. However, a
large majority of prospective investors are deterred by unclear and overlapping property rights,
and even current investors are deterred from expanding their operations. Land disputes can
easily turn into violent confrontation and inter-elite clashes, which can destroy inventory,
delivery, and production schedules. In some cases, the potential for profit from large pineapple
and banana farms has led elites to dispossess smallholders as they consolidate lands for contract
growing.

94.    The proposed strategy is designed to support Mindanao’s comparative advantage and
strengthen its linkages with the entire region. It identifies three priorities to unlock agriculture
potential and streamline farm-to-market connectivity (Figure 46).


                  Figure 46. How to Unlock Mindanao’s Agriculture Potential




                Raise farm productivity    Support development of
                 through agro-spatial     logistics services, improve   Builid up ports and
                    approaches and           roads from farms to        modernize customs
                 productive alliances         markets and ports




95.    Connectivity bottlenecks are compounded by skills deficits. Over 80 percent of
Mindanao’s farmers and fishermen are poor or near-poor, lacking scale and skills to compete.
People with more education in Mindanao, especially ARMM, see few prospects for wage gains.
To maximize human development and productivity in Mindanao, weaknesses need to be
addressed in both basic education and skills & employment development. The approach needs
to especially target youth in conflict-affected areas.

96.     Resolving conflict in Mindanao rests on addressing the causes of conflict and providing
jobs and economic opportunities as alternatives to violence. The proposed framework builds
on the 2011 World Bank World Development Report on conflict, security, and development.
Breaking the cycle of insecurity and reducing the risk of its recurrence require restoration of
confidence in collective action and transforming institutions to provide a sustained level of
security, justice, and jobs. “Restoring confidence” requires deliberate efforts by both state and
private actors from the national to the community level in order to launch the initial stages of
confidence-building and institutional transformation and secure early gains. “Transfor ming
institutions” requires giving early priority to actions to reform the institutions responsible for
citizen security, justice, and jobs.

97.     Creating jobs is central to stabilization and normalization in conflict areas for several
reasons. First, jobs address one of the roots of conflict, which is a lack of employment
opportunities that drives many, particularly combatants and out-of-school youth, to desperation.
Without prospects for earning a decent income, the unemployed (especially the young) become
pessimistic about the future. Second, when employment opportunities are available, recruitment
by rebel or criminal elements promising better income becomes less attractive. Third, jobs give
individuals a sense of being part of the society as they share in its benefits. Third, if individuals


                                                     68
feel that they belong to the society, they will have a greater stake in its preservation and have
more to lose, especially their jobs and goals of a better future, if conflict breaks out.

98.    However, job creation will not be enough. Where the cause of conflict is not economic,
such as the struggle for identity or self-rule, economic measures alone will not be enough to
resolve the conflict. In Mindanao, peace and development will hinge on a political solution that
can successfully address the causes of violence—injustice, inadequate governance, land
dispossession, discrimination, and sociocultural marginalization. Inclusive job creation can
support peace by providing equitable access to economic opportunity for all, even those in
remote, conflict-affected communities.

99.     Supporting the transformation of institutions will not be simple and cannot be done
quickly. There will be no single “make or break” moment; it will take a series of self -reinforcing
actions to restore confidence and gradually build effective institutions. Violence prevention and
recovery is only possible if it is recognized that security, justice, and economic stresses are linked.
As a result, a specialized suite of programs is needed in fragile environments that combines
elements of security, justice, institution building, and economic transformation. In addition to
making agriculture more productive, improving farm-to-market connectivity, and promoting
human development, it will be necessary to build up institutions in the ARMM and other conflict-
affected areas and address the less obvious drivers of conflict and fragility. One aspect is to
support resilient communities and responsive local governments. Another is to promote citizen
security through supporting normalization processes and promote justice by addressing land
conflicts.

100. The proposed strategy could have wide-ranging benefits to the Philippines. These range
from nationwide improvements due to customs reform and the ability of subsistence farmers
and day laborers in poor areas to access farm to market roads to youth enrolling in job-training
programs. It will also transcend the divide between non-conflict and conflict-affected areas in
Mindanao and support interventions to promote peace and socioeconomic development as well
as longer-term economic development opportunities that would help reduce the risk of conflict
in the future. The proposed strategy will guide the World Bank engagement in Mindanao.
