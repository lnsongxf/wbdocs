Research Reports

The publications in this series cover a wide range of subjects—from computer
modeling to experience with water user associations—and vary in content from
directly applicable research to more basic studies, on which applied work ultimately
depends. Some research reports are narrowly focused, analytical and detailed
empirical studies; others are wide-ranging and synthetic overviews of generic
problems.
     Although most of the reports are published by IWMI staff and their
collaborators, we welcome contributions from others. Each report is reviewed
internally by IWMI staff, and by external reviewers. The reports are published and
distributed both in hard copy and electronically (www.iwmi.org) and where possible
all data and analyses will be available as separate downloadable files. Reports
may be copied freely and cited with due acknowledgment.


About IWMI

IWMI’s mission is to provide evidence-based solutions to sustainably manage water
and land resources for food security, people’s livelihoods and the environment.
IWMI works in partnership with governments, civil society and the private sector
to develop scalable agricultural water management solutions that have a tangible
impact on poverty reduction, food security and ecosystem health.

    Box 1. Major IWMI-led programs focused on water productivity.

    CGIAR System-Wide Initiative on Water Management (SWIM) (1995-1999): SWIM supported much of
    the early work on water productivity. Launched in 1995 by the Technical Advisory Committee of the CGIAR,
    SWIM was a collaborative research program focusing on broad issues of water management and agricultural
    production within a basin context. Key research themes included water accounting, salinity management,
    water-land relations, water productivity, multiple uses, water harvesting and basin-scale modeling. Many
    of the fundamental water productivity concepts, tools and indicators emerged from this body of work.

    Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture (CA) (2001-2006): Commencement of
    the CA program in 2001 fostered a broader, multi-disciplinary body of conceptual and applied research on
    water—globally, regionally and in selected river basins in Asia and Africa. The program, involving hundreds
    of CGIAR researchers and partners, aimed to improve water investment and management decisions to
    meet poverty, hunger, and environmental sustainability objectives by understanding the (i) options to
    enhance agricultural water productivity; (ii) benefits, costs and impacts from past developments in irrigated
    agriculture; and (iii) water requirements to meet future food security and environmental sustainability goals.

    CGIAR Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF) (2004-2013): Informed by SWIM and early CA
    research, IWMI called for a major new research-for-development program to catalyze water productivity
    improvements that are effective and efficient as well as pro-poor, gender-equitable, and environmentally
    sustainable. This call led to the launch of the CPWF. The program was a major multi-partner program
    with the aim of raising water productivity and improving food security while helping to alleviate poverty,
    improve health, and attain environmental security. Over the course of a decade, the program funded over
    a hundred projects, concentrated primarily in 10 major river basins in Asia, Africa and South America.

    CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) (2012-present): In 2011, the CPWF was
    reoriented to become part of the new CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE). It
    comprises 11 CGIAR centers and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as core
    partners. Through collaboration with research, policy and implementing organizations in Asia, Africa and South
    America, WLE aims to increase water and land productivity in a sustainable manner in order to secure the
    provision of ecosystem services, improve food security, reduce poverty, and promote gender and social equity.

    Box 2. Terms and definitions.

    Classical irrigation efficiency
    The term refers to the ratio of water consumed by crops relative to water applied or, in some instances, relative to
    water withdrawn from a source. The numerator sometimes takes into account effective precipitation, by deducting
    it from the water consumed. To assess losses in the conveyance and application of irrigation water, the terms
    conveyance efficiency (ratio of water received at the farm gate relative to the water withdrawn from the water
    source) and application efficiency (ratio of water stored in the root zone and ultimately consumed by crops relative
    to the water delivered to the farm gate), respectively, are used.
    Sources: Israelsen 1932, 1950; Keller and Keller 1995; Burt et al. 1997; Cai et al. 2006; Jensen 2007.

    Water-use efficiency
    The term refers to the ratio of plant biomass (or yield) relative to the water consumed (or, in some instances,
    transpired). In the field of agronomy and plant physiology, it is typically expressed in kilograms per cubic meter
         3
    (kg/m ).
    Sources: Viets 1962; Molden 1997; Renault and Wallender 2000; Howell 2001; Hsiao et al. 2007; Perry et al.
    2009.

    Effective irrigation efficiency
    The term is defined as the ratio of water consumed, minus effective precipitation, relative to the effective use of
    water. Effective use of water is the difference between water inflow to an irrigation system and water outflow (with
    both flows discounted for the leaching requirements to hold soil salinity at an acceptable level). The term was
    developed to address some of the limitations of classical irrigation efficiency by taking into account the quantity
    of water delivered from, and returned to, a water supply system (as well as the leaching requirements).
    Sources: Keller and Keller 1995; Keller et al. 1996; Cai et al. 2006; Jensen 2007.

    Water productivity
    The term refers to the ratio of physical production (in terms of biomass or crop yield) or, in some instances,
    ‘economic value’ of production (in terms of gross or net value of product) relative to water use (in terms of water
                                                                                                        3
    withdrawn, applied or consumed). It is, therefore, expressed in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m ) or US dollars
                            3
    per cubic meter (USD/m ). The selection of the numerator and denominator depends on the scale and focus of
    the analysis.

   Hsiao et al. (2007) showed that the ‘efficiency’ concept can be used for an array of steps that may be involved in converting an input into a
final end product. They applied the chain of efficiency approach to systematically quantify and integrate the complex steps involved to convert
water into an agricultural output. When the production of an output is complicated and an input (such as water) goes through a chain of
sequential steps ending in the output, the overall efficiency of the process can be quantified in terms of the efficiency of each of the component
steps. The output in any step in the chain is the input in the following step. For example, if water is withdrawn from a reservoir for irrigated
crop production, the efficiency of the first step would be conveyance efficiency, calculated as the ratio of water received at the farm gate to
the water withdrawn; the second step would be farm efficiency, calculated as the ratio of water at the field edge to the water at the farm gate,
and so on. In all, the authors present a chain with three engineering-related and five agronomy-related efficiencies, with the last one being
yield efficiency, defined as the ratio of harvested yield to the plant biomass. At each efficiency step, different interventions could be made to
improve the respective efficiency measure, yet the effects would extend to the whole process.

 It is interesting to note that the term ‘water productivity’ dates back, at least, to the nineteenth century, when it was used in connection with
water management for agriculture in the Indus River Basin, and defined as the number of farm holdings per unit of available water (Renault
and Wallender 2000).
