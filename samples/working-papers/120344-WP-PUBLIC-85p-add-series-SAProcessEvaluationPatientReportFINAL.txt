EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In June of 2016, a team of researchers from South Africa’s National Department of Health, the
World Bank, Boston University and the Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office began
enrolling patients into an evaluation of the National Department of Health's National Adherence
Guidelines (AGL) for Chronic Diseases being implemented by the National Department of Health
(NDoH). The AGL is a tool for the NDoH to promote differentiated care, a client-centred approach
that simplifies and adapts services across the HIV cascade while reducing unnecessary burdens on
the health system.

This report describes the patient interview and focus group
discussion results for the five HIV cohorts (Evaluation Protocol 2).      The AGL is a tool for
The five cohorts are meant to evaluate five interventions within the      the NDoH to

   patients eligible for each intervention?

EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



 4. What additional strategies do patients feel would be helpful in improving treatment adherence?
For each questions we analysed and triangulated qualitative and quantitative data. The results
show that from the patient perspective, each intervention has promise and supported either ART
initiation or adherence, however each could be improved. Detailed illustrative quotes are provided
for each intervention according to the main themes identified. Specifically, patients had very
positive feelings about ACs and decentralized medication delivery in focus group discussions,
though the results for ACs were more strongly supported by the quantitative data.

ANSWERS TO THE STUDY QUESTIONS:
1. HOW DOES PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH CARE AT THE INTERVENTION SITES COMPARE TO
      THE CONTROL SITES AMONG HIV POSITIVE PATIENTS?
      ▪   Respondents from intervention sites generally perceived the quality of care as better or at
          least no different from respondents at control sites, with the AC and FTIC intervention
          cohorts reporting a higher level of satisfaction with care over the controls.

      ▪   Patients in ACs and enrolled in DMD reported high satisfaction with these services in terms
          of convenience and saving them time. These patients were able to frequent the clinic less
          often than patients in the control group, and there was a perception of improved quality of
          care amongst AC participants.

2. WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS TO AND FACILITATORS OF ART INITIATION AND ADHERENCE
      AMONG HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR EACH INTERVENTION?
      ▪   Patients identified a series of barriers to ART adherence, including food insecurity,
          medication side effects, long waiting times at the clinics, travel time to get to the clinics, as
          well as poor staff attitude and support. Patients also expressed concern over accidental
          disclosure from attending the clinic and being seen by the community health workers
          associated with the clinic.

      ▪   Patients identified numerous facilitators of improved adherence, including using reminders
          and cell phones for remembering when to take medications as well as disclosure of HIV
          status to those who could support them. These factors were perceived to interact, as
          disclosure could also lead to having someone who could serve as a reminder to take
          medications.

3. WHAT ARE THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF EACH INTERVENTION FOR HIV POSITIVE
      PATIENTS FROM THE PATIENT PERSPECTIVE?
      ▪   Patients at intervention sites reported that they received more counselling than at control
          sites and also reported more use of desk aids and materials at those sessions. However, staff
          attitude and the time at the clinic for these sessions was seen as a big deterrent and a risk to
          potentially losing these higher risk patients from care.




xiv
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



   ▪   Patients expressed concern that reasons for blood tests and test results may not always be
       well discussed at the clinic, and failure to give results to patients can lead to a perception
       that these laboratory tests and monitoring are not important.

    Interventions for HIV treatment initiation:

   ▪   Patients receiving FTIC reported feeling more supported by the additional counselling
       sessions that are held after initiation and indicated that this helped with adherence.
       However, poor staff attitude and service at clinics particularly around the time of initiation
       can pose a threat to patient adherence.

    Interventions for patients stable on HIV treatment and adherent:

   ▪   Having the option to pick up more months of medication at more convenient locations is
       seen by patients as a key strength of interventions and one that may improve adherence. It
       is important to ensure that issues of staffing and medication delivery are resolved.

   ▪   Patients perceive missing laboratory results as an issue, they are aware when staff do not
       have results in hand and do not appreciate when tests have to be repeated unnecessarily.

    Interventions for patients failing treatment or who missed visits:

   ▪   Patients often do not seem to be aware that they are being traced, particularly when traced
       after early missed appointments. However for the most part patients saw tracing as being
       beneficial for retention in care and encouraged greater involvement of community health
       workers and community groups.

4. WHAT ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES DO PATIENTS FEEL WOULD BE HELPFUL IN IMPROVING
    TREATMENT ADHERENCE?
   ▪   FTIC participants noted that increased support from community health workers would be
       helpful for adherence. Receiving calls and tracing from this cadre is appreciated.

   ▪   Being able to have blood draws done at ACs or the pharmacies with DMD pick up points was
       considered a key improvement to these interventions.

   ▪   Additional training for counsellors (to ensure that they are equipped to provide effective
       counselling and ongoing support) so that patients continue to feel motivated and supported
       was raised.

Adherence to HIV treatment is a complex process that isn’t well understood. Numerous studies
have evaluated barriers to treatment adherence, but few have done so in the context of an
evaluation of targeted interventions to improve adherence. The results of this mixed method study
shed substantial light on the results of the overall impact evaluation. By collecting both qualitative
and quantitative data, we were able to observe the general trends in barriers to and facilitators of
adherence within the population of the study but also get detailed information on participants’
experiences with the clinics and the interventions. As follow-up continues, we will be able to link
this data with follow up data to create a complete picture of participants’ experiences and the
reasons for the successes and failures of any of the interventions.

                                                                                                        xv
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES




KEY MESSAGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
      ► Before AGL introduction in a clinic, it is important to address some of the perceived
         clinic-level barriers to adherence, ensuring site readiness and sufficient resources so
         that providers feel engaged and empowered to implement the interventions and
         address the issues of staff attitudes towards their patients.
      ► The counselling sessions after treatment initiation are important to patients, and
         counsellors should be guided by the specific job aids and by the patients’ individual
         needs for information, as well as the general principles of good patient
         communication.
      ► Patients experiencing adherence problems and receiving EAC should feel helped by
         this additional support, with staff showing an understanding for the circumstances of
         patients who struggle to adhere. Chastising patients for not being adherent risks to
         demotivate them.
      ► It is important to promote the continued implementation of ACs alongside
         implementation of DMD, ensuring that facilities are sufficiently resourced to run
         these clubs. Some patients perceive the eligibility for ACs and DMD as an incentive to
         become stable on treatment, and the program can promote this aspect of graduating
         to efficient schemes of drug refill.
      ► While some patients prefer the option to visit a DMD pick-up point other patients
         benefited from the additional support provided by the clubs. During scale up it is
         essential that patients are given the option as to which repeat prescription collection
         strategy they prefer in order to maximise their retention in these programs.
      ► Issues around DMD implementation need to be resolved, scripting and staffing issues
         at pick-up points must be addressed to prevent patients becoming disheartened with
         this intervention, risking patient adherence and potentially returning to and causing
         further congestion at the facilities.
      ► In addition, it is important to collect accurate data on patients to be able to provide
         strong patient care. In particular we found data on tracing of patients to be limited as
         no standard register or approaches existed to track who had been traced.
         Implementing a standard register could help with better tracing of patients and
         improved retention.
      ► The study demonstrates the importance of staff orientation and training on the AGL
         interventions to maximise these powerful interventions and patient perception of
         quality care.

1 INTRODUCTION
For antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV and treatment for other chronic diseases to be effective,
patients must remain in care for long periods of time, initiate treatment as early as allowed under
prevailing guidelines, consistently achieve high levels of adherence to their treatment regimen and,
as a result, exhibit stable monitoring test results and/or treatment completion. In the case of HIV,
treatment is lifelong and requires consistent, nearly complete adherence to sustain an undetectable
viral load. Numerous studies and reviews[1–4], as well as the South African National Department of
Health’s (NDOH) own data[5], have indicated that retention in care and adherence to ART in South
Africa are sub-optimal and pose a serious threat to the long-term success of the national HIV
response.

1.1 INTERVENTION TO BE EVALUATED
To address the retention and adherence to HIV challenge, in 2014 the South Africa NDOH developed
the “National Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases (HIV, TB and NCDs)”1. The guidelines
address the provision of a minimum package of interventions to increase linkage to care, retention
in care, and adherence to treatment. They reflect a differentiated care approach which aims to
enhance the quality of the patient’s experience as well as reduce the burden on the health system so
that health system resources can be reallocated to those patients most in need. The minimum
package interventions are listed in Table 1.1, five of which are being evaluated under this study,
with a focus on HIV.

EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



Before launching nationwide scale-up of the Adherence Guidelines, the NDOH selected 12 clinics
(primary health care clinics and community health centres) for early implementation of the
minimum package for HIV patients. These sites were intended to generate information to refine the
guidelines, gain experience in implementation, and project budgetary needs. The early
implementation sites were also intended to generate data on the effectiveness of the interventions
and on how to best tailor and target them. These early-learning sites, therefore, provided a platform
upon which to build a rigorous evaluation strategy.

1.2 OVERVIEW OF THE EVALUATION STRATEGY
The overall strategy to evaluate the National Adherence Guidelines has been designed as a mixed
methods matched cluster-randomised study with 12 early learning (intervention) sites
implementing the minimum package of interventions during the early-learning phase of national
roll-out, and 12 delayed implementation (control) sites which should only implement the minimum
package interventions later during the national roll-out. All implementation of the interventions is
being done by NDOH in South Africa.

The evaluation strategy includes two parallel and complementary
studies. First, we are estimating the effectiveness of the National Adherence Guidelines on patient
outcomes in a study entitled “Evaluation of the National Department of Health's National
Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South Africa Using Routinely Collected Data”
(approved by Boston University IRB BUIRB H-34074 and University of Witwatersrand Human
Research Ethics Committee Wits Protocol M150537). This “effectiveness evaluation” (lower panel
of Figure 1.1) is a matched, cluster-randomized design in 24 clinics, 12 of which received early
implementation of the minimum package and 12 with delayed implementation serving as control
sites. Clinics were matched on clinic characteristics: total remaining on ART, clinic size, setting,
location and viral suppression. This study uses routinely collected data at sites to understand how
the minimum package changes patient outcomes.

Second, we seek to understand the implementation process in a study entitled “Process Evaluation
of the National Department of Health’s Adherence Guidelines for Chronic Diseases in South Africa”

(BUIRB H34197 and Wits Protocol M150652). Using data not routinely collected from a selection of
sites within the cluster randomized design, we can assess why the interventions worked or did not
work, for whom they worked, and what conditions are associated with greater or lesser
effectiveness. This “implementation evaluation” (upper panel of Figure 1.1) uses data collected
from patients and providers to understand the implementation process, intervention acceptability,
patient preferences and views of the intervention.

The individual adherence interventions included in the minimum package require different
implementation activities and produce different outputs and outcomes in the patient population,
but they seek to converge to improve adherence and health outcomes of the patient population at
large (Appendix 1, program logic model). Therefore, findings from the intervention effectiveness
evaluation and the implementation evaluation can be triangulated to understand overall
programmatic effectiveness of the National Adherence Guidelines and generate recommendations
for improvement as the NDOH continues to roll out the National Adherence Guidelines.

1.3 IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION AIM
The overall aim of this component of the evaluation is to understand key aspects of the
implementation of the National Adherence Guidelines from the perspective of the patients and
providers and, in the longer term, to explore how these components relate to the effectiveness of
each minimum package intervention on patient outcomes. The evaluation will describe and assess
which interventions are actively taken up by the evaluation sites, the processes by which the
interventions in the minimum package are being implemented, patients’ acceptance of the
interventions, patients’ perceptions of the quality of care associated with the interventions, and
providers’ perspectives on the experience of implementing the interventions at the site.

The objectives of this implementation evaluation are:

▪   to assess the degree to which each individual intervention in the minimum package was
    correctly implemented in accordance with national guidelines

▪   to understand the implementation strategy at each clinic and to compare the types of strategies
    used between intervention and control sites to improve treatment adherence

▪   to assess the impact of each of the minimum package interventions on perceived quality of care
    and identify factors that influence patients’ acceptance of each intervention and assess the
    impact of perceived quality of care on treatment outcomes

▪   to assess factors that influence acceptability of each intervention to providers

  AND METHODS
2.1 IMPLEMENTATION EVALUTION QUESTIONS
The four evaluation questions answered in this report include:

1. How does patient satisfaction with care at intervention sites compare to that at comparison
   sites among HIV-positive patients?
2. What are the barriers to and facilitators of ART initiation and adherence for HIV-positive
   patients eligible for each intervention?
3. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each intervention for HIV positive patients from the
   perspective of patients?
4. What additional strategies do patients feel would be helpful in improving treatment adherence?

2.2 IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION FRAMEWORK
To answer the evaluation questions, we used a mixed-methods
approach, guided by the Consolidated Framework for                      To answer the evaluation

2.3 IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION DESIGN
Embedded within the effectiveness evaluation, the implementation evaluation used a cross-
sectional design and a mixed-methods approach to collect data from a sub-sample of four
intervention and four control sites. This approach has several strengths. First, it allows for
triangulating findings from various data sources. Second, the control group allows us to
differentiate the challenges posed by the minimum package implementation from those that are
already faced by clinics. Third, because the implementation evaluation is embedded within the
effectiveness evaluation, at the end of the study we will be able to relate implementation data to
patient outcome data and observe changes over time.

2.4 IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION DATA COLLECTION
    METHODS
Using mixed-methods, data were collected over a period of four months from November 2016
through February 2017 from two main sources:

                                                           IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION DESIGN AND METHODS



1. Quantitative HIV Patient Survey: We conducted a quantitative survey among of a sample of
   patients in each of the five intervention groups at four intervention sites and among those
   eligible for each intervention at four control sites, in order to assess patient satisfaction with
   care.
2. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with HIV Patients: We conducted three different FGD types
   at each site among different patient populations: i) patients who had recently initiated
   treatment; ii) patients who were stable on treatment 3–6 months after initiation; and iii)
   patients who were unstable on treatment 3–6 months after initiation or who had missed a visit
   by more than 5 days. Focus group discussions were designed to elicit patient perspectives on: i)
   the quality and acceptability of the interventions; ii) barriers and facilitators of patient
   adherence including the interventions; iii) satisfaction and appropriateness of adherence
   services; and iv) ways to improve the interventions.

2.5 STUDY POPULATION AND SAMPLING
The eight sites included were a subsample of the 24 effectiveness evaluation sites. We purposively
selected with NDOH one pair of intervention and control sites from each of the four provinces for a
total of eight sites.

2.5.1     Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The quantitative patient survey and focus group discussions enrolled patients who either received
or were registered to receive one of the five interventions at intervention sites, or who were eligible
for the intervention at control sites.

Patients were eligible to participate in the FGD or Patient Survey if they met the following criteria:

▪   Patient at an included intervention or control site

▪   ≥ 18 years old

▪   Met the eligibility criteria for one of the five interventions in the effectiveness evaluation

▪   Attended the clinic for a visit as part of the effectiveness evaluation (intervention sites) within a
    specific time frame depending on the intervention (or control) cohort:

    -   Fast track ART initiation counselling: 3 months after ART eligibility or receiving FTIC
    -   Adherence clubs: 3–6 months after club eligibility or being enrolled in an adherence club
    -   Decentralized medication delivery: 3–6 months after delivery eligibility or being registered
        for DMD
    -   Enhanced adherence counselling: 3–6 months after counselling eligibility (i.e.,
        unsuppressed viral load)
    -   Early patient tracing: after returning to care




                                                                                                         7
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



Patients were excluded from participating in the FGD or Patient Survey if they:
▪   Did not reside in the facility catchment area

▪   Intended to transfer care to a different facility within 12 months

▪   Were pregnant and eligible for PMTCT

▪   Were unwilling to provide informed consent

2.5.2     Quantitative Patient Survey: Sampling Strategy
Patients were consented and enrolled in a quantitative cross-sectional
survey. To ensure patients could have been exposed to the interventions,            All patients
we recruited patients eligible for each intervention at intervention sites          went through a

size section below for details) between 3 and 6 months after becoming               process.
eligible for the intervention or after they had returned to care for those
patients who had missed visits. Lists of eligible patients with expected clinic visits were produced
by the research team from the TIER.Net electronic patient register and these lists were then used to
identify these patients at the clinic, club or medicine pick-up point. The study staff would then
assess and check the eligibility of those patients and if eligible begin the recruitment and consent
process. All patients went through a full informed consent process.

2.5.3     FGDs with Patients: Sampling Strategy
We identified FGD participants by reviewing records from the larger evaluation to identify patients
eligible for each intervention. Study staff approached participants at their next clinic, club or
medicine pick-up visit, gave them a brief introduction to the study and asked if they would be
interested in participating. Those wishing to participate were confirmed for eligibility and asked to
return to the clinic or other convenient location at the time of the focus group discussion. Patients
were recruited consecutively, as they arrived at the study site and met the eligibility criteria and all
went through a full informed consent process.

2.6 DATA COLLECTION, MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE
2.6.1     Quantitative Patient Survey
Survey data were captured on encrypted tablets. Electronic data files were stored on secure,
protected drives with access limited to relevant study staff. These data were then linked to
electronic medical record data collected on the TIER.Net system and relevant baseline variables (e.g.
baseline CD4 count, ART initiation dates, dates of birth, viral load results) were imported into the
final data set.

2.6.2     FGDs with Patients
Two researchers certified in human subjects protection and trained in qualitative methods
administered the focus group discussions at each site: one facilitated the discussion and the other
took detailed notes. Each focus group was scheduled for a convenient time at the clinic or other
convenient location and was conducted in a space that was accessible, neutral, safe and secure.
Upon arrival informed consent was obtained, documented and basic participant demographics
were captured. FGDs were audio recorded, translated and transcribed verbatim. Paper copies of
qualitative transcripts and notes were kept in a locked cabinet. Electronic transcripts are kept in a
password-protected file and all identifying information is excluded from the qualitative datasets.

2.7 SAMPLE SIZE
The total target sample for human subjects for the process                The patient survey

per HIV cohort) and no more than 800 patients. The sample size for        participants (at least 70

ceasing qualitative data collection).

2.8 DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION
All quantitative analyses were conducted in STATA v14. (Stata Corp). Quantitative analytics yielded
descriptive statistics for this report and are presented by intervention and control. Because the
survey data were meant to be descriptive, formal tests were not conducted. Socio-economic and
demographic characteristics of the patient population interviewed and self-reported adherence to
treatment are presented using frequencies and proportions of answers given on the patient
questionnaire.

All qualitative data were analysed in NVivo 11© (Doncaster, Australia). Coding themes were
identified a priori according to the evaluation questions and the CFIR Framework (described above).
Additional themes were included as they emerged. Three researchers coded all of the qualitative
data (FGD transcripts). We assessed intercoder agreement by calculating a Kappa coefficient and
refined the coding as necessary until agreement reached good correlation (>0.5). We then analysed
themes by intervention type and by intervention and control. Quantitative and qualitative findings
were then triangulated to answer each of the evaluation questions.

3 FINDINGS
This section first presents a description of the sample, followed by the results for each of the
evaluation questions.

3.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY CLINICS
Patient and provider data were collected from eight clinics, a sub-sample of four matched pairs from the
overall impact evaluation study sample, one pair in each district. Table 3.1 presents the eight selected
sites by district and province and the intervention allocation at these sites. As seen in Table 3.1, due to
competing priorities at the National level and separate targets to decongest stable patients out of health
facilities, DOH’s DMD implementation happened outside the confines of randomization. The result of
this was DMD implementation at some control sites and absence of DMD at some intervention sites. To
account for this, in the process evaluation we need to be cognizant of where DMD implementation has
occurred (as noted in the last column of Table 3.1). Those sites that were implementing DMD at the time
of cohort enrollment are listed below as “DMD int at enrollment”. However, it should also be noted that
one site was not implementing DMD at the time of enrollment for the effectiveness evaluation but has
since started implementing DMD (indicated below as the DMD control site with an *). As such it is
possible that even at DMD control sites some patients may have noted that they are in fact collecting
their medicines at a DMD pick-up-point. Furthermore, given the high targets that were set for DMD at
the national level, certain sites decided to take patients out of AC cohorts and move them to DMD
instead (e.g., Tlhabane and Thokozani) resulting in additional complications for the evaluation at
intervention sites implementing both AC and DMD.

3.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF PATIENTS INTERVIEWED
Table 3.3 below shows the characteristics of the 631 patients who were interviewed. We note that
because in the control sites we could not know who, among those eligible for a repeat prescription
strategy (RPCS) would have chosen AC or DMD, these patients are grouped together under the
RPCS heading. The sample was about two-thirds female (69.6%), few were married (64% never
married) and most likely to be between the ages of 30-39 (36.9%) or 40-49 (26.9%) as is typically
seen within HIV care and treatment programs. Nearly all were South African (91.6%) and half (50%)
lived in informal settlements.

Intervention and control arms were roughly balanced with respect to age and gender, though there
were somewhat more females among the intervention arm participants. We also observed some
differences in living conditions between groups with more intervention arm patients living in
formal settlements than in the control group. However, unemployment rates were very similar
between groups at between 46 and 47%.

Table 3.4 shows additional characteristics of the sample that describe measures of socio-economic
status. Access to electricity was common (92%) though access to piped water was less common
(58.6%). Only about one-third of the sample received no government grant and about one-third
said they would find it easy to access R100 if someone needed treatment. These measures were
well balanced between intervention and control sites.

The table also shows baseline clinical characteristics of the sample. Patients interviewed largely
had low CD4 counts at ART initiation, with a median of 229 cells/ml3, below the CD4 eligibility
thresholds that have been in place for some time of <350 cells/ml3 and <500 cells/ml3 that were
only recently abandoned in favour of treatment for all. Last viral load was low with a median of 124
copies/mL. These characteristics were very well balanced between intervention and control arms,

Table 3.5 below show the demographics for the focus group discussion participants. Here we have
less information as these patients did not complete a full interview. However, much like the patient
interview population, most were either 30-39 (33%) or 40-49 (33%) years old and about two-
thirds were female (64.1%).

Overall, we found that the participants in both the FGDs and the patient interview population were
broadly representative of the patient characteristics we would expect for an HIV clinic population
and were roughly balanced between intervention and control arm on baseline demographics.

Taking the two samples together, we have an appropriate sample from the two different data
collection methods at both the intervention and control sites to be able to draw conclusions.

3.3.1      KEY MESSAGES OF THE SAMPLE
i.    Overall, we have a sufficient and appropriate sample from the two different data collection
      methods at both the intervention and control sites

ii.   Qualitative data were sufficient to reach saturation and predictability at both the intervention
      and control sites

iii. Triangulating the quantitative and qualitative findings will allow us to generate
      programmatically meaningful recommendations on the scale up of the adherence strategy
      minimum package

3.4 FINDINGS FOR EVALUATION QUESTION 1
How does patient satisfaction with care at intervention sites compare to that at
comparison sites among HIV-positive patients?
In order to understand satisfaction, it is important to know the reasons people are attending the
clinic. To answer this question we collected data on clinic utilization through patient interviews.
Table 3.6 presents basic utilization patterns and an overall ranking of quality of care as experienced
at their most recent clinical visit, by intervention cohort. As would be expected, the FTIC patients
had been at the facility the shortest duration at the time of interview and came to the clinic most
often as they would not yet be eligible for multi-month scripting. The AC and DMD cohorts had been
at the clinic the longest and had the longest intervals between clinic visits. Their visit spacing was
even longer than those in the control arms (95% of AC patients and 100% of DMD patients reported
coming to the clinic every 2-3 months or less, while only 57% of those eligible for RPCS in the
control group did so). Most patients reported no other comorbid diseases, though comorbidities
were most common among those in or eligible for FTIC, TRIC and EAC as would be expected as
these patients were either new on ART (FTIC) or unstable (TRIC and EAC). Surprisingly, 16.7% of
AC and 11.3% of DMD patients also reported having hypertension, higher than in the control group
eligible for RPCS at 9.7%. For FTIC, AC and EAC, the intervention arm patients were more likely to
report having received good or very good care than the control arm, but not for TRIC and DMD. At
the same time, for both DMD and TRIC, the proportion of patients reporting bad or very bad care
was actually lower than in the control group suggesting even with DMD the perceived quality of
care was likely no worse than in the control group. This is consistent with the overall effectiveness
evaluation where we did find difficulties with DMD implementation, though these results should be
interpreted with caution as DMD was not randomized.

3.4.1      Question 1 Key Messages
i.    In general, respondents were attending facilities for HIV treatment and often at least one other
      chronic disease condition either monthly (for those in earlier stages of care) or every 2-3
      months with fewer participants attending less than every three months

ii.   Comorbidities, particularly hypertension were between 10-16% for those in repeat
      prescription strategy interventions

iii. Respondents from intervention sites generally perceived the quality of care as better or at least
      no different from respondents at control sites, with the AC and FTIC intervention cohorts
      reporting a higher level of satisfaction with care over the controls. Participants in the repeat
      prescription strategies (AC and DMD) were able to frequent the clinic less often than
      participants in the control group, with little difference in perceived quality by DMD
      participants but an improved perception of quality of care amongst AC participants.

3.5 FINDINGS FOR EVALUATION QUESTION 2
What are the barriers to and facilitators of ART initiation and adherence for HIV-
positive patients eligible for each intervention for patients on ART?
In patient interviews, we surveyed patients as to what they perceived as important barriers to and
facilitators of adherence. Table 3.7 below shows barriers and facilitators that are common to all
cohorts stratified by intervention and control cohorts. Most patients were able to get to the clinic in
less than 1 hour with between 10% and 27% reporting taking 1-2 hours depending on the cohort,
and between 1.5% and 7.5% of patients reporting taking more than
2 hours. We found little differences between intervention and             While we found no
control arm patients in terms of time to get to the clinic, with the      differences between the
exception of the TRIC cohort where 87% of intervention arm                intervention and control
patients, but only 77.3% of control arm patients reported taking less     arms for TRIC, it does

Still it appeared to be higher among RPCS control arm patients than DMD and AC patients and
highest overall among those in both the intervention and control arms for the TRIC cohort. While
we found no differences between the intervention and control arms for TRIC, it does suggest that
transport (and other) costs may be a barrier to adherence overall. Reports of childcare costs,
unpaid time off from work and other costs were rare overall.

EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



Time reported spent at the clinic was long with fewer than 10% of patients reporting spending less
than an hour in the clinic per visit with the exception of RPCS patients, where between 15% and 43%
of patients reported taking less than an hour. Those most likely to report short visits were in the AC
cohort where 42.9% of patients reported spending less than 1 hour per visit and another 38%
reported 1-2 hours per visit. For all other cohorts, longer times were more common. Still, for FTIC,
AC and TRIC patients, intervention arm patients were less likely to spend four or more hours per
visit than control arm patients. Surprisingly, about 35% of all DMD patients did report spending
four or more hours at a visit, more than in the control arm. This may be the result of cases in which
implementation of DMD was poor where drugs were not at the pick-up-point. In such cases,
patients had to return to the clinic to pick up their medications but with no prior appointment or
arrangement.

The tables below present further cost and expenses incurred for those intervention participants
enrolled in ACs (Table 3.8), for intervention participants picking up their medication via DMD
(Table 3.9) and for any participant (control or intervention) who reported receiving some
enhanced adherence counselling (Table 3.10). Among those patients enrolled in AC, 80% reported
they were able to get to the club in less than 1 hour, half of these patients still incurred transport
costs although the cost per club visit was significantly less than the cost of a clinic visit (ZAR12 per
club visit vs. ZAR20 per clinic visit) and most AC members interviewed (93%) reported that club
visits took less than 2 hours.

Slightly more DMD patients had to travel more than hour to pick up their medications, although
interestingly only 40% indicated that they incurred transport costs for these visits which was less
than AC patients. The cost in rand per medication pick up was slightly higher than AC visit and was
the same as the cost reported by DMD patients as visiting the clinic. This may be because pick-up-
points are often still at the clinic or nearby to the clinic although the same could also be true for ACs.
However the time taken to actually pick up medications is significantly shorter than a clinic visit
with 90% of these DMD patients reporting that they can pick up their medications in less than 1
hour and 100% saying it took less than 2 hours – a clear benefit of this model if implemented well.

Because EAC is required to some degree under HIV treatment guidelines, patients in both the
control and intervention arm reported receiving this counselling on the patient questionnaire and
as such we can compare related costs of this intervention in both arms (see Table 3.10). It seems
that patients requiring EAC in the intervention arm may be prioritised as over 90% reported having
to wait less than an hour for this counselling compared to 64% of control arm patients. The actual
time spent in counselling did not seem to vary between arms with 70% in each arm reporting that it
took less than 1 hour and 30% saying 1-2 hours.

Below we provide illustrative quotes that answer the specific study questions and speak to the
specific themes.

Intervention Sites
Through focus group discussions, we elicited facilitators of improved adherence. At the
intervention sites, patients noted that having support from someone to remind them to take their
pills was a strong facilitator of adherence. In particular, support from outside the clinic, particularly
from family and friends was considered very helpful in remembering to take medication on time as
illustrated in the quotes below:

           “Taking your pills on time and having someone to help you remember when it is time, or
               something that is a memory aid to remind you when it is time to take the pills.”
                                              FTIC participant

          “I second on that because support should primarily be from your family and friends. For
       instance where I live there are four of us. When one of them realises that I have forgotten they
        say “hey mam it is 7” and then I drink them. I am not scared to tell them that I go to the clinic
                                                for these pills.”
                                               FTIC participant


Thus disclosure to friends and family members was found to be a key facilitator to remaining
adherent. Interestingly, it was noted that this was particularly true early on in in the course of
treatment before patients had much experience on antiretroviral therapy and were still developing
treatment routines as would be the case for FTIC patients:

                                                                                                  FINDING



     “At the beginning I told my husband that he should check on me and remind me if I have taken
                                               the pills.”
                                           RPCS participant

Still others noted that having the support of someone who also had HIV and was taking medications
was a helpful facilitator to good adherence. Taking pills together with someone else was noted as
being supportive. It was also noted that this was helpful in supporting medication pick-up as one
could pick up medication for the other, reducing the time needed to be spent at the facility:

     “I ended up getting used to and I ended up fetching them for him and he would also fetch them
      for me when I am busy and I would pour us water and drink them together and we have been
                             doing like this up until we both got used to it.”
                                            RPCS participant

Again this was noted as being particularly important early on in the course of treatment as would
be so for FTIC patients. Others noted specific devices or approaches they used to continue to
remember to take their treatment on time as facilitators of adherence. Taking advantage of routines
and the repetitive nature of pill taking was also discussed as important for adhering to treatment.
This was noted as being important even when outside one’s normal routine:

       “I take my treatment at 8 o’clock. Even when I am at the tavern, I would go out and take my
                                               treatment.”
                                             RPCS participant

      “Suppose I take a trip, I make sure that I take the treatment either before I leave or else wrap
       the pills with a piece of toilet tissue. On my arrival at my destination, I would then take the
                                                   treatment.”
                                                RPCS participant


While such strategies were often mentioned as being helpful by themselves as aids to remembering
to take their treatment and to take it regularly, these strategies often overlapped with the helpful
nature of disclosure and the support of friends and family as illustrated by this quote:

     “In order not to miss the time for taking the treatment, I have asked my wife to remind me when
                       it is time to take the treatment. Or I also listen to the radio.”
                                               FTIC participant


While many noted specific approaches they took to taking their pills on time, still others noted fear
of the consequences of not taking their treatment as a motivating factor. This appears to be most
strongly related to patients who had already experienced the symptoms of HIV disease prior to
initiating treatment. This would be expected to be common in our sample because, as noted above,


                                                                                                         23

the median starting CD4 count at the time of treatment initiation was just above 200 cells/ml3 when
many patients would have already experienced illness related to HIV, some quite severely:

      “My nails were beginning to rot and even their colours was becoming black and showing signs
     of decay. Since I started taking the pills, I no longer experience any problem at all. I have gained
                  weight and I can see that I am adhering to the treatment as expected.”
                                                FTIC participant

Care providers also emerged as a motivating factor, encouraging patients to continue to take their
medication and highlighting the benefits of treatment. In particular, it was noted that patients
responded well to hearing that those who took their treatment regularly would feel better and be
able to engage in daily activities and improved health encouraged others to keep taking their
medicines:

      “Then they said to me … if you adhere to this treatment and take the pills consistently, you will
      quickly gather stamina. I obeyed the instructions and I saw them supporting me throughout. I
       am not afraid to take them. I know that when I take them, I would be okay. I think they have
                                      given me the greatest support.”
                                               FTIC patient

        “What actually helped me until now in taking my pills…There is a certain lady called Sister
     Hellen, she is a social worker at the clinic. Until now, that Sister … I attended class for three days
      and she has been encouraging us to take pills, take care of ourselves, eat healthy for example
       fruits, vegetables, drink lots of water and exercise. Whilst we do that, we must be taking our
     medication in the correct way, that is how we will pick up …we take them to boost our immune
      system in the body. That is what encouraged me to still be taking my medication even today.”
                                            EAC/TRIC participant


Control sites
Patients in the control sites reported similar approaches to adherence as did patients in the
intervention arm. Support from family and friends was often mentioned, again noting that having
someone else who is also infected and on treatment was a help:

     “My mother is the one who supported me, she’s been living for 14 years with this virus, she is the
                                       one who supported me.”
                                          FTIC participant

        “I am also reminded by the children. But when I am away from home, most often I am with
                                         friends who remind me.”
                                             RPCS participant




24
                                                                                                 FINDING



Also like the intervention arm, use of alarms, cell phones and other devices were mentioned as
important strategies to remembering to take medications on time.

      “I use my cell phone, it reminds me when is time to take medication at 7 in the morning and in
                     the evening it tells me that there’s something missing in my body”.
                                               RPCS participant

        “When is time to take pills, even when I’m busy with something, when I look at time there’s
                                something that just tells is time take pills.”
                                             RPCS participant

However, it was also noted that not all of the devices that people use are available to all patients in
need of adherence support. In particular, while cell phone ownership is common, it was noted that
this is not true everywhere, and therefore using cell phone reminders may not be feasible in all
areas:

       “To tell you the truth I agree … that alarm is good. Because some of us in the rural areas we
                                             don’t have phones.”
                                              FTIC participant


One difference between the intervention and control group was that several control group
participants noted simply needing to comply with what the nurses or clinical staff advised them to
do as a motivating factor, particularly if the information given was easy to understand:

      “When I come to the clinic and speak to the nurses, when they advise me to take the treatment
                                      at a particular time, I oblige.”
                                             FTIC participant

      “I would say it is about abiding by what the nurses are telling you…They do share this kind of
        information with us and it is exactly what they explained us and it has helped me take the
                 treatment as prescribed, I would be able to live like any other person.”
                                              FTIC participant

Control arm patients also noted the benefits of taking treatment as important motivators for
adhering to the treatment. In particular, the fact that those who take their treatment appear healthy
without signs of the disease was a motivating factor:




                                                                                                       25

     “They do talk about it, and they enjoy taking their medication, some even say that a person with
     HIV looks better than a person with diabetes. When people take their medication well you might
       not even believe that they are sick, because they stick to their medication and the clinic also
       makes sure that they get medication at the right time. People speak positive about it, those
      taking their medication look so healthy that some people may find it hard to believe that they
                        are actually living on medication for the rest of their lives.”
                                              RPCS participant

Still others in the control group noted a personal desire to continue living and the expected benefits
of treatment as a strong motivator for adhering to treatment:

        “Because I love life and no one else can fight for my life, I have to consider my own life, I must
                                 know what time to take them and stick to it.”
                                               RPCS participant

3.5.2      Barriers to Adherence from FGDs
Intervention sites
At interventions sites, a commonly noted barrier to adherence that participants described was the
necessity to have sufficient food to take ARVs. This barrier is one that has been found consistently
in the literature as a barrier to treatment adherence since the early days of the treatment rollout,
with some patients in our study even noting abandoning treatment because of food insecurity:

       “Many people in our households are unemployed. When you collect your treatment and take
     them home with you; when you arrive at home and take them on an empty stomach, they won’t
      have any effect. As a result you end up abandoning them. You end up no longer taking them.”
                                             RPCS participant

         “..some people do not know where their next meal will come from. I can image that burning
        sensation in the stomach so that could be an obstacle leading to them defaulting on that day
        with the hope that they will be able to drink it on the next day, they might go on like that and
                                  eventually stop taking their medication.”
                                               RPCS participant

Stigma, another barrier that has been well described in the literature, was also a common reason
that intervention arm patients noted for not adhering to treatment. This was true despite how
common HIV treatment has become and nearly a decade of experience with HIV treatment in South
Africa. In particular, patients noted a desire to keep their treatment status hidden when travelling
or interacting with people they did not know well or trust with disclosing their HIV status:




26
                                                                                                FINDING



       “Because sometimes we are staying with some people, we don’t want some people to see our
                                             medicine.”
                                          FTIC participant


While the medications used in HIV treatment have improved over time, side effects associated with
treatment can still lead to poor adherence and were raised by intervention arm participants as
being a reason for not adhering to treatment. This was particularly true in cases where the side
effects impacted their ability to carry out their daily responsibilities, especially with working.
Participants expressed that they found they received little support on how to deal with side effects:

       “And when you tell them that these tablets make you feel sick, they cause me heartburn, or I
                             become dizzy, they say that is how they are.”
                                            FTIC participant

       “No, I think there is something missing in them. They make me lose sleep and that affects my
       work, I do temp work and sometimes I cannot go to work. I feel sleepy during work. I cannot
       stand it anymore. They should have informed us or they should tell us how they will manage
                                        this. They really affect me. ”
                                              FTIC participant


In terms of treatment initiation, intervention arm patients frequently noted long wait times and the
need for waiting to complete blood work or being turned away from the clinic as barriers to
starting treatment:

       “But regarding treatment as mentioned earlier I have been back here 3 time for [unclear]. I
     arrived here around 9 and waited until 10, until 2. At 2 I would be told to go home, meanwhile I
      am absent from school, the same would happen on the next day, I was not on treatment at the
      time but I was meant to start. I gave up eventually. I asked myself who is the patient here and
       convinced myself to return the 4th time and only then did I get a chance to do a blood test.”
                                             FTIC participant


For those on treatment, staff attitude and lack of clinic staff support and understanding of the
patient’s personal situation was highlighted as a reason why patients might not discuss issues of
adherence with staff and consequently might adopt behaviours that risk treatment adherence:




                                                                                                        27
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



     “You know what brother, we are really not getting support in there. What makes our viral load
             to be high is because they are not helping us to solve the problems we have.”
                                         EAC/TRIC participant

       “And again when you have stress and you go to the counsellor, she asks you what makes the
       viral load to be high, you find that you have a lot of stress and she is not helping you instead
      asks you about the high level of your viral load. You are aware that you have too much stress
      and you started drinking alcohol, when you start talking they say stress does not do anything,
                         they are not able to talk to me in an appropriate manner.”
                                            EAC/TRIC participant


Control sites
For control arm patients, a common theme around barriers to adherence was stigma just as was
noted in the intervention arm. Some participants who said that disclosure was important to
improving adherence also noted issues with accidental disclosure that could prevent strong
adherence including issues with outreach workers. This fear of disclosure was noted as a reason for
seeking care at facilities further away from where they live:

     “Some people don’t want to disclose their status, but as soon as they go to your house people will
       notice them since they even have a uniform identifying where they come from, so it’s good for
       support but is also not good because we have people who are very ignorant when a person is
       positive they start gossiping about them, no wonder some don’t want to disclose it, even when
      they are seriously ill they will stay at home and not even go to the clinic since we all know each
     other in the community. And those people will help you and go around talking about you as well.
           That’s why you will find that a person stays at certain place but will collect treatment
     somewhere else very far and end up not having money for transport, they avoid being helped by
                                      a nurse staying in their community.”
                                                FTIC participant


Like at intervention sites, control site participants also noted that consistent access to food, travel
time and long queues at clinics were barriers to good adherence. Interestingly, participants noted
that some clinics make provisions for those who are sicker or older to shorten their wait times, but
even then it was not considered sufficient to overcome the barriers to good adherence.

     “Some old people travel by foot to the clinic on an empty stomach, they made a rule that people
      who exceeded certain age must pass to the front but you will find them waiting in queues for a
                                                 long time.”
                                             FTIC participant


While participants generally had positive things to say about the clinic staff, like in the intervention
arm, control arm participants noted that they did not always receive supportive advice from clinic

28
                                                                                                   FINDING



staff. In particular, participants noted that clinic staff were not always supportive in helping
patients understand how to deal with issues around travel and medication taking:

         “Like me right now I work in [location], my work needs me to travel. Sometimes I will be
      working very far but I will try to be late at least with 2 days not more than that. Even when you
                  try to explain to them that you had problems, they don’t understand.”
                                                FTIC participant

3.5.3      Question 2 Key Messages
i.    Patients identified numerous factors that led to improved adherence, including using
      reminders and cell phones for remembering when to take medications as well as disclosure of
      HIV status to those who could support them. These factors were perceived to interact, as
      disclosure could also lead to having someone who could serve as a reminder to take
      medications.

ii.   Patients also identified a series of barriers to ART adherence, including food insecurity,
      medication side effects and long wait times at the clinics and long travel times to get to the
      clinics and poor staff attitude and support. Patients also expressed concern over accidental
      disclosure from attending the clinic and being seen by the community health workers
      associated with the clinic.

3.6 FINDINGS OF EVALUATION QUESTION 3 AND 4
Question 3: What are the strengths and weaknesses of each intervention for HIV
positive patients from the perspective of patients?

Question 4: What additional strategies do patients feel would be helpful in
improving treatment adherence?

As they are closely related, we analyzed the data on question 3 and 4 together. We first present the
quantitative data and then follow it with information from the focus group discussions.

3.6.1      Treatment Initiation Interventions
Table 3.12 below shows the results from interviews comparing intervention to control groups in
terms of factors related to treatment initiation for those in the FTIC cohort. These are presented
among the intervention and control groups to allow for comparison across groups. Overall, we saw
little difference in the proportion of patients reporting good or very good quality services at the
time of testing, though the ratings were high overall. This was true for ratings of staff friendliness
and satisfaction with care. FTIC participants did report one fewer visit prior to treatment initiation
(median 2 vs 3) and they were about 10 percentage points more likely to say they felt involved or

individual counselling after initiation ART than those in the control group (27.3% vs 13.8%).

3.6.2       Adherence Clubs (AC) and Decentralised Medicine Delivery (DMD)
Because they both had the same comparison group, we analysed data on AC and DMD together in
Table 3.13. The benefits of being in one of the repeat prescription strategies are seen in the
frequency of pill collection. 22.6% of patients in DMD and 39.3% of patients in AC reported picking
up medications every 3 months while only 8.3% reported doing so in the control group.
Interestingly, the most common DMD pick-up point was still at the facility with 64.5% of DMD
participants collecting their medications at the facility. This is something we also noted in the
provider interviews. We also saw a fair bit of overlap in interventions as many on AC (52%) and
DMD (64%) had also registered for fast lane medication pick up and this was substantially higher
than in the control group (9%).

The lower half of the table represents questions asked only of DMD or AC participants. Overall, we
found satisfaction with AC to be high as 98.8% of those asked said
they were happy to be in a club and 96% said they were either           Self-reported
satisfied or very satisfied with receiving ART at a club. All said they

3.6.3       Enhanced Adherence Counselling (EAC)
Table 3.14 below shows the results of questions asked of the EAC cohort and their controls. The
groups were similar with respect to the number of times they had stopped taking medications since
ART initiation and with respect to self-reported adherence in the past 4 days. However, control arm
patients were much more likely to have stopped treatment for more than 4 weeks compared to
patient in the intervention arm (57.1% vs 30.0%). Those in EAC reported being twice as likely to
have attended more than 2 counselling sessions since June 2016 (19.2% vs 10.0%). The counselling
EAC members received also appeared to be more interactive than control group participants, with
cards and desk aids, flip charts and posters being much more frequently used than in the control
group. Those in EAC were also much more likely to rate their service as good or very good than
those in the control group (92.3% vs 63.7%). Still, those in the EAC group rated their adherence
after counselling about the same as those in the control group (90.9% vs 88.0% reporting very good
or always adherent).

3.6.4        Tracing and Retention in Care (TRIC)
Finally, Table 3.15 below describes the results in the TRIC cohort. Both intervention and control
groups were unlikely to report ever having been contacted by a tracer, which is consistent with
what we heard anecdotally at the clinics. Some patients were never contacted, while others were
traced but did not realize it as they confused this with other services the clinic offered. Still, those in
the TRIC group were more likely than those in the control group to say they were contacted (20.3%
vs 8.0%). For those that were traced, phone calls seemed to be the most common method in both
groups, though it was more common in the intervention arm (86.7% vs 66.7%).

3.6.5         Strengths and Weaknesses of Specific Interventions and Suggestions for
              Improvement
As part of the patient questionnaire, participants were asked generally how patient support could
be improved around ART initiation. Those attending ACs (at intervention sites) were asked about
how ACs could be improved and a similar question was asked of those who were picking up their
medications at DMD pick-up-points. Finally those who received/were registered for enhanced
adherence counselling or who were registered for tracing were asked how enhanced adherence
counselling might be improved and if there was anything that the tracers could do differently.

In focus group discussions, we asked participants about the specific interventions and the benefits
that each provided as well as ways to improve them. Below are illustrative quotes around the main
themes that participants raised alongside the quantitative responses from the patient questionnaire.
and Table 3.16 below shows the common themes that emerged.

Note: *=DMD was delivered at a number of controls sites and hence emerges as a common theme within control facilities as there
was only one site which was a control site with no implementation of DMD.

Fast track initiation counselling
Patient questionnaires
From the questionnaire, we found that around 35% of participants in the intervention arm said that
they thought that patient support at ART initiation was fine, 5% thought there should be less
counselling, while just under 30% thought there should be more initiation sessions. One fifth of the
FTIC eligible patients in the intervention arm said they thought that treatment should be initiated at
the time of diagnosis and over 30% said that staff needed to be friendlier. Open ended responses
also allowed participants to make other suggestions on how patient support could be improved at
ART initiation. Control arm participants highlighted the following aspects that could be improved,
which interestingly included a number of issues that should be addressed by implementation of the
adherence guideline interventions:

▪    Access to more than one month of medication

▪    Ensuring patient confidentiality within the clinic

▪    Helping food insecure patients with access to food

▪    Providing more information about treatment and use of more visual aids

▪    Making it easier to access medication closer to the patient

▪    Opening up more facilities

▪    Reducing waiting times at facilities and fast-tracking treatment queues

▪    Increasing the number of staff at facilities

▪    Improvement in staff attitude and communication

In the intervention arm some of the same issues were raised as areas of improvement in terms of
increasing the number of staff, reducing patient queues, providing food support and ensuring
patient confidentiality. These patients also thought that medications should be brought closer to the

patients but went further in identifying home delivery and CHWs supporting patients initiating and
taking their medication. Other suggestions for improvement included:

▪   Better education of patients

▪   Increased campaigns

▪   Targeting of certain population groups such as the young and the old so that they could access
    services outside the clinic and not have to queue

Integration of services was presented as positive with many patients feeling that the separation of
clients by service type made it easier to identify those who were HIV positive thus increasing
stigma, and therefore integration of services reduced stigma as patients were not separated by
disease.

Focus group discussions
Many of the points identified on the patient questionnaire are supported by quotes from the FGDs.
FTIC participants mentioned the counselling they received as benefits to FTIC saying that it made
them feel supported in their treatment:

     “I got support, because when I started taking the treatment, they told me about the kind of food
      I should eat. They also said that I should not indulge in unsafe sex. They also helped me realise
                                    the kind of life I am supposed to live. ”
                                               FTIC participant

Particular aspects of counselling, especially around how to keep to a schedule to take their
medication, the importance of follow-up blood tests and around the importance of reducing alcohol
use were mentioned by the participants as important parts of FTIC counselling:

     “The support they gave me by giving me a card to write down the date so that I am able to know
      that on this particular date, I am supposed to be going to the clinic to collect my treatment. By
       so doing, I think, they have given me a good support, because I am able to know the dates on
                                which I am supposed to be collecting my pills. ”
                                              FTIC participant

       “I also got support so that I could also take the treatment at the right time and after taking
     them I should give myself time to rest and not wander at night and go around drinking alcohol.
       If I was drinking five bottles of beer, I should reduce the amount of alcohol intake until I no
                                             longer take alcohol.”
                                                FTIC participant

At the same time, participants mentioned that FTIC could be improved by continuing this support
and counselling beyond the first initiation sessions:



                                                                                                          39

         “To tell you the truth, the clinic is not doing much, first day when you have to start your
       treatment, they will tell you all the facts about alcohol, but as time goes on when you collect
      your treatment, they don’t say much to remind you to keep taking your treatment well. It is not
      always they come with the strategy to help you if you can’t take your treatment as instructed.”
                                                FTIC participant

      “I think they should provide counseling not only on that day they should continue providing it
     until you feel that you have accepted your status. I don’t think they are doing that much to help
     people understand how this sickness actually works. Because immediately after finding out, they
          just tell you what you should do and what you should not do, after that they leave you.”
                                             FTIC participant


FTIC participants also noted that additional support beyond just the fast track counselling was
important to helping them adhere to treatment. In particular, they mentioned community health
care workers as being an important part of their support and appreciated receiving calls and
tracing from these cadres.

      “They must also take down our phone numbers so that they can phone us when we don’t show
         up. I often receive their calls while at work reminding about the date for collecting my
                                                  treatment.”
                                               FTIC participant

While FTIC was generally perceived as positive, participants still noted problems with blood testing
with delays in being able to access blood testing and results and the fact that blood results were not
properly explained to them. They suggested this was a common barrier to continued care and
indicated that this would be another key area for improvement:

      “I think we do not get sufficient care because it is usually full. I was supposed to do a blood test
         but they only managed to do that on Friday. They say blood cannot be stored at the clinic
       overnight so if it is full they must have other ways to take blood samples anyway. I eventually
        left the facility without doing it on that day. A week went by without doing the blood test. I
         eventually had it done after another week had passed, you see. It would be much better to
     separate us - those that come here for blood tests should be separated from those that come for
                                                  other things.”
                                                FTIC participant

     “I support what has been said. I have also been through it, actually it happens often because it is
       usually full. I have accepted that maybe it is because an elderly person works with blood. She
       takes her time and if she comes across someone she knows then they will waste time chatting
      and gossiping and when she is finished with that person she would say ‘next, and this is the last
                                           person I will see today’. ”
                                               FTIC participant

      “…they gave me the 16th of February to go for my blood samples. They won’t explain how my
     CD4 count is doing, even that paper I don’t know if it is from the lab, it has biology terms that
     we don’t know, they read it to us but we need them to explain what is happening to our bodies.
                                       They just put it in our files.”
                                            FTIC participant

Participants also noted continuity of care providers as leading to decreased quality of services
because the new provider had no history with the patient. In addition they felt that moving between
providers meant that their files and documentation of their history could easily be lost or misplaced.
They felt that seeing a consistent provider could improve adherence:

      “One thing I came to be aware of is that the results are not handled by one person. It seems like
     there are so many of them because one time when I went to collect my results, the person I dealt
          with in the past was not the one who attended to me even though she was there. It was a
       different person. You see? Things like that confuse us. It would have been better if results were
                     handled by one person … In that way none of them will go missing.”
                                               FTIC participant


Another common theme that FTIC patients expressed, along with participants in other cohorts, was
that they felt that their adherence would be better if they could get more months of medication at
once. This is of particular concern for patients in FTIC however, as these patients are only able to
access one month of medication for the first twelve months of care:
     “Yes. I think it would be better if we were given our treatment that would last for two months.”
                                              FTIC participant

Patients also expressed that treatment would be improved if they could have other ways to access
their medication:

     “I think … they could improve it by making card carrying member. Like the ones, we use on the
                                                 ATMs”
                                            FTIC participant

     “I support that, if you are unable to come then they should have a way to deliver the pills to me.”
                                              FTIC participant


                                                                                                         41

Participants also noted that specific populations needed extra help with accessing care and
adherence to treatment once they initiated. They specifically noted the young and the old as
needing specialized care:
        “A group of young people must go out and encourage people to adhere. A group of women
                            should go out and encourage people to adhere.”
                                           FTIC participant

        “Elderly men and women cannot walk or wait on the queue for a long time. With regard to
     school children, they could be easily assembled at a central place at school where we can talk to
     them as a group. It may not be possible to visit them where they normally play, because they are
     scattered all over the places; the school is an ideal place. The youth are still strong, they can visit
     the centre, and when they come here. And when they come here, there must be several rooms for
       consultation so that they don’t have to wait for a long time. They must be attended to and go
                                                  back home.”
                                               FTIC participant


Adherence Clubs
Patient questionnaires
On the patient questionnaire, just over 25% of patients who were registered for ACs said they
thought the clubs could be improved if they were held on the weekend or at different times of day
and outside of work hours. Over 15% of club participants also
suggested that clubs should have more staff and access to a nurse at
                                                                          Other patients
the clubs. In addition, they mentioned that they would prefer
having blood draws at the club rather than back at the facility.
                                                                          indicated that they

know their patients well and could run their clubs more efficiently.
There was also the suggestion that WhatsApp groups could also be created for each club which
could potentially be used to deliver results but also allow an open line on which to ask questions of
club members and staff.

Focus group discussions
In focus groups, AC participants, much like DMD participants, frequently mentioned the time saving
aspect of being in a club as an important benefit of the program

     “Before we used to go to the clinic queuing up and the procedure took a long time, you spent the
     whole day just to get [the pills]. So I think now it’s better because they have made us part of the
                                    club. You go there, collect and leave.”
                                                RPCS participant

       “I also think that where we have now been taken it’s better, there at the clinic the procedure
       was long, we would stay there for a long time, now where we have been taken to, at the club
                    when you go in just after prayer time you get your pills, you leave...”
                                              RPCS participant

The clubs were also seen as better than DMD because they could get pills for a longer period of time
which required them to come to fewer visits:

      “I see the club as being better because we are no longer queuing up, you are even able to leave
      on time, even when you are going to work you are able to get in early in the morning and then
       around 07h00 or 08h00 when they have arrived, they give you your pills and you go home or
       you go to work. So the club is better, so the ones at the pharmacies like you collect the pills at
      [pharmacy A] or at [pharmacy B] I see it being…I don’t see as being okay because here at least
                                       they give us for three months. ”
                                               RPCS participant

Participants in ACs, expressed that they found being in a club helpful. One benefit that was not
anticipated but does speak to the barriers noted above was that participant could still get their pills
even if they could not find transport to get to the clinic:

      “I think being part of a club helped. I was able to get my pills from the club when I didn’t have
        money for transport. They could give me pills for at least 2 months or even 4 months until I
                         could get money to go to the clinic as I am unemployed.”
                                               RPCS participant




                                                                                                            43
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



Some also expressed that being in a club helped with stigma because they were not getting
treatment at the clinic where everyone knew they had HIV:

     “I think the club one is great, because when we would queue up at the clinic it was too crowded,
       so like people know that the ones for room 2, that ART goes to room 2, so some people when
     they call out your name you out for the file there the person is unable stand up because you feel
      that people are watching that you are going to room 2 …the whole clinic is watching me, that
         I’m going to room 2, and they’ll end up talking about me. So at least at the club it’s better
                                because we’re few and we know each other.”
                                              RPCS participant

It is worth noting however, that not all patients at intervention sites were aware that clubs existed.
This was commonly expressed among FTIC patients, who might not yet be eligible at the time of
interview. Still, they expressed a wish that they had known about clubs earlier:

        “I also support that, I had no knowledge of clubs I only heard about it on Friday when that
                                gentleman I spoke about earlier mentioned it.”
                                              FTIC participant

      “Ok have others heard of various methods while waiting at this facility or from someone else or
       how did you receive the information you have that helps you to take your pills correctly? If we
     have this information about easier methods for receiving our medication, like what B mentioned
       a pharmacy and that the queue is shorter and it is convenient for us in terms of time and our
       health condition, is it so? Ok so it means for most us this is the first time we are hearing about
                              these methods today. We were not aware of them. ”
                                                FTIC participant

Some participants in clubs noted a benefit to those who were not in clubs, namely that it made the
clinic less congested and it provided an incentive to adhere to treatment so one could join a club:

     “I think that they have helped because they left the people whose CD4 counts are low, those who
     are not taking their pills properly on the queues, they should also push themselves, that they will
                get to where those people are at, for them to be able to get to where we are.”
                                              RPCS participant




44
                                                                                                 FINDING



In addition there was a sense of pride in being in a club because it meant one was well and taking
their medications as they should:

    “Yes, they ask themselves when we enter through the door as to why is it that you are continuing
     to that direction, you are able to see that the person is not taking the medication properly if he
     or she was taking it properly you would be continuing with me that side. You should take good
     care of yourself so that you are able to continue with me to that side. It means that I am well, I
      am on the corner of being told that I have been healed. You should eat, take the pills properly
      get out in what you are in. You see we also explain to them that they should rush to where we
                                are. So that they also reach where we are.”
                                              RPCS participant

However, some participants noted that they thought the providers should have access to more
information about their patients at the clubs so that their treatment might be more holistic and also
so that the patient themselves could note down any relevant information.

      “I request that when we come to collect the treatment, they must bring along our files, when
        they provide you with the pills, they must also explain to you what your condition is at the
      moment. They must tell you how you are progressing and what is happening. The file must be
       nearer so that you can see for yourself and also write down some of the information so that
      when you get home, you can scrutinise it on your own. They must carry along our files when
                 they give us the pills, instead of just giving us the pills and then leaving.”
                                               RPCS participant

Participants also mentioned that ACs provided a chance to get to know others who could provide
support to them:

      “My experience is that there is value for me because I have made friends at the club and again
        when we were at the club, we used to be there from the early morning and leave at 4h00
                                        without talking to anyone.”
                                              RPCS participant

     “Yes, it is not difficult when we are people with the same status we speak that we are the same,
     like when we talk like this I know that we have the same status unlike when we get to the clinic
         and we are too many with the status, and they say those that have a certain status must
     mention the challenges that they come across with in line with their disease. It was not possible
                   but when it is like this and we are like a choir, we sing the same song.”
                                               RPCS participant




                                                                                                       45
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



Other participants noted the benefits of clubs by talking with those who were in them and noted
that it both made it easier to collect pills and to get support for their care in the community or
outside the facility:

      “They help because for some the facilities are too far for them to collect their pills. The people
      that assist end up going to the homes of those people to help them. They may find that they do
         not know the time for taking their pills or how to take them. That is how they get help.”
                                             FTIC participant

Some who were not in clubs also saw them as an incentive for patients who are taking their
medications and adhering to treatment schedules:

       “These programs encourage us to take our pills, and you know you will not qualify to be in a
       club if you do not take your pills correctly. You are transferred to a club only when you take
       your pills right. I think you will not be able to collect from the pharmacy if your blood shows
                                  that you are not taking your pills correctly.”
                                                FTIC participant

One concern raised about the clubs was that it was not always clear that participants were given
the choice to join or not, which could lead to poor retention long term:

     “With me the sister just opened up the file and then said you are going to the club, then she gave
      me directions to the club so that next time when you come you just go straight to the club. You
                  are no longer queueing up, so who likes to queue up? I then agreed.”
                                              RPCS participant


Decentralized Medication Delivery
Patient questionnaires
Within the patient questionnaire, the main suggestion that patients had for DMD improvement was
to have more staff available at the pick-up points to reduce problems (16%) and to have better
locations for patients to pick up their medications (14%). Several participants suggested that they
felt the pick-up points should be open at more convenient times and provide more months of
medication. Again when given the opportunity to expand further on their responses and suggest
other ways to improve DMD most patients who responded expressed how satisfied they were and
how much they liked the service. Several of those that offered other ideas for improvement were at
sites where implementation has been challenging—participants from these sites highlighted the
need to ensure that medications were always at the pick-up-points on the required days and that
there were sufficient staff to manage the pick-up points. A number of patients indicated that they
thought there should be more pick-up points and that extended hours at those points would be
beneficial.

Focus group discussions
In focus group discussions, similar themes were identified. While DMD was not implemented in a
randomized fashion as initially planned, somewhat complicating our interpretation of the results,
those who got DMD expressed that it was helpful in supporting adherence as they could pick up
their medication less frequently and in a more convenient location:

       “Sometimes at the clinic they make things easy for us by giving us the forms to fill and then
       you’ll come back after six months for blood samples therefore you’ll be able to collect your
     medications from other places such as [Pharmacy A] or any other pharmacy of your choice near
      you …after six months you’ll come back again for blood samples and then go and collect your
                                           medication again.”
                                            RPCS participant



      “I think it helped me a lot because when I got there, I just produce my ID, they give me a two
     months subscription, I don't wait on a queue, you won’t find queues. I just go in and go out. I will
      start my work on time. Is different from the clinic, you will arrive there around 5 or 6 in the
     morning, but you will leave around three or four, you will sit and wait for your medication. This
       one is very helpful because when you are at work and ask for permission, you just go in you
     won’t find a queue, you pick your medication and go back to work. From what I’ve experience is
                                              very helpful.”
                                             RPCS participant

DMD participants frequently expressed saving time as an important strength of participating in
DMD. Many also noted that there was a benefit to other patients if they chose to get their
medication through DMD because it allowed clinic staff to focus on patients who needed more
intense care:

      “They are right because they save time and also assist in reducing the queue at the clinic. You
      also mentioned about collecting treatment without wasting time particularly by those people
                                        who are going to work. ”
                                           RPCS participant


While DMD and other repeat prescription strategies were seen as beneficial when they worked well,
in other cases, they were seen as creating difficulties for the patient in accessing their treatment.
Some expressed frustration with repeat prescription strategies if their medications were not ready
for them when they arrived and felt that care would be improved if staff ensured their medications
were ready when they presented to the pick-up point:




                                                                                                        47

      “We shouldn’t be expected to be running behind the staff. It is wrong. Whoever is supposed to
       dispatch the treatment should know what is expected of him/her that tomorrow it’s his/her
        turn to distribute the treatment. They must know the number of people who are coming to
     collect their treatment on a particular date, package the supplies accordingly and carry them to
      the dispatch area before knocking off. When we come the following day, we mustn’t be told to
       wait while they are still running around and carrying along with them the treatment on the
                       street. If a moving car runs over them, then the pills are gone.”
                                               RPCS participant

It was also noted as a difficulty if they had to get blood results and collect medication for a pick-up
point or a club at the same time as the services were not integrated. Participants expressed that the
program would be improved if blood draws could be integrated into the program:

      “When we come here to take the treatment, we must collect them over that side together with
     the CD4 count results; we should not collect them this side but the other side as well as the blood
       tests. Everything should be done that side. We should come this side only when we are sick. At
          the moment everything is done this side. When they refer us here, they waste our time.”
                                             RPCS participant

Some participants also indicated that it should be made clearer that it was possible for patients to
send somebody else to pick up their medications and should be better informed about what was
required to be able to do this.

       “After filling the form for collecting pills at the pharmacy, when you go to collect pills that’s
      when you go with your ID because they already have your information. When they ask you to
      bring your ID is because they want to see if those pills are yours. That lady was trying to say if
         you can’t collect them yourself, you can register someone who will collect them for you.”
                                               RPCS participant

In some instances, DMD was seen as providing less medication than at the clinic and therefore
participants had to get to the DMD pick-up point more often and this made the ACs more attractive
than DMD. Participants expressed that DMD would be improved if they could get more months of
medication at each pick up like they perceived was occurring at ACs:

     “So the club is better, so the ones at the pharmacies like you collect the pills at [pharmacy A] or
       at [pharmacy B] I see it being…I don’t see as being okay because here at least they give us for
      three months. Sometimes you find that you don’t have the money to go to [pharmacy B] every
          month, so at [pharmacy A] and [pharmacy B ] it seems like people are given pills for one
     month … Sometimes you don’t have money, what will you use to go to town from where you stay
      to fetch the pills? At least at the clinic they give you for three months, you stay…you know that
     at this particular time I need to have budgeted money for transport so that I may go collect the
                                                       pills.”
                                                 RPCS participant


Additionally participants also suggested that medicines could be packaged in way that made them
less noisy. This suggestion was related to the perception that if you had medications on you in a
noisy bottle people would know that you were HIV positive.

       “I would suggest they remove them in that bottle because is causes them to make noise. They
        don’t make noise when they are in a plastic bag. You can just remove them and take them.”
                                            RPCS participant



Another improvement that was suggested was greater flexibility in terms of where medications
could be picked up, particularly if a patient is travelling. Patients highlighted the benefits of being
able to go into anyone of a chain of pharmacies providing DMD or to other clinics to pick up their
medication.

       “Because you see for them to send you back I don’t agree with. Suppose I have already left for
      Vereeniging and then they send you back to go and fetch this thing, because I believe that even
      at Clicks it is only one thing that they are supposed to help me with. I have even exhausted my
      pills, I might be in Pietersburg or anywhere else. Each and every clinic is supposed to assist me,
      they must not complain about my surname, as long as I have come to collect the pills, they are
                                            supposed to assist me.”
                                               RPCS participant


Enhanced Adherence Counselling
Patient questionnaires
In our patient questionnaires, patients had some suggestions for improving EAC. Some felt that
having more sessions would improve adherence (16%), while others felt that more
information/materials were important (16%). While it was less common, some suggested that the
sessions should be longer (14%). Finally, some suggested that EAC could be improved if
participants could access counsellors outside of work hours and if the staff were friendlier. When
given the opportunity to make further suggestions about how the service could be improved, most

                                                                                                           49

who answered this question in the intervention arm said that they actually felt the service was
acceptable, two people suggested that it should be done for all patients and another suggested that
there should be a fast track queue or system for these patients to see the counsellor or nurse.

Focus group discussions
Despite the benefits seen to EAC, participants also felt that they were often chastised for not being
adherent and that this affected their care and that care could be improved if the staff were more
understanding of the circumstances of the patients and listened to what they had to say. This issue
was highlighted by both FGD participants from control and intervention sites:

        “We do not know, they’ll rather go off on you...For being honest that you forgot to take your
         medication. They take it so seriously that they go off on you. You end up been completely
                          discouraged and not go to the clinic because of that.”
                                          EAC/TRIC participant

     “Another

provide feedback on the quality of counselling that they have received perhaps via suggestion boxes:

         “They should also train the counsellors that people can never be the same and that we are
        facing different challenges. They should know that everyone has her own different problem.
       They must be there to support and not to judge because at the end of the day when you leave
       here your problem is known by a certain sister and they start looking at you and say oooh, it’s
            that one, there is no more that privacy between a counsellor and a patient, no more
                                  confidentiality to express our own views.”
                                           EAC/TRIC participant

       “Like I said, when you are done with counselling, there is something that you have to sign, it
     shows if the person is wrong or right. Then month end the management comes to collect it, then
         they can see if the person is right or wrong from the form that you signed as a patient.”

EAC participants also felt that they still had to spend a long time at the clinic to receive care and
that this was a deterrent to continuing treatment. Reducing the time that it took to complete EAC
could improve patient resuppression rates:

     “When I go to the clinic on my date to collect pills I can arrive there at four. In the morning. I sit
       on the bench so that I can be Number 5, 6 or Number 1 on queue.... But when those who take
     you to the nurses come, you will sit there and wait, they will say a person who check vitals is not
      there. There will be a nurse who feels pity for you and offer to help you even though your vitals
       are not checked. There’s a huge delay were the vitals are checked there’s nothing we can do.”
                                           EAC/TRIC participant

Several participants also highlighted how they go for blood tests but often do not get their results
which either leads to additional tests or patients perceiving that in fact these tests are not
important.

       “I also have a problem with blood samples. Ever since I started taking the pills I have taken
     blood samples but I have never received results from these samples. Each time they tell me that
                            they cannot find my blood samples, they’re lost.”
                                         EAC/TRIC participant

     “Even with the viral load and other things, you don’t understand because they take your blood
    samples and send them, sometimes the results don’t come. They won’t tell you when your results
      have arrived they will just leave you, as long as they took your blood. Because of that you will
    tell yourself that taking blood samples is not important and when the date comes to go for blood
               samples you end up not going because you don’t know the importance of it.”
                                          EAC/TRIC participant

Interestingly, patients who were receiving EAC also mentioned receiving support from others in the
clinic as being a supportive aspect of the program. This suggests that group counselling or clubs for
patients who are not adhering could have benefits for patients by bringing together patients with
similar adherence issues to come up with solutions:

      “Yes, but we do talk amongst ourselves, even during lunch time we do talk about it. It is easy to
      engage with someone who understands what you are going through, who knows what you are
     going through. It’s like talking about your pregnancy with someone who is also pregnant. So, it’s
       the same thing. It is easy. It’s easier than to talk with someone who doesn’t understand at all
               what you are go through that every night you have to take your medication.”

                                                   stable.”
                                            EAC/TRIC participant


However, other patients highlighted that having others in those counselling sessions meant they
were less likely to want to talk about their issues, especially if other staff or counsellors were in the
session and felt it resulted in confidentiality issues and a lack of trust in their counsellors:

     “Okay, the counsellor can be there, but I think when we come to counselling it must not be one
     two three, … You find that when you go for counselling and you are alone then you are able to
     talk, but now when there is three of you, you won’t be able to open up. When there is the three
     of you, you decide to show some respect and keep quiet. Our problems are not the same that is
      why when you go for counselling they must sit you down and explain to you and then you are
      also able to open up and again you need privacy because you can’t be able to talk in front of
     many people. Counselling means people should trust each other, you must trust your counsellor
                 and she must also trust you. It is not supposed to be a group like that.”
                                          EAC/TRIC participant

       “It worked for me but my problem was that she was not alone, there was somebody else and I
                        was not able to talk, I ended up bottling up many things.”
                                          EAC/TRIC participant

As was highlighted in the patient questionnaire, participants in the EAC/TRIC FGD in the
intervention arm also raised the need for and benefits of ongoing counselling. Those who had
received such counselling felt motivated and supported.

     “…you need to understand that when you go to the clinic and they find that your viral load is too
      high, they tell you that you must go to the other side and see the counsellor. When you go that
     side they ask you to draw blood and they find out that your viral load is high and then they send
      you for counselling. It is helping. That intervention is done at the clinics, like now you find that
     they have counsellors that will counsel you again, they sit you down and explain to you why you
                            have to go on the other side and see the counsellors.
                                            EAC/TRIC participant

Tracing
Patient questionnaires
While a question was asked on the patient questionnaire about how tracers might do things
differently very few patients responded with suggestions to this question. Anecdotally we know
that patients do not always realise that they have been ‘traced’ and often do not consider that they
have missed an appointment if they attend the clinic while they still have some medications
remaining, instead they interpret phone calls and SMS messages as more of a reminder. Those few
patients that did respond on how tracing could be improved indicated a preference for only being
called, rather than having home visits, being warned of a home visit and ensuring that patient
permission had been given to be traced.

Focus group discussions
Despite our inability to see much effect of the AGL early tracing model in the effectiveness study,
participants who received TRIC did seem to appreciate it. They noted that having someone come to
them in the community provided an opportunity to discuss their adherence issues and plan to
return to the clinic:

     “I recommend this strategy of tracing, because when the tracers visit your neighbourhood...you
      can speak to the people who come and trace you and check the reasons that prevent you from
      visiting the clinic. And then they would advise you to go to the clinic… I was one of the people
                                    who were traced. So tracing is right.”
                                           EAC/TRIC participant

       “I recommend this one for tracing because when they come here, the neighbour won’t know
        what they came for, may be they are here because they do house visits, house to house. The
       tracing is ok because you can talk to the people who come to do the tracing that you have a
     problem and the reason you did not go to the clinic then they can advise you to go and when you
              get here you look for a certain individual. It will help you through the process.”
                                           EAC/TRIC participant


Patients seemed to appreciate the role that community health workers play in visiting them at their
homes and providing them with information and encouragement to return to the facilities.
However, some participants noted that they felt this was not appreciated by other healthcare staff
and managers.

         “We have made a point about community based care workers. I think if they are trained
      regarding health issues they can be encouraged and if their job could be viewed as important,
      that could help us. I have noticed that their job is not taken seriously and as a result they lose
                                                motivation.”
                                             RPCS participant


                                                                                                           53
EVALUATION OF THE NATIONAL ADHERENCE GUIDELINES FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN SOUTH AFRICA: PATIENT PERSPECTIVES



Participants noted that not only do community health workers trace them if they have missed visits
but they also provide some level of education to patients. They also thought that there was
potential for community health workers to deliver medicines direct to households which they
thought would be more discreet.

      “I think community based care workers have a good job. If they come to my house no one will
     think it’s because she has brought my pills. They will probably think she is there to teach me like
                                       she does with everyone else.”
                                            RPCS participant

Even participants in other groups were aware of tracing that was being done and found it
encouraging, feeling that it would be a good way to keep people motivated to come to clinics and
adhere to their treatment.

     “Because I heard that they were taking people’s cellular phone numbers back home so that they
       can phone us. That is very encouraging. May you be around for a very long time because you
                                       know how to encourage us.”
                                            RPCS participant

Interestingly participants also recognised that the contact details they give to the clinic and not
updating these details if they change was a key challenge to this intervention:

     “Tracing is ok but the problem might be when one changes the address and does not inform that
       she has moved, let’s say you were staying at [X] and moved to [Y], when you get there they do
      not have your history and you start from scratch… What is important is that when you move,
                  you must disclose that you are no longer staying there … this will help.”
                                           EAC/TRIC participant

As in the patient questionnaire, participants had little to suggest in terms of how this intervention
could be improved although one group did suggest that a community committee might be a way to
lessen the work load on clinic staff and help with tracing those in their community:

       “…if the committee in the community can be used, it will lessen the work load of the nurses, I
      think that committees should be allowed to attend meetings that are held at the clinic so that
       nurses can inform the committee members that there is so and so that stays in room 55, this
      person doesn’t come to fetch his/her treatment. If that is the case the committee members will
      be able to identify the person because maybe they know most of the people in the community.
         Most nurses that work here in [X] don’t stay here, they stay at [Y] which means that they
       wouldn’t know the zones in [X]. I think this is one of the programs that can make work a bit
                                                  easier.”

3.6.6      Question 3 and 4 Key Messages
i.    Patients receiving FTIC report feeling more supported by the additional counselling sessions
      that are held after initiation and indicated that this helped with adherence. However, poor staff
      attitude and service at clinics particularly around the time of initiation poses a significant
      threat to patient adherence.

ii.   Having the option to pick up more months of medication at more convenient locations is seen
      by patients as a key strength of adherence interventions and one that may significantly impact
      adherence. Those patients in ACs and enrolled in DMD reported high satisfaction with these
      services in terms of convenience and saving them time and they also reported high adherence.
      However, issues with implementation of these interventions were noticed by patients and it is
      important to ensure that issues of staffing and medication delivery are resolved.

iii. Patients at intervention sites reported that they received more counselling than at control sites
      and also reported more use of desk aids and materials at those sessions. However, staff
      attitude and the time at the clinic for these sessions was seen as a big deterrent and a risk to
      potentially losing these higher risk patients from care.

iv. Counsellors may need additional training to ensure that they are equipped to deal with patient
      issues as effective counselling and ongoing support are key to ensuring that patients continue
      to feel motivated and supported.

v.    It is important that the reasons for blood tests are clearly explained to patients and that
      patients are informed of their blood test results and what these mean. Failure to give this
      information back to patients results in the perception that these laboratory tests and
      monitoring are not important.

vi. Patients often do not seem to be aware that they are being traced, particularly when traced
      after early missed appointments. However for the most part patients saw tracing as being
      beneficial for retention in care and encouraged greater involvement of CHWs and community
      groups.

vii. Patients perceive missing laboratory results as an issue, they are aware when staff do not have
      results in hand and do not appreciate when tests have to be repeated unnecessarily. Being able
      to have blood draws done at ACs or the pharmacies with DMD pick-up points was considered a
      key improvement to these interventions.

4 CONCLUSION
Sustained adherence to HIV treatment is a complex process that isn’t well understood. Numerous
studies have evaluated barriers to treatment adherence, but few have done so in the context of an
evaluation of targeted interventions to improve adherence. The results of this mixed method study
shed substantial light on the results of the overall impact evaluation. By collecting both qualitative
and quantitative data, we were able to observe the general trends
in barriers to and facilitators of adherence within the population of     By collecting both

sites although clinic-level challenges particularly related to staff
attitude and service were highlighted as an issue at both intervention and control sites. Hence care
must be taken as the National Guidelines are rolled-out nationally that any improvements in the
quality of care resulting from implementation of the interventions are not negated by failing to
address these clinic level barriers which are commonly reported.

Repeat prescription collection strategy interventions (AC and DMD) that allowed stable patients to
collect their medications at more convenient locations, for longer periods and avoiding long clinic
queues were seen by participants at both control and intervention sites as a major advantage in
terms of promoting adherence. Patients in the focus group discussions who were either new to
treatment or who had had issues with adherence and were receiving additional counselling as a
result, also suggested that these interventions would likely increase their ability to adhere to
treatment and expressed a desire to be enrolled as soon as possible in these interventions. ACs in
particular were associated with an improved perception of quality of care and patients also
recognised the benefits to clinics as patient numbers were reduced and decanted to the external
ARV pick-up points. While it was always the intention that these clubs and external pick-up points
would cater for other chronic conditions, implementation aspects of these approaches do first need
to be addressed to ensure that some of the staffing issues and distribution of medicines that have

caused challenges do not negatively impact the benefits of these strategies. Implementation of these
interventions and the decanting of patients from facilities has been a focal point for the National
Department of Health and implementing partners in priority districts during the latter part of 2016
and beginning of 2017, and when implemented properly they are well received by patients.
Consideration might also be given to expanding the services offered at these external care points,
such as the ability to get bloods drawn, to improve patient satisfaction and likely retention of
patients in care.

Individual strategies to ensure adherence have been established by many other researchers and
were highlighted in the data collected from patients as part of this process evaluation. Disclosure,
family support and methods to remember when to take medications were all highlighted as means
to improve adherence. Clinic level barriers to adherence are also fairly well established and were
expressed as challenges and causes of concern by the patient
population surveyed here. Food security and lack of access to         As follow-up of the HIV

value the services that community health workers can provide.
They also see the potential for those services to be expanded further and indicated that the value of
these healthcare providers must not be underestimated in terms of their ability to promote and
ensure adherence.

Based on the information available from this study it appears that several of the minimum package
interventions have been well received and resulted in an improvement in the quality of care and
some improvement in patient satisfaction and adherence. As follow-up of the HIV cohorts continues,
we will be able to link this data with follow up effectiveness data to create a complete picture of
participant experience and the reasons for the successes and failures of any of the interventions.

4.1 KEY MESSAGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
     ► Before scale up, it is important to address some of the perceived clinic-level barriers
        to adherence, ensuring site readiness and sufficient resources so that providers feel
        engaged and empowered to implement the interventions and address the issues of
        staff attitudes towards their patients.
     ► The counselling sessions after treatment initiation are important to patients and
        counsellors should be guided by the specific job aids and by the patients’ individual

58
                                                                                  CONCLUSION



   needs for information, as well as the general principles of good patient
   communication.
► Patients experiencing adherence problems and receiving EAC should feel supported
   by this additional support, with staff showing an understanding for the circumstances
   of patients who struggle to adhere. Chastising patients for not being adherent risks to
   demotivate them.
► It is important to promote the continued implementation of ACs alongside
   implementation of DMD, ensuring that facilities are sufficiently resourced to run
   these clubs. Some patients perceive the eligibility for ACs and DMD as an incentive to
   become stable on treatment, and the program can promote this aspect of graduating
   to efficient schemes of drug refill.
► While some patients prefer the option to visit a DMD pick-up point other patients
   benefited from the additional support provided by the clubs. During scale up it is
   essential that patients are given the option as to which repeat prescription collection
   strategy they prefer in order to maximise their retention in these programs.
► Issues around DMD implementation need to be resolved, scripting and staffing issues
   at pick-up points must be addressed to prevent patients becoming disheartened with
   this intervention, risking patient adherence and potentially returning to and causing
   further congestion at the facilities.
► In addition, it is important to collect accurate data on patients to be able to provide
   strong patient care. In particular we found data on tracing of patients to be limited as
   no standard register or approaches existed to track who had been traced.
   Implementing a standard register could help with better tracing of patients and
   improved retention.
► The study demonstrates the importance of staff orientation and training on the AGL
   interventions to maximise these powerful interventions and patient perception of
   quality care.
