       observed data of rainfall, river water levels,
       and river discharge, but change their contents

and advisories
Deciding when to issue an evacuation order has been
a serious challenge for local governments. Not only
must they confront the uncertainty often contained
in forecasting information, but they are sometimes
not very clear about what an evacuation order and
advisory really mean. In other cases, they have little
information about incoming hazards and the status
of levees and other structures.

  specific projects, technical assistance can include the dispatch of JICA experts, the training of local officials for “capacity development,” or the
  supply of equipment or financial assistance. Technical cooperation is one of JICA’s three major areas of development assistance, the others
  being provision of grant aid and low-cost yen loans.

Examples of hydrological services
related technological development:

     • Radio wave current meter

     • Image processing type flowmetry

     • Provision of river information by cellular phone

     • X-band multi-parameter rain radar for torrential
       rain

Radio wave current meter
Using noncontact type radio wave current meter,
flow measurement can be conducted safely and
continuously even at the time of a large-scale flood
with the help of recent development of technology.

             R adio wave current meter
          Ø Using noncontact type radio wave current meter, flow measurement can be conducted safely and continuously even at the time of a
            large-scale flood with a help of recent development of technology.
          Ø In the Public Works Research Institute/ ICHARM, a study on advancement of the flow rate observation using this technique is proceeding
            now.
               By emitting radio wave toward the water surface from the sensor installed on the structures such as bridges,
               It can measure the surface flow rate applying Doppler shift at the time of sending/ receiving of the wave.

The World Bank Disaster Risk Management Hub, Tokyo supports developing countries to
mainstream DRM in national development planning and investment programs. As part of the
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and in coordination with the World Bank Tokyo
Office, the DRM Hub provides technical assistance grants and connects Japanese and global DRM
expertise and solutions with World Bank teams and government officials. Over 37 countries have
benefited from the Hub’s technical assistance, knowledge, and capacity building activities. The DRM
Hub was established in 2014 through the Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming DRM in
Developing Countries – a partnership between Japan’s Ministry of Finance and the World Bank.
