             ow should Latin America define its needs for infrastructure investment?
     Box 1: H
     Fay (2000) and Fay and Yepes (2003) provided the first estimates of infrastructure investment needs in developing regions.
     Their approach was essentially a benchmarking one, using simple econometrics to examine how infrastructure spending has
     evolved over time along with income, population, urbanization, GDP composition, and other relevant determinants of house-
     hold and firm demand for infrastructure services. It then priced the investment needed to keep a similar relation as income,
     population, and urbanization increase over time.

     The main limitation of this approach is that there is no optimization. It simply prices what it would take to maintain the histori-
     cally observed (possibly constrained) relation between infrastructure and income, population, and urbanization. The approach
     does not establish a causal relationship between investments and growth, nor does it price a specific desired objective (such as
     the Millennium or Sustainable Development Goals). It is also very sensitive to assumptions about future growth rates.

     Subsequent authors (Perrotti and Sanchez 2011; Kohli and Basil 2011; Ruiz-Nunez and Wei 2015) have introduced various im-
     provements and updates to this original model, with estimates for Latin America ranging from 3.6 to 6 percent of the region’s
     GDP (box table 1). To our knowledge, however, none has been able to answer the question of optimality (the amount of invest-
     ment needed to achieve a particular growth path). CAF (2011), Powell (2013), and Serebrisky and others (2015) mostly draw
     from this body of work to conclude that the region’s infrastructure investment needs are 4-6 percent of GDP.

     Climate change considerations have also affected estimates and methodologies. Bhattacharya, Romani, and Stern (2012) esti-
     mate that Latin America would need an additional $200-300 billion a year to achieve mitigation and resilience objectives. But
     while reasonable methodologies exist to estimate the cost of low-carbon investment pathways, estimating adaptation invest-
     ment needs at the level of a country—let alone a region—is pure guesswork.

  Box 2: U
  While the scale and scope of a subsidy program are political decisions based on a city’s finances and other goals, certain tools
  can help inform choices on who should receive funding and how much they should receive. An example is a fare affordability
  index to measure the financial impact of a standard basket of transit trips—say, 45 a month for each household member—on
  various income groups. The financial impact of this public expense is often measured as a percentage of household income.
  Box figure 1 shows this approach for Buenos Aires, where the affordability of public transport was measured for an average
  household as well as for families in the lowest income quintile.

  Though this approach is helpful, there is no accepted norm for determining what share of household income spent on trans-
  port would be considered unaffordable. Affordability depends on the alternatives (the practicality of walking and cycling as
  alternatives to public transport) and other costs of living, including housing. Housing decisions, in particular, have a large
  impact, because most cities present a tradeoff between high accessibility (in the city center) and more affordable housing (in
  the metropolitan periphery). Still, the fare affordability index can help policymakers understand and articulate different sub-
  sidy levels in a structured manner. In Buenos Aires the understanding of affordability levels at different periods helped show
  that fares could be raised considerably and still be more affordable—as measured by the share of income the poorest quintile
  spent on a basket of travel—than a decade earlier.

Note: One DALY can be thought of as one year of “healthy” life. The sum of DALYs lost across a population can be thought of as a measure of the gap between current
health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age, free of disease and disability.

Some 94 percent of households have access to an im-
proved source of drinking water, placing Latin America in
the top ranks of developing regions—though still short
of the 99 percent in high-income countries (figure 15a).
Moreover, this average masks a large gap between rural
(84 percent) and urban (97 percent) coverage (figure 15b).
In fact, while coverage is lower for poor households, the
rural/urban divide trumps income as a marker for lack of
access to an improved drinking water source (figure 15c).
                                                                                                                             13
The region’s relatively high coverage is no cause for com-
placency. More than 20 million people, mostly in rural ar-
eas, lack access to an improved source of drinking water,
three-quarters of them in six countries—Brazil, Colombia,

Ecuador, Haiti, Mexico, and Peru—that include the re-
gion’s richest and poorest countries. The type of service
also differs between rural and urban areas, with 94 of the
urban population with access to water served with piped
water on their premises, but only 68 percent in rural areas                                                                                                     8

         nnovative schemes to expand sewage services across Latin America
  Box 4: I
  In Brazil, where cost is a significant barrier to the expansion of sewerage in major cities, at least three utilities have taken steps
  to create more pro-poor services. EMBASA, Bahia state’s utility, implemented an innovative program between 1995 and 2007
  to introduce “condominial” sewerage to low-income neighborhoods. This program was a city block-based approach that relied
  on community consultations to design low-cost joint sewerage facilities. It placed the responsibility for final linkups on groups
  of households rather than individual households.

  Similar schemes have been pioneered by CAESB, Brasilia’s state water utility. Under its condominial scheme, connections to the
  main public sewers are constructed after the targeted community signs an agreement setting out the rights and obligations
  of all partners. The investment cost of the system is kept low by the use of small bore pipes, starting at diameters of just 100
  millimeters (Shankland and others 2010). Another Brazilian utility, SABESP, targeted the “last mile” problem by offering sub-
  sidies and payment by installment for connecting households to sewerage services. Finally, in the state of Minas Gerais, the
  state water utility COPASA has established a subsidiary that offers pro-poor tariffication and technologies. Colombia, Peru, and
  Uruguay are also implementing projects to tackle sewerage for the poor but they have yet to develop them at scale.

  Elsewhere, public-private partnerships for wastewater treatment plants appear to be working well. A perfect example is the
  Atotonilco de Tula plant in Mexico, which treats wastewater generated in the valley of Mexico. It is 54 percent funded by the
  private sector and is operated by a private consortium. There are also examples of private businesses building wastewater
  treatment plants to make use of municipally discharged wastewater—the Enlozada-Cerro Verde treatment plant in Arequipa,
  Peru, was built and operated by the mining company Cerro Verde, which uses the treated water at its mine site.

Note: The changes are computed between the last observation and the point in time after 2009 when the lowest fiscal balance was recorded. If the lowest balance
corresponds to the latest observation, the difference was computed with respect to the point in time when the fiscal balance was closest to zero. The values for the

  Box 6: H
  Latin America is exposed to many climate risks, most of which materialize through the water cycle. These risks vary by sub-re-
  gion but also depend on climate change. Impacts are expected to increase in intensity and severity as global temperatures
  continue to rise:

   ››Most dry regions could get drier and most wet regions could get wetter. Increased rainfall in tropical and subtropical Pacific
      coastlines and southern Brazil is in contrast with decreased precipitation in the Caribbean, Central America, northeast and
      central Brazil, and Patagonia. Rainfall could decrease 20-40 percent if global warming increases 4oC above pre-industrial
      temperatures (a “4oC world”).

   ››Seasonal distribution of stream flows could become more variable. Glaciers could disappear in a 4 C scenario and suffer
                                                                                                            o

      considerable loss in a 2 C scenario. This retreat could cause glacial lake outbursts and flooding, as well as reduced water
                                   o

      runoffs in some river basins.

   ››Increased risks of droughts and extreme heat could undermine seasonal water availability. Higher mean temperatures and
      increased rainfall variability could extend dry spells and drought conditions by up to 20 percent in a 4oC scenario.

   ››More intense rainfalls could increase the risks of landslides. Excessive rainfalls within short periods could overwhelm urban
      natural drainage systems. Landslide risks are highest in sloping terrains—where poor people often live.

   ››The intensity and frequency of tropical storms will likely increase. The frequency of the strongest tropical cyclones could
      increase by 40 percent in a 2oC world and by 80 percent in 4oC world. Storms could increase coastal flooding, mostly in the
      Caribbean.

   ››Higher sea levels could cause coastal flooding and erosion. Projections vary by zone and range from an average of 0.38
      meters in a 2oC world to 1.14 meters in a 4oC world. Such extreme coastal flooding and rising sea levels could expose many
      zones to the risk of storm surges.

  Some of these risks will be conditioned by changes in ecosystems and feedback relationships. A 40 percent decrease in the
  Amazon’s forest area could be a potential tipping point at which forest-climate interactions could decrease precipitation. For-
  est cover loss is already associated with droughts in the Amazon.

          on-probabilistic decision-making under uncertainty methodologies
  Box 7: N
  Although the scientific evidence for a changing climate is clear, uncertainty about the speed and intensity of these changes is
  high. In this context it is impossible to define probabilities for future climate conditions or extreme climatic events.

  To account for these deep uncertainties, non-probabilistic approaches are needed—often called decision-making under un-
  certainty (DMU) methodologies. Rather than weighting futures probabilistically to define an optimal strategy, these methods
  seek to identify robust strategies— those that satisfy decision makers’ objectives in many plausible futures (Lempert and
  others 2013; Kalra and others 2014). These methods have been applied, for example, to define a robust portfolio of water res-
  ervoirs for implementing Lima’s long-term water resource plan (Kalra and others 2015). The basic steps include identifying all
  the possible conditions that could make a project fail, and deciding whether these are reasonable scenarios to try and protect
  against based on decision makers’ tolerance for risk, inputs from experts and stakeholders on whether the scenarios are worth
  worrying about, and the costs of robust strategies options.

  Such an approach can also help to define pathways that allow for flexibility and adjustment of the strategy once new infor-
  mation becomes available and future developments become more predictable. For example, for Lima an adaptive portfolio
  of water reservoirs was identified, starting with no-regret reservoirs to be implemented in the near term. In the medium term,
  reservoirs can be added depending on the feasibility of and necessity for more complicated projects. And in the long term,
  decision makers can choose those reservoirs that meet future water demand.

Note: The three figures show for critical segments of three major roads in Peru (Panamericana, Piura, and Carretera Central) the net present value of four possible
interventions: more frequent maintenance, increasing redundancy (for all or just some routes), and flood-proofing. The net present value of these interventions
is estimated for hundreds of possible scenarios—depicted in the many horizontal bars—that explore uncertainties around possible future flooding, damage
associated with this flooding, and time to rebuild. The net present value is calculated as the difference between the reduction in annual losses (including user costs
and rehabilitation costs) due to intervention and the investment and maintenance costs of the intervention option.

  Latin America a 52 percent score (“average/to be improved”) for renewable energy index and 41 percent for energy efficiency.
  This is better than Sub-Saharan Africa but below other developing regions, especially for energy efficiency. The index evaluates

  In its first global rollout (2015), RISE covered 14 Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Domin-
  ican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela. Most of these countries have
  introduced laws, regulations, targets, and action plans to promote renewable energy development (Haiti and Venezuela are
  exceptions). Most have also developed resource mappings and integrated renewable energy into traditional expansion plan-
  ning. But it is in the details of regulations, operational rules, and planning where countries still need progress. For example, few
  countries in the region consider renewable energy scale-up in their transmission planning, and few produce strategic plans or
  provide zoning guidance on siting, which is essential to investors.

  Most countries also need to make regulatory and policy incentives more efficient and effective, and improve the creditwor-
  thiness of their utilities to make them more attractive to potential investors. Finally, credit enhancement and risk mitigation
  instruments—such as letters of credit, escrow accounts, and payment guarantees—are needed to attract private investment
  in renewable energy, but few governments in the sample are able to offer such incentives.

  A few countries in the region have developed policies, regulations, and institutions to boost energy efficiency (Mexico, and to
  a lesser extent Brazil and Colombia). But implementation has been weak, and most has occurred in the context of crises and
  deficits in energy supplies. In addition, fossil fuel subsidies remain high in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador,

Note: SAMBA is the South America Electricity model developed by KTH Divisions of Systems Analysis. RET is a scenario with higher levels of renewable penetration
but rapid growth in demand, INDC includes all renewable additions envisaged under countries’ Intended Nationally Determined Contributions as per the UNFCCC
Paris Agreement, Disruption includes the same large-scale renewable energy as under the NDCs but much greater decentralized renewable energy and energy
efficiency, along with smart grids. ICEPAC is based on national expansion plans and demand estimates (OLADE’s Super Model). Note that for ease of comparison,
SAMBA prices were applied to the capacity expansion of ICEPAC (ICEPAC assumes much lower prices).

          he Political Economy of Reform: Conditions for Change
  Box 9: T
  A review of successful water sector reforms found that building reform momentum and sustaining service required action on
  three inter-related fronts:

   ››Build and strengthen internal capacity and culture: The technocratic and managerial skills that helped launch the
      reforms were then used to build strong staff and managers. Other managerial techniques – like performance-based
      pay, inclusive corporate strategic planning, and general transparency – also helped build and strengthen perfor-
      mance-based cultures. Utility leaders built internal capabilities and cultures that make the utility successful and lat-
      er on helps to sustain reforms. A professional culture provides a barrier against predation on the utility since, being
      anathema to professional culture, the organization itself will fight against it. Grooming future leaders and promoting
      training and development were particularly important in the cases studied. This is an indication that leadership is a
      critical variable, not solely at the outset of reforms, but throughout the life of a successful utility, particularly in a pre-
      carious macro political economy context. By creating a deep management bench, a utility reduces the risk that losing a
      leader will undo its success. A performance-based corporate culture, with an emphasis on transparency, also promoted
      reform momentum and reform resilience. A performance-based pay system – based on annual reviews against perfor-
      mance indicators derived from the utility’s overall mission, and well-defined job descriptions for staff – is important in
      many of the case utilities. Many utilities also involve all staff in strategic planning. This sets the scene for establishing
      ownership of the institution, with staff at all levels understanding, operationalizing and able to articulate the approach
      taken by the management.

   ››Forging and embedding alliances with external stakeholders: Alliances with customers, the Government, development
      partners and other stakeholders were used to build momentum for reform, and help sustain it. Utility leaders demon-
      strated a high degree of political savvy, understanding of the political and wider sociocultural context, and the ability to
      navigate competing interests in an unsettled governance and institutional environment. Alliances constructed in the mo-
      mentum phase were instrumental in maintaining reforms later.

   ››Creating and strengthening formal rules and structures (institutions): In isolation, formal rules and structures are an
      inadequate guarantee of sustained success. ‘Independent’ boards, for example, are routinely replaced by politicians, some-
      times in breach of company law. ‘Independent’ regulators may be reluctant to approve tariff increases. But when coupled
      with professionally capable organizations embedded in a web of stakeholder alliances, formal regulatory and governance
      structures can contribute to the sustainability of reforms.

          ssessing needs and proposing a pipeline – the case of Infrastructure Australia
 Box 10: A
 In 2008, in response to inadequate coordination in infrastructure planning, the Australian government created Infrastructure
 Australia (IA), an independent statutory body, whose role is to provide independent research and advice to all levels of govern-
 ment as well as to investors and owners of infrastructure on the projects and reforms Australia needs to fill the infrastructure
 gap. Its responsibilities include auditing the country’s infrastructure needs and performance, and developing a rolling 15-year
 infrastructure plan that identifies Australia’s national and state-level infrastructure priorities in transport, including energy,
 telecommunications and water. Implementation of the plan requires that the federal government and/or the sub-national
 governments subsequently make it official policy.

 Infrastructure Australia is tasked with identifying Australia’s long-term infrastructure needs through an infrastructure audit.
 This audit is based on an analysis of drivers of infrastructure demand such as population and economic growth, looks out to
 2031, and has served as a key input to Australia’s current Infrastructure Plan which contains a package of reforms regarding
 how infrastructure is financed, delivered and used.

 The strategy developed in the Plan considers a wide range of options and instruments, including institutional and regulatory
 reforms, as well as investments. The longer-term view helped move beyond the more common project-centered approach
 and enabled a more integrated view of how infrastructure across various sectors can contribute to the country’s development.
 Infrastructure Australia then developed an Infrastructure Priority List of initiatives and projects in collaboration with state and
 territory governments and industry that considers three dimensions: strategic fit, economic, social and environmental value,
 and deliverability.

 The plan identified a number of complex reforms that could deliver significant productivity benefits country-wide, but are
 politically challenging. To overcome this Infrastructure Australia proposed a three-tiered approach that called on the national
 government to leverage its investment in infrastructure to encourage state and local governments to implement the reforms
 identified in the Plan. In addition, Infrastructure Australia emphasized the need for need for early community engagement—
 which can improve the quality of planning and reduce opposition.

 Key strengths of the Australian system include:

  ››Insulation from political pressures. As an independent body, Infrastructure Australia is, in principle, insulated from the
     political process, and can therefore assess infrastructure needs and develop recommendations on the basis of objective
     criteria.

  ››A structured approach. Infrastructure Australia’s applies a sequenced and structured approach to infrastructure planning
     by framing investment choices within a long-term assessment of needs (the Audit) and a considered evaluation of the var-
     ious options for addressing those needs that is guided by a set of long-term goals (the Plan).

  ››An integrated strategy. By considering all infrastructure sectors within a single plan that is guided by a set of long-term
     ambitions, the Infrastructure Plan provides for an integrated perspective of infrastructure.

 Such a holistic and integrated approach encourages greater alignment across sectors and investments, and improves the
 scope for generating synergies.
