I. INTRODUCTION


Among other factors, transport connectivity is an essential part of the enabling environment
for sustained and inclusive growth. In developing countries, particularly in Africa, the vast
majority of farmers does not have good access to the local, regional, or global market, and
depends on subsistence farming with few advanced inputs. Limited connectivity is a critical
constraint in accessing social and administrative services, especially in rural areas where the
majority of the poor live. Africa’s manufacturing and other local businesses are also lagging
behind in the global market, except possibly for a few textiles, agrobusiness, and mining
activities (Dinh et al. 2012).


The literature is supportive of the importance of transport connectivity. In the short term,
transport costs and travel time can be reduced by improved road conditions (Lokshin and
Yemtsov 2005; Danida 2010). Over the longer term, agricultural productivity will be
increased (Khandker, Bakh, and Koolwal 2009; Bell and van Dillen 2012), and firms will
become more profitable with more jobs created (Mu and van de Walle 2011). Poverty will
then be alleviated (Dercon, Hoddinott, and Woldehanna 2008; Khandker and Koolwal 2011).


However, somewhat surprisingly, there are few global indicators that measure transport
connectivity systematically. The traditional measurements are the total length of roads and
the percentage of paved roads. The original data were sourced from the International Road
Federation and were included in the World Bank’s World Development Indicators until
recently. However, these indicators are only collected at the national level, and it has long
been argued whether they are actually meaningful for measuring development efforts made
on the ground, because they cannot provide any granularity of local connectivity, and the

indicators barely changed over time, despite significant resources spent to improve the road
network on the ground.1


The Rural Access Index (RAI) developed by Roberts, Shyam, and Rastogi (2006) is perhaps
among the most important global indicators for measuring transport sector development. The
RAI was originally defined by the proportion of people who have access to an all-season
road within an approximate walking distance of 2 kilometers (km). The original work relied
on available household surveys and other modeling techniques. Although some
methodological ambiguity remains, it was estimated that about one billion rural residents, or
68.3 percent of the rural population, were left unconnected to the road network in the world
(map 1). There is significant inequality across regions: while nearly 90 percent of the rural
population in East Asia and Pacific has 2-km access to the road network, the RAI in Sub-
Saharan Africa is estimated at only 33.9 percent.

 By definition, the total length of roads is not changed unless new roads are constructed. In many
cases, however, road projects aim to rehabilitate, maintain, or upgrade the existing road network. In
addition, even unpaved roads can be appropriate and function well. It is a matter of whether a road is
properly maintained.
                                                      -4-




Unfortunately, the RAI has not been updated since the initial work, for various reasons. For
instance, the original work used household surveys, which are normally costly to carry out.
In Roberts, Shyam, and Rastogi (2006), RAIs based on household surveys were reported only
for a handful of countries. In addition, household surveys normally do not have sufficient
spatial representativeness. In reality, rural accessibility differs significantly from one location
to another even within a country. Thus, it is difficult to have spatial representativeness when
the data are sourced from household surveys. Finally, because of the differences in spatial
representativeness and method, the measured RAIs are not necessarily comparable across
countries. As a result, there was little sustainability of regular data updates with the previous
method.


Given the renewed interest in the RAI in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs), a more sustainable and consistent method for measuring rural access has been
proposed using new spatial data and techniques.2 The SDGs aim to develop quality, reliable,
sustainable, and resilient infrastructure to support economic development and human well-
being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all (Target 9.1).


The new RAI method is conceptually the same as the previous work—that is, “share of the
population who live within 2 km of the nearest road in good condition in rural areas”—but it
uses newly emerging global data and advanced techniques. For instance, high-resolution
population distribution data, such as WorldPop, developed by the international research
community, can provide detailed information on where people live. Digitized road network
data, including road conditions, are also often available at national road agencies. By
virtually combining these data, the new method computes the RAI without counting
households on the ground (figure 1).


The new method is expected to ensure the index’s sustainability as well as consistency across
countries. Importantly, the new method allows the assessment of rural accessibility at any

disaggregated subnational level (such as districts or villages). Therefore, it is more
informative than the previous RAI and is expected to be highly relevant to road sector
operations, for instance, for road planning, prioritization, and monitoring purposes.

The current paper aims to examine what the main determinants of the new RAI are, using
subnational estimates in eight countries: Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Nepal,
Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The paper investigates correlation, not causality, but there
are several important characteristics of the measured RAI. The paper also examines
correlation to poverty. Again, causality remains open to argument. There is often
endogeneity between road infrastructure and poverty incidence, because governments may
invest more in road assets where economic productivity is already high and people are
already rich. Still, it is important to confirm that the new RAI is actually related to overall
development objectives, such as poverty reduction.


The following sections are organized as follows: section II discusses our empirical models,
section III provides the main results and some policy implications, and section IV concludes.

II. EMPIRICAL MODELS AND DATA


The new RAI is defined by the proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of the
nearest road in good condition. Road conditions are assessed in different ways, depending on
the available data in the countries. In general, the assessment is conducted based on the
surface type and roughness of each road. From an engineering point of view, the RAI only
takes into account paved roads in good and fair condition and unpaved roads in good
condition (see World Bank (2016) for further details).


Urban areas are excluded using the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project (GRUMP) data set.
The population distribution data come from WorldPop, which is available at a resolution of
100 meters and regularly updated whenever new data (such as national census data) become
available.


World Bank (2016) shows that the new RAI estimates are somewhat different from the
original estimates in 2006, mainly because of methodological differences. Among the sample
countries where results are available, rural access varies significantly, from 17 percent in
Zambia to 56 percent in Kenya and 87 percent in Bangladesh (table 1). An advantage of the
new RAI method is that the index is available not only at the national level, but also at the
subnational level. The latter is the primary data source for the following empirical analysis
(map 2).

By definition, the RAI can be decomposed into four factors: (i) number of beneficiaries
(AccessPop) per km, (ii) share of roads in good condition (GoodRdKm), (iii) rural road
density (which is defined by the total road length (TotalRdKm) divided by rural land area
(RuralArea), and (iv) population density (RuralPop / RuralArea):

The equation cannot be estimated because this is an accounting identity, which gives a
perfect fit in the log linear model. From a policy point of view, however, two terms are of
particular interest: RdDen and Quality. Important policy questions are: how the RAI could be
improved, and whether universal access (that is, RAI = 1) would be achievable. Equation 1
indicates that in principle there are only two ways to achieve universal access: (i) extending
the road network by constructing new roads or reclassifying previously unclassified roads
into the official network, and (ii) improving the quality of the existing road network through
rehabilitation or upgrading works. While the former is measured by road density (RdDen),
the latter is primarily captured by the share of good roads (Quality).


To answer these questions, the following reduced form equation is considered:


ln RAI ic   0   1 ln RdDenic   2 ln Quality ic   3 ln PopDenic   4 ln PopConcic   5 ln Urbanic  vc   ic   (2)


RAI is rural access measured in district i of country c. It is determined by road density,
RdDen, and the share of good roads in the total road length in rural areas, denoted by Quality.
Only rural areas are considered in our data. The RAI is also considered to be related to rural
population density (PopDen). It is commonly expected that the RAI would be higher where
population density is high, although it depends on the population distribution between near-
road and far-road areas, which is expected to be captured by population concentration along
the road network, PopConc. This is defined by the share of people who live within 2 km of
the road network in the total population in rural areas. Urban is the usual urbanization rate,
which is the share of urban population in the total population.


In addition, the relationship between the RAI and the poverty rate is also examined with data
from Kenya, Mozambique, and Uganda, where poverty data are available at the subnational
level:


POVic   0   1 ln RAI ic   ic
                                                                                                                         (3)
           0   1 ln RdDenic   2 ln Quality ic   3 ln PopDenic   4 ln PopConcic   5 ln Urbanic  vc   ic
                                                -9-




It is expected that poverty is negatively correlated with rural access (  1  0 ): the higher the
rural access is, the lower the poverty rate is. By using the same set of independent variables
as in equation 2, the analysis examines which element is most important or relevant to
poverty reduction.


Summary statistics are shown in table 2. The data cover 691 districts or counties in eight
countries. In these districts and counties, about 11.4 percent of the total population lives in
urban areas, which are excluded from the RAI calculation.3 In rural areas, on average there
are 236 persons per km2, of which about 61.8 percent live within 2 km along the current road
network. For road infrastructure, there are on average 50.9 km of roads per 100 km2 of land
in rural areas. About 33 percent of the rural road networks are in good or fair condition. As a
result, the RAI is on average 37.2 percent, that is, 37.2 percent of the rural population has
access to the road network in good condition.


Poverty data are only available for Kenya, Mozambique, and Uganda. On average about half
of the population lives below the poverty line. But the poverty rate varies significantly, from
nearly zero to 92 percent in the sample districts/counties.

 Technically, urban areas are spatially excluded from the RAI calculation, using GRUMP, which
develops a rural-urban distinction extent in the disaggregation process.

III. MAIN RESULTS


The ordinary least squares (OLS) method is applied to estimate equation 2. The findings
show that road density and quality are both important determinants of the RAI (table 3). The
coefficient of RdDen is significantly positive at 0.324, and the coefficient of Quality is also
significant. The latter has a greater coefficient of 0.543, indicating its relative importance for
improving the RAI. Even if the country-specific fixed effects are taken into account, the
result remains unchanged. Both are significant, and the effect of road quality is greater than
the road density effect.


The findings also show that the RAI is affected by population distribution patterns. It tends to
be higher where more people live along the road network: the coefficient of PopConc is
positive and significant. Contrary to our prior expectation, however, population density,
which is often used as a proxy to measure the efficiency of rural road investment, turned out

to be insignificant unless country-specific fixed effects are taken into account. The evidence
suggests that the RAI is determined specifically by the relative population distribution
between near-road and far-road areas, not the general population density in a broad area.


Urbanization has a positive but insignificant coefficient in the model without fixed effects.
When country fixed effects are included, the urbanization effect is significant. A possible
reason may be that the sample countries are highly heterogeneous in level of urbanization.
Technically speaking, urban areas are excluded from the RAI calculation. However, there is
normally endogeneity between urbanization and road investment: urban areas are often more
productive than rural areas, possibly because of agglomeration economies. At the same time,
urban areas often receive more investments in road infrastructure. Therefore, peri-urban areas
that are not included in urban areas tend to have high accessibility. As a result, high rural
access and high urbanization coexist.


The policy implication is complex, because the evidence indicates that the urban-rural divide
could be widened: road accessibility would likely be higher where larger urban areas exist
nearby. Thus, there is a risk that remote rural areas located away from major urban areas
would be left behind further.

One may wonder if there is any systematic difference between Africa and South Asia,
because the two regions have several different characteristics. For instance, population
density in Africa is generally much lower than in South Asia, and so is road density. The
conventional structural model is used to test this hypothesis. The test statistic is estimated at
23.32, well above the critical value, suggesting that there is a systematic difference in the
RAI determinants between the two regions.


Several specific differences are found, although they cannot be overgeneralized because our
sample of countries is limited (table 4). First, road density and quality are both important to
improve the RAI in Africa. However, road density does not matter for South Asia: the
coefficient of RdDen is not statistically significant. This may be because Bangladesh and
Nepal already have high road densities. In African countries, the current road networks may
remain to be developed.


The evidence provides different policy implications for the two regions. For South Asia, a
remaining challenge to improve rural access is primarily to improve the quality of the
                                                 - 13 -




existing road network. For Africa, where the existing road networks are often narrowly
defined, not only quality improvement, but also network expansion is needed. The road
network can be expanded by new road construction or reclassification of unclassified or
informal roads into the official network. Both options would require more resources in the
road sector and, possibly, institutional rearrangements, such as expansion of the road
authority’s responsibility.


Second, the relationship with urbanization is relatively weak in Africa, although still
statistically significant. The coefficient of Urban is 0.012 in Africa and 0.083 in South Asia.
This may reflect that Africa’s level of urbanization is still relatively low, although it is
projected to accelerate quickly in the future.

Finally, the subnational poverty rates are regressed on the RAI and other relevant indicators.
There is no doubt that poverty is relevant to the RAI (table 5). The coefficient is estimated at
-0.103.


Among the RAI determinants, road density is found to be significant, but road quality is not
correlated significantly with poverty. These results seem to be consistent with the above-
mentioned twin challenges in Africa. African countries need not only road rehabilitation, but
also network expansion. The evidence reconfirms the particular importance of road network
expansion to reduce poverty in rural areas. The poverty regression is only focused on three
countries in Africa: Kenya, Mozambique, and Uganda. Therefore, the results can be
interpreted to mean that many of the rural poor in these countries live beyond the current
road networks. Thus, significant efforts would likely be required to provide them better
access to the road network.

IV. CONCLUSION


Transport connectivity is essential to sustain inclusive growth in developing countries. Many
rural populations are still considered to be unconnected to the domestic, regional, or global
market. In the context of the SDGs, the RAI has an important role to play as a global
indicator to measure people’s transport accessibility in rural areas where the majority of the
poor live.


With sustainability of data updates, consistency across countries, and operational relevance
taken into account, a new method to calculate the RAI was developed using spatial data and
techniques. The resultant RAI estimates vary significantly across countries and across
districts in a given country. The estimates are already useful for road planning and
prioritization purposes. But an important policy question may be how the RAI could be
improved. In theory, there are only two ways: (i) improving the road condition of the existing
road network, and (ii) expanding the road network through new road construction or
reclassification.


The paper investigated the characteristics of the subnational RAI estimates in eight countries.
It was shown that road density and road condition systematically influence the RAI. For
South Asia, improvement of road condition is particularly important, possibly because road
density is already high. In Africa, road network expansion and improvement are both
important to raise the RAI. In some African countries, in fact, road classification is still
imperfect and the current road network is defined narrowly. In such a case, new road
construction and/or reclassification of unofficial feeder or local paths is needed. All the
indications are that significant resources are likely to be required to achieve “universal
access.”
