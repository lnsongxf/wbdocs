    1        Introduction
    Foreign banks can promote exports by providing trade ﬁnancing, enforcing contracts and
    reducing information asymmetries. Claessens, Hassib, and van Horen (2015) show that
    sectors that are more dependent on external ﬁnance export more when a foreign bank is
    present in the country. They focus on the ﬁnancing aspects of foreign banks, but they do
    not examine the other roles foreign banks may play in boosting exports. Indeed foreign
    banks can also reduce information asymmetries for exporting ﬁrms, especially in countries
    where there are fewer ﬁnancing constraints. These foreign banks can help ﬁrms assess the
    proﬁtability of a given product in the foreign market and provide valuable information about
    export market conditions. It is diﬃcult, however, to disentangle the information role foreign
    banks play from the ﬁnancing role.
        In this paper we examine the eﬀects foreign banks have on exports of sub-regions in
    Turkey. Turkey has experienced a large expansion in exports, growing by over 250 percent
    between 2002 and 2008. The export boom can be attributable to a variety of reason such as
    devaluation of the Turkish lira, improved macroeconomic conditions, and entry into the EU-
    Turkey Customs Union.1 The focus on Turkey allows us to isolate the bank’s information

role from its ﬁnancing role. Firstly the analysis on a single economy allows us to better
control for country-wide elements such as the quality of institutions, the rule of the law, and
political economy macro conditions that will have similar economic implications across the
sub-regions. As a result, we can focus on the local eﬀect of foreign banks on the sub-regions
exports. Secondly, and more importantly, many Turkish ﬁrms tend not to rely on external
ﬁnancing for exports, suggesting a diminished role of banks in ﬁnancing export activities in
Turkey. Acar (2009) ﬁnds that many ﬁrms (over 70%) rely on own ﬁnancing and retained
earnings –and not trade ﬁnancing or bank ﬁnancing– to fund their production activities.
Moreover, 60% of Turkish ﬁrms in 2008 do not use the common letter of credit to ﬁnance
their export activities, but rely on cash on delivery. With a smaller role in trade ﬁnancing,
foreign banks may play a larger role in providing an information channel to promote exports.
Preliminary analysis suggests that foreign banks play an important role for export promotion.
Figure 1 presents a positive correlations between aggregate exports and the local share of
foreign bank branches. The positive correlation holds even after excluding Istanbul, where
most foreign banks will be located.
    We ﬁnd that foreign banks increase the exports of sub-regions in Turkey. Controlling for
the level of ﬁnancial development and standard gravity variables, a one standard deviation
increase in the presence of foreign banks will increase the log of exports by 0.02 standard
deviations. Moreover, we not only examine the extensive margin of the information channel,
or the presence of the foreign bank, but also the intensive margin, or the footprint of these
foreign banks in the sub-regions. We show that the intensive margin of the information
channel matters for exports more than the extensive margins and the level of ﬁnancial devel-
opment. A one standard deviation increase in the shares of foreign banks in the sub-region
will increase the log of exports by 0.08 standard deviations. We also document some spillover
eﬀects of banks from countries that are neighboring the trade partner, or regional countries.
In particular, we ﬁnd that the presence of foreign banks from regional trade-partner coun-
tries can increase exports. As the footprint of these banks from regional countries increases,
exports to the trade partner decreases, pointing to a trade diversion eﬀect. The negative
eﬀects of banks from regional countries on exports are mitigated by the positive eﬀects of
bank branches from the trade partner. We ﬁnd that our results hold when we account for
the ﬁnancial crisis.
    The paper relates to two strands in the literature. First, we add to the recent growing
literature on the role of foreign banks in the economy. Giannetti and Ongena (2009) ex-
plore the impact of foreign bank lending on the growth and ﬁnancing of Eastern European
ﬁrms from 1993 to 2002. Foreign lending is related to increases in sales, assets and use of
ﬁnancial debt, with a mitigated impact on small ﬁrms. The information channel appears to


                                              2
    play an important role as young (connected) ﬁrms beneﬁtted the most (least) from foreign
    bank entry.2 Exploiting sectoral data from more than 90 countries between 1995 and 2007,
    Claessens, Hassib, and van Horen (2015) investigate whether the local presence of foreign
    banks stimulates exports. This paper is closely related to ours. Foreign banks can promote
    trade but they focus on the ﬁnancing roles these banks play in increasing exports by rely-
    ing on the sectors dependence on external ﬁnance from Rajan and Zingales (1996) in their
    identiﬁcation strategy. In contrast, our paper focuses on how the presence and footprint of
    foreign banks aﬀect the sub-national exports of one country.
        Our paper highlights the information roles foreign banks can play in promoting trade.
    Turkey presents a distinct case to examine the information role of foreign banks as ﬁrms
    in Turkey are less reliant on foreign banks for trade ﬁnancing. As discussed in Acar (2009)
    above, over 70% of ﬁrms use their own capital or retain earnings to ﬁnance production
    activities and Turkish exporters are ﬁnanced by cash on delivery.3 In fact, the survey of
    Turkish ﬁrms by Acar (2009) ﬁnds that the decline in Turkish exports during the ﬁnancial
    crisis is a result of decreases in foreign demand rather than issues with trade ﬁnance (See
    Ahn (2015) for a theoretical discussion). Demir and Javorcik (2016) also conﬁrm the ﬁndings
    in the survey with data from the Turkish Statistical Institute for a subset of exports. They
    show that in 2002 a majority of textiles and clothing from Turkey to the EU (92%) and non-
    EU countries (76%) were ﬁnanced by open account transactions and documentary collection
    methods.4 These ﬁrms do not rely on the banks to provide credit ﬁnancing.
        Second, we contribute to the emerging literature that examines how networks can over-
    come information barriers in international trade. Information asymmetries and the lack of
    information about the ﬁnal destination present large ﬁxed costs to trade, especially for ﬁrms
    exporting diﬀerentiated goods. Rauch (1999) ﬁnds that colonial ties and common languages
    between countries are more important for trade of diﬀerentiated goods than homogeneous
    goods.5 Many ﬁrms overcome these informational barriers by relying on business and so-
    cial networks to facilitate sales and increase the matches between buyers and sellers (Rauch

2
  The authors caution that the role of foreign banks may be magniﬁed by the low level of development of
  banking systems at the time of the analysis, and compounded by the limited ability of local banks to screen
  for viable loans.
3
  While the cash on delivery method is riskier for Turkish exporters, many ﬁrms do not have the bargaining
  power to negotiate better terms with their foreign partners.
4
  Open account transactions are sales where the goods are shipped and delivered before payment is due. With
  documentary collection methods, a bank collects the payment on behalf of the exporter but the banks do
  not guarantee the payment. These methods are in contrast to the letter of credit, where the bank makes a
  commitment from the importer to pay the exporter.
5
  Chaney (2008) presents a theoretical model that shows that less diﬀerentiated goods (having a higher elas-
  ticity of substitution) makes export participation or the extensive margin less sensitive to changes in trade
  barriers.

(2001)). Rauch and Trindade (2002) show that the overseas Chinese network has promoted
trade between countries with larger number of Chinese immigrants. Similarly, Combes,
Lafourcade, and Mayer (2005) ﬁnd that business and social networks play a similar role in
promoting the exports of French ﬁrms. Chaney (2014) show how networks can be incorpo-
rated into theoretical models of international trade. Our paper provides evidence on how
foreign banks create informational links between trade partners and help to increase trade
ﬂows.
    The paper proceeds in three sections. Section 2 discusses the empirical methodology and
the data used in the analysis. Section 3 presents the results on the relationship between
foreign banks and exports in the Turkish sub-regions. Section 4 concludes.


2    Empirical Methodology and Data
We examine the impact of foreign banks on Turkish international trade and in particular we
aim to focus on the information channel through which they may operate. Foreign banks
have strong ties with their parent country and are better placed to assess the proﬁtability of
a given product in that market and provide information about the export market conditions
(information channel). With respect to this channel, we explore whether the extensive margin
–the presence of the foreign bank– and the intensive margin –the footprint of the bank(s)–
are economically and statistically signiﬁcant. Foreign banks may also provide ﬁnancing for
ﬁrms that export to their home countries, which can blur the eﬀects of the information
channel. However, as discussed above, a large proportion of ﬁrms in Turkey do not use trade
ﬁnancing for their exports.
    Exporters may gain easier and better access to ﬁnance when a larger number of ﬁnancial
services is present in the sub-region in which they operate (ﬁnancing development). We
control for the level of ﬁnancial development or the amount of available ﬁnancing in each
sub-region, in order to net out the pure ﬁnancing contribution to trade. Empirical evidence
at both the aggregate and industry levels points to a positive relationship between sound
ﬁnancial markets and international trade. Using aggregate panel data of 30 years and 65
countries, Beck (2002) shows that countries with a higher level of ﬁnancial development have
(i) higher shares of manufactured exports in both GDP and total merchandise exports, and
(ii) a higher trade balance in manufactured goods. Similarly, Manova (2008) shows that
equity market liberalizations increase exports disproportionately in ﬁnancially vulnerable
sectors that require more outside ﬁnance or use fewer collateralizable assets. Addressing
reverse causality, Manova (2013) shows that more thriving ﬁnancial markets encourages
growth in international trade, rather than the other way around.

    The empirical speciﬁcation is a standard log-linearized gravity equation. We are agnostic
about the theoretical model and can appeal to the simple Armington model in Anderson
and Van Wincoop (2003). The presence and footprint of the foreign banks are introduced
in the iceberg trade cost function. The baseline speciﬁcations are as follows:

 Log(Exportsijt ) = α + β Financial developmentit + γ Trade-partner bank?ijt + Xijt δ +   ijt   (1)

Log(Exportsijt ) = τ + φFinancial developmentit + χShare(Trade-partner bankijt ) + Xijt ψ + ωijt
                                                                                            (2)
where Log(Exportsijt ) is the log of exports from sub-region i to trade-partner country j in
time t. Xijt is a vector of controls including the standard elements of a gravity equation
such as the economic size of the origin and destination economies, Log(Sub-regional GVAit )
and Log(Country GVAjt ), as well as the distance between trading partners, Log(Distanceij ),
to proxy for bilateral trade costs. Moreover it includes ﬁxed eﬀects for the sub-region,
trade partner and time to capture elements that are either time-invariant but space speciﬁc
(e.g. the quality of the institutions and infrastructures, at least over the short time period
considered) or time speciﬁc but space invariant (such as global economic trends). These
ﬁxed eﬀects will also account for the multilateral resistance terms highlighted by Anderson
and Van Wincoop (2003).
    The main variables of interest in the speciﬁcation relate to the information channel. This
is captured with two variables that will be estimated in separate regressions. Trade-partner
bank?ijt (Yes=1) is a dummy variable that equals one if a bank from the partner country j
is present in sub-region i, and it captures the extensive margin of the information channel.
Share(Trade-partner bankijt ) is deﬁned as the share of branches of the bank from the trade
partner country j in sub-region i, and it captures the intensive margin of the information
channel. Financial developmentit is deﬁned as the sub-regions level of ﬁnancial development
at time t. The coeﬃcientsγ and χ respectively capture the importance of the extensive
and intensive margins of the information channel, while β and φ reﬂect the importance of
ﬁnancial development for exports.
    Other foreign banks from the region of the trade partner may have a spillover eﬀect
on exports. Compared to more remote ﬁnancial institutions, these banks from neighboring
countries are more knowledgeable about the destination country and can likely provide in-
formation and credit to the exporting ﬁrms in the sub-region. We assess the role of having a
bank from a geographical region of the trade partner on the sub-regions exports to that trade
partner. We replace the information channel variables with similar variables that capture
the presence of a bank from the trade partners region and the number of branches these


                                               5
    banks have.
       The empirical framework is altered as follows:

    Log(Exportsijt ) = α+β Financial developmentit +γ Regional trade-partner bank?ijt +Xijt δ +            ijt

                                                                                                (3)
    Log(Exportsijt ) = τ +φFinancial developmentit +χShare(Regional trade-partner bankijt )+Xijt ψ +ωijt
                                                                                                (4)
    where Trade-partner regional bank?ijt is a dummy variable that equals one if Turkish sub-
    region i has a bank from countries close to trade partner j , and Share(Trade-partner regional
    bankijt ) is the share of branches of the bank from countries close to the trade partner. We
    consider countries that are close to the trade partner to be those within the same region as
    the trade partner.6 The other variables in Equations 3 and 4 are deﬁned as above.
        Finally, we want to distinguish the eﬀect of the information channels before and during
    the crisis. A dummy variable that captures the crisis period will be interacted with the
    variables for the ﬁnancing and information channels in the regressions. The dummy Crisis?t
    (Yes=1) takes the value one for the years 2008 to 2010, the last year in our sample. As such
    it captures the latest ﬁnancial crisis, taking into account the delay in contagion from the US.
        The analysis will use data on 26 Turkish sub-regions and 180 partner countries between
    2002 and 2010. It primarily relies on two data sources. First, NUTS 2 sub-regional economic
    data come from Celbis, Nijkamp, and Poot (2014).7 The NUTS 2 sub-regional economic
    data are collected by Celbis, Nijkamp, and Poot (2014), and provide information on the
    main variables used in the analysis. The sub-regional exports (Exportsijt ) is the total value
    of bilateral exports of sub-region i to country j at time t.8 Sub-regional gross value added
    (Regional GVAit ) is obtained from Turkstat and the trade-partner country gross value-added
    is from the UN Statistics Division.9 All three variables are measured in constant 2005
    100,000 USD. Bilateral distance between the Turkish sub-region and trade partner country
    (Distanceij ) is measured as the Euclidean distance between the most populous province of

6
  We use seven geographical aggregates, deﬁned according to the World Development Indicators. Namely,
  they are East Asia and Paciﬁc, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America and Caribbean, Middle East and
  North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa.
7
  The term NUTS stands for “Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistic” and is deﬁned in the 2002
  agreement between the Turkish authorities and Eurostat. There are three NUTS level: NUTS 1 identiﬁes
  12 regions, NUTS 2 26 sub-regions, and NUTS 3 81 provinces. The classiﬁcation is not a one-to-one map-
  ping of the administrative territorial subdivision of Turkey and is used mainly for statistical purposes and
  comparability with other EU countries.
8
  The analysis does not cover Belgium and the Islamic Republic of Iran as these countries are not available in
  the data from Celbis, Nijkamp, and Poot (2014).
9
  The sub-regional GVA data is compiled in terms of 1998 national currency. To correct for inﬂation and
  exchange rate ﬂuctuations, Celbis, Nijkamp, and Poot (2014) rely on the external currency deﬂator and the
  USD conversion rate provided by the Turkey Regional Ministry of Development.


                                                      6
     the sub-region and the capital of the partner country.10
         Second, we exploit ﬁnancial information disaggregated at the sub-regional and provin-
     cial levels from the Bank Association of Turkey.11 The data contains information on the
     number of branches of local and foreign banks and the number of loans in each Turkish
     sub-region. The deﬁnition of the level of ﬁnancial development in each sub-region (Financial
     developmentit ) is the ratio of credit to gross value added computed at the sub-regional level.
     The measure is popular in the ﬁnancial development literature. As King and Levine (1993)
     initially pointed out, the measure can be used as proxy because lending to the private sec-
     tor rather than only to government and state-owned enterprises is more likely to stimulate
     growth in the sector by promoting corporate control capacities and risk evaluations. While
     we are aware of the limitations of this variable, it is the best indicators available given the
     data and the subnational nature of the analysis.12


     3    Results
     We ﬁrst examine the eﬀects of foreign banks on exports, which are summarized in Table 2.
     The intensive margin and the extensive margin of the information channel and the level of
     ﬁnancial development positively aﬀect the exports of Turkish sub-regions. We compare the
     eﬀects of each variable on exports in separate regressions in columns (2) to (4), by examining
     the standardized coeﬃcients. A one standard deviation increase in ﬁnancial development
     leads to a 0.03 standard deviation increase in Log(Exportsijt ). Similarly a one standard
     deviation increase in the presence of foreign banks will increase the log of exports by 0.02
     standard deviations. When the share of bank branches increases by one standard deviation,
     the log of exports increase by 0.08 standard deviations. These initial regressions suggest that
     while the level of ﬁnancial development and the extensive margin of the information channel
     are equally important for exports, the intensive margin of the information channel is most
     important for exports.
         The intensive and extensive margins of the information channel remain important after
     accounting for the sub-regional level of ﬁnancial development in the regressions in the last
     two columns of Table 2. The level of ﬁnancial development is important, and as important
     as the extensive margin of the information channel, but the intensive margin of the infor-
     mation channel is more important for the sub-regions exports. All coeﬃcients for ﬁnancial
     development and the information channels are statistically signiﬁcant. The signs on the

     gravity variables are as expected: the larger the size of the sub-region and the trade-partner
     economy, the larger the exports to the trade partner; the further away in distance is the
     trade partner, the smaller the exports.
         Next we examine if there are spillover eﬀects from the banks from other neighboring
     trade-partner countries. The results in Table 3 indicates that the presence of banks from
     countries within the region of the trade partner continues to promote exports. However,
     a higher share of regional banks from neighboring countries reduces exports to the trade
     partner. The results suggest that foreign banks from neighboring countries have a trade
     diversion eﬀect, where the sub-region trades more with regional countries that have a larger
     bank presence and substitute away from trade with the trade-partner country. When both
     the shares of bank branches from the trade partner and neighboring countries are included
     in the regression, the trade diversion eﬀect is present but the presence of bank branches from
     the trade partner mitigates this eﬀect. A one standard deviation increase in the share of
     regional bank branches decreases Log(Exportsijt ) by 0.06 standard deviations. In contrast,
     a one standard deviation increase in the share of bank branches from the trade partner
     increases Log(Exportsijt ) by 0.08 standard deviations. The net eﬀect on Log(Exportsijt ) is
     positive. The role of the level of ﬁnancial development remains unchanged from baseline
     results. A one standard deviation increase in ﬁnancial development increases Log(Exportsijt )
     by 0.03 standard deviations.
         Finally the data set allows us to investigate whether the role of foreign banks changes
     as ﬁnancial conditions tighten. We include a dummy for the crisis period and interact it
     with the variables for ﬁnancial development and the information channel. Tables 4 and
     5 report the results. Again the intensive margins play a more signiﬁcant role in boosting
     trade. When the Share(Trade-partner bankijt ) grows by one standard deviation during the
     crisis, Log(Exportsijt ) increases by 0.05 standard deviation. The corresponding eﬀect for
     either the ﬁnancial development or the extensive margin is more muted at 0.01 increase in
     the standard deviation of exports.13 The results are reversed when we examine the spillover
     eﬀects of banks from the trade partners region, which is in line with the results above that
     do not control for the crisis period.
         A possible concern is the endogeneity of the ﬁnancial development as the supply and

     The result can be interpreted through the lenses of Besedeˇ   s, Kim, and Lugovskyy (2014). They develop
     a theoretical model to show that credit constraints play a key role in early stages of exporting, but not
     in later stages. The model is supported by empirical evidence from product-level data on exports to 12
     European Union members and the United States. In our case, we cannot control for the duration of export
                                                                         s, Kim, and Lugovskyy (2014). However,

     the information channel may have diﬀerential impacts on exports depending on the ﬁnancial conditions faced
     by the sub-region.

nancial development may decline if ﬁrms reduce their demand for loans because, for example,
their production falls as the economy slows down (demand channel). At the same time, a
reduction in ﬁnancial development may be due to the desire of ﬁnancial institutions to reduce
their leverage and exposure when ﬁnancial conditions worsen (supply channel). We adopt
two variables as possible instruments: the lagged value of ﬁnancial development (assuming
that only contemporaneous eﬀects matter) and Weighted domestic credit to private sector
by banks (% of GDP). The latter captures the share of domestic credit to the private sector
provided by banks, and it is weighted by the ratio of foreign bank branches to total number
of branches in the region. Ongena, Peydr´ o, and Van Horen (2015) uses matched ﬁrm-bank
level data for Eastern Europe and Turkey to show that foreign-owned banks contracted their
lending more during the ﬁnancial crisis, than locally-funded domestic banks.
    The results are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. The instruments appear highly correlated
with the dependent variable, but not uncorrelated with the error term as we reject the null
that the instruments are valid. The inclusion of the instrumental variables does not change
our results.


4    Conclusions
Foreign banks are important for trade as they provide ﬁnances and information to local
ﬁrms. By focusing on Turkey where few ﬁrms use foreign banks to ﬁnance trade, we show
the importance of the information channel that foreign banks play in promoting exports.
We ﬁnd that the presence of foreign banks will increase the exports of sub-regions in Turkey.
The exports will further increase as the footprint or share of the foreign bank branches
increases. We also show that there are spillover eﬀects from other foreign banks of countries
neighboring the trade partner: the presence of these foreign banks can increase exports to
the trade-partner country but as their footprint increases, they can divert trade and reduce
exports to the trade partner. The positive relationship between foreign banks and exports
does not change with the ﬁnancial crisis.
    These results show that aside from ﬁnancing, banks can play an important role in pro-
viding information and reducing information asymmetries for exporters. Questions remain
on what are the mechanisms by which banks transmit the information to the exporters and
whether the information from banks is unique and cannot be replicated by other agencies
such as export promotion boards and chambers of commerce. We leave these questions for
future research.
