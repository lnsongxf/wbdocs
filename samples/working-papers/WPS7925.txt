  Abstract
  In Bhutan, the public sector is usually seen as the most                           into labor force participation and the public or private
  desirable employer. This study asks if this can be attributed                      sector. The study finds that the public/private wage dif-
  to public sector employees receiving higher wages than                             ferential is sizeable but can entirely be accounted for by
  comparable private sector workers. To answer the ques-                             observable characteristics. At the same time, there is strong
  tion, the study combines an Oaxaca-type decomposition                              evidence that preferences for public sector jobs are
  of wage differentials into characteristics and coefficients                        caused by pronounced intersectoral differences in over-
  effects with a multinomial logit model for self-selection                          all compensation packages, in particular fringe benefits.

1.      Introduction

All over the world, public sector labor markets and especially the determination of wages in the public
sector have attracted a great deal of attention by both researchers and policy makers. As noted by
Gregory and Borland (1999), this attention seems to be largely due to the significant size of many
public sector labor markets and also to their fundamental differences from private sector labor
markets. With regard to wage determination, competition imposes discipline on (many) private sector
wages whereas (many) public sector wages are not governed by market forces but are instead
influenced by political developments, government priorities and similar non-market processes. In an
early contribution, Fogel and Lewin (1974) establish that de jure public sector workers in many
jurisdictions are supposed to obtain wages equivalent to those received by private sector workers
performing comparable work. While Fogel and Lewin (1974) argue that this “prevailing wage
principle” is sensible in terms of both equity and efficiency they note that de facto it is often violated.

        This study asks whether public sector wages in Bhutan follow the prevailing wage principle or
if instead systematic differences between the wages of the country’s public and private sector workers
exist. To answer this question, a three-step procedure is used that makes it possible to (i) account for
possible self-selection into labor force participation and into public or private sector work, (ii) estimate
flexible models of wage determination for the public and the private sector and (iii) investigate the
proportion of the differences in the average levels of hourly wages between public and private sector
workers that is accounted for by differences in the level of individuals’ characteristics (the
“characteristics effect”) and by differences in the impact on wages of these characteristics (the
“coefficients effect”), as originally suggested by Oaxaca (1973).

The three-step procedure reveals that average public sector wages are significantly higher than average
wages in the private sector. Quantile regressions show that the public/private wage differential is
especially pronounced in the left tail of the wage distribution. However, in the mean and across most
of the wage distribution, the public/private wage differential can entirely be accounted for by
differences in observable characteristics between public and private sector workers (in particular by
differences in the average educational attainment and industrial structure between public and private
sector). Therefore, the study finds that in the narrow sense of the word, i.e., as far as wages and not
overall compensation packages are concerned, Bhutan’s public sector does in fact follow the prevailing
wage principle. However, it has to be noted that Bhutan’s public sector workers enjoy more extensive


                                                    -2-
fringe benefits, better access to pensions and other social insurances, more job security and higher
prestige. Therefore, overall compensation packages received by Bhutan’s public sector workers tend
to be far more generous than those offered in the private sector. This also explains why for many in
Bhutan the public sector is the most desirable employer.

       This study aims to make three contributions. First, it is among the very first empirical studies
on Bhutan’s labor market and the very first one documenting patterns of sector selection, wage
structure and wage determinants. The issue of public/private wage differentials is particularly relevant
for Bhutan as the country’s public sector is not only seen as the sector of choice by many job seekers
but also large, comprising almost 50 percent of employment outside agriculture. Because three
hydropower projects currently under construction that together have a cost of 150 percent of Bhutan’s
GDP will come on stream in the coming years, incentives to expand the size of the public sector even
further are likely to rise as are incentives to increase the generosity of the compensation packages
offered to public sector workers. Second, the study adds to the literature on public/private wage
differentials in development countries. While quite a bit is known on this issue for developed and
transition economies, knowledge is still limited or even non-existent for large parts of the developing
world. Finally, by using a refined three-step procedure that combines the decomposition method
introduced by Oaxaca (1973) with the multinomial logit model for sector self-selection suggested by
Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007) the study makes a methodological contribution.

       This study is closely related to the microeconomic literature on public/private wage
differentials. Ehrenberg and Schwartz (1986), Bender (1998) and Gregory and Borland (1999) review
early contributions largely with respect to developed countries. The body of literature focusing on
transition economies is surveyed in Lausev (2014). The literature for developing countries is more
scattered. Pioneering analyses include those by Lindauer and Sabot (1983) for Tanzania, van der Gaag
and Vijverberg (1988) for Côte d'Ivoire, Stelcner, van der Gaag and Vijverberg (1989) for Peru and
Terrell (1993) for Haiti. More recently, empirical investigations of the public/private wage differential
have been conducted for Vietnam (Bales and Rama, 2001), China (Chen, Démurger and Fournier,
2005, and Démurger, Li and Yang, 2012), Turkey (Tansel, 2005), India (Glinskaya and Lokshin, 2007,
and Saha, Roy and Kar, 2014), Pakistan (Aslam and Kingdon, 2009), different Latin American
economies (Mizala, Romaguera and Gallegos, 2011), again Peru (Coppola and Calvo-Gonzales, 2011)
and a handful of other countries. As noted by Lausev (2014), the relevant literature typically finds that


                                                  -3-
average public sector wage premiums in developing countries are positive and larger than those in
developed economies.

        The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background on the economic
situation in Bhutan. Section 3 contains a description of the Bhutan Labour Force Survey (BLFS) 2014,
the data set used henceforth. The same section also introduces the analytical strategy and describes
the econometric model underlying the three-step procedure. The main empirical analysis follows in
Section 4. The section consists of four parts: First, a compilation of descriptive statistics on wages,
fringe benefits and other variables. Second, an analysis of self-selection into labor force participation
and public or private sector as well as of the determinants of wages in either sector and a
decomposition of the selection-adjusted difference in average wages between public and private sector
into characteristics and coefficients effects. Third, an appraisal of whether results are robust to
variations in the empirical setup. Fourth, similar decompositions for different quantiles of the wage
distribution. Finally, Section 5 discusses possible implications for research and policy and concludes.



2.      Background

Bhutan is a landlocked country in South Asia bordering China to the North and India to the West,
South and East. According to NSB (2014), Bhutan’s population in 2014 was around 745,000 and its
land area covers 38,394 square kilometers. Thus, Bhutan has a population in the same order of
magnitude as the Comoros or Guyana and covers a land area similar to that of the Netherlands or
Switzerland. Bhutan’s official currency is the ngultrum or Nu. The Nu is pegged to the Indian rupee at
par; in late 2014 one US dollar was worth about Nu 63.5. Administratively, Bhutan’s territory is divided
into 20 dzongkhags (administrative districts). The 20 dzongkhags are further divided into 205 gewogs
(groups of villages).

        Bhutan is maybe most famous for introducing and popularizing the concept of Gross National
Happiness (GNH), now enshrined as a principle of state policy in Article 9 of the country’s
constitution. Exact characterizations of GNH differ but one widely cited publication defines it as a
“multi-dimensional development approach that seeks to achieve a harmonious balance between
material well-being and the spiritual, emotional and cultural needs of our society” (GNHC, 2012, p.
3). Over the last decades, Bhutan has seen rapid and sustained economic growth. In 2014, its GDP
per capita reached US dollar 2,379 according to the World Development Indicators. Over the last

                                                  -4-
decades, Bhutan has also achieved broad-based and inclusive poverty reduction. As noted by NSB
and World Bank (2014), between 2007 and 2012 the proportion of the population with consumption
below the official poverty line dropped by half and Bhutan was able to practically eradicate extreme
poverty. Multidimensional poverty indices and indicators related to education and health outcomes
have also seen significant improvements.

        With regard to Bhutan’s labor market, overall conditions are more favorable in the country
than in most other South Asian economies. For instance, data from MoLHR (2015) show that in 2014
Bhutan’s overall unemployment rate stood at 2.6 percent. Besides, the gaps between male and female
labor force participation and employment rates have long been much narrower than in many other
South Asian economies. While the overall education level of Bhutan’s labor force continues to be
comparatively low, it has been improving rapidly due to a trend toward almost universal enrollment
in primary education, increasing enrollment rates in secondary education, and an ever greater emphasis
on tertiary education.

        At the same time, Bhutan faces a number of significant labor market challenges and
bottlenecks. These include high levels of informality and underemployment (in particular in rural
areas), a limited formal social protection system and relatively elevated rates of unemployment for
certain parts of the labor force, especially for young, well-educated city dwellers. Specific labor market
challenges relate to the interplay between the public and the private sector. A vibrant private sector
has yet to emerge in Bhutan. As documented in MoLHR (2015), the country’s public sector comprises
almost 50 percent of employment outside agriculture. It also employs two-thirds of workers with
tertiary education. In addition to that, the public sector is widely perceived as the preferred employer,
including among educated youth who aspire to white-collar jobs. In a recent survey among
unemployed youth in Bhutan, 50.3 percent of respondents said they would prefer to work for the
government and another 32.4 percent aspired for a job in a state-owned enterprise (MoLHR and
UNDP, 2014). Similar data from the 2014 edition of the Bhutan Labour Force Survey confirm that
the majority of unemployed persons would like to work in the public sector. Highly educated persons
are particularly keen to find a job in the public sector and the perceived superior salary, good benefit
packages and high job security of public sector jobs are cited among the main reasons for why work
in the public sector is so attractive.

       With major hydropower projects coming on stream in the next few years, Bhutan’s
macroeconomic environment is expected to change radically in a short period of time. This will
potentially exacerbate the already existing imbalances between public and private sector. The three
hydropower projects currently under construction in Bhutan together have a cost of 150 percent of
the country’s GDP. Already today, hydropower contributes 30 percent of the Royal Government of
Bhutan’s domestic revenues and this figure is expected to reach 56 percent by 2024/25. While
Bhutan’s hydropower developments are a huge opportunity for the country’s development, they also
carry risks. In particular, they are expected to lead to an appreciation of real exchange rates through
higher wages and land and real estate prices. This “Dutch disease” phenomenon will make it ever
harder for the private sector to compete in the tradable sector. Furthermore, because the hydropower
revenues will enter Bhutan through the government budget, the incentives to expand the size of the
public sector and increase public sector pay and benefits are likely to rise. This might limit
opportunities for the private sector even in the non-tradable part of the economy.



3.     Data, Analytical Strategy and Econometric Model

3.1.   Data

The analysis relies on data from the 2014 edition of the Bhutan Labour Force Survey (BLFS),
described in detail in MoLHR (2015). The BLFS is a household survey that is conducted annually by
the Department of Employment of Bhutan’s Ministry of Labour and Human Resources (MoLHR).
The BLFS covers a nationally representative sample of around 6,000 households in all 20 dzongkhags
of Bhutan. As Bhutan’s urban residents are more heterogeneous than its rural population and
economic activities in urban centers are more diverse, urban households are oversampled. In 2014,
the BLFS covered 1,479 rural and 4,440 urban households for a total sample of 5,919 households. On
average, sampled households contained about four household members resulting in a total sample size
of 23,587 individuals.

       In each household covered in the BLFS, all questions are answered by one respondent, often
the household head. Respondents are questioned about variables concerning the household as a whole
and about socio-demographic and work-related characteristics of all household members. Together
with items on labor force participation, the core of the BLFS questionnaire encompasses questions
related to the household members’ current work status and employment history. An additional module

                                                 -6-
covers housing and asset ownership, risks and coping mechanisms, and coverage of social protection
programs on the household level. Interviews were done in December 2014 and January 2015. For the
first time for a large-scale household survey in Bhutan, tablet-based computer-assisted personal
interviews (CAPI) were conducted. The objective was to improve data quality and streamline data
analysis. As another measure to assure high data quality, all respondents were asked for their cellphone
numbers and during a meticulous data cleaning exercise these numbers were used to reach out to
respondents in case any inconsistencies or missing values had been discovered in the raw BLFS data.1

         The BLFS contains information on household members’ monthly earnings and weekly hours.
Both variables are available for dependent as well as own-account workers. Under the assumption that
each month consists of 4.35 weeks this makes it possible to construct a measure for hourly wages.2
The survey also ascertains whether a worker is employed in the civil service, other government
agencies, the armed forces or state-owned enterprises (which following ILO, 2009, together constitute
the public sector), in agriculture or private enterprises (defined henceforth as the private sector) or by
a non-governmental organization, international non-governmental organization or community service
organization (a very small group of workers that is henceforth disregarded).

         Additionally, the 2014 edition of the BLFS questions respondents about a wide range of
household members’ individual characteristics useful for an analysis of wages. These include
information on labor market characteristics such as whether an individual is a regular paid employee,
casually paid employee, contract worker, own-account worker or unpaid family worker. Henceforth,
unpaid family workers and/or workers for whom an hourly wage cannot be discerned will not be
considered. Comprehensive sectoral information is also available in the BLFS. For the purpose of this
study, this information is aggregated to the level of 16 broad sectors according to the ISIC Rev. 3
classification (agriculture, hunting and forestry; fishing; mining and quarrying; manufacturing;
electricity, gas and water supply; construction; wholesale and retail trade; hotels and restaurants;



         1   To verify the reliability of the BLFS data, Appendix A compares size, structure and annual average pay of
Bhutan’s civil service according to the BLFS with administrative data from the country’s Royal Civil Service Commission
(RCSC, 2014, 2015). While some noteworthy discrepancies between the civil service employment structure according to
the BLFS data and RCSC (2014) can be documented, the overall size, structure and annual average pay of the civil service
is similar according to both sources.
           2 Implicitly, the construction of the measure for hourly wages assumes equal pay structures in the public and the

private sectors. Alternative computations not reported here but available upon request document that the main results of
Section 4 are robust to instead constructing the wage variable under the assumption that a month consists of four weeks
for public sector workers and 4.5 weeks for private sector workers (or vice versa).

        Information on socio-demographic characteristics, such as individuals’ age and education are
included in the BLFS as well. This allows the construction of a variable for potential labor market
experience. Information on an individual’s location (dzongkhag and urban or rural area) and his or her
gender and nationality (Bhutanese or not) can also be used. Lastly, the questionnaire contains a series
of questions on households’ wealth and exact demographic composition. For precise definitions of all
variables used in the empirical analysis of Section 4, cf. Table 1.



3.2.    Analytical Strategy and Econometric Model

The microeconomic literature has used a wide range of methods to investigate wage differentials
between public and private sector workers (cf. Lausev, 2014, for an overview). Among the most
commonly used methods are “single equation” models and “double equation” models. Single equation
models are basically wage regressions in the tradition of Mincer (1974) for the whole economy that
include a public sector dummy variable. For double equation models separate wage regressions are
run for the public and private sector samples. The main advantage of single equation models is that
they make corrections for self-selection into labor force participation and specific sectors
straightforward. In the context of analyzing wage differentials between public and private sector,
controlling for such self-selection is of paramount importance. On the other hand, double equation
models are more flexible and allow intercepts and returns to productive characteristics to differ across
sectors. They can also be an intermediate step for counterfactual decompositions, i.e., for an
investigation of the proportion of the differences in the average levels of hourly wages between public
and private sector workers that is accounted for by differences in the level of individuals’
characteristics (the “characteristics effect”) and by differences in the impact on earnings of these
characteristics (the “coefficients effect”) as originally suggested by Oaxaca (1973).3




         3 The Oaxaca type decomposition was originally introduced to study racial or gender wage differentials. It has

since been applied to many other areas.

        Here, a procedure is used that combines the decomposition method introduced by Oaxaca
(1973) based on a double equation model with the multinomial logit model for sector self-selection
suggested by Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007):4 The combined procedure makes it possible
to account for possible self-selection into labor force participation and into public or private sector
work in a straightforward way, to estimate a flexible double equation model and to conduct a
counterfactual decomposition of the wage differential between public and private sector. It consists
of three steps: In the first step, a multinomial logit model for simultaneous selection into labor force
participation and into the public or private sector is estimated. Second, the correlates of log hourly
wages are estimated separately for public and private sector workers. Finally, the difference in mean
hourly wages of the two groups is decomposed into characteristics and coefficients effects.

        The basic model for steps one and two is given by

        (1)                    and
              ∗
        (2)                    .

                                                                                                            ∗
or inactivity),    refers to the wage associated with work in a specific sector of employment,                  is a
discrete choice variable that indicates the choice of a sector of employment.             and     are vectors of
demographic, institutional, regional or labor-related explanatory variables.           and      are error terms.
Equation (1) is a wage equation in the tradition of Mincer (1974) and equation (2) an equation for
simultaneous choice of labor force participation and sector.

        In the most basic double equation model, wage equations for the public and the private sector
are estimated separately and without consideration for sector self-selection. However, if individuals
have unobserved characteristics that affect both their choice of employment and their wages, then the
error terms       and     will be correlated and estimates of         that do not account for self-selection
biased and inconsistent. To correct for this potential inconsistency, applied research has traditionally
employed the bias correction method embedded in Lee’s (1983) extension of the Heckman (1979)




        4A combination of the selection correction strategy by Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007) and
decomposition by Oaxaca (1973) has previously been used in similar form by a small number of studies, including by
Chen, Démurger and Fournier (2007). The exposition of this section draws on Bhaumik, Gang and Yun (2006),
Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007), Dimova and Gang (2007) and Gang and Schmillen (2014).

two-stage selection model to the multinomial logit case. The advantage of Lee’s (1983) approach is
that it is fairly simple. It requires the estimation of only one correction term. However, Bourguignon,
Fournier and Gurgand (2007) note that this simplicity is achieved at the cost of relatively restrictive
assumptions. They use Monte Carlo methods to show that a variation of the selection-correction
approach suggested by Dubin and McFadden (1984) performs better in practice.

          The approach proposed by Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007) is again based on a
multinomial logit model. Its central feature is that it takes the correlation between the disturbance
terms from each wage equation and the disturbance terms from each multinomial logit equation
(namely the terms       and     ) explicitly into account. This link is incorporated by assuming a linear
association between           and   . After further assuming that the Independence of Irrelevant
Alternatives (IIA) hypothesis holds and performing a number of algebraic manipulations,
Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007) propose the following selection-corrected variant of
equation (1):

          (3)                               ∑     … |                          ,

where       is the probability of self-selection into sector   and the	      e are bias correction terms.
While the           have no closed form they can be computed numerically after the multinomial logit
estimation. Moreover, Dimova and Gang (2007) point out that as the number of bias correction terms
in this equation is equal to the number of multinomial logit choices one can identify not only the
direction of the bias related to the allocation of individuals in a specific sector but also which choice
among any two alternative sectors this bias stems from. For instance, a positive bias correction
coefficient related to the private sector selection equation in the public sector wage equation highlights
higher wages of individuals in the public sector compared to individuals taken at random due to the
allocation of people with less favorable unobserved skills out of the public sector into the private
sector.

          The empirical estimation of equation (3), i.e., of separate selection-corrected wage regressions
for the private and the public sector, forms the basis for the third and final step. In this step, a
selection-adjusted Oaxaca type decomposition is used to investigate the proportion of the differences
in the average levels of hourly wages between public and private sector workers that can be accounted

for by characteristics and coefficients effects, respectively. Formally, the stylized Oaxaca type
decomposition equation can be written as

        (4)
              ̅         ̅       ,

or alternatively as

        (5)
              ̅         ̅       .

Here,    denotes average log hourly wages and       is a 1 × K vector of average individual characteristics
of sector                   ,       including the relevant correction terms.        is a K × 1 vector of
parameters and ̅ the average error terms which are zero by construction. The first, second, and third
components of the right-hand side of equations (4) and (5) are called the characteristics, the
coefficients and the residuals effects, respectively. The key difference between equations (4) and (5) is
that equation (4) uses public sector coefficients as the baseline while equation (5) relies on private
sector coefficients for this purpose. As there is rarely a particular reason to estimate either equation
(4) or equation (5), Reimers (1983) proposes to use the average coefficients over both groups instead.
This is the approach followed here. Moreover, Bhaumik, Gang and Yun (2006) note that the
coefficients effect generally incorporates the effect of differences in the constant term between
sectors. The coefficients of the constant terms explain the wage differential between public and private
sector workers that is not attributed to explanatory variables. Hence, the difference in the constant
terms may be interpreted as baseline differences between the two sectors. It can be separated from
the effects of the other coefficients.

        The characteristics and coefficients effects can be further decomposed into subgroups of
variables or even individual variables. In this context, a critical issue is that the decomposition results
for categorical variables depend on which category is chosen to be the omitted base category. To avoid
this issue and to arrive at decomposition results that are independent of such a choice, this study
makes use of a method introduced by Yun (2005). The method relies on first estimating the group
models with the standard dummy coding. Next, the coefficient vectors are transformed so that they
represent deviations from the grand mean and the coefficient for the base category is added.

         Also note that while the estimates from the second stage wage regressions and the third stage
are consistent, their standard errors are inefficient. However, efficient standard errors can however be
obtained with the help of the bootstrap. This is the approach followed here.

         In terms of characteristics to be included in the vectors of explanatory variables,                    and     ,
this study uses potential experience, potential experience squared, nationality and gender of the worker
and indicators for his or her educational attainment and type of employment in the wage equations
and ensuing Oaxaca type decomposition. The inclusion of these variables is based on standard human
capital theory. For similar reasons, variables for the sector and dzongkhag of employment and a
rural/urban dummy variable are also included in the wage equations and Oaxaca type decomposition.
In contrast, occupation dummies are not included. This is due to their potential endogeneity related
to the interaction of self-selection into sectors and into occupations.5

         When estimating the equations for selection into labor force participation and into private or
public sector work, all controls for an individuals’ socio-demographic characteristics, education and
location are again included. To avoid identification to rely entirely on the parametric form of the
multinomial logit model, a number of additional variables appear in the selection equation but not in
the earnings equation. I.e., these explanatory variables are used as excluded instruments. Here,
excluded instruments are mainly family characteristics – the proportion in the household of children
aged 14 or under, seniors aged 66 or over, private sector workers and public sector workers. The
selection of family characteristics as excluded instruments borrows significantly from the literature on
labor supply and earnings. For instance, Christofides and Michael (2013) and Gang and Schmillen
(2014) postulate that the presence of children and/or old individuals in the household should influence
self-selection into labor force participation and Christofides and Pashardes (2002) argue that the
employment of other members of an individual’s family in a specific sector should reduce the costs
of job search in this sector. At the same time, family characteristics should have no direct effects on
wages.

         Additionally, a wealth index is used as an excluded instrument. Following standard practice,
this wealth index is defined as the first principal component factor of a large number of variables



         5Similar concerns about potential endogeneity might also be voiced about the use of labor market characteristics
and industry dummies as regressors. As such concerns can be seen as less pressing as compared to those for occupations,
labor market and industry characteristics are nevertheless included as regressors.

capturing household living conditions, wealth and assets (cf. World Bank, 2003). Here, these variables
are the ownership of a dwelling, of different types of livestock and land as well as of 29 different
consumer goods like mobile phones, rice cookers, composite bows or cars, and the presence of an
electricity connection. Schultz (1995) and Tansel (2005) argue that higher household wealth – or rather
the higher unearned income derived from it – should increase the shadow value of time spent working
and therefore decrease labor force participation but should not influence wages through any other
channels.6


4.       Results

4.1.     Descriptive Statistics

Basic summary statistics for various variables related to individuals’ earnings, labor market
characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics, education and industry are summarized in Table 2.
The table displays the means and standard deviations of all relevant variables separately for public and
private sector workers. Additionally, results of t-tests for differences in characteristics between the
two groups are presented. Appropriate sample weights are used for the descriptive statistics
summarized in Table 2 and all other statistics presented in this section.7

         Table 2 makes it clear that there are many differences in the average characteristics of public
and private sector workers that are statistically and economically significant. Maybe most strikingly,
public sector employees have significantly higher average hourly wages than those in the private sector.
On average, public sector workers earn Nu 77.31 (that is approximately US dollar 1.22) per hour.
Average hourly wages of private sector workers are Nu 66.23 (or US dollar 1.04). The public/private
wage differential is statistically significant at the 1 percent level.



          6 The practical implementation of the three-step procedure is greatly facilitated by a number of STATA ado-files

programmed by different researchers: Below, oaxaca by Jann (2008) is used for the Oaxaca type decompositions and code
based on the one in selmlog by Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007) for the numerical computation of correction
terms. Besides, the quantile regressions of Section 4.3 rely on rifreg by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007, 2009).
          7 As mentioned above, the BLFS contains data on 23,587 individuals. 14,137 of these fulfill the restrictions

underlying the baseline decomposition (as detailed in Table 1, this implies in particular that they are between 15 and 65
years old and are neither unpaid family workers nor graduates of institutions of religious education). Of these, 7,178
individuals work either in the public or the private sector. Finally, for 6,562 individuals valid information on all control
variables is available in the BLFS. Accordingly, they form the basis of the analysis of this section. Table 2 shows that the
unweighted sample of 6,562 individuals can be broken down into 3,180 observations for public sector workers and 3,382
observations for private sector workers. Using appropriate sample weights, this translates into 58,068 public sector workers
and 118,853 private sector workers.

        Concerning labor market characteristics, public sector workers are relatively more likely to be
employed as regular wage workers. This status applies to 94.1 percent of public sector workers but to
only 16.5 percent of private sector workers. Conversely, public sector employees are substantially less
likely to be contract or piece paid workers or, unsurprisingly, own-account workers. Socio-
demographic variables also show notable differences between the two sectors. In particular,
statistically significant differences exist with respect to workers’ average location, gender and
experience. For instance, 67.9 percent of public sector workers live in urban parts of Bhutan but only
27.0 percent of private sector workers are city dwellers. Moreover, public sector workers are less likely
to be female and on average have less potential experience. At the same time, while according to the
BLFS 2014 the proportion of Bhutanese nationals is very high in both sectors it does not significantly
differ between them.8

        The average educational attainment of workers differs markedly between the two sectors.
Whereas less than a quarter (22.7 percent) of public sector employees have no or no formal education
this is the case for almost two-thirds of private sector workers (64.8 percent). On the other hand, 3.5
percent of public sector workers but only 0.5 percent of private sector workers have higher tertiary
education, defined here as the completion of at least a Master’s degree. Finally, industrial structures
also differ between the two sectors. For instance, public sector workers are dramatically less likely to
work in agriculture, hunting and forestry (nil vs. 46.7 percent) but much more likely to work in public
administration and defense (52.5 vs. nil percent). Again, these differences are statistically significant at
the 1 percent level. In general, the picture that emerges from Table 2 is that in Bhutan wages, jobs and
workers all differ considerably between the public and the private sector.

        Fringe benefits that are paid in addition to the base salary are an important aspect of overall
worker compensation for which the BLFS 2014 contains relatively detailed information. According to
Bhutan’s Labor and Employment Act, the majority of workers should de jure be entitled to the
following eight distinct fringe benefits: gratuity (not in the sense of tips but as an additional retirement
benefit after a certain length of service), provident fund payments (another retirement benefit),
overtime payments, paid annual leave, paid sick leave, paid casual leave, paid maternity/paternity leave




        8 Administrative data from the MoLHR and the World Bank’s Bhutan Enterprise Survey 2015 document much
higher proportions of non-Bhutanese workers than the BLFS 2014. This hints at a general under-reporting of non-
Bhutanese individuals in the BLFS 2014.
                                                     - 16 -
and compensation for work accidents or occupational diseases. However, in many countries and also
in Bhutan the enforcement of labor laws is relatively lax and some employers are able to avoid
compliance (cf. Fandl, Kugler, Vodopivec and Weber, 2011, for details on compliance with Bhutan’s
Labor and Employment Act). Against this backdrop, the BLFS 2014 collects data for regular paid
employees, casual paid employees and contract / piece paid workers in state-owned or private
enterprises, and data on their de facto coverage by fringe benefits.

        As monetary values of fringe benefits are hard to quantify, they will not be considered in the
subsequent analysis of the public/private wage differential. However, Table 2 still lists the prevalence
of these benefits separately for public and private sector workers. The table shows that coverage is
incomplete both in the public and the private sector. At the same time, public sector workers are more
likely to be eligible for each of the eight types of benefits and all differentials are both statistically
significant and economically meaningful. In fact, for each of the eight benefits, coverage among public
sector workers easily exceeds 90 percent. The benefit with the lowest prevalence among public sector
workers is paid annual leave. 94.3 of public sector workers are covered by this benefit. On the other
end of the spectrum, 96.5 percent of public sector workers receive compensation for work accidents
or occupational diseases. In contrast, only between around 25 percent and 65 percent of private sector
workers are covered by each particular benefit. Only 27.0 percent of private sector employees are paid
for overtime. Paid sick leave is the most common benefit in the private sector. 64.5 percent of private
sector workers receive this benefit. It seems safe to assume that differences between public and private
sector would be even more pronounced if data on benefit coverage were also collected for workers
other than regular paid employees, casual paid employees and contract / piece paid workers in state-
owned or private enterprises.



4.2.    Selection Equation, Wage Regressions and Baseline Decomposition

Turning to the initial step of the three-step procedure outlined above, Table 3 reports outputs from
an empirical estimation of the sector selection equation (2). These outputs provide insights into the
determinants of self-selection into labor force participation and into public and private sector. Not
directly reported in Table 3 but available upon request are the coefficients of the multinomial logit
model used to estimate equation (2). What is displayed in Table 3 are marginal effects on the likelihood
of self-selection into the public sector, the private sector or inactivity. This is because marginal effects

                                                   - 17 -
are much more straightforward to interpret. Since the marginal effects of a multinomial logit model
depend on the values of the explanatory variables, one must decide at which values to report them.
As is common in the literature, the table shows the average marginal effects. In other words, Table 3
provides insights into the determinants of the sectoral choice of individuals with average
characteristics. The delta method is used to compute standard errors.

         In many ways, the multinomial logit estimates of Table 3 confirm the descriptive evidence of
Table 2. For instance, they confirm that urban workers are more likely to work in the public rather
than in the private sector, ceteris paribus. Additionally, they provide some evidence that city dwellers are
more likely to be inactive. Moreover, the multinomial logit estimates confirm that relatively well-
educated individuals are more likely to self-select into public sector jobs. Well-educated individuals
are also much less likely to be inactive. Other results of the multinomial logit estimates could not have

                                                           - 18 -
been deducted from descriptive evidence or nuance the descriptive picture of Table 2. For instance,
Table 3 shows that women are less likely to participate in the labor market but also indicates that
women tend to self-select out of the private sector. In addition to that, Bhutanese nationals are shown
to be more prone to seek public sector employment and less likely to be either inactive or employed
in the private sector. Finally, the table demonstrate that an inverse u-shaped pattern exists between
potential experience and labor force participation (irrespective of the sector of employment). Similar
inverse u-shaped patterns have been documented for many other countries.

        Concerning possible self-selection into labor force participation and public or private sector
work, it was mentioned above that the empirical representation of equation (2) uses household and
family characteristics (the proportion of children, seniors, private sector workers and public sector
workers in the household) and a wealth index as excluded instruments. As is evident from Table 3, all
of these instruments have at least some statistically and economically significant influence on self-
selection. For instance, individuals in households with a higher proportion of members aged 14 or
under are relatively more likely to work in the public sector. The opposite is the case for individuals
in households with a higher proportion of members aged 66 or above. Besides, the sector of activity
of other household members apparently acts as an important push factor: in case a higher proportion
of other household members is employed in the public sectors that makes employment in the private
sector less likely. Similarly, when relatively more household members are private sector workers, this
reduces the probability that a specific worker self-selects into the public sector. Finally, higher
household wealth reduces the likelihood of self-selection into the public sector and increases the
likelihood of labor force non-participation. The last result is consistent with the argument of Schultz
(1995) and Tansel (2005) that higher household wealth – or rather the higher unearned income derived
from it – should increase the shadow value of time spent working and therefore decrease labor force
participation.

        Table 4 shifts the attention to the second step of the three-step procedure and an empirical
estimation of equation (3). I.e., Table 4 is concerned with estimating the correlates of log hourly wages
in the public and the private sector. As mentioned in Section 3, following the methodology proposed
by Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007) this is done in a way that takes self-selection into
account and even allows an explicit consideration of biases related to the allocation of individuals in a
specific sector and which choice among any two alternative sectors this bias stems from.

         In spite of some important differences between correlates of log hourly wages in the public
and the private sector, Table 4 shows that altogether the patterns associated with individual wages
look rather similar for the two sectors. Moreover, the overall picture that emerge from the table is that

                                                         - 20 -
even in Bhutan – a country with many unique features – most basic regularities derived from standard
human capital theory hold. Direction and size of the individual coefficients are generally those that
one would expect from the estimation of such a wage equation in the tradition of Mincer (1974). For
instance, Table 4 demonstrates that both in the public and the private sector average hourly wages are
higher for better educated individuals, ceteris paribus. It should be noted that Table 4 does not correct
for the possible endogeneity of educational choice and therefore does not make causal statements
about the returns to education in Bhutan.

        For both public and private sector workers, wages tend to increase with potential experience
but with a declining rate. Thus, over the life cycle wages exhibit an inverse u-shaped path. However,
this pattern is only statistically significant for public sector workers. With regard to gender, a
statistically significant gender wage gap exists neither in the public nor the private sector. Given that
gender wage gaps continue to be a defining feature of many countries’ labor markets this appears
noteworthy. Concerning the different industry variables, wages tend to be lowest in agriculture,
hunting and forestry (the reference category in Table 4). In both the public and the private sector,
workers in mining and quarrying and in health and social work earn among the highest wages. Other
industries with relatively high wages include construction and other service activities in the public
sector and fishing and public administration and defense in the private sector. Note that the wage
differences across industries are generally much more precisely estimated for the private sector.

        According to Table 4, an urban wage premium is only present for the private sector while
wages between urban and rural areas do not differ in a statistically significant way for the public sector.
Together with the often only marginally significant coefficients associated with industry variables, this
result gives the impression that Bhutan’s de facto public sector wages are in fact strongly correlated with
variables that de jure determine public sector wages, especially in the civil service (like an individual’s
education), but much less so with variables that have less of a de jure role like gender, location or
industry. Contrary to this overall pattern, Table 4 shows that hourly wages and Bhutanese citizenship
are negatively correlated in the public sector whereas there is no statistically significant relationship
between the two variables in the private sector. This might reflect a specific (unobservable) assignment
to high-level positions demanding specialized technical expertise of the small number of non-
Bhutanese employees in Bhutan’s public sector.

        Finally, it is worth having a look at the coefficients associated with the various correction
terms. As pointed out in Dimova and Gang (2006, p. 625), “(f)or each sector-based wage estimation,
a negative (…) selectivity coefficient related to any of the alternative sectors indicates lower wages
than those of randomly chosen individuals on account of the allocation of individuals with better (…)
unobserved characteristics out of the given sector and into the respective alternative sector. For
instance, if we observe a negative private sector selectivity correction coefficient in the public sector
equation, this indicates lower than randomly chosen rewards to the skills of individuals working for
the public sector due to the allocation of individuals with better unobserved characteristics out of the
public and into the private sector.” The reverse is the case for positive correction terms. As is clear
from Table 4, the correction term related to the private sector is negative and marginally statistically
significant in the public sector wage equation. In other words, wages in the public sector appear
downward biased due to the allocation of individuals with better unobserved characteristics out of
this sector into inactivity. The correction term related to the private sector is also negative and
statistically significant in the private sector wage equation. No other correction terms are individually
statistically significant in either wage equation.

        Results from the third and final step of the procedure outlined in Section 3, i.e., an Oaxaca
type decomposition of log hourly wages based on the selection-corrected wage regressions from Table
4, are reported in Table 5. The objective of the decomposition is to explain how much of the overall
difference in the logarithm of hourly wages between public and private sector workers adjusted for
self-selection of individuals can be attributed to differences in the level of individuals’ characteristics
and by differences in the impact on wages of these characteristics. As the table shows, when sector
self-selection is taken into account the overall difference in hourly wages amounts to 0.587 log points
or roughly 58.7 percent.

The two most important estimates are those for the aggregate characteristics and coefficients effects.
According to Table 5, these amount to 0.583 and 0.004 log points, respectively. The positive value of
the characteristics effect means that if public and private sector employees were to have the same
regression coefficients, i.e., the impact of the characteristics on their hourly wages were identical, the
logarithm of hourly wages of public sector workers would have been higher than that of private sector
workers by 0.583 log points due solely to differences in characteristics. Conversely, the coefficients
effect of 0.004 implies that, if both public and private sector workers were to have the exact same
characteristics so that any difference in wages between the two sectors were due only to

differences in the regression coefficients, i.e., the rates of return on the characteristics, the logarithm
of hourly wages of public sector workers would have been higher than that of private sector workers
by 0.004 log points. In short, public sector workers would be worse off if the differences between
their characteristics and those of the private sector workers were to disappear. In addition to that, they
would also be worse off in the absence of any differences between the two groups in the effectiveness
of, or returns to, those characteristics.

          Importantly, the aggregate characteristics effect is statistically significant at the 1 percent level
and of the same magnitude as the overall public/private wage differential. In contrast, the aggregate
coefficients effect is not statistically significant at any conventional level of statistical significance.
Therefore, the main result from Table 5 – and the whole three-step procedure – is that the sizeable
differences in average wages between public and private sector workers in Bhutan can entirely be
explained by differences in the observable characteristics of public and private sector workers.

          Table 5 also allows a more detailed consideration of how different variables or groups of
variables influence the aggregate characteristics and coefficients effects. Disaggregating the
characteristics effect shows that public sector workers benefit considerably from being on average
better educated than private sector workers. The education variables explain 0.326 log points of the
difference between public and private sector wages. Most importantly in this regard, public sector
workers are relatively less likely to have no or no formal education and relatively more likely to have
lower tertiary education. The very high wage premiums associated with higher tertiary education
documented in Table 4 play a comparatively smaller role in explaining the aggregate characteristics
effect.

          The other group of observable characteristics that explains a sizeable portion of the wage gap
between public and private sector relates to the distinct industrial structures of the two sectors. Public
sector workers are much more likely to work in industries that are more favorable for the labor market
and this explains 0.499 log points of the difference between public and private sector wages. Most
importantly, public sector workers are much less likely to work in agriculture, hunting and forestry –
the industry with the lowest hourly wages. Additionally, the sectoral distribution of work in hotels and
restaurants, health and social work and private households favors public sector workers. (That of
mining and quarrying has the opposite effect.)

        Observable characteristics of public sector workers are also more favorable when it comes to
their location in terms of dzongkhag. At the same time, the characteristics effect associated with labor
market and socio-demographic variables actually works against them. In particular, public sector
workers are much less likely to be engaged as own-account workers, a type of activity very favorable
for the labor market. On average, the potential experience profile across sectors also puts public sector
workers at a disadvantage. In contrast, their higher degree of urbanization is associated with a
favorable characteristics effect. Overall, the public sector workers’ favorable characteristics effects
associated with the education, sector and location variables outweigh the unfavorable characteristics
effects stemming from labor market and socio-economic variables. This leads the overall
characteristics effect for public sector workers to be positive and statistically and economically
significant.

        Concerning a detailed decomposition of the coefficients effect, Table 5 shows that much fewer
variables can be identified as statistically significant drivers of such an effect. Of those that are
statistically significant, the returns to labor market characteristics and in particular to being a regular
paid employee favor the public sector. Among the few individual variables with statistically significant
coefficients effects, it is noteworthy that the returns to being a city dweller are higher in the private
sector whereas the wage premium associated with having a lower tertiary education is more elevated
in the public sector. The coefficients effects of some sectoral variables (including those for
construction, wholesale and retail trade and transport and communications) also work in the private
sector workers’ favor. It should be noted, however, that neither the overall coefficients effect nor the
coefficients effect net of baseline differences between public and private sector nor the baseline
differences as measured by the coefficient associated with the constant are statistically significant.

Table 6 summarizes three alternative specifications of the benchmark selection-corrected Oaxaca type
decomposition of log hourly wages. The objective is to assess whether this study’s main results are
robust to variations in the empirical setup. For conciseness, outputs are displayed only for the
aggregate characteristics and coefficient effects as well as for semi-detailed decompositions that group
the effects of labor market characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics, education, industry and
location. Outputs for the corresponding detailed decompositions are available upon request.

         As mentioned in Section 3, the benchmark selection-corrected Oaxaca type decomposition
uses the average coefficients of public and private sector workers. This follows a suggestion by
                                                           - 26 -
Reimers (1983). As an alternative, Cotton (1988) proposes to weigh the coefficients by the group sizes.
This alternative suggestion is implemented in Panel A of Table 6. Panel B of Table 6 does not rely on
the variation of the selection-correction procedure of Dubin and McFadden (1984) recommended by
Bourguignon, Fournier and Gurgand (2007). Instead, the original procedure introduced by Dubin and
McFadden (1984) is used. This procedure relies on a slightly different linearity assumption and
imposes the additional restriction that all correlation coefficients between error terms sum to zero.
Finally, in Panel C of Table 6 the sample is restricted in a way that excludes the 1 percent of
observation with the lowest hourly wage as well the as the 1 percent of observations with the highest
wage per hour. The rationale behind this robustness exercise is to assess whether results are robust to
the exclusion of outliers.

         Panels A, B and C of Table 6 show that for all three alternative specifications selection-
corrected predicted average hourly wages are statistically significantly higher for public sector workers
than for private sector workers. The magnitude of the difference in these hourly wages is quite robust
as well. Moreover, the differences can be completely attributed to characteristics effects in all three
alternative specifications. Overall coefficients effects are never statistically significant. Finally, in all
three alternative specifications observable labor market characteristics continue to favor private sector
workers whereas education and industry characteristics work to the benefit of public sector workers.
In the case of the characteristics effects of socio-demographic and location characteristics, two of
three alternative specifications support the findings from the baseline decomposition. In the third
alternative specification these variables are not associated with a statistically significant characteristics
effect. Concerning coefficients effects, results of the robustness exercise once again confirm those
from the baseline decomposition. In particular, all three alternative specifications support the notion
that returns to favorable labor market characteristics are higher in the public sector. Apart from these
labor market characteristics, hardly any of the semi-aggregate variables depicted in Table 6 are
associated with statistically significant coefficients effects. Overall, Table 6 makes it clear that the main
results from the baseline decomposition are very robust to variations in the empirical setup.9




         9 The main results from the baseline decomposition are also robust to a number of additional sensitivity checks

not depicted here but available upon request. These include the use of the standard Oaxaca decomposition based on OLS
regressions instead of the three-step decomposition method and of a three-step decomposition without sample weights.
Qualitatively, the main results are also robust to a specification that avoids possible concerns about the measurement of

4.4.     Quantile Decompositions

So far, the analysis has focused on decomposing the differences in average hourly wages between the
public and the private sector. In recent years procedures have gained prominence that make it possible
to complement an analysis of differences in mean wages by quantile decompositions that assess
different quantiles of the wage distribution (cf. Fortin, Lemieux and Firpo, 2011). Here, the Oaxaca
type decompositions of differences in mean wages between public and private sector of the last
subsections are complemented by similar decompositions based on differences in various quantiles of
the wage distributions in the public and private sectors. In terms of methodology, a two-step
procedure first suggested by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007, 2009) is implemented: First, separate
regressions of the recentered influence function (a widely used tool in robust estimation) of the
unconditional quantile on the explanatory variables are run for the private and the public sectors.
Second, generalized Oaxaca type decompositions are performed for various quantiles of the wage
distribution. An important caveat is that the procedure suggested by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007,
2009) does not control for self-selection into labor force participation and public or private sector
jobs.

         Results of the quantile decompositions are summarized in Table 7. The table focuses on the
second step of the two-step procedure suggested by Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux (2007, 2009) and on
the overall wage differences between public and private sectors at various quantiles of the wage
distribution. Additionally, the table indicates whether the overall differences are attributable to
workers’ characteristics or the returns to these characteristics. The quantiles considered range from
the tenth percentile to the 90th percentile, in steps of ten percentiles.

         Table 7 shows that overall differences between wages in the public and the private sectors are
statistically and economically significant across the wage distribution. Additionally, it demonstrates
that these differences are most pronounced in the left tail of the distribution. The tenth percentile of
the public sector wage distribution is 98.8 percent higher than the tenth percentile of the private sector
wage distribution. With regard to the median the difference is 52.2 percent and with regard to the 90th
percentile it amounts to 16.6 percent. The quantile decompositions demonstrate that over the entire



own-account workers’ wages by restricting the second-stage regressions and third-stage decompositions to dependent
workers in the public and private sector (though in this case the overall characteristics effect is significant only at the 10
percent level).

wage distribution, none of the overall differences between public and private sector wages can be
attributed to coefficients effects; these are all statistically insignificant. In contrast, differences in
observable characteristics between the public and private sectors can fully explain overall wage
differences from the tenth percentile of the wage distribution up to the median. For the right-hand
side of the wage distribution precision in the estimation of characteristics effects is insufficient to
clearly attribute overall wage differences to these as opposed to coefficients effects.

         Overall, the quantile decompositions complement the decomposition at the mean by
demonstrating that public sector wages are significantly higher than private sector wages across the
whole wage distribution but especially in its left tail. Whenever power is sufficient to disentangle
characteristics and coefficients effects, the overall difference between public and private sector wages
can be attributed to differences in observable characteristics between public and private sector
workers. No evidence is found that would support the contention that differing returns to observable
characteristics explain the overall differences in wages across any of a number of different quantiles
of the wage distribution.


5.       Conclusions

This study investigated why many in Bhutan see the public sector as the most desirable employer. It
asked if this was because public sector employees received higher wages than comparable private

                                                          - 29 -
sector workers. To answer this question, it used a refined three-step procedure that made it possible
to account for possible self-selection into labor force participation and into public or private sector
work in a straightforward way, to estimate a flexible model of wage determination in either sector and
to conduct a counterfactual decomposition of the wage differential between the public and private
sectors into characteristics and coefficients effects, as originally suggested by Oaxaca (1973). The
empirical investigation revealed that average wages in Bhutan’s public sector are significantly higher
than average wages in the country’s private sector. Quantile regressions showed that public/private
wage differentials are in fact positive over the whole wage distribution and especially pronounced in
its left tail. However, the investigation also demonstrated that in the mean and over much of the wage
distribution the positive public/private wage differentials can entirely be accounted for by differences
in observable characteristics between public and private sector workers.

        This study’s results for Bhutan are generally comparable to those of the broader literature on
the public/private wage differential in developed and developing countries. For instance, Mizala,
Romaguera and Gallegos (2011) document positive raw public/private wage gaps for all 11 Latin
American countries in their sample. All of these gaps decrease when controlling for characteristics
effects. Qualitatively similar patterns have also been documented by Christofides and Michael (2013)
for 23 of 27 European countries in their sample, by Aslam and Kingdon (2009) for Pakistan and by
others.10 What is striking about Bhutan is the sheer difference between the very sizeable raw
public/private wage gap and the practically inexistent wage gap once characteristics effects are
controlled for. Observable characteristics of workers or jobs explain a larger proportion of Bhutan’s
public/private wage differential than in almost all other countries for which comparable data exist.

        What are the policy implications of these findings? At least in a narrow sense of the word, the
overall conclusion seems to be that Bhutan’s public sector follows what has been called the prevailing
wage principle. In other words, the country’s public sector workers tend to receive wages equivalent
to those earned by private sector workers performing comparable work (cf. Fogel and Lewin, 1974).
At the same time, the public sector clearly remains the sector of choice for many Bhutanese job seekers
and queuing for public sector jobs is widespread. At first glance it might appear puzzling why the




        10  In contrast, in their study of the Peruvian labor market Coppola and Calvo-Gonzales (2011) document no
overall public/wage gap. Instead, they find significantly positive characteristics effects and significantly negative
coefficients effects that cancel each other out.

public sector should be seen as so attractive when public sector workers receive wages equivalent to
those earned by private sector workers performing comparable work. However, this apparent puzzle
can be explained by the fact that the overall compensation packages received by Bhutan’s public sector
workers tend to be far more generous than those offered in the private sector. As documented in
Section 4, Bhutan’s public sector employees enjoy more extensive fringe benefits than private sector
workers. In addition to that, they also have better access to pensions and other social insurances, more
job security and higher prestige.

        A number of major hydropower projects will come on stream in the next few years. As a result,
the pressure is likely to rise to further expand Bhutan’s public sector and to further increase the
generosity of the compensation packages offered to public sector workers. In light of the results of
this study it might appear more prudent for the Royal Government of Bhutan to instead consider a
three-pronged strategy for sectoral rebalancing – not to weaken the public sector but to allow private
sector jobs to emerge and prosper. First, reign in wage increases in the public sector and make sure
that in the future adjustments to public sector wages are modest and in line or below private sector
wage growth. Second, gradually align the overall compensation packages offered to public sector and
private sector workers, e.g. by strengthening the enforcement of labor regulations to improve private
sector workers’ access to fringe benefits they are legally entitled to, extending pension insurance to the
private sector and considering the introduction of unemployment benefits or other forms of income
support for jobless private sector workers. Third, foster broad private sector development and
continue the current policy of limiting growth in the public sector workforce, especially with regard
to the civil service.

Appendix A. Civil Service Employment and Pay

To check the reliability of the BLFS data especially with regard to the absolute and relative size of
Bhutan’s public sector and the average pay in this sector, Table A1 compares size and structure of
civil service employment and the average annual civil service pay according to the BLFS with
administrative data from Bhutan’s Royal Civil Service Commission (RCSC, 2014, 2015). RCSC (2014)
contains reliable and up-to-date administrative information on the strength and structure of Bhutan’s
civil service as of December 31, 2014 and RCSC (2015) does the same for the average annual civil
service pay as of July 2014. The civil service in turn forms the largest component of public sector
employment in Bhutan. As outlined in Section 3, the other components of the public sector are other
government agencies, the armed forces and state-owned enterprises. This definition follows ILO
(2009).

          Table A1 documents that using appropriate weights the BLFS counts 24,530 civil service
employees in Bhutan whereas RCSC (2014) identifies 26,320 civil servants. In other words, RCSC
(2014) gives a civil service headcount that is 7.3 percent larger than the one implied by the BLFS.
While this discrepancy is not non-negligible, the overall size of Bhutan’s civil service is similar
according to both sources.

          Concerning the structure of civil service employment, Table A1 breaks total employment in
the civil service down by employees’ labor market characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics
and level of education. The age and education breakdowns are performed on a more aggregate level
than what is possible with the BLFS alone. This is because RCSC (2014) does not provide the exact
numbers of civil service employees for as many age or education groups as the BLFS. The specific
categorization also differs between the two sources.

          Table A1 documents that with regard to labor market characteristics, both the BLFS and RCSC
(2014) categorize the overwhelming majority of civil servants as regular paid employees. At the same
time, the number of contract workers in Bhutan’s civil service is about six times higher according to
RCSC (2014) than according to the BLFS. The reason might be because some contract workers in the
civil service do not identify themselves as civil servants in the BLFS and instead refer of themselves
as being employed in other government agencies. This would then also explain a large portion of the
discrepancy in overall civil service employment between the BLFS and RCSC (2014). Besides, it is
noteworthy that while the RCSC plausibly classifies no civil servants as casual paid employees or own-

                                                 - 35 -
account workers, the BLFS counts a very small number of civil servants as belonging to the two
employment types. These are most probably miscategorizations.

Notes. (1) Weights have been used for the BLFS 2014 numbers. (2) BLFS 2014 records civil service employment and pay
around December 2014 and January 2015, RCSC (2014) records employment as on December 31, 2014 and RCSC
(2015) pay as of July 2014. (3) Due to data availability, civil service employment by education and civil servant annual
average pay are for regular paid employees only. (4) For the RCSC (2014) numbers, middle secondary education or less
includes functional qualification and basic education class 10 and below, higher secondary education includes certificate,
lower tertiary education includes diploma, bachelor, postgraduate diploma and postgraduate certificate, higher secondary
education includes master und Ph.D.



         Concerning socio-economic characteristics, the gender and age structure of Bhutan’s civil
service look very similar in the BLFS and according to RCSC (2014). At the same time, notable
discrepancies are found with respect to civil servants’ citizenship. Both sources count very few non-
Bhutanese citizens among the group of civil servants. However, their number according to RCSC
                                                          - 36 -
(2014) is ten times as large as the one implied by the BLFS. This might partly be because following
RCSC (2014) almost all non-Bhutanese citizens in the civil service are contract workers. According to
the source, this is the case for 444 out of 469 non-Bhutanese citizens listed as civil service employees.
However, the discrepancy between the BLFS and RCSC (2014) might also point towards a more
general under-reporting of non-Bhutanese individuals in the BLFS (cf. footnote 8). Finally, relatively
large differences are also recorded between both sources with regard to civil servants’ education.
Generally speaking, the average education level of civil servants as detailed in the BLFS is significantly
higher than that of all employed individuals in Bhutan (cf. Table 1). Nevertheless, RCSC (2014) lists
even higher average education levels for civil servants. No ready explanation is apparent for this
discrepancy.

        Finally, Table A1 shows that the average annual pay of a civil servant according to the BLFS
2014 is Nu 209,948 while RCSC (2015) lists it as Nu 236,757. Put differently, average civil service pay
according to official sources is Nu 26,809 or 12.8 percent higher than according to the BLFS 2014.
This is again a discrepancy that is not non-negligible but that still puts the BLFS 2014 relatively close
to information garnered form administrative sources.

        Summa summarum, a number of noteworthy discrepancies between the civil service employment
headcount and structure and average pay according to the BLFS data and administrative data from
the Royal Civil Service Commission can be documented, especially with regard to the typical
nationality and educational attainment of civil servants. Still, the overall size, employment structure
and level of pay of the civil service documented in the BLFS is quite similar to the one recorded by
RCSC (2014, 2015).
