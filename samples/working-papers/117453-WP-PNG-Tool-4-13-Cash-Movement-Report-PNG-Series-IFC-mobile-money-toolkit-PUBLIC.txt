Summary
Mobile phones are proving to be a powerful tool for the delivery of basic financial services to lower income
households throughout the world. In just a few years, millions of new mobile phone subscribers are now
transferring money, sending international remittances and even saving through mobile phone networks. The
term “mobile money” is used broadly in this paper and includes services ranging from money transfers and
payments to savings.

Papua New Guinea (PNG) presents interesting challenges and opportunities for a mobile money system. There
appears to be a great demand for a system that enhances cash safety, which would include not only mobile
phone transfers but also a means to transact, store, and accumulate value for later use. Carrying and holding
cash creates great insecurity for businesses and households, both of which consistently expressed a high level
of interest in a safer (including electronic) means to transport and store money.

Building such a comprehensive mobile money system does not happen overnight - it involves a powerful
combination of the right technology, delivery mechanisms, sound institutions, regulation, and a payments
system that can handle a high volume of small transactions. However there are factors that suggest a mobile
money system that goes beyond just money transfers may be possible in PNG.

Although 85% of Papua New Guineans live in rural areas, most goods and services are bought and sold in
secondary cities; villagers appear to travel to secondary cities and larger towns regularly despite distances and
                                                                                                                                                             
difficulties.1 There are few opportunities to purchase goods and services in the villages. Since most villagers
grow or raise what they eat, they have only a few shopping needs for daily life, such as food supplements
(canned fish, sugar, rice) and some sundry items (soap, cigarettes). Villagers are very secretive about their
money, noting that those known to have cash face greater societal pressures to pay for social obligations.
This suggests that concentrating cash-out points in larger towns and secondary cities, rather than the smaller
villages, may be adequate (even desirable) for many citizens.

Fortunately, infrastructure for cash-out services in secondary cities and larger towns exists, and includes over
2,500 EFTPOS terminals, 75 bank and microbank branches, 89 district treasury offices, and 105 post office
branches. Many of these locations already function as bank agents. This financial and electronic network is
fragmented, has much duplication, and does not provide quality service at present. However, the physical
and electronic infrastructure is there. In terms of technology, mobile network operators already allow clients
to transfer airtime to each other and are moving towards an electronic system of top-up to replace airtime
cards. This platform is suited for mobile money. Both mobile providers in the country noted that Papua New
Guineans are quick to accept and adapt to new technology.

There may also be an opportunity to quickly catalyze and capitalize a mobile money system. Agent banking has
frequently benefited through a “push” by government. In these cases, the government works with commercial
banks to make social payments on the government’s behalf into bank accounts. This “forces” large numbers
of recipients into the financial system. While PNG lacks a large system of social payments or a high number of
utility subscribers, it is a very top-down economy, dominated by a dozen or so entities, primarily composed of
the government and large corporate exporters. The movement of cash to the provinces has been described
by bankers as a “conveyer belt,” in which banks move money on behalf of the government and corporations



	 The frequency of travel varies according to the remoteness of the village, but regular trips to the large towns and cities seem common to most families.

to the provinces, then see very little of it flow back through the formal banking system. Most households receive
cash from the government or exporters directly or through a relative who is an employee, grower, landholder, or
beneficiary. There is an opportunity through these major money suppliers to quickly push mobile money into the
system by paying salaries, paying royalties, and purchasing commodities electronically in lieu of the current cash
systems. These electronic payments could directly reach over 500,000 households – or nearly half the population
of PNG.

This paper describes several other alternatives to catalyze a more comprehensive mobile money system. One
main conclusion is that neither technology nor the regulatory environment presents obstacles to the development
of mobile money in PNG. What is needed is a player or group of players with vision and resources with vision and
resources to work with major money suppliers and cash takers to develop and introduce a simple, standardized,
well-branded product utilizing the existing telecommunications and financial infrastructure. The challenge is in
making the product safe, reliable, well managed, and cost effective so that it addresses the population’s demand
for cash security and wins their trust.



Purpose
The purpose of this study was to look at how mobile money services could expand in PNG. The authors sought
to identify and analyze existing distribution networks that might serve as potential agents to provide cash in/
out services. Existing channels for moving money “downstream,” such as the payment of salaries, purchases
of commodities, and domestic money transfers and channels for moving money “upstream,” mostly through
the payment for goods and services, were examined. The industries, entities, and distribution networks that
are major movers of cash in, and out, of the provinces were also considered. Transaction types that have the
greatest volume and frequency, particularly for low-income households, were sought. Through this analysis, the
authors hoped to identify the potential for synergies between existing channels and a future mobile money agent
network.

This paper includes a brief review of the current environment for both the financial and telecommunications
sectors, which is well documented in other sources. The main sections of the document include an analysis of the
movement of money in PNG, observations on the demand and potential for building a mobile money system, and
constraints to the effort.



Background
The entrance of Digicel into PNG in 2007 and the ensuing competition between it and B-Mobile has led to a
fivefold increase in mobile phone accounts. Within a year, there were over 1 million subscribers, the majority of
which were Digicel customers. These numbers already surpass the number of bank accounts in the country. And
this situation is likely to continue, as it is estimated that 80% of the population will have cell reception by 2010.

In October 2008 the ADB, IFC, and INA sponsored a “Mobile Money” conference in PNG that brought stakeholders
together to share ideas on how financial service providers and others could take advantage of the growing
telecommunications network to offer financial services. A number of issues raised were addressed in a separate
report prepared by Bankable Frontier Associates.
Population
PNG is home to approximately 6 to 6.5 million persons, a sizeable market that is believed to have the potential
to support a vibrant mobile money sector.2 More than 85% of the population still lives in rural villages, many
in quite remote areas that are poorly linked by road and sea. Rural dwellers are most heavily concentrated in
Morobe and the three Highland provinces, which account for approximately 40% of the population.

Less than 250,000 persons in PNG are formally employed, only about 1 in 25 persons. Approximately 75% of the
informal work force is dependent on farming. According to the 2000 census, households tend to be large with
over half of all households consisting of six persons or more.3

PNG Economy
PNG’s GDP was estimated at near US$6 to $6.5 billion in 2008 or 21.5 billion kina. Mining, petroleum, forestry, and
the industries that process these resources account for close to 50% of GDP. The remainder is split between
agriculture, fisheries, and services. Exports approached US$5 billion in 2008, with gold, copper and crude oil
worth over US$1 billon each. This compares favorably to imports of $2.6 billion, a large part of which is for
capital equipment related to the extractive industries. PNG runs a significant deficit in services, including
financial services, of nearly $1.5 billion.

Mining and logging also play significant roles in the economy. A new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project may
surpass mining as the largest industry in coming years. It is estimated that this could double PNG’s current
GDP, which would have a significant impact on the economy. More information about these industries can be
found in the Natural Resources section of this report.

Presently, the Government is the largest employer with an estimated 76,980 public employees, 47,039 of
which work for the national government. The remaining individuals are on the payrolls of state-owned entities
or provincial governments.4 The 2009 budget provides for nearly $700 million in public sector salaries and
benefits for both national government and provincial offices.5

  	 The most recent census was conducted in 2000 and will be updated in 2010. The estimate of 6 million is linked to fertility rates but more recent
	   estimates suggest the 2000 census undercounted rural areas and the population is closer to 6.5 million.

GNI per capita is approximately $730,6 but that figure is not reflective of the reality faced by the majority of
population. Among farmers without off-farm sources of revenue, the estimated average gross household income
was 6,834 kina ($2,665), which suggests an income per capita at closer to $400. Differences in income between
provinces is significant, with the Western Highland and East New Britain districts having the highest incomes,
while Morobe and Milne Bay have the lowest.7 (Refer to Table 2)

At least 42% of households interviewed for an agricultural survey said that within their households there was at
least one person who had another form of income. Again, the proportion of these additional income earners was
highest in the Western Highlands. Sources of additional income included government employment and small
businesses.8 (Refer to Appendix 2 for detailed information).

Banking and financial services
Legal and Regulatory Issues
From a legal and regulatory perspective, PNG does not actively prohibit most mobile money models or agent
banking relationships.9 However, the lack of specific regulations also raises uncertainty for potential mobile
money providers, particularly non-banks. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has indicated that to mitigate
this risk while also encouraging innovation, it will address all applicants’ requirements on a case-by-case basis
until such time as regulations are developed. BPNG plans to have a collaborative process to develop appropriate
mobile money regulations, an approach through which interested parties can engage iteratively with BPNG. This
method will be used with both banks and non-banks, and will serve as a means to overcome PNG’s challenging
geographic, cultural, and security environments to make mobile money “transformative,” bringing financial
services to millions of new clients.

Know your customer (KYC) and other issues related to opening accounts are less onerous for domestic banks,
whereas the Australian banks are still required to follow Australia’s regulations. 10

  	     The most recent census was conducted in 2000 and will be updated in 2010. The estimate of 6 million is linked to fertility rates but more recent estimates
	       suggest the 2000 census undercounted rural areas and the population is closer to 6.5 million.
10
    	   Domestic banks and the microbanks in particular require nominal “official” identification and rely more heavily on letters from the equivalent of notaries in
	       communities, whereas the Australian banks follow the 100 points system.
Demand
Access to financial services in PNG is still quite limited. While there is no firm data, it is estimated that there
are 2.5 million adults in PNG. Among these, an estimated 500,000 have one or more accounts with the four
commercial banks in PNG. An additional 175,000 clients are served by one of the two licensed microfinance
banks in the country and perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 more are served through Savings and Loan Societies
(SLS).11 It is likely that there is considerable overlap between the banks, microbanks and SLSs.

Interviews suggest that there is demand for secure savings services among low-income households, as well
as loans for specific lifecycle needs. Additional research should be carried out to confirm this supposition.
In 2003, the ADB-PNG Microfinance Project commissioned a feasibility study for starting a new MFI12 that
included a survey of 190 low-income households in Port Moresby. Since this study is now more than five years
old and limited to a single urban area, the figures should be suspected of being out of date. However, recent
research suggests that many of the findings remain valid. Some of the key findings included:

l	             75% said that there are no banks, credit unions, formal, or informal savings schemes that are
	              accessible to them 45% of people do not save money because there are no opportunities to save

network and reduce the number of teller transactions in its branches.15 BSP has shown the greatest commitment
to retail banking, developing nearly 70 agencies with the Post Office (Post PNG) and District Treasury Offices
(DTOs) to provide deposit accounts in most districts. It is also the first bank in PNG to test a mobile money
solution, which will allow clients to check balances, purchase goods and services, and transfer funds to other BSP
account holders.

Although ANZ makes the majority of its profit from high value customers, they have a large retail position as well.
Approximately 90% of their total customer base comes from the mass market and has average balances of only
$200 or less. The company has 45 ATMs and 860 POS terminals around the country.16 ANZ is the dominant player
among coffee exporters, and also has a number of the other major importers and exporters among its client
base. ANZ’s launch of WING in Cambodia, a mobile money solution designed for low income account holders, has
opened new possibilities in retail banking for ANZ in PNG and the Pacific.

The two microbanks, Nationwide Microfinance Bank (NMB) and PNG Microfinance Limited (PML), are still small
but are providing access to savings to tens of thousands of households, with approximately 60,000 and 116,000
accounts respectively. Most microbank branches are now near existing commercial bank branches;17 however
expansion plans for both include entering unbanked markets.

The 21 Savings and Loan Societies (SLS) attracted tens of thousands of members, but many are inactive and are
disappearing from provinces. The largest SLS are professional-based, such as the Teachers SLS and Police and
State Services SLS. Of the regionally based SLS, East New Britain SLS is the largest. Like the microbanks, the
largest SLS are located near bank branches. Members join because of the promise to receive loans. It is likely that
many members are also account holders with a bank.18

The microbanks and the SLS largely rely on commercial banks to manage cash.

The ability, and cost, to open and maintain a deposit account vary across banks and microbanks. The Bankable
Frontier Associates survey suggests the cost as a percentage of GNI per capital per month ranges from 1.1%-6%.
As noted above, however, the typical household income may be only 50-60% of average GNI/per capita, which
would double these percentages. The cost of travel to the nearest bank branch is also considerable in PNG.

Gaps

Increasing financial inclusion faces a number of hurdles related to broadening access and deepening services.
These include:
l	    Broadening access requires increasing the number of service points, which necessitates improvements
	     in communications, middle management, and cash management.19 As the mobile networks in PNG
	     become more competitive and expand, many of the communications issues will be overcome in the next
	     few years, enabling most branches and agencies to communicate in real time. Improving middle
	     management and the movement of cash, however will remain problematic in the medium-term. More
	     remote	 branches are likely to remain cost centers, offering primarily savings and transfer services


15
   	 Kundu Cards are debit cards that work within BSP’s domestic payment network. These cards are not connected to VISA or MasterCard systems due to
	    high transaction fees associated with those services. However, BSP also offers a VISA debit card to customers who wish to have the additional
	    international purchasing ability this card offers.
16
   	 ANZ rural banking in Fiji and the Solomon islands is provided through mobile bank branches (trucks). It is largely manual and, therefore, costly. It has
	 successfully reached over 70,000 rural depositors in the Pacific.
17
   	 The exception is in Western Province where PML is the only formal services provider.
18
   	 In one SLS visited, the management estimated that nearly all of its members also had bank accounts.
19
   	 Many of the BSP agencies in the DTOs, and many of the bank and microbank branches, are offline. Post offices operate mostly via fax and phone calls, which
	 are often unreliable and result in delays that have enabled fraudulent activities in the past.
	           with few opportunities to build earning assets. This requires finding ways to reduce the costs of
	           serving these markets and reduce the need for cash management.
l	           Deepening access necessitates improving and increasing products. Savings and the secure
	            movement of money are in great demand among low income households. Existing service providers
	            are not meeting client needs. Monthly fees remain unpopular, even as low as BSP’s 2 kina per month
	            fee.20 For small savers, this equates to a cost of 3-4% of their bank balance per. Money transfer fees
	            are also high through banks and the salim moni kwik service from the post offices.
l	           PNG’s settlement and clearing systems are still rudimentary. It can take up to fourteen days to
	            realize a check between banks. It is also not a fully secure system. Yet despite theses challenges,
	            the use of checks persists due to the lack of other affordable means to transfer cash. BPNG is
	            working on revamping the clearing and settlement system into a two tiered system: one for banks
	            and finance companies with real time clearing and another for non-banks with end of day settlement.
l	           Interoperability will remain an issue for some time in PNG. Banks operated through proprietary
	            EFTPOS networks such that a single retailer may have two or three POS devices. Interoperability
	            requires a real time clearing system as well as the willing (or required) participation of financial
	            institutions. Such as system is ideal, although not a requirement, for a mobile money system. This
	            paper assumes that a mobile money system will happen before interoperability is a reality.



Telecommunications Sector
Legal and Regulatory Issues                                                                                                                               
Pangtel was originally the regulator of the telecommunications industry. In a February 2008 ICT Policy, the
Government sought to remove the monopolistic powers of Telikom PNG by removing exclusive rights to
general carriers.21 At that time, ICCC was given more authority to regulate telecom.

Unfortunately, the bifurcation of responsibilities between Pangtel and ICCC were fraught with political
challenges. As a result, a new 450-page National ICT Policy was released in early February 2009 and approved
by NEC at the end of March 2009. This document consolidates all telecommunications regulation under one
body, which will be a restructured version of Pangtel. Since the policy was released only recently, it is unclear
what the implications of these changes will be on the industry nor is it clear how quickly changes will be
implemented.

Demand
It is difficult to quantitatively assess the demand for mobile communications in PNG. The rapid uptake of
Digicel’s mobile phone offering, which started in mid-2007, is indicative of the level of demand. Both mobile
providers in the country believe there is strong opportunity for growth, and one suggested that at least 50%
of the population of PNG would have a cell phone in the next 5 to 6 years.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that usage patterns vary across the country, but it is highest in urban areas. In more
rural areas, researchers found that usage is greatest in the Western Highlands, Morobe, and Central provinces.23
(Refer to Appendix 1 for more details.)

As with banks, interoperability is between the two MNOs and Telikom PNG. Recent news articles have pointed out
the inequities and high cost of calling and texting across networks.

Supply
There are two mobile operators, majority government owned B-Mobile (with NAsFUND and other investors) and
privately held Digicel. Digicel has 800,000 customers while B-Mobile has about 200,000. Because of the high
cost of calling out of network (inter-connectivity), many customers have two SIM cards. Therefore, the number
of unique customers is most likely less than 1 million.

Movement of Cash
Over the past 35 years, PNG has had a rapid transition from a traditional barter economy to a cash economy.
Although a large percentage of the estimated one million rural households still depend on subsistence farming
as their primary livelihood, a growing number are participating in the cash economy through growing cash
crops and receiving government or private cash transfers.
                                                                          Figure 2: BSP Branch Network25
Role of Financial Institutions
From the BPNG, cash moves out to the
commercial banks in Port Moresby. BSP plays
a unique role of being the conduit for cash on
behalf of BPNG, operating cash distribution
centers in three provinces. Its branch
network is widely used for cash distribution
by the post office, government, and other
financial institutions. Cash is also distributed
through the ATM networks of banks, although
most ATMs are adjacent to bank branches.24
EFTPOS are still a minor cash distribution
mechanism, but is increasing. Shopkeepers
and retailers suggested that EFTPOS were
                                                                                                                      11
used by 10-20% of their customers, yet to
date, less than 5% used it for cash back – a
service provided by some shops that allows
customers to get additional cash when they
use a debit card for their purchase.

The public must visit a bank branch, ATM, or
affiliated location to access their incomes, deposit funds, or perform other financial transactions. This is an
onerous process for most people - whether they live in urban or rural locations. Queues at the banks can often
last an hour or more and customers may have to go through this process several times a week because they
are reluctant to carry even relatively small sums of cash. Theft, often violent, is a common problem in PNG.
In fact, it is so pervasive that it was mentioned in every interview. In addition to the lines, peri-urban and
rural dwellers have to add travel time and cost to the time they spend waiting in line at the bank, making their
experience even more expensive.

Cash Movement: From Urban to Rural
There are five primary sources of cash movement from urban centers to citizens in the outlaying areas. These
include:

1.	            Government agencies and corporate entities that employ tens of thousands of individuals across the
	              country and fund provincial and district employees and projects.
2.	            Exporters that are wholesale purchasers of key commodity crops, such as oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and
	              coconut. These networks reach hundreds of thousands of individuals either directly or indirectly
	              through buyers and processors.

24
     	 There is one private ATM provider, Kwik Cash, linked to BSP with locations in retail stores.

3.	        Natural resource industries, such as mining and forestry that are paying communities royalties for land
	          use and subsidies to compensate for environmental damage. Payments are made either through
	          incorporated land groups (ILGs) or directly to households, so it is difficult to know exactly how many
	          tens of thousands ofhouseholds receive payments.
4.	        The Fisheries industry, which functions as both an exporter of fish from open waters to the coastal
	          areas as well as the employer of about 8,000 people in canneries.
5.	        Domestic remittances, which are sent through trusted family members or the Post Office money
	          transfer service. No firm number of domestic remittance recipients is available, but it is widely believed
	          that most of PNG’s million or more households receive some form of remittances from family members
	          who are employed and/or live in urban areas.

Government
The national government can play a major role in a mobile money environment in two ways. First it can put
money into the system through its payroll. Second its district treasury offices are already acting as agents for
BSP, albeit imperfectly, and have the most extensive network of offices of any organization other than Post
PNG.

Government moves money in two ways. First, it employs
                                                                                                         Box 2: Teachers and Nurses

loans - often up to 50% of their annual salaries - that are paid
through direct deduction over the course of the year.

Second, the national government operates district treasury offices (DTOs) in the 89 districts in the country. These
offices are primarily check printing facilities, set up to pay local contractors under the District Service Improvement
Program.27 Checks are drawn on BSP. DTOs are also a collection point of government fees for licenses, registration,
and other similar services. 68 DTOs act as BSP agents under a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry
of Finance. The DTOs employ civil servants as agent bankers, who are equipped with an EFTPOS device and
basic books. Most DTOs only offer passbook accounts and have strict limits on monthly withdrawals. The agent is
responsible for transporting cash in excess of the allowable petty cash (5000 kina) to the nearest BSP branch.

Other large employers operate in much the same way as the government. All the larger companies that were
interviewed talked about paying their employees electronically. This is not always easy to set up because many of

the employed do not have bank accounts, or the identification necessary to obtain an account. One employer
interviewed described a process through which they provided all their employees with employee numbers,
which could serve as a form of identification to obtain a bank account. This was the only way that this company
could avoid dealing in cash.

Commodity Exporters
Most commodities in PNG are grown by small landholders and individual farmers, rather than at large
plantations. Exporters will purchase crops from wholesalers and individual farmers--basically any seller
that appears at their collection points. The exporter makes most payments via check or direct deposit to a
bank account. From that point down the chain, most transactions take place in cash. Everyone in the chain,
exporters included, are eager to find ways to minimize operating in cash.


                                                       Box 3: Portrait of a Coffee Buyer

     Mr. Kiopa is an independent coffee buyer who owns a truck. The primary qualifications to be a buyer are to own a truck
     and to have good contacts. He drives around the Eastern Highlands and   buys from over 100 small landholders and
     farmers.  He is unsure of how many individuals provide his coffee as many villages pool their crops and one or two
     individuals sell on the village’s behalf. Mr. Kiopa calls villages he plans to visit in advance with his mobile phone, telling
     them the day’s price as well as the time he will be in their area.  Villagers bring their coffee to the road at the agreed
     time.  Mr. Kiopa pays cash, carrying around 10,000 kina in the low season and 20,000 kina in the high season. He buys
     low grade parchment (3 kina per kg. or 3.2 kina if there is a village middleman). Mr. Kiopa takes his coffee to a dry factory
     and pays 0.20 kina per kg. for processing.  Thus he pays a total of between 3 to 3.4 kina per kg, and he sells the processed
     beans for 5-5.25 kina per kg.  Villagers sell to Mr. Kiopa because they make more selling to him than they would make if                                  13
     they had to transport the coffee to a buyer themselves.  

     Mr. Kiopa goes to ANZ bank daily, waiting up to 1/2 - 11/2 hours to withdraw or deposit money.  He estimates there are
     anywhere from 50-100 freelance buyers such as himself in Eastern Highlands.


Oil palm, coffee, cocoa, and coconut are the primary commodity exports in PNG, in order of size.28 Exporters,
traders and processors of many agricultural products tend to have main offices in both Lae and Port Moresby
because there are no roads to connect these two major cities.29 Some exporters also have branches in other
major cities. They purchase commodities from wholesalers, village organizations, small landholders, and
individual farmers that come to them. Although there are some differences, the overall process of purchasing
and cash management in these commodity value chains is similar for all commodities.

At the exporter’s level, most transactions are done via check or direct deposit, requiring the seller to visit a
bank branch to obtain cash.30 Wholesale buyers need cash to be able to purchase directly from smaller buyers
or from the farmers themselves.

PNG is the world’s seventh largest oil palm producer and the third largest exporter of oil palm. Most oil palm
is harvested at estates that are supported by large private sector investments in oil palm milling companies.
Estate growers generally pay their employees in cash or through bank transfers. As expected, most small
landholders are paid in cash by exporters or wholesale buyers. With an estimated 40,000 or more small
landholders producing oil palm across five areas, that is a lot of cash transactions.31
28
   	 Vegetables, such as potatoes and tomatoes are also grown at the village level, but these are primarily sold domestically.
29
   	 Different industries also have a strong regional presence, with regional hubs in Goroka and Hagen for coffee, in Rabaul for cocoa, and in Kimbe for oil
	 palm. Lae, as a port town, and Port Moresby, as the seat of government and financial center, dominate.
30
   	 Further investigation is needed into commodities other than coffee. Some exporters pay cash at processing factories and there are stories of oil palm
	 buyers (directly employed by exporters) carrying significant amounts of cash to smallholders.
31
  	 Hoskins and Bialla West New Britain, Popondetta, Milne Bay, and New Ireland are the five areas. Some 14,500 blocks were farmed by an average of 2.9
	 families in 2001.

Coffee is the major export from the Highlands. Unlike oil palm there are very few large coffee plantations remaining,
so exporters source coffee from an estimated 400,000 households. Buying is accomplished either directly from
farmers at the exporter’s dry factory or, more likely, through buyers and processors. These intermediaries
can either be employed by the exporter, or they may be independent agents. Exporters pay with a check at dry
factories and with cash for most off-site purchases. More than half of all coffee is purchased by individual buyers,
who transact in cash.

As a point of interest, all the players across the commodities purchasing value chain – from farmers to exporters
– are starting to use mobile phones to obtain pricing information, identify markets, and determine market demand.
Usage varies by province. (Refer to Appendix 1 for detailed information about these patterns.)

Natural Resource Industries
Mines, gas and logging firms are required to make payments to tens of thousands of households and land
groups - often quarterly. These payments are small, determined in advance, and could be an excellent
way to capitalize a mobile money system. They are also controversial because royalties are often paid to
incorporated land groups (ILGs) or landowner companies formed for this purpose, which may make them
neither representative nor transparent. Many of those involved in the process are seeking a better means to
ensure payments reach intended beneficiaries.

Six mines in five provinces contribute 50% of the country’s export revenue and 20% of its GDP ($1.2 billion).
One company, Ok Tedi Mining Ltd, which mines both gold and copper, is the largest business contributor to
the economy, providing 25% of PNG’s export earnings and employing 2,000 people. About 2% of the company’s

                                                   Box 4: Ok Tedi Compensation Payments

     The Ok Tedi Mine is the largest single contributor to PNG’s GDP.   The company is also responsible for substantial
     environmental damage that results from the release of over 90,000 tons of rock waste and tailings into the Fly River
     System in the Western Province.  

     A 1994 lawsuit resulted in a $125 million settlement and transfer of 10% of the company’s shares to the government.  With the
     intensification of damage a decade later, negotiations with the affected communities, government, and the mine resulted
     in an agreement to pay 1.2 billion kina ($350 million) in direct payments, projects and services over a 5-year period. Part of
     this includes direct support of women and children.

     This mandate required updating census information in Western Province to identify beneficiaries and to determine how
     to make payments to women who had virtually no access to banking services.   PNG Microfinance, Ltd. (PML) won the
     tender to provide these payments, which amount to approximately 5 million kina ($1.7 million) per quarter to  over 11,000
     households.

     Cash is transported by boat to five PML branches in the province.  Most money is withdrawn and spent in the stores near
     the PML branches.  PML notes that most of those stores bank with BSP, which has a lone branch on the coast in Daru.  PML
     speculates that the cash returns the way it came – by boat.


dividends, or $9.4 million, are paid to landowners, usually through trusts.

At the same time, Ok Tedi Mining is negatively impacting the environment as well as the lives of the people
who live in areas around the mine. The company is now compensating locals for this destruction through                                                         15
two means. Following the exit of BHP Billiton in 2001, the company transferred its 52% ownership to a long-
term trust, PNG Sustainable Development, which uses resultant dividends for building sustainable activities
beyond the life of the mine.33 In addition, compensation payments of approximately $6.9 million are made
directly to female heads of households. A total of 11,000 households, or about 80,000 people, benefit from
these payments. However, due to the challenges in reaching them, many beneficiaries travel long distances,
sometimes for days, to reach a branch to get the money.

Logging and related industries are not as critical as mining, but they are more extensive. These contribute
significantly to PNG, providing approximately 7% to 9% of GDP (over $500 million), with exports averaging 500
million kina. The government has been the primary beneficiary of the timber industry, receiving in excess of
$30 to $35 million from export taxes in recent years. Compared to mining, the logging industry alleges that it is
not very profitable, and has actually reported losses in recent years. Although there are 29 forest concessions,
one company, Rimbunan Hijau (RH), controls over 45% of log exports and five companies together control over
80% of the market. Altogether the logging industry is estimated to employ between 8,000-11,000 persons with
the logging companies directly employing 3,500, mostly in Western Province, Gulf Province, East and West
New Britain, Milne Bay and Central Province, and the West Sepik and Madang Provinces.

As with mining, the timber industry pays royalties to landowners, who reportedly receive 15% of gross receipts
from the sale of logs ($17 to $20 million per year).34 Most of these funds are paid directly by RH and other
companies to incorporated land groups (ILG) in cash. These payments are quickly absorbed by local stores,
many of which are owned by the companies that make them. This is particularly true in remote areas. Logging
is highly controversial and the Government of PNG, the United Nations and the Government of Norway have
joined together to reduce logging by allowing several countries, including PNG, to trade carbon credits for its
preserved forest. The Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) mechanism will

facilitate carbon credit payments to PNG, some of which is intended for the landowners. There is much debate
over the newly formed Office of Climate Control and Environmental Sustainability (OCC&ES) and whether it, or
the Forestry Authority, has the right to issue trading permits and manage receipts.35 In addition, the recipient
of the funds has not yet been determined - the mechanism may operate through ILGs or, potentially, through
individual households. With all of its challenges, this subsidy has the potential to put cash in the pockets of tens of
thousands or rural Papua New Guineans.

A new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project may surpass mining as the largest industry in coming years. It is predicted
that as much as 11 billion kina ($4 billion) in annual export revenue could be generated. It has been claimed that
this could double PNG’s current GDP, although the government estimates are more conservative. Regardless, it
could have significant impact on the economy and the people. Payments to government and landowners in the
Southern Highlands and Gulf Province combined are estimated to be $900 million.36 The mechanism for payment
has not been determined, although it is estimated some 4,100 households and 23,760 persons will directly benefit.
The Minister for Petroleum and Energy recently announced his support for sharing the revenue broadly with all
unemployed citizens.37

Fisheries Industry
The importance of fishing industries in PNG was touched on toward the conclusion of the research. Although
the number of fishers involved was not obtained, preliminary data suggests that this industry is probably
another source of capital flows into the market. Further research should be carried out to augment the limited
information obtained.

What was determined during this study is that there are two aspects to the fishing industry in PNG: international
export and canning. As much as 12 million kina ($4.8 million) in cash receipts enters the market each year through
the export trade and additional 10 million kina ($4 million) come from the canning business. More than 8,000
people work in canning factories, all of who are paid through direct deposit. Notably 80% of the canning workers
are women.

Domestic Remittances
Domestic remittances are conducted through Post PNG or by trusted individuals, who carry cash from city
workers to their families in villages. Both methods are costly and can be time consuming. While there are no
clear estimates, it is widely accepted that every village and most rural households benefit from incoming
money transfers.

As in all countries, domestic remittances are a major mover of cash from urban to rural areas. Most village
families have at least one member that works in a town or city, who sends money home on a regular basis.

Post PNG has 44 offices and 43 agencies around PNG, 12 of which provide money transfer and other banking
services as agents for BSP. In addition, Post PNG offers the country’s most popular non-bank money transfer
system, known as salim moni kwik (SMK). SMK is available in less than half of the Post branches and agencies
because of security risks. Even at those locations that do offer the SMK service, cash is not always available.
When that happens, customers are turned away and asked to return later to obtain their funds. Communication
between post office branches and the head office is primarily through faxes. SMK provides more than 50% of
Post PNG’s revenue, so it is a very important service to them.

Cash Movement: From Rural to Urban
There are three primary means that cash moves from rural areas back to urban centers. These include:

1.	       Import companies that bring international goods into PNG, and then disburse both these and
	         domestic products to retail outlets across the country.
2.	       Wholesale distributors and retail chains make up a significant portion of the distribution chain for
	         retail goods, with the latter being the ultimate point of purchase for most individuals in the country.
3.	       Mobile network operators (MNOs) use a distribution network of wholesale and retail distributors as
	         well as tucker shops to sell airtime to local populations. Mobile phone top-up is now a large source of
	         cash movement from rural to urban areas.

Although banks and Post PNG play a major role in helping individuals and companies move cash from rural to
urban areas, they remain net cash disbursers in rural areas. Banks have often described their movement of            17
cash as a “conveyer belt” that moves money in one direction – from urban to rural. This is the case despite the
fact that there are regular electronic transactions to credit rural and provincial accounts and debit those of the
large companies in Port Moresby and Lae. Similarly district treasury offices remain net cash disbursers even
though district and provincial governments also collect cash for taxes, fees, leases, fines, and other official
business. Auto dealers were frequently mentioned as a means of moving cash from rural to urban areas, and,
as such, are worthy of note. However, most purchases of vehicles and large equipment are carried out without
a physical movement of cash.

Import Companies
There are a relatively small number of major importers that have long-established distribution networks.
In some cases, the importers work only with a limited number of wholesale distributors, in other cases they
have relationships down to the retail level. Thus some importers have a stronger network that could be
leveraged for cash-in/cash-out purposes than others.

Importers, wholesalers, and mobile network operators work through a combination of direct sales and
indirect sales through decentralized distribution networks. PNG is a net importer of most durables and
many consumables. Major importers include Trukai Industries, which is the countries largest rice importer,
International Food Corporation, (imported canned fish), Frabelle (canned tuna), Globe (corned beef), and Seeto
Kui (dry goods and retail items). Transport is handled directly by buyers, or through a limited number of
trucking and shipping companies. A handful of companies in PNG provide these services at a macro level,
from which the distribution process decentralizes to independent truckers.

Rice, a major commodity import, is widely consumed throughout PNG. The largest importer, Trukai Industries,
has 1,100 employees and operates distribution points in 12 locations around the country. Domestic sales
BUILDING A MOBILE MONEY DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA




range from 35 to 50 million kina per month ($14-20 million). Trukai deals directly with a relatively small, trusted
group of 80 to 100 wholesale distributors. These distributors use trucks or boats to pick up rice from one of
Trukai’s distribution depots, or they contract with Trukai to have the goods delivered to a central location. Trukai
outsources transport to one or two trucking and shipping companies. These transport companies also work with
exporters; so they might transport rice to rural areas and then bring coffee back on their next run to the urban
centers. Trukai is paid by its wholesale buyers via check or direct deposit. Most transactions below this level,
from distributors to retail, are through cash. In essence, then, the truckers become cash points.

Seeto Kui, another major importer, has a different model than Trukai. In this case, the company imports a range
of commodities, dry goods, and retail items. Like Trukai, they do not operate retail stores. Seeto Kui has over
350 “customers” – a mixture of wholesale distributors and larger retailers. While Trukai buys rice from multiple
sources, then bags and brands it “Trukai”, Seeto Kui has established exclusive relationships with a number of
international brands, such as Heinz and Proctor & Gamble. The company has a staff of 30 sales people that “push”
these products to their customers as well as over 100 merchandisers who manage the brands. These brand
managers visit each Seeto Kui customer at least twice per month. Other than cases where Seeto Kui has a strong
relationship with a customer, all sales are paid upfront. Only when cash has been deposited or transferred to
Seeto Kui’s account will the company begin to package a shipment. Those customers that have the means will
send their own trucks to one of Seeto Kui’s two distribution centers to pick up their merchandise. Otherwise,
Seeto Kui contracts with a trucking company to deliver the goods. At the local level, all product purchases are
made in cash.

Wholesale distributors and retail chains
There are only a few national retail chains and most also act as wholesalers in areas where they do not directly
operate. There is little supplier credit and most wholesale is done through electronic money transfer or “cash
and carry” at the warehouse. Retail chains are already set up for cash back (a service that provides additional
cash after a debit card is used for purchase) and are natural cash-out points. However, their reach is limited
to the major and secondary cities.

PNG is home to a small number of large firms, many of which combine wholesale and retail stores. These are
primarily in the secondary cities, but through these stores and distribution networks they effectively provide the
entire country with consumables and durables.

Papindo is has one of the largest retail chains in PNG, with 35 branches. Papindo has grocery and variety stores
and also has several locations that are “cash and carry”. Out of its single distribution center in Lae, Papindo
manages to restock most of its shops bi-weekly. Papindo stores offer EFTPOS and cash back services, although
only about 1-2% of their customers use these services - and those are primarily BSP customers. Not surprisingly,
many Papindo stores are authorized Digicel resellers.

SVS (Super Value Stores) operates 16 SVS stores in seven cities as well as supplying six wholesalers in Port
Moresby and a group of retailers primarily out of Lae. As with most wholesalers, the majority of SVS’ inventory is
imported and only 30-40% is produced and bought locally. SVS has its own trucks and manages its own transport
to its stores and wholesalers.

Chemica operates like many other wholesalers/retail chains except that their primary focus is on home and
farming supplies. They have eight stores all supplied from Lae through which they also wholesale to smaller
chains and individual stores. Several of their stores offer “cash and carry.” In the Highlands, Chemica’s Goroka
store is the major wholesaler to several hardware stores in Mount Hagen and Goroka. Chemica stores in
Goroka have approximately 500-600 sales daily, approximately 10% of are transacted via EFTPOS. Only 1% of
Chemica’s customer base in Goroka takes advantage of their cash back service. There are a handful of other
large wholesalers and retail chains that could also be important points in the cash-out infrastructure in PNG.
These include grocery and variety chains like Brian Bell, Tropicana, Ltd., and TST as well as the conglomerate
WR Carpenters. SP Brewery is also a major distributor in PNG.

Mobile Network Operators
Digicel and/or its distribution partners, Flex and Oceanic, are likely candidates to build an agent network like
those in Kenya and the Philippines, where payment services
                                                                            Box 5: Credit Me, Credit You

Digicel’s distribution model is widely admired in PNG. Aside
from its successful contribution to Digicel’s core business,
it is also providing a new model in PNG for branding,
promotion, and speed to market. Digicel has 12 “flagship” (corporate) stores and a list of 151 retailers that
are a combination of “stores in stores” (i.e. Digicel shops within larger stores operated by retails chains like
Papindo and SVS) and smaller independent franchises. Retailers can sign up new subscribers in addition to
selling airtime and other Digicel merchandise. Retailers most often buy and resell Digicel’s product rather than
operate on consignment.

Digicel also works with two distributors, Oceanic and Flex to distribute and sell pre-paid airtime cards. Recently,
Digicel has allowed these two companies to market other Digicel merchandise.38 Together Oceanic and Flex
have a direct sales staff of over 600 people.

Now that Digicel’s initial roll out phase has been completed, the sales staff is shifting from direct sales to
signing up sub-distributors, a process that includes more small individual resellers and that will extend its
reach in the provinces. Flex and Oceanic operate through a network of approximately 100 sub-distributors.
They also rely on 47 post office branches to further augment their networks.




 	 Flex is 50% owned by Digicel and is the smaller of Digicel’s two distributors.

Cash Usage Patterns at the Village Level
Villagers do not have a high requirement to spend at the local level because there is little to buy. Payment
for social obligations and small food and sundry items from local tucker shops are the primary use of cash at
home. When villagers do spend money for other items, they usually travel outside of the village to make their
purchase. This is true whether they are paying school fees or buying clothes. These usage patterns suggest
that other than social payments there is little need for cash at the village level.

According to the interviews conducted for this study, villagers spent very little money at the local level.40 In fact,
some of the women said that they had no need for money – and if they did, they would pull up a few vegetables
and sell them along the road. Money was needed for large, occasional expenditures. A typical family’s largest
regular expenditures include school fees, social obligations, and clothing. Non-subsistence farmers may also
have larger, regular expenses related to fertilizers and farming tools. Almost all families visit secondary cities
on a regular basis where they spend (and sometimes receive) their funds. (Refer to Appendix 4 to see the small
amounts spent at the village level).

These qualitative findings are consistent with the survey of 335 farmers conducted by the Fresh Produce and
Development Agency. According to that work, other important purchases, particularly in Western Highlands
and Eastern Highlands were home construction materials and agricultural products. (Refer to Appendix 3 for
additional details on spending patterns in 5 provinces across PNG).

 	 This may not be the case for those individuals that live in extremely remote locations, however.
40
Building a mobile money ecosystem in PNG
The premise of this study was to look at potential cash agents in the event that a bank, mobile operator, or
payment service provider wished to launch a money transfer service. However, initial research suggests that
there is an opportunity to expand beyond a limited money transfer solution to introduce a broader mobile
money system that enables individuals to store, carry, transfer value, and perform a range of other financial
transactions through a mobile device.

It’s not about cashing in or out, it’s about cash safety
Cash leads to personal insecurity because theft and violence are so prominent in significant segments of the
society. This is true from the major city down to the rural level. Most of those interviewed have been victims
of crime in the past year. Thus, virtually everyone interviewed expressed concern about the problems with
carrying cash, and asked for a means to make the movement of money more secure. Even among family
members there is a risk of theft or misuse of funds. As a result, it is unadvisable to develop a solution that
links a mobile phone number to an individual’s virtual or actual bank account because of the high incidence of
phone theft.

There is enormous pressure to fulfill social obligations, such as paying bride prices and reparations. The
demands are particularly urgent to those who are perceived to have more money than others in the family
or larger social unit. For this reason, most people are secretive about their income and assets. Many of the
people interviewed chose not to share information about their income from coffee, vegetables, or other small
businesses – even with family members. Several mentioned that they hide money in their homes or bury it
nearby. Husbands and wives may not even know where their spouse has hidden funds. This means that when                                               21
someone dies unexpectedly, the wealth they have accumulated may be lost forever to their family members
– at a time when it is most vital.41

Start with the major money suppliers to catalyze a mobile money system
Mobile money systems benefit from an immediate market opportunity. PNG is very much a top down economy,
with money flowing from a few major sources - government agencies, exporters, mining companies, fisheries
- based in the largest cities to the rest of the country. By associating with a number of these major companies,
mobile money providers could begin to catalyze a movement from cash to electronic value. It could also help
to draw people to bank accounts over time if the mobile money provider is a bank or works closely with a bank.
Electronic government salary payments in PNG could reach tens of thousands. The same could be true of the
mining and lumber industries. In essence, this would be an important part of the cash-in movement. Once
recipients have money in the system, they are more likely to look for ways to use mobile money to save and
transact.

Cash-out where people buy and sell, not where they live
While “cash is king” in rural PNG, the volume of daily transactions is fairly modest as most families are
subsistence or semi-subsistence farmers. Families face only a few large expenditures that require saving,
borrowing, or some combination of the two. When in need, acquisition of capital is usually accomplished by
calling upon relatives in cities or through hording cash over a period of time. Most discretionary spending
takes place in towns or at markets, since there are limited spending opportunities in the villages. Even school
fees, one of the largest regular payments, is increasingly being paid in the cities at the bank rather than at the
village school.


 	 One of the reasons, the Government of PNG choose to change from paper to polymer money was to improve durability and prevent premature rotting.

BUILDING A MOBILE MONEY DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA




If villagers had access to a mobile money solution that allowed them to access their cash when they reached
the nearest town or market it may be sufficient for their needs. If schools, agriculture dealers, construction
companies, and other locations where people spend a lot of money began accepting electronic transactions, there
would be even more incentive to transition from cash. Villagers could maintain small amounts of cash at home
for local purchases. In essence villagers would have the option of two places to store their money - an “e-wallet”
or e-banking account for larger amounts and a secure place at home for those amounts needed to purchase soap,
batteries, or other small items from the village tucker shop.

The cash-out network already exists, but needs improvement
There is a well established, growing and underutilized EFTPOS network that includes merchants, post offices,
and BSP agents in DTOs that are already handling cash. The network is imperfect in many respects. It has much
duplication—a single retailer may operate multiple EFTPOS devices from different banks. The availability of cash,
telecommunications, and electricity causes regular service interruption among EFTPOS agents. Anecdotes from
both retailers and shoppers indicated that customers do not fully trust cash back and believe retailers will try to
give them less than they are due. Although fees on EFTPOS transactions are prohibited by law, interviews indicate
that many clients still believe fees are being charged.

A new network is not necessarily needed; rather the existing network needs to provide a better, more standardized
service. One of the attractions of mobile money solutions elsewhere is the standardization and branding of
the product. M-Pesa, WING, and WIZZIT agents have been trained, are easily identified and approachable, and
provide standardized service. There are many possible ways to achieve this in PNG. A bank provider of a mobile
solution could work closely with EFTPOS agents to provide training and improved branding. Alternatively, Digicel
or B-Mobile may wish to use their retail locations, many of which are located within retailers, to provide more
professional, reliable service utilizing the retailers’ EFTPOS. Even a third party could place sales staff with existing
EFTPOS agents or develop a franchise model that includes training and branding, but builds on the existing EFTPOS
infrastructure.

The cash-out network can be extended by recruiting cash takers
In addition to the existing EFTPOS network, there are also a relatively small number of import and distribution
companies that are responsible for pulling cash-out of the rural areas. (Refer to Appendix 5 for examples.) These
companies have merchandisers and a sales force that are in regular contact with retailers around the country.
Groups like Seeto Kui are also brand managers and accustomed to managing a brand identity through a diverse
group of retailers. The trucking companies used by these importers may also play a role. Their contribution
to moving cash and product requires more investigation. All of the importers interviewed expressed interest
in finding a means to avoid carrying cash between towns and cities and have the potential to be agents either
directly, or through their distributors or shippers.

Airtime distributors are also cash takers. As noted above, the two MNOs have a combined direct sales force
of around 600 who support retail sales and develop sub-distribution networks. The staff is trained, provides a
standardized, branded product, and reaches all socioeconomic levels. Airtime distributors currently struggle
with the secure movement of cash. Increasingly the distributors are outsourcing the risk to sub- distributors
and resellers who take the responsibility of moving excess cash to banks in order to purchase airtime through
electronic transfer. Although there is some uniformity among local airtime resellers, the distribution companies
are challenged in their attempts to maintain control over their distribution network. As an example, cards are
often sold at more than face value depending on the location, day, or time of week against the companies’
wishes.

Limited person-to-person (P2P) transfer is already available and accepted, and has the potential be “viral”
Credit Me, Credit You operates on a P2P platform that requires the sender of electronic airtime to be registered
with Digicel. It has already become viral in the sense that individuals can transact in airtime without going
through an agent. This mechanism is ideally suited for micro and small enterprises in rural areas, such as
coffee buyers or retail shops that make regular, small purchases from distributors. Small trade stores have
already become “spontaneous” airtime resellers - they have no direct relationship with either Digicel or B-
Mobile and may be several steps removed from the airtime distributors.

 *could also be used for cash in

There are various options to leverage this behavior for mobile financial services. A truly “viral” approach would
be to allow any holder of a mobile money account to transfer money freely to another holder, enabling them
to provide cash-in or cash-out services at any point. It would most likely start with those who have money and
bank accounts - those with salaries or businesses. To minimize risk, transaction amounts and volumes could
BUILDING A MOBILE MONEY DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA




be strictly limited. This laissez faire approach would make it difficult to control pricing and eliminate low levels of
fraud. However, people should quickly learn which viral “agents” are the most trustworthy and affordable in the
community, and these individuals will be given the majority of the transactional business.

Alternatively, a mobile money provider could take a more controlled “business to business” (B2B) approach,
requiring all agents to register and hold bank accounts. This replicates the approach that MNOs take with the
electronic top-up resellers. The model could be adapted by a range of players in the market to extend reach. For
example commodity buyers or distributors, which seek to reduce their volume of cash transactions, could become
agents and require that all financial transactions with their clients be carried out electronically. These top tier
buyers and sellers could encourage their distribution partners to sign up as agents as well, and could even support
them in the process. This would bring the agent network down another level. The primary concern of buyers and
distributors is to reduce their volume of cash transactions. Over time, this second tier of agents may see the
benefit of transacting with their customers electronically, and in encouraging those customers to function as
agents as well. Thus the proliferation of the model could begin to reach down to tucker shops and even individuals
that could become cash-in/cash-out points at the local level. Coffee buyers may pay growers electronically, but
provide cash-out during visits. Retail stores may start providing cash-out services to reduce their cash on hand
and then pay distributors electronically. The controls on this approach go beyond simple registration. Registered
agents would be conducting retail transacting through their own bank – or virtual accounts—not those of the
mobile money provider. Agents would therefore be careful to screen their partners and would have the ability to
block those who act irresponsibly.

A third approach is to target high volume transactions that are regular and common to most citizens. Rather than
create a completely open P2P or B2B system, special permissions could be granted for specific high volume,
recurring transactions, such as public transportation (bus and boat), school fees, utility payments (urban areas
only), and beetle nut vendors.42 Such an approach would be similar to already existing gift cards and public metro
cards. This will happen in the near future with airtime itself, as individuals link their bank account to their phone,
and then buy airtime directly through their mobile phone.

One opportunity when targeting specific transactions is the ability to structure the service to provide additional
value. For example, a school fee payment system could be linked to a stored value account, enabling account holders
to set aside - or save - funds for school fees over time. Or, frequent PMV (bus) riders could get discounts when
paying drivers through their mobile money account. Beetle nut vendors also present an interesting opportunity
because they are high volume cash takers - but, because they are so numerous, this group may be better suited
for the “viral” P2P approach.

Each of these approaches would require partnerships between the agents and the service provider, the mobile
phone provider, and, in most cases, a bank.

Major challenges to any “viral” approach include limited mobile coverage, connectivity failures, and difficulties
in recharging phones. Any of these problems could cause customers to have to return to an agent multiple
times until the systems are functioning and the agent has enough funds to satisfy the customer’s requirements.
Participation in the system at the mass population level is directly linked to the reliability of the network.




42
     	 DataNets currently offers an internet and terminal based product that enables utility clients to buy prepaid meter time.
An assumed advantage of a less structured approach is cost. The business model for mobile money has
not been definitively proven. Unlike airtime cards, which reward resellers with margins of 3-10% (or even
higher with “illegal” mark ups), the margins for a mobile money agent are significantly lower. Thus the more
opportunity there is for individuals to provide very low-value financial transactions without the need for
expensive oversight and management, the more likely a mobile money solution is to scale rapidly.

Mobile money solutions should be developed to reach the financially excluded
In order to reach the most potential customers, mobile money solutions should not only be designed to
accommodate the most common transactions, but the system must also be designed to include people that
do not own their own phones. Systems like M-Pesa thrive in part because they do not require a client to own
a phone - clients can transact through their own phones or directly through an agent. This is similar to the
existing EsiPay system in PNG that enables utility clients to pay their bills either directly through the Internet
or through an agent, usually a grocery store.

Although low-income households may not be directly linked to a major money supplier, it is likely that there
is only one degree of separation from someone who is. This may be a salaried relative, an ILG, or even a
neighboring schoolteacher or coffee grower.       Lower income households will need affordable, accessible
means to put cash into the system. While some cash-in/cash-out can take place through EFTPOS networks or
retail stores, these options have limited geographic outreach compared to Post PNG, schools, and the DTOs.
As a result, a comprehensive mobile money strategy should include a number of existing infrastructure players
to ensure scale of reach.
                                                                                                                     25
Further study is also recommended on the attitudes of the rural population toward different potential agents.
The authors repeatedly heard stories about poor service and high cost from within existing networks. Another
complaint was trust. Informally, interviewees ranked the following as “trusted”: (1) family, (2) churches and
schools, and (3) government offices (i.e., DTOs, Post PNG). Conversations suggest that neither banks nor
retailers ranked high. Many felt banks “eat people’s money” and retailers are not always honest. For these
reasons, receipts, passbooks, and other tangible proof of transactions are still valued, despite their many
inconveniences.

Stored value is demanded and requires risk management and education, not just regulation
While further research is merited, there appears to be a strong demand for a stored value solution rather
than a simple money transfer product. There is an understandable predisposition in the market toward bank-
led mobile money solutions because the stored value is a bank account in a regulated institution. However,
due to cost considerations, an exclusively “bank account linked” solution is unlikely to quickly reach scale with
the unbanked. There is a need to first make these individuals bank customers, which requires overcoming
a number of trust, education, and other related issues. BPNG seems open to non-bank solutions provided
risks are adequately addressed. This concern could be overcome through partnerships between the mobile
service providers and regulated financial institution(s) or the entry into the market of a company with a strong
reputation and “deep pockets” that is willing to share some of the risk.43 Regardless, non-bank providers will
need to proactively address the risks associated with holding stored value.

Some of the responsibility for risk management will necessarily fall on the clients, who are accustomed to
receiving scratch cards when they purchase airtime or receipts as proof of their transaction when obtaining cash
back. While the transition from airtime cards to EVD has just begun, interviews suggest that clients have been
fairly quick to adapt to e-receipts received on their phone. The ability to check account balances regularly and
review transactions, both of which are possible in existing systems, may provide a greater sense of security than
that the traditional passbook. This has not been tested on a massive scale, however, and should be addressed in
the early stages of any pilot.



Conclusion
Mobile money will happen in PNG. Banks, mobile operators, and third party providers are moving forward to
test solutions. BPNG is increasing its knowledge of mobile money and appears open to allowing pilot projects to
develop. The major donor organizations involved in financial sector reform and access to finance are cooperating
and have plans to support the development of mobile money at the retail and regulatory levels, as well as its
integration with the overall payments environment.

The primary conclusion of this study is that there is great demand for a system that enhances cash safety and that
includes not only m-payments but also a means to store value. Secondarily, there is already a fairly broad EFTPOS
network in place and mobile telephony is growing at exponential rates both of which can be leveraged to achieve
scale and outreach. There are also a limited number of points where cash goes into the system and “trickles
down” to households. Given the risks of carrying and holding cash, PNG presents an interesting opportunity to
develop a system that allows for multiple ways to cash-in and cash-out, including electronic disbursement (cash-
in) as well as the electronic purchase of goods and services (cash-out). The fact that most goods and services are
bought and sold in secondary cities, coupled with the limited need for cash in villages, may minimize the need to
build an extensive network of rural cash points from the outset.
