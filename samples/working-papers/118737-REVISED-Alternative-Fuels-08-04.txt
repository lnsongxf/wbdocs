FOREWORD



Cement is paramount for economic development and poverty reduction in emerging markets. Along with aggregates
and water, cement is the key ingredient in the production of concrete, and, as such, is an essential construction material
that enables large infrastructure projects in energy, water, and transport, as well as, importantly, the construction of
modern buildings and urban infrastructure. Given the rapid urbanization rates in developing countries, cement is
crucial for delivering on the climate-smart cities agenda. Emerging markets have been rapidly increasing their cement
use and now account for over 90 percent of cement consumption worldwide (4.1 billion tons in 2016).

Cement accounts for at least 5 percent of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and, according to some
estimates, this share may be even higher. At the same time, energy-related expenses in the cement sector, mostly on
fossil fuels and electricity, account for 30 to 40 percent of the industry’s cash costs. While current energy prices are
still recovering from the global financial and economic crises, there is no doubt that they will continue to increase in
the long run. In recent years, the cement industry has been successful in reducing its operating costs and improving its
carbon footprint (emissions per unit of output) by improving energy efficiency, increasing the use of alternative fuels,
and deploying renewable energy sources.

With a cumulative investment portfolio in cement of over $4.2 billion, IFC has accumulated a vast experience in the
industry, including in sustainable energy projects. To share its knowledge with external stakeholders and to promote
sustainable practices in the sector, IFC commissioned two studies on international best practice, covering alternative
fuels, and thermal and electric energy efficiency. These studies were developed as part of the Brazil Low Carbon
Technology Roadmap led by the National Cement Industry Association of Brazil (SNIC), the Brazilian Association
of Portland Cement (ABCP), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) of the
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and IFC.

This report, and an accompanying report on thermal and electric energy efficiency, provide a summary of international
best practice experience in the cement sector and focus on specific technical measures that could be implemented by
cement plants to reduce their operating costs and improve their carbon footprints. The reports provide a plethora of
practical information from implemented projects and include detailed technical descriptions, estimates of capital and
operating costs, as well as case studies and references from locations where the measures have been implemented. A
combination of general and in-depth information will make these reports a helpful read to both management and
technical and operating personnel of cement plants as well as to a larger range of stakeholders.

 Box 1: Use of Alternative Fuels in Cement Production: The Case of Poland

   Over the past decade, the cement sector in Poland has experienced rapid growth in its use of alternative fuel sources for industrial
   processing. As shown in Table 1, the alternative fuel substitution rate in Poland reached 45 percent in 2011. It has continued to
   increase in recent years and is now above 60 percent, with some cement plants using up to 85 percent alternative fuel.
   The expansion of co-processing in Poland was made possible as a result of:
    •	 Strong commitment of the cement sector, including through: grasping the alternative fuel market opportunities as they were
       emerging; establishing mid-term and/or long-term contracts with the waste management sector; smart and continuous
       investments in the handling (and in some cases preparation) of alternative fuels; and the development of skills in kiln
       operation to accept low-quality alternative fuels.
    •	 Ongoing enforcement of waste regulations, particularly those related to landfilling.
    •	 A favorable economic context comprising smart national and international investments, taxation on landfilling, and some
       alternative fuel opportunities supported by European subsidies.
   A more detailed overview of the experience with alternative fuels in Poland can be found in Appendix 2.

 Traditional Disposal/Usage Practices

 •	Use as fertilizer, given the high agronomic value
 •	Energy recovery is the main destination in case of health crisis
   (for example, the “mad cow” crisis) or in case of ban from other
   uses for overproduction reasons
 Supply Chains
 Transportation:
 •	Most convenient solution is tanks (and silo storage at
   production sites)
 •	Trailers could be used, but this requires more complex facilities
   in the cement plant: hopper and transfer to silo
 Preprocessing and Utilization Technologies
 Preprocessing is performed in rendering facilities
 Recommendation: no preparation step in the cement plant
 Risk Identification: Environmental Implications and
 Operational Health and Safety Considerations
 Storage must be managed properly to avoid:
 •	Rodent infestation
 •	Fire caused by direct inflammation or fermentation
 •	Explosion because of flying dust: silo design must be adapted
 •	Hopper must be located in a building to avoid contact with
   water and outside dissemination of smell

ALTERNATIVE FUEL QUALITY

The alternative fuel specifications are set in the contract
between the preparation step and the cement plant.


For the liquid alternative fuel, the calorific value depends
mainly on the quality of the solvents; it is often above 15
gigajoules per ton, with 20 gigajoules per ton being possible
in the best cases.


For the solid alternative fuel, the calorific value depends on
the moisture content of the sawdust (furniture sawdust is
one of the driest) and the moisture of the wastes. A calorific
value between 12 and 15 gigajoules per ton is achievable.

 The top two typical destinations for waste oil are:                      Collection of waste oil is a key issue. Garages typically store their

 The typical destinations for used tires and rubber wastes are:          Tire collection is the main management issue. Used tires are

 •	Some trials have been done in steel plants, but with limited
   quantities because the process is very sensitive to the presence of

  •	 The tank or lagoon must be cleaned on a regular basis (monthly, •	Ash: 10% to 50%
     annual), producing sludge that needs to be disposed of.
 •	Simple decantation with or without oil separator
  •	 Sludge produced in small quantities is usually pumped by a
     vacuum cleaning truck.
 •	Biological or physico-chemical sewage plant
  •	 Different natures of sludge are produced: physico-chemical or
     biological
  •	 After biological treatment, the sludge could be dried by mechanical
     treatment (centrifuge or filter press) or a thermal process.
 These operations can be performed in an external collection facility
 that will produce the sludge.
 The cleaning of tanks also produces sludge.
 The remediation of old lagoons or storage, either orphaned or with
 an identified owner, is also a source of sludge.
 In a similar category, dredge sludge originates from the cleaning of
 canals or sewers.
 This analysis focuses specifically on the oil sludge produced in refineries
 or during oil extraction. Huge quantities are produced worldwide,
 and cement plants are one of the main destinations for this sludge.
 Traditional Destination                                                       Supply Chains
 A wide range of destinations exist, considering the potential                 Traditional trucks are used to transport the sludge. In the case of
 variations in quality. Typical destinations are:                              simple trailers, the risk of spillage must be managed.
 •	Land spreading
  •	 This solution could be used for inorganic sludge, presenting real
     agronomic value coming from inorganic chemistry.
  •	 The presence of pollutants, even in small concentrations, is a
     limiting factor on this use.
 •	Landfilling
  •	 Landfilling of sludge is applicable for sludge with low moisture
     content.
  •	 Water present in the sludge could easily leach or give thixotropic
     properties to the sludge, disrupting landfill operations
     (production of leachate and destabilization of the waste layers).
 •	Incineration
  •	 Within an incinerator located on the sewage plant premises (for
     large-scale production)
  •	 Within a external incinerator managed by a waste management
     company
 •	In the case of remediation of old lagoons, the pretreated sludge
   could be landfilled on-site after preparation (mixing with lime or
   sawdust).
