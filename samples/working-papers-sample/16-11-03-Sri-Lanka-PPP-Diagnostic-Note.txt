                  Sri Lanka PPP Diagnostic Note
Accelerating infrastructure investment through PPPs

 Key Findings
  Fiscal constraints and limited budget resources will require the Government of Sri Lanka to explore and consider
   alternative financing options to address the country’s infrastructure needs. One option to address these constraints
   is to mobilize private sector financing through the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). However, it is important to
21 note that PPPs have direct and indirect fiscal and financial implications which need to be assessed on a case by case basis
   and fully understood by participating agencies and policy makers.

   Overreliance on public finance. In Sri Lanka today, many projects that are suitable candidates for PPP procurement are
    typically being financed through the public sector, with the public sector funds often being sourced through sovereign
    loans backed by sovereign guarantees. Private sector financing is only sought in cases where a project is unable to secure
    public funding. This practice is partly a result of the lack of a framework that can help line ministries determine the most
    appropriate method of procurement and financing (public sector versus PPP) at the project inception stage.

   Lack of project prioritization. The Government’s Western Region Megapolis Program consists of over 160 individual
    projects with an estimated investment volume of US$40 billion. In addition, there are a large number of other projects
    identified by various agencies at the national level. However, there is no framework to prioritize such projects and, more
    importantly, many of these projects are not being properly assessed for feasibility or readiness for implementation.

   Multiple agencies with overlapping functions. There is currently no clear assignment of responsibilities among the
    various government agencies engaged in promoting PPPs. As a result, different agencies are independently pursuing PPP
    projects. The absence of a cohesive framework to govern the institutional mandates, responsibilities and inter-agency
    decision making processes has created an environment of uncertainty and confusion that is difficult for potential domestic
    and foreign investors to navigate.

   Limited institutional capacity. Although in the past there have been several PPPs successfully transacted in the port
    and power sectors, the current institutional capacity with respect to structuring and procuring PPPs is severely limited.

   Over reliance on unsolicited proposals. In recent years, a substantial number of public sector projects have been
    procured on an unsolicited bid basis which is a practice that can have adverse implications with respect to transparency
    and value for money considerations.

   Limited capacity in the debt markets to finance infrastructure projects. There are liquidity (debt volumes and tenors)
    constraints in the domestic financial markets given the magnitude of investment required.

   Land valuation issues. A perceived lack of consistency with respect to the allocation and valuation of Government land
    for investment has implications for a successful PPP program.

Key Actions
   Optimize public resources and prioritize investments. To optimize the use of public resources a more systematic
    process of project prioritization should be adopted. In addition, instituting a mechanism for a detailed economic and
    financial analysis of each of the prioritized projects as well as having coordinated inter-agency discussions, will help
    better determine the nature of support (financial and/or non-financial) that may be required from Government.

   Establish an ‘apex’ institutional framework. A high-level committee, with representatives from key sectors, should
    be established. Such an apex institution would have the mandate to review all proposed investments and assess whether
    they should be financed publicly or be developed through a PPP. An inter-ministerial or cabinet level sub-committee
    could act as such an apex institution.
   Institutionalize a PPP unit. Based on the experience in other countries, a specialized PPP unit for the identification,
    preparation, evaluation and negotiation of PPPs should be considered for the development of PPPs in Sri Lanka. This
    PPP unit would also provide the necessary analytical support to the proposed apex institution referred to above.
   Improve policy environment. Clear and consensus-based policies and guidelines should be established around Public
    Investment Management and PPPs, with the objectives of enhancing coordination and optimizing the use of public
    finance.

   Strengthen procurement guidelines. Sri Lanka’s current public procurement guidelines for PPPs require review and
    revision, particularly with respect to managing unsolicited bids. Specifically, the mechanisms and procedures for handling
    unsolicited proposals need to be clarified and strengthened to ensure more effective adherence to the principles of
    competitive tendering and value for money.

   Develop a liability management framework. A liability management framework should be developed that will enable
    the Government to better manage and track the direct and contingent fiscal liabilities that arise from PPP arrangements.

   Build PPP capacity and awareness. A consistent understanding of PPPs should be ensured across the various line
    ministries and government agencies. This can be achieved through training and the use of PPP guide books. The
    Government should also actively reach out to external stakeholders to encourage an open dialogue about PPPs.

   Mobilize long term infrastructure finance. Once a sizeable project pipeline is identified, the Government could
    consider establishing an infrastructure development financing institution that can help mobilize long-term financing for
    infrastructure PPPs.

WBG’s global experience.


4. Project development and transaction advisory
    services.
The WBG, through IFC’s PPP Transaction Advisory
Department, can provide assistance to develop,
structure, and tender individual PPP projects. IFC has
significant global experience in providing infrastructure
advisory services and is currently involved in several
potential projects in Sri Lanka including in the water and
solar power sectors. While IFC’s advisory services
cannot be directly funded by the WBG, these advisory
services can potentially be funded through the Global
Infrastructure Facility or by third party donor funding.
Funds from the Global Infrastructure Facility can also be
used to fund project preparation advice from third party
consultants as well as helping the Government devise
broad sector strategies for PPP procurement.


5. Financing and guarantee support for PPPs.
To ensure the financial viability and bankability of PPP
projects in Sri Lanka, a broad range of financial
instruments and products are available from the WBG in
coordination with other multilateral and bi-lateral
agencies. Specific support from the WBG can include:
(i) guarantee instruments, such as credit and/or political
risk guarantees from either IDA/IBRD or MIGA; and (ii)
equity and/or debt financing from IFC, including
balance sheet financing as well as syndicated financing
with commercial banks and other development finance
institutions.


6. WBG Assistance for long term financing.
The WBG can provide technical support to assist in
mobilizing long-term infrastructure financing based on
the WBGs international experience. One way of
mobilizing such financing would be through the
establishment of an infrastructure development fund
