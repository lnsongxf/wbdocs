          A. Recent Economic Developments and Outlook




Favorable monsoon kept India’s economy on a solid growth path
India’s economy              India’s GDP expanded by an upwardly-revised 7.9 percent year-on-year (y/y) in FY16 (April
was slowing in the           2015-March 2016), the fastest pace in five years.1,2 Growth slowed to 7.3 percent H1 FY17,
first half of FY17…          dragged down by a contraction in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF; see Figure 1A). Growth
                             of gross value-added (GVA), considered a more reliable measure of the economy,3 slowed from
                             7.8 percent y/y in FY16 to 6.8 percent in H1 FY17 (Figure 1B). A decline in manufacturing
                             output was the main contributor to the slowdown, although this decline may be partly due to
                             measurement issues – see Box 1.

… but the favorable          The normal monsoon in June-October 2016 boosted growth of agriculture (+5.2 percent y/y
monsoon revived              in July-December 2016), farmer income, and rural consumption, shifting the economy to an
the growth                   upward path. In November 2016, however, demonetization caused a cash crunch that affected
momentum, which              India’s large informal economy and its financial sector, offsetting some of the gains in the rural
was only partly              economy. High frequency indicators pointed to a significant dent to growth, but the economy
dampened by                  continued to expand in Q3 FY17 (October-December 2016), albeit at a somewhat slower
demonetization4              quarterly pace (Figure 2).5 GDP growth slowed to 7.0 percent in Q3 FY17, but consumption
                             growth held up, investment growth turned positive, and trade showed green shoots. Similarly,
                             helped by agriculture and government services (Figure 1B and Figure 3), GVA slowed only 0.2
                             pp in Q3 FY17, with the deceleration largely explained by a slowdown in the financial sector
                             (specifically, financial, real estate and professional services) as banks had to focus on exchanging
                             currency.



1 “FY” refers to the Indian fiscal year, the twelve-month period ending March 31 of the year in question.
2 GDP is valued at market (purchaser’s) prices, whereas GVA is measured at basic (producer) prices, excluding product taxes and subsidies.
3
  The IMF (2017, p. SA10) notes that “due to weaknesses in estimating taxes less subsidies on products in constant prices, and as supply-side data
remain of better quality than expenditure-side data, GVA is preferred as a proxy for measuring economic growth.”
4
  Because the policy entailed the immediate demonetization of ₹500 and ₹1000 notes, it became widely known as “demonetization,” although it can
be best described as a currency exchange, since new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes were introduced to replace old ones. See Note 1 in Part B.

The impact of                    Five main factors explain the modest economic slowdown in the face of a large liquidity shock:
demonetization on                (i) coping mechanisms; (ii) higher rural incomes; (iii) robust public consumption; (iv) a jump in
growth was                       reported sales; and (v) formal economy indicators used to assess the informal economy. Coping
mitigated by growth              mechanisms included informal credit and the switch towards non-cash payments. Rural wages
in agriculture,                  continued to rise in November and December, and the decline in food prices was not severe
government                       despite higher farm output, suggesting resilience in rural areas. Meanwhile, spending by states
spending and                     drove public consumption higher. A surge in sales tax collection, especially in November (Figure
coping                           4), supports a hypothesis that businesses may have reported earlier sales to legitimize holdings
mechanisms, and                  of old notes. Sales tax collection are used to estimate growth in wholesale and retail trade, which
was partly masked                may have been overstated. The jump in sales tax collection also translates into higher net indirect
by statistical issues            taxes, explaining the continued gap between GVA and GDP. Finally, the Index of Industrial
                                 Production (IIP) is used to approximate activity in informal manufacturing but demonetization
                                 had an asymmetric effect on informal firms. See Note 1 in Part B.

Higher agricultural incomes and public spending boost consumption
The monsoon                      Following a normal Southwest monsoon, rain-fed crops performed well after two years of
delivered higher                 deficient rains. As of February 2017, the rainfall deviation stood at 10.1 percent of the long
agricultural                     period average (LPA) compared to -57.9 percent of LPA in February 2016 and reservoir levels
growth…                          were at 46.5 percent of total capacity versus 35 percent a year ago. As a result, agriculture growth
                                 accelerated to 6.0 percent y/y in Q3 FY17 from 3.8 percent y/y in Q2 FY17. This was the
                                 highest growth in nearly five years, and probably continued into Q4 FY17 as reservoirs were
                                 recharged: the second advance estimate of production put cereal output for FY17 at nearly 250
                                 million tons, crossing the previous record of 246 million tons harvested in 2013-14.

…and dampened                    The favorable monsoon and to some extent demonetization also contributed to moderating
food inflation…                  food price inflation, which drove headline inflation lower even as global commodity prices
                                 increased (Figure 5). With the exception of cereals, the pace of price rises in most food categories
                                 registered a decline. In particular, vegetable prices contracted from September, and from
                                 December, the price of pulses also declined. Considering the combination of higher production,
                                 the perishable nature of vegetables in the context of a cash shortage, and favorable base effects
                                 as vegetable prices had remained high for the previous two years, the decline in food inflation
                                 was relatively modest. Since the cash crunch was felt more in the rural economy and food forms
                                 a larger share of the basket in rural areas, rural inflation declined more than urban inflation
                                 (Figure 6).

…increasing real                 Owing to increased agricultural output, wages in rural areas have accelerated since October
rural wages and                  2016. Further helped by declining rural inflation, real rural wages climbed 2.4 percent y/y in
leading to an early              January, driven by wages for agricultural jobs (Figure 7). Rural consumption, as approximated
surge in rural                   by two-wheeler and tractor sales, picked up in September and October (Figure 8). Tractor sales
consumption                      had risen over 50 percent in October, while two-wheeler sales rose 18 percent. Demonetization
                                 then led to a sharp deceleration in rural consumption, as depicted in Figure 8, but this appears
                                 to have been temporary, as sales appear to have been recovering as of March.

Civil servants’ pay              Urban consumption growth seemed less affected by demonetization as compared with rural
hikes and coping                 consumption (Figure 9). This may be due to the impact of the civil service pay increases, the
mechanisms helped                fact that urban households were better able to switch to digital payments and mitigate the
urban consumption                liquidity crunch, use of informal credit, as well as the continued decline in inflation, which
                                 boosted real incomes.

The financial sector               The contribution of service sector growth to overall GVA in Q3 FY17 was 3.5 percentage points
dragged down                       (pp), the lowest in the past ten quarters. Growth of the services sector slowed sharply to 6.8
services growth,                   percent in Q3 FY17 as compared with 8.5 percent y/y in H1 FY17. The sectoral slowdown was
which slowed                       largely due to a slowdown in financial, real estate and professional services (18.7 percent of
despite an                         GVA and a key driver of growth in recent years), which slowed to 3.1 percent y/y from 8.1
expansion in                       percent in H1 FY17. Given the full-time effort required to exchange old notes, it is not

                                   services was robust (Figure 10), reflecting the rapid increase in public consumption.

Higher public                      The acceleration in public administration services mirrors a pickup in government consumption,
sector consumption                 which started in 1H FY17 (+15.4 percent y/y; FY16: 2.9 percent) and continued into Q3 (+19.9
likely to have come                percent y/y). This acceleration contrasts with the central government’s continued adherence to
from state-level                   a path of fiscal consolidation partly premised on expenditure restraint. The center has cut its
spending as the                    fiscal deficit from 3.9 percent of GDP in FY16 to 3.5 percent in FY17. Higher revenues (up

                                  from 9.2 to 9.8 percent of GDP) and stable current expenditure6 (10.3 and 10.4 percent of GDP
                                  in FY16 and FY17, respectively) drove consolidation in the period. Demonetization and the
                                  earlier tax amnesty resulted in a fiscal bounty in FY17, with tax revenues expected to be up 17.0
                                  percent, 4.4 percent above budgeted targets. Partly thanks to a continued decline in subsidies,
                                  current expenditure has been stable even as the government implemented increases in pensions
                                  and allowances for civil servants following recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission.

                                  Given the expenditure restraint at the center, the growth in government consumption has been
                                  the result of higher spending by the states, which are now responsible for 60 percent of general
                                  government expenditure. Transfers from the center to states increased a further 0.5 pp of GDP
                                  in FY17, while fiscal deficits of states have reportedly increased (see Note 2 in Part B), both
                                  suggesting higher spending levels.

Driven by both                    In H1 FY17, government consumption dominated while consumption by households (85
households and                    percent of final consumption and approximately 60 percent of India’s GDP), slowed (H1 FY17:
governments,                      6.1 percent y/y; FY16: 7.3 percent). Private consumption growth then accelerated from a tepid
consumption                       6.1 percent y/y in H1 FY17 to 10.1 percent y/y in Q3 FY17 (+12.8 percent q/q saar), which
remained the main                 combined with the further increase in public consumption ensured that final consumption
growth driver in                  demand jumped 11.4 percent in the quarter, the fastest increase in over five years. Overall, final
FY17                              consumption expenditure remained the main driver of GDP growth, expanding by 9.0 percent
                                  y/y between April-December 2016.

Investment remains tepid despite higher public capex and lower interest rates
Both the union and                Capital expenditure by the central government has increased from 2.6 percent of GDP in FY15
state governments                 to 2.8 percent in FY16 and 3.0 percent in FY17 (Figure 11). Reflecting this increase, as well as
stepped up capital                higher spending by state governments, public investment by the general government in the
expenditure…                      national accounts has increased from 3.5 percent of GDP in FY15 to 3.9 percent of GDP in
                                  FY16. Given the further increase in central capital expenditure in FY17, government investment
                                  is likely to have climbed further.

remained sluggish               improve the business environment and facilitate foreign direct investment (FDI). GFCF
in early FY17                   contracted by 1.4 percent y/y in real terms between April-September 2016. GFCF as a percent
                                of GDP have averaged 27.4 percent between Q3 FY16 and Q2 FY17 compared to a medium
                                term average (5 year) of 32.4 percent of GDP. This weakness in private investment has been
                                attributed to local and global excess-capacity (Figure 12) leveraged corporate and bank balance
                                sheets, and remaining domestic bottlenecks.

Signs of an                     After contracting for three consecutive quarters, GFCF grew by 3.5 percent y/y (15.3 percent
investment recovery             saar) in Q3 FY17. Supporting the view of an incipient pickup, production of capital goods
have emerged…                   expanded by 6.8 percent 3mma y/y in January 2017 after 13 consecutive months of negative
                                growth, imports of machinery rose by 13.5 percent y/y in March, and FDI expanded by 10.9
                                percent in Q3 FY17 driven primarily by investments in the telecommunications sector.

                                The uptick in investment may explain the relative resilience of the construction sector in Q3,
                                considering the sector’s dependence on cash payments to daily wage construction workers and
                                material suppliers. News reports7 noted that some employers front-loaded wage payments with
                                old currency, which helps explain the performance of construction as well as consumption.

… but remain                    However, credit growth remains weak. Although credit data for November and December is
tentative as bank               clouded by banks’ focus on exchanging old notes rather than lending, January and February data
credit remains                  was little improved, with growth of barely 3.5 percent (y/y). Banks have used higher deposits
subdued                         post-demonetization to buy government securities rather than to expand credit (Figure 13). This
                                suggests weak credit demand, as many large corporates remain highly leveraged and global
                                capacity in key sectors such as steel is ample. Credit to industry remains in negative territory and
                                has been the main driver of lower overall credit growth while credit growth to households and
                                services firms has been largely stable (Figure 14).

The RBI has paused Although headline inflation has come down and the RBI met its 5 percent inflation target along
its interest cut cycle the glide path, core inflation (non-food, non-oil) remained sticky above the 4 percent long-term
since October          target (Figure 15). Meanwhile, domestic liquidity has become ample following the uptick in
                       deposits post-demonetization (Figure 16). Tightening conditions in advanced economies,
                       especially the US, added to domestic pressures. The WPI, which is more sensitive to commodity
                       prices, picked up to a three-year high in February, led by a firming of farm input costs.

                                 Anticipating a pickup in inflation and activity, the MPC has kept the policy repo rate at 6.25
                                 percent since September 2016, and shifted in February from an accommodative to a neutral

The manufacturing                Industrial growth picked up in Q3 FY17 primarily because of improvements in mining (Figure
sector rebounded in              17 and Figure 18). Manufacturing growth, which contributes the most towards industrial
Q3 FY17 after a                  growth, had weakened for the third consecutive quarter from a high of 12.8 percent y/y in Q3
weak start to the FY             FY16 to 6.9 percent y/y in Q2 FY17. This was partly because the commodity-heavy WPI used
                                 in the deflator accelerated by 5.1 pp in the period, eroding growth in real terms; growth of
                                 manufacturing value-added accelerated in nominal terms. In Q3 FY17, despite further gains in
                                 WPI and demonetization, real growth in manufacturing rebounded to 8.3 percent y/y (nominal
                                 terms: 11.8 percent y/y). Measurement issues may also be at play in estimates of manufacturing
                                 output in Q3 FY17 as they rely to some extent on reports of sales, which some firms may have
                                 inflated to legitimize holdings of old currency. Both the IIP and WPI series have been rebased
                                 in May, 2017, which may ameliorate statistical issues going forward (see Box 3).

Green shoots in the external sector
Domestic demand                 Domestic demand accounted for 87 percent of the y/y growth rate of GDP (excluding
continued to drive              discrepancies) in 9M FY17. This compares with 97 percent for FY16, highlighting both a better
growth…                         performance of exports (9M FY17: +1.5 percent; FY16: -5.4 percent) but also a deceleration of
                                domestic demand (9M FY17: 5.2 percent; FY16: 6.3 percent) that has also spilled over to slower
                                import growth, leading to a higher contribution from net exports.

…but exports                    Export performance improved in earnest in Q3 FY17, when real exports of goods and services
revived strongly in             expanded by 3.4 percent y/y. Nominal merchandise exports in USD terms grew by 5.7 percent.
Q3 FY17…                        Commodity prices rebounded and volumes turned positive after several quarters (Figure 19), as
                                reflected by the large contribution of non-oil exports to export growth (Figure 20).

…and driven by US                      While exports to Africa, the Middle East and the UK declined, exports to the United States
demand                                 (approximately 16 percent of total exports) jumped by 13.1 percent y/y in Q3 FY17 from 2.3
                                       percent in Q2, thereby driving merchandise export growth. Exports to greater China (mainland,
                                       Hong Kong and Taiwan, Province of China) also increased by a similar magnitude, suggesting
                                       that India may be more integrated in global supply chains than commonly believed. Note 3 in
                                       Part B provides additional details on India’s trade performance and policy.

Imports, especially                    Imports of goods and services (in USD) increased by 6.5 percent y/y in Q3 FY17 after
of services, also                      contracting by 6.7 percent y/y in H1 FY17. Merchandise imports picked up in Q3 FY17,
increased strongly                     growing by +5.7 percent y/y compared to a -10.5 percent in H1 FY17 and -15.0 percent in
in Q3 after                            FY16, when lower oil prices drove imports sharply lower (Figure 23). Imports of petroleum and
contracting earlier                    petroleum products (22 percent of merchandise imports during FY16) increased along with
in the FY                              prices. Core imports (excluding oil and gold), increased by 3.8 percent due to the recovery in
                                       exports through higher imports of intermediate goods. Capital goods imports jumped by 11.0
                                       percent in Q3, reflecting the improvement in GFCF. Service import growth surged to 23.2
                                       percent y/y in Q3 FY17 (FY16: +4.3 percent y/y). Modern services were the main driver,
                                       expanding 16.3 percent y/y in Q3 FY17 (Figure 24). In particular, insurance and financial service
                                       imports grew by 66.9 percent y/y in the period.

The current account                    The current account deficit narrowed to 0.4 percent of GDP during H1 FY17 from 1.0 percent
deficit remains                        in FY16, and widened slightly to 0.5 percent of GDP in the year up to Q3 FY17. Despite the
comfortable and                        negative (albeit small) terms-of-trade shock as oil prices increased, the oil trade balance
financed by FDI                        narrowed to 2.1 percent of GDP in Q3 FY17 compared to 2.5 percent of GDP in FY16. On
                                       the back of the solid growth in merchandise exports, the non-oil balance improved by 0.5 pp
                                       between FY16 and Q3 FY17 to a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP. Worker remittances declined
                                       in the first half of FY17, as flows from Gulf countries remained subdued8. However, the
                                       rebound in oil prices led to a 16.2 percent y/y jump in worker remittances in Q3 FY17, and for
                                       the year up to Q3 FY17 worker remittances were down only marginally. Other household
                                       transfers in the BoP declined more, however, possibly affected by demonetization, and total
                                       remittances retreated by 0.4 pp of GDP in the same period. Gross FDI inflows expanded
                                       significantly in FY17 (17.3 percent y/y for 9M FY17, in USD terms) to 2.8 percent of GDP in
                                       the year up to Q3 FY17, thus comfortably financing the current account deficit.


8Worker remittances include compensation of employees. Overall remittances to India decreased by 8.9 percent in CY 2016 from CY 2015 to
USD 62.7 billion, the second consecutive yearly decline.

a temporary slow-                states slowed by 1.6 pp between Q3 FY17 and January-February 20179. Finally, high frequency
down in FY17                     indicators do not yet paint a firmly bullish picture. In February, the industrial production index
                                 for capital goods contracted 3.4 y/y, while credit to industry contracted 5.2 percent y/y,
                                 suggesting that a meaningful recovery in private investments is unlikely until later in FY18.

                                 These headwinds and tailwinds largely cancelled out each other in Q4 FY17, keeping the
                                 economy in a U-shape recovery, which gains momentum in FY18, when growth is projected to
                                 accelerate to 7.2 percent (Figure 26). Growth in private investments is likely to pick up once

                                 advanced. With agriculture and fiscal policy unable to provide the same boost to growth given
                                 the higher base, higher commodity prices leading to a small negative terms-of-trade shock,
                                 sluggish credit to industry, and frictions from the initial implementation of GST (see Note 2 in
                                 Part B), headwinds to growth are likely to increase. On the positive side, consumption will
                                 remain robust given declining inflation and solid household credit growth, and the pickup in
                                 trade is likely to endure at least through the first half of the fiscal year, helping lift investment.

                                 In later years, growth is projected to accelerate gradually to 7.7 percent by FY20, underpinned
                                 by a more meaningful recovery in private investment following the recent push to accelerate
                                 infrastructure spending, concerted efforts to improve the business climate and (eventually) less
                                 leveraged corporate and financial balance sheets “crowd in” the private sector.

                              term (Figure 28). Achieving a higher potential would require a combination of productivity
                              enhancements, a larger pickup in investment, and an increase in women’s participation in the
                              labor force, as India’s labor force is short of its potential given the large gender gap in economic

While domestic and            There are several key risks to the outlook. First, private investment continues to face several
global downside               domestic impediments in the form of corporate debt overhang, stress in the financial sector,
risks prevail, policy         and regulatory and policy challenges, as well as excess capacity globally. If these bottlenecks are
reforms could bring           not alleviated, a continuation of slow private investment would weigh down on growth and put
better-than-                  downside pressures on India’s potential GDP. Second, continued uncertainties in the global
expected outcomes             environment, notably a faster than expected tightening of monetary policy in USA could affect
                              short-term volatility of flows, and spillovers from Brexit and USA trade and immigration
                              policies, as well as a renewed slowdown of the Chinese economy, could further delay a
                              meaningful recovery of external demand, which has played a critical role in India’s previous
                              growth episodes. Finally, as a net oil importer, further rapid increases in oil and other commodity
                              prices could lead to a negative terms-of-trade shock and pressures on fiscal accounts. On the
                              other hand, upside risks include a more sustained recovery in external demand into the second
                              half of the fiscal year and beyond, a smooth implementation of the GST that leads to a faster-
                              than-expected pickup in investor sentiment, as well as an acceleration in the resolution of NPAs
                              following the recent measures to empower RBI.

A shift in drivers towards industry and investments
Agriculture will              Agricultural output is expected to grow at 4.7 percent in FY17 and stabilize at its long-term
continue to provide           average of 2.6 in the successive years (Figure 29). First estimates of FY17 food grain production
momentum to the               suggest a record high of 135 metric tons, an increase of 9 percent over the last year, resulting
economy in early              from both a 4 percent increase in gross-sown area and a reported increase in yields. In addition,
FY18…                         good rains allowed for some recovery of groundwater, whereby water storage in 91 major
                              reservoirs stood at 76 percent of total storage capacity, becoming 27 percent higher than last
                              year. Given these favorable hydrological conditions, and that demonetization ultimately had
                              little negative impact on sowing for the winter crop, the momentum in agriculture should carry
                              into early FY18.

… but industry                     Industrial growth is expected to slow down to 5.6 percent in FY17 due to (i) a slowdown in
gradually takes over               construction as the sector adjusts to the post-demonetization environment and the public sector
as a growth driver                 pares back on capital expenditure growth, and (ii) mean-reversal of measurement issues in Q310.
                                   Economic activity is expected to pick up into FY18 driven by improved trade performance, resilient
                                   consumption, and eventually higher demand for capital goods from an increase in investments.
                                   Industrial growth is expected to accelerate to 8.0 percent by FY20, pulling the overall GVA growth
                                   to 7.7 percent. Services growth will be stable at 8.8 percent in FY20 and remain the key driver of
                                   overall economic activity, supported by backward and forward linkages to the industrial sector.

Private                             Private consumption remains a stable growth driver, ranging between 7.2 and 7.5 percent between
consumption will                    FY17 and FY20 (Figure 30). The minor deceleration in FY17 is offset by higher rural incomes

source of growth…                   declining inflationary expectations that boost real incomes. Inflation expectations, as measured by
                                    the RBI, have come down sharply from 10.5 percent a year ago to 7.3 percent in December 2016
                                    and should decline further toward the RBI’s inflation target of 4 +/-2 percent. Furthermore, the
                                    catch-up in rural demand following favorable rabi and kharif harvests will create significant
                                    potential for overall growth. Budget estimates of FY18 by the center and states point to limited
                                    consolidation, achieved primarily from the sale of public assets.11

…but private                       The government will maintain its momentum in public infrastructure spending, with
investment                         government capital expenditure by the center budgeted at 3.0 percent of GDP in FY18, flat
eventually                         from the previous year. Private investment is expected to pick up, but only gradually as recovery
accelerates                        may be protracted in part due to relatively longer-term effects of demonetization on cash-reliant
                                   construction activities (household investment, largely housing, accounts for approximately 1/3
                                   of total investment), corporate leverage and the persistent weakness in credit growth, which
                                   suggest that the financial sector may require more time to adjust. Gross fixed capital formation
                                   is forecast to grow by 3.3 percent in FY17 and rise gradually to 8.9 percent by FY20, overtaking
                                   private consumption as a major growth driver. Underpinning this forecast is the impact of
                                   reforms such as the Bankruptcy law and GST, crowding-in from the recent infrastructure push,
                                   and continued inflow of foreign investments. The abolition of the Foreign Investment
                                   Promotion Board from FY18 will further support investment growth. Moreover, RBI’s efforts

                                 deposits post-demonetization will eventually allow credit growth to recover robustly and

Exports continue to recover, but uncertainties are high
Exports likely to                Exports are projected to expand by 6.1 percent in FY17 due to the low base in FY16 and the
begin recovery in                cyclical pickup of the global economy, led by the USA, commodity-exporting emerging markets,
FY17; significant                and China. In later years, export growth is projected to remain stable, consistent with moderate
uncertainties cloud              growth in global trade and a small increase in India’s global market share, but well below the
the outlook from                 levels registered during the boom years before 2012. The outlook for FY18 and beyond is
FY18                             clouded by uncertainty about the potential increase in protectionist policies and the structural
                                 deceleration in global trade. The baseline scenario, based on the World Bank’s global forecasts,
                                 assumes global trade volumes grow by 3.8 percent y/y in FY18-FY20, half of the 7.5 percent in

A pickup in demand               Growth in imports is expected to accelerate but remain below export growth at 4.8 percent by
for consumer goods               FY19. The initial rise in imports is predicated on higher private consumption (consumer goods
and, eventually,                 account for nearly half of all merchandise imports) and a modest recovery in exports, which will
capital goods will               lead to demand for imported consumption and intermediate goods, respectively. In later years,
drive imports                    imports are likely to grow owing to higher demand for capital goods (which currently account for
upward and widen                 approximately 17 percent of total merchandise imports) from revived investment, as well as higher
the current account              demand for intermediate inputs in response to improved manufacturing activity and exports. The
deficit modestly                 current account deficit may widen gradually to 1.5 percent of GDP by FY19 (Figure 32). However,
                                 robust inflows of FDI will ensure smooth financing of the deficit as the government continues to
                                 open additional sectors of the economy and India reinforces its stance as a bright spot in the global
                                 economy

External and domestic risks weigh on the favorable outlook
The most                         Private investment growth continues to face several impediments in the form of excess capacity,
substantial                      regulatory and policy challenges, and corporate debt overhang. A continuation of sub-par
medium-term risks                growth in private investment cannot be ruled out if corporate and financial sector balance sheet
are associated with              stresses are not alleviated, although the recently-announced measures to deal with Non-
the recovery in                  Performing Assets (NPAs) represent a potential upside risk as the baseline anticipates a
private investments              protracted recovery (Box 2). The banking sector problems are likely to remain a drag on private
                                 investments to the extent the resources for required recapitalization are unavailable and diluting

                             government equity for raising additional resources is uncertain. Over the longer term, in the
                             absence of investments and resulting expansion of production capacity, not only may faster

External risks               Downside risks to the global economy – and accordingly to export growth and capital flows –

Further increases in          Consumers and the government reaped large benefits of lower oil prices in FY16. Those
oil prices may be            benefits will at best dissipate in FY17 and FY18. A sharper increase in oil prices compared to a
disruptive                   generally stable baseline would lead to a negative impulse, assuming the government retains
                             current excise levels, or higher fiscal deficit. Increases in inflation may reverse the RBI’s
                             accommodative stance. Without the benefit of the growth in oil-related excises (and possible
                             reductions if oil prices increase) the government will find it challenging to meet its deficit target
                             without further cuts in expenditure – and usually capital expenditure is the first to be cut.

                                          Box 1: Linking measurement and reality of economic activity

 This box summarizes key statistical issues influencing the measured economic activity in India in FY16-FY18. Statistical issues are
 especially important at this time because demonetization brought about a new set of challenges in measuring economic activity.

 High-frequency data shown in Figure 35 suggests a V-shaped recovery of the Indian economy: the indicators contracted in Q3 FY17,
 then expanded in Q4 FY17. However, quarterly GDP data shows a deceleration but no contraction in Q3 FY17, and the World Bank
 expects the same pace in Q4 FY17 rather than a stronger expansion – a U-shaped recovery. To reconcile both sets of facts, one needs
 to understand how GDP (and GVA) data are calculated. Estimates of GVA use quarterly filings of firms (to measure growth in
 manufacturing and some service sectors), and sales tax collection (to measure growth in the wholesale and retail sector and net indirect
 taxes, which link GVA with GDP). The methodology is not uncommon, and the administrative data, especially on tax collection, is
 relatively reliable, notwithstanding certain shortcomings.12

 However, in an exceptional case such as demonetization, economic actors behave exceptionally. In particular, the jump in indirect tax
 collection in view of the drop in consumption of durable goods (such as two-wheelers and vehicles) and the fall in prices of perishable
 food items supports a hypothesis that traders and firms in possession of old notes may have declared earlier sales to legitimize their
 holdings. Sales tax collection in the states jumped, as shown in Figure 4. Meanwhile, collections of indirect (excise and service) taxes
 by the central government also surged in November, with indirect tax growth up 36 percent compared to 25 percent in October.
 Indirect tax growth has since dropped to 12.4 percent in February. These developments likely did not reflect actual sales in the quarter,
 but appeared in the GDP data as a jump in sales.

 A second statistical challenge, mentioned in the 2017-18 Economic Survey, is the difficulty in measuring the informal economy, which
 is likely to have been most affected by demonetization: “Recorded GDP will understate impact on informal sector because informal
 manufacturing is estimated using formal sector indicators (Index of Industrial Production). ” (p. 60). Indeed, similarly to GDP, the IIP

barely changed between the second and third quarters, although in both cases growth was negative. The implicit assumption that
formal and informal sectors move broadly in tandem is reasonable in normal times but broke down during the period of
demonetization.

Finally, it was earlier highlighted that the use of the WPI in deriving the deflator, especially for manufacturing value-added, may lead
to certain anomalies. The Economic Survey notes, “the large wedge between CPI and WPI inflation has created difficulties in
measuring the GDP deflator”. While these difficulties may have overstated growth in FY16, when WPI was declining (Figure 36), the
reversal of this trend, especially in the first half of FY17 may now be understating actual growth.

To the extent that nominal GVA is a more accurate measure of economic activity, it is noteworthy that despite the fast growth in
agriculture and the statistical issues that would have led to an exaggeration of growth in wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing
sectors, nominal GVA growth slowed 1.1 pp in the third quarter.


                                          Box 2: New measures to address banking-sector stress

The Indian banking sector has been burdened by non-performing assets (NPAs) that constrain the sector from supporting economic
growth. NPAs of Scheduled Commercial Banks stood at ₹7.0trn (8.5 percent of advances) in FY17 (year-ending March 2017), up
from ₹0.9trn (2.2 percent of advances) in FY11. Together with restructured assets, total stressed assets in the banking system are
currently around ₹9.6trn (11.5 percent of advances).

Banks are required to make loan loss provisions (LLPs) to cover losses stemming from NPAs. Rising NPAs therefore lower profits.
Eight out of the ten largest PSBs had losses in FY16, due to provisioning for the NPAs. While FY17 results are still coming in, some
banks appear to have improved performance, while some deteriorated, but none are out of the woods completely. LLPs ultimately
shrink banks’ capital and reduce banks’ ability to lend, as reflected in the decline in credit growth observed.

In 2015, the RBI performed an asset quality review (AQR) with the goal of providing greater transparency regarding the scope of the
NPA problem. NPAs were understated in reported numbers as for example, banks often carried out restructuring of loans to avoid
classifying them as NPAs, thereby also avoiding the accompanying LLP expenses. While better recognition of the problem is a critical
step to recovery of the sector (World Bank, 2016c), the AQR led to a steep increase in provisioning that had an expected short-term
adverse impact on the profitability of the banks (RBI, 2016).

In parallel, over time, the RBI has introduced several tools to help banks deal with distressed assets (Table 2). Despite the availability
of a wider range of instruments, their use by banks has been limited to date.

The latest among these enabling legislations is the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2017, which involves RBI more
deeply into asset resolution. The Ordinance makes three key amendments. First, it authorizes the central government to direct the
RBI to order banks to initiate insolvency proceedings (under the recently-approved Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) against specific
defaults. Second, it allows the RBI to establish (one or more) authority(ies)/oversight committee(s), and to appoint their members.

                                                                                           INDIA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE MAY 2017 » 20
 Such committee will advise banks on the resolution of stressed assets. Third, it authorizes the RBI to issue directions to banks to
 resolve stressed assets. Under the Ordinance, decisions in the Joint Lenders Forum (JLF) agreed upon by a minimum of 60 percent
 of creditors by value and 50 percent of creditors by number are now be considered as the basis for deciding the corrective action plan,
 and will be binding on all lenders, subject to the exit option available in the framework.

         Lenders’ Forum (JLF)                       highlight the probability of accounts becoming delinquent. JLF is a separate
                                                    empowered group of lenders that can speed up decisions to resolve stressed assets.

 From a supervisory perspective, the RBI issued a revised framework in April 2017 and specified risk based triggers for Prompt
 Corrective Action13 by the central bank. Among others, a breach of ‘Risk Threshold 3’ of common equity tier 1 by a bank would
 identify it as a likely candidate for resolution through tools like amalgamation, reconstruction etc.

 The rationale for the Ordinance is that large volumes of NPAs are concentrated on less than 50 creditors14, but the bankers are not
 inclined to initiate default proceedings against such companies for two main reasons – pressure by powerful corporates; and fear of
 investigative proceedings particularly for decisions that involve a settlement and haircut and may have been optimal from an NPA
 resolution perspective but could raise questions from a vigilance standpoint. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is itself new, and
 banks and corporates may be reluctant to initiate proceedings given the legislation is untested. In the face of such disincentives for
 fast decision-making, the ordinance may be justified (in the short term) even if it empowers the RBI beyond its regulatory role.

 Some commentators (e.g. Datta & Sengupta, 2017) point out that the Ordinance elevates the role of the central bank (and the
 government) from a market regulator to a market participant, proactively involved in decision-making of the commercial banks.
 Moreover, while the ordinance seeks to provide greater comfort for (public sector) bankers to take decisions on the resolution of
 impaired assets, there is a question whether RBI officials may also not be subject to similar concerns, in which case paralysis will not
 be resolved. Finally, the government’s ownership stake in the financial sector creates broad incentives for losses to be recognized only

gradually (under the RBI’s time-bound provisioning rules), as fiscal resources ultimately need to be allocated to recapitalize the banks
for the incurred losses.

At a minimum, the Ordinance should help test the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which has been a key financial sector reform
initiative. By bringing borrowers and lenders to a common platform, the Ordinance, which, among others, empowers the RBI to issue
borrower specific instructions to banks to initiate resolution under the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016, would
test the timeliness of resolution given the limited timeframe of 180 days (with provision of one-time extension of 90 days) under the
bankruptcy code. It will be key be for banks, borrowers and creditors to agree on the resolution plan to prevent liquidation of the
borrower.

In May 2017, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Ministry of Commerce revised the base year of India’s wholesale price index
(WPI) and index of industrial production (IIP) series from 2004-05 to 2011-12. The series have also undergone other methodological
changes, including (1) adding new items and excluding some old ones to capture the changing structure of the economy; (2) including
work-in-progress in estimating capital goods production in IIP; and (3) removal of indirect taxes in deriving wholesale prices.
Both series are a crucial input in estimating GVA and GDP growth. In estimating GVA, the CSO uses a combination of private sector
corporate sector filings (deflated using WPI), and IIP growth (as a proxy for the unorganised sector). On account of the upward
revision to IIP growth and downward revision to WPI inflation (Figure 37 and Figure 38), GVA and GDP growth could witness
some upward revision when updated to reflect the new series.

1.   India’s Great Currency Exchange
India’s currency          On November 8, 2016 the Government of India announced that existing ₹500 (USD 7.50) and
exchange initiative       ₹1000 (USD 15) banknotes, corresponding to 86 percent of India’s currency in circulation by
is an unprecedented       value, had been “demonetized,” that is, ceased to be legal tender.15 Holders had 50 days to turn
development,              in the demonetized notes at banks. Although holders could initially exchange some of the old
leading to short-         notes for new notes, or withdraw new notes from their accounts, cash shortages ensued as
term disruption and       withdrawals were subject to limits and technical factors constrained the pace of introduction of
potentially long-         new notes. Since more than 80 percent of purchases in India are made in cash, the shortages
term benefits if          caused a drop in transactions and reduced economic activity in the short-term, as described in
complementary             Part A. While the cash shortage has largely abated, certain sectors that disproportionately employ
measures are              the poor and vulnerable may take longer to adjust, notably construction and other informal
adopted                   sectors. Therefore, measures announced to ramp up affordable housing construction will be
                          important to mitigate the short-term impact on this group. In the long term, demonetization
                          has the potential to accelerate three positive and related transformations: (i) formalization of the
                          economy; (ii) increased tax collection and (iii) greater digital financial inclusion. However, to
                          realize the potential benefits, complementary measures are required.

A gargantuan and unprecedented exercise aimed at curbing “black money”
Outside of                India’s currency in circulation is equivalent to 12.3 percent of GDP, higher than in most
hyperinflations or        emerging market and advanced economies (Figure 39). An estimated 23 billion banknotes have
other severe crises,      been demonetized, representing over 86 percent of currency in circulation by value (Figure 42),
there is no               or approximately 10 percent of GDP. In January 1978, the government demonetized ₹1000,
precedent for             ₹5000 and ₹10000 through an ordinance to control illegal transactions. However, these high-
demonetization of         denomination notes accounted for just 1.7 percent of the total value of notes in circulation and
this magnitude


15This led the initiative to be known as “demonetization,” although it is best described as a currency exchange of old ₹500 and ₹1000
notes for lower-denomination notes and new ₹500 and ₹2000 notes.

The near-term economic impact was limited but the social impact may have been greater
The impact on                    As discussed in Part A, despite statistical issues that mask some of the impact of demonetization
economic activity                on measured economic growth in Q3, available evidence suggests that the actual impact was
was limited given                smaller than what the observed liquidity contraction would have suggested. A naïve model
the magnitude of                 assuming constant money velocity and sticky prices would have yielded a much larger impact in
the exercise                     FY17 GDP (Table 3). Instead, while the inflation trajectory was little-changed, money velocity
                                 accelerated strongly after demonetization (Figure 43)16.

                                 This increase in money velocity reflects a jump in the use of electronic payments, as well as
                                 coping mechanisms, especially informal credit. As demonetization was pervasive and widely
                                 understood to be temporary, the response of informal credit probably was larger compared to
                                 a monetary shock perceived to be permanent. In addition, the government allowed the use of
                                 old notes for specific purchases until December. Importantly, old notes could be used for fuel
                                 purchases until early December 2016, and farmers were able to buy seeds with old notes, which
                                 ensured that the sown area of the rabi (winter) crop was barely impacted by demonetization.
                                 This, together with the liberation of tolls, prevented a breakdown of the logistics chain, which
                                 would have had a much bigger impact on activity.


16While the numerator (GDP) may have been overstated by statistical issues in Q3, the numerator was also overstated since it includes old notes
that had not been deposited but were no longer legal tender, and new notes were predominantly the relatively less liquid ₹2000 notes.

Possible short-term             While the macroeconomic impact of demonetization has been relatively limited, the distribution
adverse impact on               of the costs is uneven as the informal economy is likely to have been hit especially hard.
low-income                      Although the informal economy may account for only 40 percent of GDP (Kolli & Sinharay,
households                      2011), it employs 90 percent of India’s workers (Naik, 2009), and the disproportionate impact
                                of demonetization on India’s informal sector suggests that it would have affected those workers
                                the most. The poor and vulnerable are more likely to work in informal sectors (farming, small
                                retail, and construction), and are less able to move to non-cash payments. Sensitive to the
                                potential impact on jobs in the construction sector, which is an important avenue for poverty
                                reduction, the government announced a number of measures to boost the construction of
                                affordable housing, which may help the sector as it transitions to a less cash-reliant model.

Banks benefit from              The initial impact of demonetization on banks was negative, as evidenced by the slowdown in
higher deposits, but            financial services in the national accounts. The longer-term impact may be more positive if the
credit growth                   new steady-state level of deposits is higher and usage of electronic payments increases. Although
remains limited                 a large share of the cash deposited has been withdrawn, as of April 28 deposits were up 3.7 pp
                                of GDP compared to before demonetization. In turn, higher deposits should allow for a
                                reduction in deposit and lending rates, and for banks to increase lending volumes while
                                preserving profit margins. Although deposit and base rates did come down slightly, banks used
                                additional deposits to purchase government securities rather than extend credit (Figure 13).

Gains to                        In FY17, the taxation of previously unreported cash (including the amount identified via the tax
government’s                    amnesty and demonetization) generated additional tax revenues. Gross tax revenues (including
collections this FY,            the states’ share) exceeded the budgeted target of 10.8 percent of GDP and came in at 11.3
with possible long-             percent (FY16: 10.6 percent; Figure 44), mostly reflecting higher-than-expected excise
term benefits                   collections on petroleum products.17 Meanwhile, demonetization had a neutral effect on direct
                                taxes, which were in line with budget targets (5.6 percent of GDP). Moreover, as banks bought
                                government bonds, funding costs initially fell, lowering the interest bill at least temporarily
                                (Figure 45). Going forward, revenues may increase permanently if demonetization is successful
                                in raising the amount of income reported to tax authorities.



17   Indirect tax revenue, particularly excise, came in higher than the budgeted 5.2 percent of GDP at 5.7 percent of GDP during FY17.

Complementary reforms will ensure the achievement of positive transformations
Formalization of the economy
Demonetization can             The informal economy accounts for over half of India’s GDP (as of FY09) and 82 percent of
accelerate the                 non-agricultural employment (as of FY12; Table 4). Demonetization promotes a reallocation of
formalization of the           resources from the informal to the formal economy. First, informal traders and credit providers
economy                        felt the brunt of the withdrawal of liquidity. If informal credit providers, who serve individuals
                               and informal businesses, faced losses related to cash that they had not previously declared, their
                               capital base and future ability to lend declined. On the other hand, liquidity flowed to banks,
                               which can channel it as credit – largely to formal enterprises. Second, formal merchants and
                               businesses were better able to switch to non-cash forms of payment during the liquidity crunch,
                               thereby minimizing disruptions. Many firms that had been reluctant to formalize now adopted
                               digital payments, moving a step closer to formalization, thanks to the demonetization exercise.

                               Formalization is ultimately a positive transformation that can lead to greater efficiency, and India’s
                               low aggregate productivity is in part due to the prevalence of a large number of informal,

                                unproductive firms (Figure 46). Complementary measures related to the ease of doing business
                                (notably labor market regulations) are needed to ensure that the new equilibrium of higher
                                formalization prevails. Moreover, given that the informal sector is a large source of employment,
                                especially for poor and vulnerable groups, the shift requires mitigation measures for those groups
                                as well as strengthening India’s safety net and expanding skilling programs.

                                Complementary measures to promote the formalization of the economy include the “ease of
Formalization of the            doing business” agenda to reduce the cost of firms operating in the formal economy. The key
economy will be                 measures in this regard are: (i) implementation of the new Insolvency Act, which allows a more
supported by                    orderly reallocation of resources from less to more productive firms; (ii) improvements in tax
improving the “ease             administration that balance the need for enforcement of tax laws with the burden of compliance;
of doing business”              and (iii) further improvements in licensing and registration procedures for businesses. The
and GST                         smooth implementation of GST will be another major complementary reform to promote
implementation                  formalization, as firms have a strong incentive to register with GST to obtain input tax credits.

Mitigating the                  Recent global events have highlighted the importance of mitigating the impact of economic shifts
impact on the poor              on the groups that will be most disrupted. As noted, in India, the poorest and most vulnerable
will be important in            work in the informal sector. The construction sector in particular has been an important pathway
this accelerated                out of poverty for many rural households. Policies that facilitate the absorption of construction
transition towards              labor force by larger firms, including as part of the announced expansion of investment in public
formalization                   infrastructure and in affordable housing, are helpful in this regard. Similarly, policies that promote
                                hiring by formal firms, including through review of burdensome or complex labor legislation,
                                would be important to ensure that the losses in the informal sector are significantly compensated
                                by gains at the formal end.

Increasing tax collections
Greater                         The main stated objective of demonetization was to penalize holders of cash related to income
formalization also              that has avoided (or evaded) taxation, and curb its creation. Indeed, few individuals pay tax (Figure
implies higher tax              47) and India collects little in personal income taxes. Although this may be expected by its current
collections                     income level (Figure 48), as income rises, income tax collections would be expected to increase.

                                Furthermore, corporate tax collections have been declining (Figure 49), a trend whose impact on
                                the budget has been offset by increased reliance on indirect taxes. Demonetization affected the
                                stock of “black money”, and the government succeeded in raising additional tax revenues from

India can raise more             A 2012 study by the National Institute of Financial Management 18 found that investments in real
revenues from the                estate is the most common method to hold unaccounted income. Real estate has reportedly been
taxation of property,            purchased largely in cash, in order to avoid stamp duty and registration fee, and to minimize
a major store of                 property tax, even as very few municipalities enforce meaningful and regular taxation of
unaccounted wealth               properties. As a result, India is an outlier in the collection of tax on property (Figure 50), which
                                 limits resources at the level of state and local governments.

                                 One factor accounting for this development is the relatively high costs of property registration,
                                 which creates incentives to under-report the underlying sale value of the property, thereby
                                 creating “black money”. Under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission
                                 (JNNURM), states agreed to reduce stamp duty rates, which were often 10 percent or higher, to
                                 five percent. While the rates have thus come down, they remain high in many states in comparison
                                 to levels in other countries. Once registration fees are added, the overall cost of registering
                                 property increases by an average of 1 percent surging to 10 percent in Bihar, where a 2 percent
                                 additional stamp duty in urban areas leads to an effective stamp duty rate of 8 percent. At the
                                 same time, some states have raised the circle/administrative rates closer to market levels.
                                 Nevertheless, between 2005-2006 (when the JNNURM was launched) and 2013-2014, the ratio
                                 of stamp duty collections to GDP increased only modestly from 0.70 to 0.78 percent of GDP,
                                 suggesting that underreporting of transaction values remains a challenge.

The government has               In the past two and a half years, the government enacted a law regarding undisclosed foreign
taken several                    income and assets, amended the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement with Mauritius and
measures to curb                 Cyprus, and implemented a Voluntary Income Disclosure Scheme earlier this year. Moreover, the
“black money” and                Benami Act, which targets property held in the name of third parties, came into effect on
improve the                      November 3rd 2017. These are welcome measures, but collections of personal and corporate
enforcement of tax               income tax and property taxes can be further enhanced by (i) better coordination among tax
collection                       agencies to increase number of companies with tax deduction at source (TDS); (ii) introducing a
                                 minimum alternative tax based on a firm’s assets (or individual wealth); and (iii) rationalizing land
                                 taxation to incentivize truthful reporting of property values.

Greater coordination    There is limited information exchange between state and the central revenue departments, as well
between central and     as between the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) and the Income Tax Office (ITO),
state tax agencies,     curbing the ability of different tax authorities to cross-reference information and better enforce
and among central       tax collection. Although information exchange has picked up since the signing of an MOU
tax agencies can        between the CBEC and the ITO, collaboration between the agencies can be deepened further,
lead to improved        which is likely to bring significant benefits with the launch of GST
enforcement
                        Since firms have an incentive to register for GST to claim input tax credits, GST provides an
                        avenue to cross-reference filings of GST and corporate income tax, thereby ensuring consistency
                        in reported turnover, as well as using this information, first to alert companies of any possible
                        mismatch and, subsequently, for audit purposes. This requires increased collaboration and data
                        sharing not only between the departments overseeing direct and indirect tax collection but also
                        between state and central revenue departments.

                        Besides, GST can help in providing additional information on firms’ corporate incomes, as well
                        as increasing the number of firms that deduct personal income tax at source; this can be similarly
                        verified or audited based on mismatch between the firms’ reported turnover and filing of TDS.

A minimum               India’s taxation system for businesses is complicated because of numerous exemptions that allow
alternative tax based   certain firms to pay no taxes. Many of these businesses deliberately keep idle assets on their
on individual and       balance sheets, using these assets for speculative purposes or as conduits for tax avoidance or
corporate assets can    evasion. A Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) on book profits at a rate of 18.5 percent is currently
secure higher           applied when the amount paid on book profit is higher than the amount resulting from a regular
revenues and allow      tax rate of 30 percent applied on taxable profit. However, this helps mainly in the case public
the simplification of   sector enterprises that have the incentive to accurately report profit. Most corporations have no
the tax code            such incentive, leading to MAT being ineffective as a tool to improve compliance. In the recent
                        past, further exemptions have crept into MAT, reducing its ability to serve as a minimum tax.
                        Lastly, MAT does not apply to non-corporations, hence further limiting its effectiveness.

Taxation of land        The advent of GST would be an opportunity to consolidate stamp duty and other property
transactions can be     registration and related fees into the GST, possibly at the low rate applicable to gold (5 percent).
rationalized to         This would bring many transactions to light, especially as developers would have more incentives
increase revenues       to report, given the facility to claim input tax credits. Notwithstanding these steps, improved
and transparency        collection of land-related taxes also requires fine tuning and modernizing land cadasters, besides
                        frequently updating circle rates to create a better check on reported transaction prices. Finally,
                        keeping the land value updated would allow state governments to moderate stamp duty rates.

Digital financial inclusion
India has been a        Since the 1990s, India began developing the technology infrastructure to facilitate the creation
pioneer in digital      of a payments and settlement ecosystem. Legislation and policy initiatives have been key to
financial inclusion     promoting wider acceptance and deeper penetration of electronic payments, including through
                        the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile) trinity. India now has a robust, diversified and efficient
                        retail payments framework, comparable to that in advanced countries, to meet the diverse
                        requirements of users. These include bank accounts, checks, debit and credit cards and prepaid
                        payment instruments. A variety of remittance channels are in place to suit the needs of users
                        based upon their time criticality and cost sensitivity: National Electronic Funds Transfer
                        (NEFT), Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), Aadhaar Enabled Payment System and recently
                        the Unified Payments Interface. Systems such as the Electronic Clearing Service (ECS), the
                        National Automated Clearing House (NACH) and the Aadhaar Payment Bridge System meet
                        the need for making bulk and repetitive payments. The RBI Committee Report on Medium Term
                        Path on Financial Inclusion (2015) articulated the vision.

Yet cash                            Cash transactions are still very prevalent, however (Table 5), and few individuals used electronic
transactions remain                 payments or mobile banking prior to demonetization (Figure 51). After the demonetization
pervasive                           decision in early November 2016, there has been a large jump in digital payments (Figure 52).
                                    These include debit cards (92 percent y/y in FY17 vs. 31 percent in FY16) and pre-paid
                                    instruments such as e-wallets (71 percent y/y in FY17 vs. 128 percent in FY16). High growth
                                    comes from a low base, however, which explains why the contribution to growth of these
                                    categories is negligible. 19 On balance, the extent to which demonetization succeeds in
                                    universalizing electronic payment will depend on the implementation of supporting
                                    arrangements and capacity building interventions.

19 Following the RBI’s reporting on electronic payments, this figure includes RTGS, which is largely an inter -bank system for large
value payments. RTGS saw huge spurt during demonetization because of an increase in ePayments in other payment systems, which
use the RTGS to do the final aggregate settlement, and because of the increase in liquidity in the banking system that led to more
inter-bank money market transactions and placements with RBI.

                        2017, but Bihar, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha have teledensities below
                        80 percent, while rural teledensity is only 56 percent, suggesting unequal access.

                        India lags further behind with respect to data connections. India has approximately 432 million
                        internet subscribers (of which about half are still on narrowband 2G connections) compared
                        with 731 million in China. Nearly half of Indian businesses had an online presence in 2014
                        compared to two-thirds in China two years earlier. The cost of a 1 Mbit/s residential broadband
                        service in India is 6-10 times more expensive than in China.

Even with the right     While the demonetization experiment moved a large number of individuals to digital payment,
infrastructure,         sustainable changes in consumer behavior will require additional measures. Rao et al (2016)
changing consumer       point to a few key challenges. Individuals need to make two key changes in their behavior. First,
and bank behavior       they must move from tangible means that they can see and feel, to means that are less tangible
will require            or not at all tangible. Second, they have to rely on technologically advanced tools to undertake
additional effort       regular day-to-day operations. The latter requires users to be literate and educated to the extent
                        of comprehending the content of transactions. Supporting and sustained investment in digital
                        financial literacy is needed for this purpose. Complementing that baseline need is accessibility
                        in the local language: if the bulk of the population needs to come on board, it would be
                        important to make these facilities available in the principal Indian languages to ensure that users
                        comprehend the transactions they enter into.

                        In addition, the banking sector will need to move from account opening to account usage. The
                        challenges for the banking sector include adjusting to the cash preferences of customers who
                        start using credit or electronic advances, and translating the increase in the number of bank
                        accounts from the Jan Dhan Yojana into actual usage of those accounts. Increasing the use of
                        direct benefit transfers to provide further benefit through electronic transfers would be an
                        important step in this regard.

                        Customers of Pre-Paid Instruments (PPI) however do not get the full benefits of

                       bank account to PPI and vice versa. However, it is not possible to move funds between PPIs.
                       This difficulty arises because of lack of full access for PPI issuers to the retail payments
                       infrastructure in the country and restrictions on the “cash out” feature for PPI given AML/CFT
                       considerations. In the context of proposed changes to PPI guidelines, the RBI has suggested
                       further strengthening the KYC requirements for opening PPI accounts – this could pose
                       challenges to issuers and customers, but on the other hand could pave the way for PPI
                       instruments getting fully integrated into the retail payments infrastructure.

                       provided during demonetization). Moreover, the government can accelerate its push to digitize
                       all government transactions, including tax filings and payments. In particular, the introduction
                       of GST allows doing this on a national scale.

2.      Fiscal Policy Update
FY18 Budget: Everything in Moderation
Budget largely achieves the objectives of building fiscal credibility
Fiscal consolidation                    The government announced the FY18 fiscal deficit target at 3.2 percent of GDP, lower than the
continues, at a                         expected 3.5 percent deficit in FY17 and the 3.9 percent achieved in FY16 (Table 7 and Figure
measured pace                           54), but 0.2 pp higher than the previously announced fiscal path. This stance is broadly neutral:
                                        excluding disinvestment receipts (which are treated as financing items under GFSM 2001), the
                                        ‘strict’ fiscal deficit (“World Bank/IMF definition” in Table 7 below) is expected to come down
                                        by only 0.1 percent of GDP. The primary deficit contracted by 0.4 percent of GDP in FY17
                                        and is expected to decline further to 0.1 percent in FY18, supporting a declining path for the
                                        debt of the Central government. However, what appears to be the materialization of contingent
                                        liabilities (“residual” in Figure 55) has kept debt ratios above what the path of fiscal deficits
                                        would imply. The combined debt stock of the center and the states has been declining since
                                        2004 and has stabilized close to 69 percent of GDP since FY16.

The budget targets         In May 2016, the government commissioned a group of experts to review the Fiscal
are largely aligned        Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, which embodies India’s fiscal rule. During
with the                   preparations of the FY18 budget, the committee delivered its report to the government, which
recommendations of         published it in April 2017. Its key recommendations include (i) introducing a medium-term debt
the FRBM review            target of 60 percent of GDP for the center and states combined (vs. 69 percent currently); (ii)
committee                  adopting an explicit escape clause for when deficits can deviate from the target; and (iii) gradually
                           lowering the fiscal deficit targets. The government is currently reviewing the recommendations,
                           although it has already accepted some of them in the budget. Importantly, for FY19 (the year
                           of the next general election), the fiscal deficit is targeted at 3 percent of GDP. Box 4 has
                           additional details of the report’s recommendations.

                                                 Box 4: The FRBM Committee Report

 The FRBM Review Committee submitted its report in January 2017. The Committee proposed a draft Debt Management and Fiscal
 Responsibility Bill, 2017 to replace the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBM Act). Key recommendations
 are summarized below:
      1. The committee suggested using general government debt-to-GDP ratio as the primary anchor for medium-term fiscal
         consolidation. A debt-to-GDP ratio of 60 percent should be achieved by no later than FY23, with a 40 percent limit for the
         center and 20 percent limit for the states.
      2. The fiscal deficit (GoI definition) should be adopted as the key operational target consistent with achieving the medium-
         term debt ceiling.
      3. The path of fiscal deficit to GDP ratio consistent with achieving the debt targets, according to a majority of the committee
         was set at 3.0 percent in FY18-FY20, 2.8 percent in FY21, 2.6 percent in FY22, and 2.5 percent in FY23.
      4. The committee has included certain escape clauses to provide fiscal flexibility. These can be invoked in situations resulting
         in (i) matters of national security, war, calamities resulting in collapse of agricultural output (ii) sharp decline in real output
         growth of at least 3 pp below the average for the previous four quarters (iii) far-reaching structural reforms in the economy
         with unanticipated fiscal implications. However, deviations from the stipulated fiscal deficit target should not exceed 0.5 pp
         in a year.
      5. It has also complemented this with a buoyancy clause according to which the fiscal deficit must be lowered by at least 0.5pp
         below the stipulated target if the growth of real GDP is 3pp higher than the average of the previous four quarters.
      6. The revenue deficit to GDP ratio should decline steadily by 0.25 pp each year with the path specified as follows: 2.3 percent
         in FY17, 2.05 percent in FY18, 1.8 percent in FY19, 1.55 percent in FY20, 1.30 percent in FY21, 1.05 percent in FY22, and
         0.8 percent in FY23.
      7. The committee also recommended the setting up of a three-member Fiscal Council that would: (i) provide macroeconomic
         forecasts to the government; (ii) independently assess the central government’s compliance with the recommended fiscal
         targets,; (iii) advise the central government on invoking the escape clause along with the action plan for returning to the
         stipulated fiscal trajectory; and (iv) prepare an annual fiscal strategy




Revenue performance improving; most assumptions for FY18 realistic
Tax revenues               As seen in Note 1, gross tax revenues exceeded the budgeted target of 10.8 percent of GDP,
exceeded targets in        coming in at 11.3 percent, mostly reflecting higher-than-expected excise collections (especially
FY17                       on petroleum products) as well as higher-than-budgeted service tax collection (Figure 56). The
                           increase in collection may be linked to demonetization, as businesses had to legitimize their
                           holdings of old currency. Meanwhile, demonetization had a neutral effect on direct taxes, which
                           were in line with budget targets (5.6 percent of GDP); in effect, the measure boosted income
                           disclosure, but the liquidity crunch dampened economic activity.

Outturn from tax           Tax revenue targets in FY18 are flat as a percentage of GDP compared with FY17 i.e., they
revenues expected          assume a buoyancy of one. On the one hand, there will be some significant headwinds, including
to be stable; no           the reversal of favorable oil prices, the voluntary income disclosure schemes, and the

receipts from GST               ambitious target for Personal Income Tax (PIT) collection (+25 percent in FY18 and +23
                                percent in FY17) may be feasible considering that India has one of the lowest PIT/GDP ratios
                                in the world, and government has increased the rates for individuals in high-income brackets,20
                                whereby compliance may improve due to the information gathered from demonetization.
                                Excise collection is projected to grow by 5 percent, accounting for higher oil prices, which may
                                necessitate lower tax rates, while corporate tax is expected to grow by 9 percent due to a
                                reduction in corporate taxes to 25 percent for SMEs. No projections for GST have been
                                provided, although it is the stated government policy to introduce the GST in July 2017, and at
                                the latest by September 2017.

Transfers to states           Tax devolution to states has been budgeted at 4.0 percent of GDP in FY18, same as the previous
set to remain high            year (Figure 59). This is slightly higher than 1 percent of GDP, as compared with the 13th
                              Finance Commission period, though grants to the states have been reduced to 2.4 percent of
                              GDP, compared with 3.1 percent on the average during this period. Overall, transfers to the
                              states are budgeted at 6.4 percent of GDP in FY18 vs. 5.9 percent on the average for FY11-
                              FY15. By comparison, the central government transfers approximately 30 percent of
                              expenditure to the states, against an average of 9.8 percent in the Organization for Economic
                              Co-operation and Development (OECD), although this is partly due to low own-tax collections
                              in the states, especially the municipalities.

A marginal increase           Capital expenditure, including grants-in-aid for capital formation by the states, is budgeted to
in capex is                   increase from 2.9 percent of GDP in FY16 to 3.0 percent of GDP respectively in FY17 and
budgeted                      FY18. In fact, all deviation of budgetary targeted expenditure in FY17 was due to higher capital
                              expenditures (FY17 budget: 2.7 percent of GDP). Most of the increase in capital outlay can be
                              attributed to infrastructure sectors, such as roads and bridges. The revised estimates of capital
                              expenditure on roads and bridges at 0.26 percent of GDP for FY17 exceeded the budgeted
                              target by 0.16 percent of GDP. This level of expenditure for roads and bridges has been
                              increased slightly to 0.3 percent of GDP in FY18.

Allocations to the            In FY 17, the revised estimates of total expenditures on social services (current + capital + loans
social sectors                and advances) exceeded the budgeted amount by a substantial 0.38 percent of GDP coming in
increased, albeit             at 5.3 percent of GDP. Social sector spending has been further enhanced to 5.7 percent of GDP
modestly                      in FY18. Some of the projected increase (in both FY17RE and FY18BE) is attributed to the
                              “Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act” (MGNREGA) scheme, which
                              became particularly important to absorb unskilled labor displaced by the demonetization
                              exercise. In contrast to the overall decline expected for current expenditures, expenditures on
                              education and health (which are largely current in nature) have increased modestly. Current
                              expenditures on education exceeded budgeted targets in FY 17, and are budgeted to remain flat
                              (up 0.01 pp in FY18). Current expenditures on health largely met budgeted targets in FY17 and
                              have been maintained at the same level in FY18. Substantial increases in capital expenditures on
                              health and education are envisaged in FY18, although they remain a small percentage of total
                              expenditure in the sectors (17 percent and 1 percent in health and education respectively) is the
                              first to be cut.

Important measures     Construction has been an important gateway out of poverty in India. Therefore, policies that
were taken to          promote construction are likely to have dual effects of creating jobs at the low-end of the income

of demonetization      growth. Demonetization’s continued impact in FY18 is expected to be felt primarily in the
on poor and            construction and real estate sectors, therefore the focus on infrastructure investment and
vulnerable through     protecting allocations for MGNREGA are important for the poor. In this context, the budget:
stimulus to
                       (i) granted infrastructure status to affordable housing, which could mean lower tax rates on
construction
                       project development and potentially lower funding costs; (ii) reduced the holding period for

                       subsidies, and e-NAM (national agricultural markets).

Some notable public finance management (PFM) and governance reforms introduced
A few important        PFM reforms included: (i) the budget date has been brought forward by a month, which, on the
PFM reforms            one hand, this gives parliament more time to deliberate and allows for more timely execution.

done                   information has simply been aggregated to the union budget presentation. (iii) Elimination of
                       plan vs. non-plan distinction. The plan vs. non-plan distinction, associated with five-year
                       development plans, has been eliminated and the budget has adopted a more standard
                       classification of expenditures between current and capital. A breakdown of expenditure on
                       schemes, which are largely implemented by states, has been provided instead. This is helpful in
                       identifying the expenditures implemented by central agencies vs. states. (iv) Off-budget funds
                       and overall budget transparency. Special-purpose vehicles, and off-budget borrowing remain
                       pervasive, but limited information is provided in the budget. In FY17, some of the infrastructure
                       push was accomplished through nearly ₹600 billion borrowing by NHAI; the FY18 budget
                       brought a ₹20 billion fund for the dairy sector under the National Bank for Agriculture and
                       Rural Development (NABARD).

State finances: higher deficits, higher capex
State deficits have climbed in recent years, but by how much?
State deficits have     States’ deficits have been on the rise since FY13 (Figure 60) and market borrowing by states
been increasing, but    reached 2.0 percent of GDP in FY17 compared to 1.7 percent of GDP in FY16; in contrast, the
caution is warranted    union reduced borrowing from 3.2 percent to 2.7 percent of GDP. The increase in state deficits
with respect to         is partly due to a sharp deceleration in the growth of own revenues and an acceleration of capital
recent trends           expenditures (Figure 61). However, two caveats apply when looking at the two most recent years.
                        First, the sharper increase in deficits and market borrowings in FY16 includes the effects of
                        UDAY, a scheme whereby state governments took over liabilities of their electricity distribution
                        companies and which were essentially debt of states. Second, fiscal reporting by states face
                        challenges in timeliness and quality. In particular, an analysis of ten major states shows that states
                        tend to overestimate current-year deficits during budget period (see Box 5). While states
                        overestimate revenues, revenue expenditures tend to come even shorter of revised estimates.

                                                                              INDIA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE MAY 2017 » 38

State FY18 budgets project a continuation of capex push and fiscal consolidation
FY18 budgets                         The combined fiscal deficit of a sample of major states21 is budgeted to decline by 12.2 percent
promise lower                        in FY18 from FY17RE, partly as states phase out the UDAY debt transfers that increased deficits
deficits as UDAY                     in FY16 and FY17. For example, Rajasthan’s deficit is expected to decline by 6.4 percent of
expenditures are                     Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in FY17. States have budgeted an increase in total
phased out                           expenditures (revenue expenditure and capital outlays) of 10.2 percent y/y (Figure 62), driven
                                     largely by capital outlays (+21.4 percent y/y). Revenue expenditure is projected to grow by a
                                     more moderate 8.3 percent despite the implementation of recommendations from the 7th Central
                                     Pay Commission in a number of states. States expect revenue growth to exceed expenditure
                                     growth, thus leading to lower deficits. Budget documents target revenue receipts growth of 11.6
                                     percent y/y in FY18, driven by a healthy growth in tax revenues (+12.8 percent y/y), primarily
                                     states’ own tax revenues (+13.7 percent y/y). These projections are in line with the guarantee
                                     given by the center, that under the GST revenues would increase by at least 14 percent nominally.

                                           Box 5: Revised estimates and actual budget execution outturns

 With a larger share of expenditure and borrowing in India now undertaken by states, interest has grown in state finances. However,
 the quality and untimeliness of state-level fiscal information creates a major hurdle to state-level fiscal analysis. This Box presents a
 comparison between the revised estimates and actual fiscal deficit in selected states to understand whether revised estimates (RE) of
 fiscal deficits of states are reliable guides to actual outturns. We base our observations on a sample of 10 states22 for a period of 10
 years from 2006 to 2015.

 Data shows that in the last ten years, on average, eight out of ten states in our sample have overestimated their fiscal deficits (Table
 8) and actual deficits were 0.5 pp of GDP lower than the revised estimates suggested (Figure 63). In other words, the audited fiscal
 deficit turns out to be systematically lower than the revised estimate of the fiscal deficit announced within two months of the end of
 the fiscal year. An increasing number of states have overestimated their receipts over the last 10 years, while almost all states have
 overestimated expenditures as well. Overestimation of expenditures vis-à-vis in revenues drives most of the overestimation of fiscal
 deficit. Notably, the execution of revenue expenditures drives the underestimation of expenditures with a smaller contribution from
 capital outlays (Figure 64), although there is some variation across states.

GST on the verge of implementation
Government makes progress on GST implementation
The GST is on track                Following the approval of the Constitutional amendment to enact the Goods and Services Tax
for implementation                 (GST) in September 2016, the Union Cabinet has in March 2017 approved four bills23 to
in Q2 FY18, but key                implement the new tax. The GST would be levied on all transactions involving supply of goods
policy and                         and services except those that are exempt or kept out of the purview of the GST, primarily
administrative                     electricity, and alcohol, as well as petroleum products, which can be added later.
challenges remain
                                   The model adopted by India for the GST is unique and reflects the country’s federal structure.
                                   First, the central government and the States will levy parallel taxes on goods and services
                                   simultaneously through a dual GST model. The first component, Central GST (C-GST) will be
                                   levied and collected by the central government, and the second component, namely, the State
                                   GST (S-GST) will be levied, collected and appropriated by each of the States. A third variant of
                                   the GST, the integrated GST (I-GST), will be set at a rate equal to the C-GST plus S-GST, and
                                   will apply to interstate transactions instead of C-GST and S-GST. The states and the Center will
                                   split the administration of the GST. The second unusual feature of India’s GST is that it will
                                   have a number of rates – from exempt, to low-rated, to standard-rated with additional cesses.

                                   The GST Council is currently working on the final operational rules, and the Fitment Committee
                                   has recently announced GST rates on all goods and services, a challenging task given the need
                                   to harmonize rates across 29 states that in some cases had different rates for the same
                                   commodity (Figure 65 and Figure 66).

                                   To be ready for the GST, State governments will need to re-engineer and align their processes
                                   with the GST processes, no matter whether a state decides to adopt its own IT systems (Model
                                   1), or use the IT system developed by the GST Network (Model 2). Due to the integrated nature
                                   of commerce across the country, and the potential of widespread disruptions if some states
                                   move to GST and some do not, it is critical that all states ensure their preparedness, including
                                   the majority of Model 2 states, which would still require significant capacity building.
                                   Notwithstanding the challenges, the GST is expected to be rolled out in the second quarter of

                       firms. By replacing a large number of taxes levied by the center and the States, GST would
                       integrate the tax base and allow seamless flow of input tax credit across the value chain of goods
                       and services. This would eliminate the need to file and pay multiple taxes, reduce cascading, and
                       result in an overall simplification of indirect taxation regime. Third, GST will reduce logistics
                       costs of moving goods across states, since the current regime had a number of barriers to trade
                       across states, from inspections at state borders, to limits on claiming input tax credit, and the
                       central sales tax, which was not eligible for input tax credit, effectively acting as a tariff. Fourth,
                       investment may gain as the distinction between goods and services is eliminated and capital
                       goods used as an input in provision of services will also be eligible for input tax credit.

                       While the mechanisms are clear, estimating their impact on economic growth is challenging. In
                       one recent study, Van Leemput and Wiencek (2017) estimated a positive impact on real GDP
                       between 3.1 to 4.2 percent. However, due to lack of data, the authors can only calibrate the
                       model to inter-state trade that takes place through rail, which represents less than 40 percent of
                       domestic trade. Moreover, the model appears to result in a reduction of overall tax burdens,
                       which is unlikely to be the case given the objective of revenue neutrality of the policy. Regardless,
                       the impact is likely to be positive and significant, given the highly inefficient nature of the current
                       indirect tax system.

The GST is             A key design feature of the GST is that it should be revenue neutral. As of FY15, states and the
intended to be         center raise approximately 13 percent of private consumption expenditure in indirect taxes that

formalizes
                       Revenue neutrality also (approximately) ensures that the impact on inflation will be minimal. A
                       lower tax burden in one segment (e.g. higher provision of input tax credits for manufactured
                       items) would need to be offset by increases in other categories (e.g. services, which are currently
                       taxed at 15 percent and are likely to be taxed at the standard 18 percent rate). States are
                       guaranteed revenue growth of at least 14 percent y/y; should actual GST revenues fall short of
                       the guaranteed target, the center will compensate them.

                       In the long term, the GST will help increase formalization of the economy and may lead to
                       higher revenues. Sellers who are not in the GST chain will be unable to claim input credits,
                       putting them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis registered vendors. As the credit chain will function
                       only if all the transactions are recorded, the post-GST environment would lead to improved
                       disclosure of economic transactions, which in turn, may also have a strongly positive impact on
                       direct tax collection.

                               standard-rated inputs to exempt items, as well as cascading of taxes outside of GST (especially
                               those on petroleum products), lead to a significant “tax content” of many exempt and low-rated
                               products (Figure 68 and Figure 69). This suggests that simplifying the GST by reducing the
                               number of exemptions and rates would likely improve efficiency without a significant loss of
                               progressivity, which is best achieved through cash transfers and broader use of progressive

In line with the                             This note examines recent trends in international trade and outlines developments on the policy
global slowdown in                           front, both globally and in India. In particular, India has not been immune to the global
trade, India’s growth                        slowdown in trade of the past three years, as growth rates in exports and imports have been
in imports and                               decreasing. Two recent significant global policy developments, namely the formal initiation of
exports has been                             the process of exit by the United Kingdom from the European Union and the New Trade Policy
declining                                    Agenda for 2017 announced by the USA, contributed to the uncertainty surrounding trade
                                             openness from the two major economies. On the domestic front, India laid out its new Foreign
                                             Trade Policy (FTP) for five years (2015-20), ratified the WTO trade facilitation agreement and
                                             implemented the Single Window Interface for Facilitating Trade. India also introduced several
                                             trade remedy measures, other export and import measures, and FDI reforms.

Before the recent pickup, trade went through a multi-year decline
The trade-to-GDP      In the past 20 years, India has become more integrated with the global economy. The trade-to-
ratio has declined in GDP ratio more than doubled from 27.5 percent in FY 2002 to 56.7 percent in FY 2013, as
recent years…         service exports and merchandise imports climbed (Figure 70). However, the trade-to-GDP ratio
                      declined to 43.4 percent in FY 2016, the lowest since FY 2005, as India has experienced an
                      export slump in the previous four years.

                                             been driving the decline in Indian merchandise export growth (Figure 72). A similar
                                             decomposition of Indian service export growth (Figure 73) reveals that between Q3 of FY 2013
                                             and Q3 of FY 2015, the low growth rates was largely because of a loss in India’s competitiveness.
                                             Contracting world demand was responsible for the declining growth rates since Q4 FY2015 and
                                             gains in India’s market share have contributed to the pickup in services growth in recent

Demand was weak                 India’s exports have declined across markets. Driven by lower commodity prices and slowing
across destinations             growth in China, exports to the Middle East and emerging economies, including China, fell
                                substantially in FY16, and explained almost 60 percent of the decline in export in the fiscal year
                                (Figure 74). Only 25 percent of the drop in FY 2016 can be attributed to a loss in India’s
                                competitiveness. Conversely, the revival of merchandise exports in FY17, particularly Q3, was
                                due largely to improvement in India’s competitiveness. Besides, there was growth in world
                                demand during Q3 of FY17, the first since Q2 of FY15

                            In the United States, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the United
                            States from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). Britain, meanwhile, initiated the process of exit
                            from the European Union on March 29th, 2017.

                            While there is concern about the effects of a shift towards more protectionist trade policies in
                            the global economy, some studies indicate that India, and the South Asia region more broadly,
                            under certain policy scenarios, may be little affected. On the contrary, India should seize the
                            opportunity and deepen its participation in the global economy (World Bank, 2017).

                            On the other hand, developing countries more broadly and India in particular have continued
                            to push for gradual opening. The government of India laid out the new foreign trade policy for
                            2015-20. India also took important steps taken on the trade facilitation front. These include the
                            ratification of the WTO trade Facilitation Agreement, the submission at the WTO of a Trade
                            Facilitation in Services Agreement proposal, paralleling the existing similar agreement for trade
                            in goods, and the introduction of the Single Window System for Customs clearance. The GoI
                            also introduced several trade remedy measures and other trade policy measures as well as
                            undertook important liberalization reforms in FDI.

                            an executive order in January, 2017 to withdraw the USA from the TPP. Twelve countries,
                            namely Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru,
                            Singapore, the USA and Vietnam had signed this trade deal in February 2016. These countries
                            accounted for 36 percent of world GDP and 23 percent of world export in 2014.

                            The TPP aimed at eliminating tariffs with the exclusion of sensitive items, lowering non-tariff
                            barriers, enforcing more stringent environmental and labor standards, strengthening intellectual
                            property rights (IPR) protection, increasing transparency in public procurement and limiting
                            advantages to state-owned enterprises. According to a World Bank (2016b) estimate, the
                            agreement could have raised the GDP of its member countries by an average of 1.1 percent and
                            member country trade by 11 percent by 2030.

                            Several studies estimated that the TPP could have led to some losses in Indian exports,
                            particularly to the US market, due to trade diversion (Kumar and Krishna, 2015, Banga and
                            Sahu, 2015, among others). The United States is the single largest destination for Indian exports.
                            Around 16.2 percent of the total merchandise exports and 15.75 percent of the total service
                            exports from India are to the United States.25 The remaining eleven countries account for
                            around 13.4 percent of the merchandise export market and 10.65 percent of the service export
                            market (Figure 80).26 The greatest impact from the TPP was expected in the textile sector, given
                            that Vietnam would have gained zero duty access to US markets while India would face duties
                            of 14-32 percent on readymade garments. In addition, Vietnam presently imports yarn and fabric
                            from India and exports readymade garments to the US. The ‘Yarn forward rule’ under the TPP
                            would have made it mandatory to source yarn from TPP member countries to avail duty
                            preference and could potentially have impacted exports of Indian yarn to Vietnam.



25Merchandise export data pertains to FY 2016 and service export data to 2011.
26Among the TPP economies, Singapore, USA, Japan and Malaysia are also an important source of foreign direct investment. These four countries
accounted for over 51 percent of FDI inflows in FY 2016 (RBI, World Bank staff calculations)


47 « INDIA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE MAY 2017
                    Given the withdrawal of the United States from the TPP, the TPP will not go ahead in its current
                    form. The member countries met in March 2017 in Chile to assess future steps. However, no
                    clear consensus emerged on the way forward. The member countries are scheduled to meet
                    again in May 2017. Given these recent developments, where the future of TPP, as well as that
                    of other trade agreements the US is party to or is currently negotiating, such as the Transatlantic
                    Trade and Investment Partnership and the Trade in Services Agreement, is unclear, it is difficult
                    to ascertain the likely impact on Indian exports.

The United          The United Kingdom is an important global player, with the European Union (EU) accounting
Kingdom voted in    for over half of its trade. Several emerging economies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and
June 2016 to exit   Sub-Saharan Africa have a high trade exposure with the UK. As part of the EU, the UK had
from the European   clear commitments and rights, in several areas including competition policy, investment and
Union (Brexit)      movement of capital. As an EU member, the UK was part of 36 preferential trade agreements
                    (PTAs). Brexit has increased trade and investment policy uncertainty for the UK and the impact
                    of Brexit on trade flows and investment would depend on the type of trade relationship that the
                    UK will have with the EU.

                    World Bank (2016a) considers several post-Brexit scenarios assuming varying degrees of
                    economic integration with the EU. These include the “Norway Scenario” (the UK is a non-EU
                    European Economic Area – EEA – member part of the European Single Market); the “Swiss
                    Scenario” (the UK is a not a member of the EU or the EEA, but negotiates bilateral treaties
                    with the EU), the “FTA scenario” (the UK negotiates FTAs with the EU and other countries),
                    and the “no-agreement scenario” (UK trade is governed by the WTO). The study concludes
                    that the weaker the trade deal negotiated with the EU, the more negative could be the post-
                    Brexit outcome for the UK. Thus, the Norway scenario dominates the FTA scenario, which
                    dominates the no-agreement scenario. The study also suggests that Brexit may have a negative
                    impact on trade with countries that have strong trade linkages with the UK, which include
                    Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Ireland, Netherlands and Cyprus in the EU, as well as non-
                    EU countries such as South Africa, Nigeria and countries in the Caribbean.

                    The UK accounts for around 3.6 percent of India’s merchandise export market share and 7.5
                    percent of service export market share. (Figure 80). Between 2011 and 2016, approximately 5.6

                               percent of total FDI inflows were from the UK.27 The impact of Brexit on India would depend
                               on the post Brexit trade policy that emerges as well as the agreements India negotiates with the
                               UK, going forward.

Trade policy developments in India show continued but cautious engagement in global trade
The new Foreign                Enacted in April 2015, the policy aims to promote exports, encourage domestic procurement
Trade Policy (FTP)             of inputs and capital goods and improve trade facilitation. Two new schemes, the Merchandise
2015-20 aims at                Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and the Services Exports from India Scheme (SEIS) have
promoting exports              been introduced. Duty scrips are granted as rewards under the MEIS and SEIS. These scrips
                               can be used to pay customs duty on imports of inputs and capital goods, excise duty on domestic
                               procurement of inputs and capital goods and service tax for procurement of services. Under the
                               MEIS, countries have been categorized into three groups (traditional markets, emerging and
                               focus markets and other markets) and the rates of rewards range from 2 – 5 percent of realized
                               FOB value of exports. The rate of rewards under SEIS range between 3 – 5 percent on exports
                               of notified services.

                               In order to incentivize domestic procurement, the government has reduced the export
                               obligation under the Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCG) for capital goods
                               sourced domestically. The scheme allows for imports of capital goods at zero customs duty. The
                               importer is subject to a normal export obligation of six times the duty saved over and above the
                               average exports of the applicant in the preceding three years. In the case of indigenous
                               procurement of capital goods, duties are calculated as notional customs duties and the export
                               obligation set is lower than when capital goods are sourced from abroad. The new MEIS scheme
                               also proposes higher rewards for items with higher domestic content and value addition as
                               compared to items with high import content and less value addition.

                               With a view to improve the ease of doing business, the government reduced the number of
                               mandatory documents for exports and imports to three. The new FTP will be valid until March
                               31st 2020 and is due for a mid-term review in October 2017. See Table 9 for key changes to the

has come into force   concluded at the WTO’s 2013 Bali Ministerial Conference. The Government of India handed
                      over the instrument of the TFA to the WTO in April 2016 and was the 76th country to ratify
                      the TFA, now signed by over 110 countries and having come into force on February 22nd, 2017.

                      OECD (2015) estimate that the TFA could potentially reduce trade costs by 12.6 -16.5 percent
                      for low income countries, 13.7 -17.4 percent for lower-middle income countries, 12.8 -14.6
                      percent for upper-middle income countries and 10.4 -11.8 percent for OECD countries. WTO
                      (2015) use a computable general equilibrium model and predict an increase in world exports
                      from the TFA of between USD 750 billion to USD 1 trillion dollars per annum. The actual gains
                      would depend on the implementation time frame and coverage. Between 2015 and 2030, the
                      implementation of the TFA is expected to add more than 2 percent per year to world export
                      growth and approximately half a percent per year to world GDP growth. Their estimates from
                      a Gravity model suggest even larger gains.

                      Logistics connect firms to domestic and international markets through a network of supply
                      chains whose performance is critical to trade integration and growth. The LPI measures the
                      efficiency of supply chains across the world. It is prepared by the World Bank every two years
                      based on a survey of over 1,200 logistics professionals worldwide. In a large country like India,
                      the LPI is biased towards the performance of the main economic gateways (e.g. Mumbai), and
                      may not capture the full extent of costs and inefficiency in moving goods internally.

28Anti-dumping duties are imposed by an importing country to combat dumping, i.e., when an exporter sells at a lower price in the foreign market
than it sells in its domestic market. Countervailing duties are imposed by importing countries to counter artificially low prices that are a result of
subsidies offered by governments to exports. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties are discriminatory measures applied to the particular trading
partner to combat `unfair’ trade practices, which is shown to cause harm to domestic industry. Safeguard measures are temporary import restrictions
or duty increases to protect a specific domestic industry from an increase in imports of any product which could cause serious injury to the industry.
These measures are non-discriminatory and are applied to all trading partners. Unlike anti-dumping and countervailing measures, safeguard measures
do not require a finding of an `unfair’ practice.

          C. Unlocking women’s potential




     Kavita holds a postgraduate degree in commerce and stays with her family in an informal settlement in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. She told
     a World Bank team in 2015 that she wanted a job, and even managed to obtain one as a teacher. However, the salary was a “pittance”,
     not commensurate with the effort she put in. Next, she invested in a specialized course for accountancy and registered in an employment
     exchange. Her efforts bore fruit and she secured a job offer for an accountant’s position in a textile firm. There, her prospective employers
     expected her to work long hours, and her parents forbade her to return home late from work. As a result, Kavita was not working. Her
     mother, a home-based worker stitching small garments on a piece rate basis, spoke of finding “a suitable match” for her daughter.

i.        Women represent an untapped source of growth for India
Increasing women’s           Low female labor force participation rates (LFPRs) impose constraints on a country’s growth,
participation in the         the empowerment of its women, and the outcomes for its children. Greater involvement from
labor market is one          women in the labor force has both an economic and a social impact. Paid employment is known
of the key                   to increase women’s agency and empowerment (World Bank, 2011 and 2012). Money gives
challenges of India’s        women a sense of empowerment within their marriage and their households, higher levels of
development                  decision-making power, and greater mobility. At the household level, women who participate in
                             the labor force marry and have children later, and their children stay in school longer. Even the
                             sisters of women who work marry later (Sivasankaran, 2014). Moreover, there is evidence that
                             women’s earnings can have a beneficial impact, not just on their own health and nutrition, but
                             the health and education outcomes of their children. Women are more likely than men to invest
                             a large proportion of their household income in the education of their children (Qian, 2008).

                             In sum, an increase in women’s labor force participation (LFP) and earnings can lead to faster
                             growth, reduced poverty and more widely shared prosperity. Women benefit from their
                             economic empowerment, and so too can their men, children and society as a whole. The case
                             for India getting more of its women in the labor force is thus not only “the right thing to do”
                             but also “smart economics” (World Bank, 2006).

India’s low female LFPR has declined further
India’s female                   India’s female LFPR is not only low compared to other countries or that of Indian men, but has
LFPR declined 10                 declined between 2004-05 and 2011-12 (the latest available National Sample Survey or NSS). At
pp between 2004-05               37 percent in 2004-05, India’s LFPR was already some 15-20 pp lower than what would be
and 2011-12                      expected given its income level. This rate declined further between 2004-05 and 2011-12,
                                 reaching 27 percent31. Among the working age (15+) population, 25 percent of women had a
                                 job in 2011-12 (two percent were unemployed), compared to 79 percent of men (Figure 89).
                                 While 92 percent of men who were not in school had a job, only 28 percent of women did.
                                 Considering only those of prime working age (25-46), the figures are 99 percent for men and 29
                                 percent for women. This gap increased from 2004-05. The share of men either in school or in
                                 the labor force has been stable, with a modest decline among men above the age of 46
                                 (suggestive of net retirements). For women, however, a number equivalent to 4.4 pp of the total
                                 working age population was neither working or in school, and this decline affected both women

Reconciling census and NSS views of female LFP
Possible mis-                    One proposed explanation for the decline in female LFP is that of mismeasurement of women’s
measurement                      work. The analysis in this chapter is based on India’s NSS. Hirway (2012) argues that the NSS
cannot explain the               does not capture a sizeable part of female employment that is related to home-based subsidiary
decline                          work. The work most women in India are engaged in does not match the image of a regular,
                                 salaried, nine-to-five job. Many women have marginal jobs or are engaged in multiple activities,
                                 including home production, which is difficult to measure adequately.

                                 Female unemployment may be underestimated as well. Under the NSS Principal Status
                                 definitions, a person is only considered part of the labor force if he or she has been looking for
                                 a job for at least six months during the survey year – a very stringent criterion. For example, in
                                 the case of the MGNREGA, a number of people who work or seek work under MGNREGA,
                                 or who are registered with a placement agency, are counted by the NSS as being out of the labor
                                 force. If their number is included, the female LFPR is higher by about 3 pp and 5 pp in rural
                                 and urban areas, respectively.


31This figure is based on ‘principal status’ but the pattern is similar when considering different definitions. Andres et al. (2017) report a decline
from 43 percent to 31 percent under the latter definition. See the Technical Appendix for details on how labor force participation is defined.

                               This explanation also coheres with employment indicators from the population censuses of 2001
                               and 2011, which show only a small decline in female LFP in rural areas compared to the decline
                               reported in the NSS. The difference lies mostly in the manner in which the Census and NSS
                               define unemployment: the Census does not require a person to have been searching for a job
                               for at least 6 months during the year, as the NSS does. This less stringent definition results in a
                               much higher unemployment rate in rural areas in the Census in 2011. If unemployment was
                               indeed high in rural areas, it suggests that not all decline in female LFP was voluntary.

                      Agenor, Mares, and Sorsa (2015) develop a model that simulates policies expected to influence
                      women’s choices in how they allocate their time between household chores and childcare,
                      investing in their human capital, and work. Policies include both pro-growth and pro-gender
                      policies, such as investment in infrastructure, improving efficiency of government spending in
                      health and education, increasing family benefits per child, and affirmative action policies for
                      women in the labor market. The authors estimate that such policies would boost India’s growth
                      rate by 1.5 to 2.4 pp per annum in the long term.

                      Khera (2016) links the issues of gender inequality and informality in the labor market within a
                      unified framework. Her model allows her to quantify the impact of gender-based policies on
                      aggregate economic activity and on labor market indicators of gender inequality. Khera argues
                      that policies to reduce informality and facilitate women’s participation in the labor market are
                      complementary, and shows that increasing the level of education of women by 5 percent raises
                      the female LFPR by 1.5 pp and GDP by 1.25 percent. Higher education also increases the
                      number of women in formal employment and consequently reduces inequality. She estimates
                      that closing the gender gap would lead to a 6 percent increase in India’s GDP.

                      gap in LFP, is over 30 percent.

ii.     What are the proximate causes of low and declining women’s LFPR?
Women’s LFPR has      Two patterns stand out as proximate causes of changes in the LFP of Indian women. First, a
declined further      larger share of young women is outside the labor market because they are in school. Second,
with more education   there has been a dramatic drop in female LFP in rural areas (from 41 to 29 percent), while female
and urbanization      LFP in urban areas has stagnated at very low levels (20 percent). The combination of a larger
                      number of girls in school, a declining female LFPR in rural areas, a stagnant female LFPR in
                      urban areas, and urbanization together account for the overall drop in the female LFPR.

More young women in school is a “good” cause of the recent decline in female LFP
About 30 percent of   Both the male and female LFPR declined between 2004-05 and 2011-12, to some extent as more

school longer         matches the increase in women of the same age group who are in school. For this age group,
                      the increase in female enrollment can explain the drop in female LFP (Andres et al., 2017). As
                      a result, out of a total decline in the female LFPR of close to 10 pp, approximately 3 pp are
                      explained by a larger number of young women who might have previously been at work but are
                      now in school. Similarly, Rangarajan, Iyer, and Kaul (2011) estimate the share of women who
                      withdraw from the labor force in order to improve their education at over 40 percent.

Participation rates                  Not only were there more young women in school in 2011-12 compared to 2004-05, but those
among educated                       in the labor market had a higher level of education (Figure 95). However, the effect of higher
women are also                       levels of education on female LFP is not linear. While college-educated women do have a higher
relatively low…                      propensity to work, women who have only completed a secondary education are the least likely
                                     to work (Figure 96), in large part because an increasing number are continuing their studies
                                     (Figure 97). However, even for college graduates, the female LFPR in India is only around 40
                                     percent compared to 59 percent in Bangladesh and over 75 percent in Indonesia and Brazil.

… and declined for                   The discussion so far suggests that approximately 30 percent of the decline in women’s LFPR
all age and                          is due to more young women being in school. However, the LFPR declined for women of all
educational groups                   ages (Figure 97). As shown also in Figure 90, there was a significant increase in the number of
                                     women who are neither in school nor working, which went well beyond the decline in the share
                                     of (older) men in the labor force (and which might be attributable to an aging society). On the
                                     contrary, the decline is concentrated among those of prime working age (26-45).

                                     In addition, the female LFPR fell across all levels of educational attainment, and even after
                                     taking into account school enrolment (Figure 98). Female LFPR declined the most for the group

                                                         In rural areas, the LFPR for men declined by approximately 5 pp over this period, which may
                                                         be explained by additional schooling and, to a lesser extent, retirements. Meanwhile, the
                                                         magnitude of the decline was much larger for rural women, with their LFPR falling by nearly 15
                                                         pp to 36 percent in 2011-12 (Figure 102); the decline is similar regardless of the measure of
                                                         employment used. Andres et al. (2017) argue that the drop in the overall female LFPR was
                                                         mainly due to this development.

Female LFP                                               One factor contributing to the decline in rural female LFPRs may be a de facto urbanization of
declines along the                                       rural areas and the fact that movements across the urban-rural gradation may not be captured
rural-urban                                              in the binary rural/urban designation. As rural areas become less agricultural, the female LFPR
gradation                                                there may increasingly resemble the (lower) female LFPR in urban areas. Lending support to
                                                         this view, female LFPR strongly declines along the rural-urban gradation. Women living in
                                                         India’s smallest villages (with population below 5000 people) are twice as likely to be in the labor
                                                         force as those living in big (million plus population) cities (Figure 103). For men, on the other
                                                         hand, the LFP is roughly the same (Figure 104).

Women’s jobs                               While less than half of Indian men are now employed in agriculture, nearly two-thirds of working
remain primarily in                        women remain tied to farm-based work (Figure 105), typically “self-employed” on the family
agriculture                                farm. In fact, the share of agricultural employment in a state or district is a good predictor of
                                           the female LFPR (see Box 8). The decline of female LFP along the urban gradation is linked to
                                           the fact that women’s participation in services and industry, which are urban sectors, is very low
                                           (Figure 106) compared to other countries. The decline in the share of women working in
                                           agriculture seen in Figure 105 is largely explained by women dropping out of the labor force,
                                           rather than a large shift to other sectors. In most sectors, with the exception of utilities and
                                           construction, the share of women was stable or declined.

                      Indian women are underrepresented in traditional services such as trade, hotels and restaurants,
                      as well as modern services such as finance, real estate and other business services, which includes
                      the IT industry. The only exceptions are public administration, education and health, but even
                      in those sectors the share of women is lower than in other countries.

iii.   Deeper causes: why is urban female LFP so low?
Why are there so      The main challenge is therefore to understand the deeper causes of the low number of urban
few women in          Indian women working, and, relatedly, why there are so few women in the industry and service
industry and          sectors. The main explanations that have been put forward can be sorted along two broad sets
services?             focusing either on labor supply or on demand. The decision to participate in the labor market
                      (labor supply) depends on women’s individual preferences or her family circumstances. On the
                      other hand, women may be willing to participate in the labor market, but do not because of
                      insufficient demand, represented by a scarcity of jobs that women find suitable.

The income hypothesis: women prefer not to work when household income increases
As income             Some decline in female LFPR can be expected with development. Female LFP is often seen as
increases, some       exhibiting a U-shaped relationship with income and education (Figure 86 above): at low levels
women may choose      of income and education, women mostly work out of necessity and in poor quality jobs, largely
to drop out of the    in agriculture. As household incomes rise when men find jobs in industry or services, women
labor force           may choose to drop out from the labor market as their reservation wage increases. Higher
                      household incomes may allow women to stay at home, often a preferred household choice in a
                      predominantly patriarchal society in which working outside of the home is stigmatized.

                      Another argument proposed by Andres et al. (2017) is that women are often secondary workers
                      who work temporarily to smooth family income. With increasing share of regular wage earners
                      and declining share of casual labor in the composition of family labor supply, women may drop
                      out of the labor force. Women may also move out of the labor force to spend more time on
                      care duties, more so in urban areas where lack of childcare and family child support with
                      increasingly nuclear families leave them with little choice but to stay at home.

                      Meanwhile, higher levels of education may interact with the marriage market, since education
                      increases both employment and marriage prospects in the Indian context. Moreover, higher
                      levels of education may also lead to lower female LFP if social stigma is associated with low-
                      skilled jobs or work in general increases with women’s education (Klasen and Pieters, 2015).

                      A large body of academic work has explained the decline in the female LFPR in India using such
                      supply-side explanations; see for instance, Olsen (2006), Chowdhury (2011), Neff, Kunal, and
                      Kling (2012), Himanshu (2011), Rangarajan et al. (2011), and Klasen and Pieters (2015).

Supply-side           However, there is evidence that higher household incomes are not closely associated with female
explanations cannot   LFP. Based on a comparison at the district level, a doubling of real wages between 2005 and
explain all the       2012 has been associated with only a modest (3 percent) decline in the rural female LFPR, not
developments          with the much larger 13 pp fall that occurred during this period (Figure 109). In addition,
observed              households with similar living standards are still characterized by varying female LFPR
                      depending on whether they live in rural or urban areas.

                      Moreover, some of the “supply-side” explanations such as the lack of childcare may help explain
                      some of the decline in the LFPR of women 26-45, but can hardly account for the decline in
                      LFPR of women over 45. Among the latter group, a number equivalent to two percentage points
                      of the working age population dropped out of the labor force, compared to half a percentage
                      point for men.

The jobs hypothesis: there are not enough jobs suitable for women in urban areas
There is a scarcity             Chatterjee, Murgai and Rama (2015) argue that beyond the income effect, the key fundamental
of suitable jobs for            driver of the decline in female LFPR in India is the lack of “suitable” jobs for women. Between
women                           2005 and 2012, the number of farm jobs dropped substantially, without a parallel increase in
                                jobs in offices and factories (Figure 110). Casual work in construction absorbed some of the
                                women exiting agriculture, with a significant contribution from MGNREGA, which in 2012
                                accounted for over a third of the female construction workers. However, job creation was
                                insufficient overall, particularly in the rapidly-expanding areas that are neither truly rural nor
                                fully urban. Farm jobs have declined particularly in the small villages, whereas regular
                                employment expanded significantly only in large cities. The combination of these two trends
                                created a “valley” of suitable jobs for women along the rural-urban gradation (Figure 111).

                                In a traditional society where women’s work is considered acceptable only if it takes place in
                                environments perceived as safe, female LFPR can be expected to depend on availability of jobs
                                which are “at home” or “close to home”. Jobs in agriculture offer that advantage. With a decline

                                  “peri-urban areas” or densification of “officially rural areas”, the challenge may be not that of
                                  urbanization per se, but that of finding suitable job opportunities for women in India’s rapidly
                                  growing small towns (large villages), which can replace the comfort of farming. Chatterjee et al.
                                  (2015) find that once local job opportunities are taken into account, the place of residence along
                                  the rural-urban gradation loses relevance as an explanation of female LFP. What matters for
                                  women’s employment is job opportunities around where a household lives; not so much
                                  whether the household is based in a rural or urban area.

                                  The importance of demand-side factors, and that the availability of suitable jobs matters, has
                                  also been highlighted by many authors (e.g. Rogers, 2012; Klasen and Pieters, 2015; Kannan and
                                  Raveendran, 2012; and Chand and Srivastava, 2014).

Women say they                    Nearly one-third of women not in the labor force and engaged in domestic duties as of 2011-
would like to work                12, corresponding to a quarter of the women out of the labor force, were willing to accept work
                                  (NSSO, 2014; Figure 112). If all women engaged in domestic duties who are willing to work had
                                  a job, the female LFPR would increase by nearly 20 pp.

The jobs hypothesis               One of the puzzles of India’s low female LFP is the low LFPR of college graduates compared

puzzle of education               India, the demand for skills would be expected to be large and growing, leading employers to
                                  create jobs that attract an increasing number of educated women. In particular, India’s women
                                  comprise a large share of science, technology and business graduates (Figure 113), and in theory
                                  should have highly sought-after skills. Therefore, it appears that factors other than a lack of
                                  skills is restricting job creation. Indeed, a 2014 World Bank Enterprise Survey32, only 9.4 percent
                                  of firms identified an inadequately educated workforce as a major constraint, compared to 15.7
                                  percent in Bangladesh and 21.7 percent globally.

iv.        What kinds of jobs do women consider suitable?

                            girls in two cities – Bhopal and Indore – in Madhya Pradesh33 (for more details see Fruttero,
                            Mehta and Schmidt, 2014). Respondents had different socio-economic backgrounds and
                            education levels. Some lived in informal settlements while others were students enrolled in
                            engineering colleges. The researchers probed them about their aspirations, the jobs they
                            considered “suitable”, the barriers they faced in accessing the labor market, and more specifically
                            the decision-making process they followed while thinking about which job to take up and which
                            one to forego.

                            The picture that emerged was surprisingly uniform. While nearly all women and girls expressed
                            a desire to work, and some were even offered work, the terms of employment were not always
                            considered favorable. Women wanted jobs that were well-paying, close to their homes, and with
                            flexible working hours. Underlying the need for proximity and flexibility were strong social
                            norms around women’s chastity, marriage, work, and household duties.

Women need jobs that are safe, pay adequately, and offer flexible working hours
Concerns about              In some cases, the need to ensure safety was driven by actual incidents of crime against women.
women’s safety are          The settlement where Kavita lived, for instance, was relatively new, comprised largely of
strong and often            migrants who worked in brick kilns. It had no street lights, youth unemployment was high and
genuine                     an alcohol shop in the area was perceived by residents as having further escalated violence
                            against women and girls. In other cases, the girls felt that the powerful imagery of violence
                            against women created by popular media also played a role in their parents forcing them to take
                            up jobs in the vicinity of their neighborhood and/or those with flexible working hours.

                            The perceived need for safety at work is confirmed in other studies. In a recent survey conducted
                            by the Evidence for Policy Design initiative, 62 percent of unemployed female youth said they
                            would consider migrating for a job. However, while they were willing to migrate in similar
                            measure as men (68 percent of unemployed male youth said they would migrate), nearly two-
                            thirds reported it to be unsafe to live away from home, compared to 32 percent of males.

                            Similarly, the Breakthrough Index for Women in the Workplace by the Center for Strategic and
                            International Studies finds that states that have high female workforce participation (e.g. Sikkim,
                            Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) are also states that have fewer restrictions on
                            women’s working hours and high conviction rates for workforce crimes against women.

Flexibility,                A majority of women and girls interviewed for the qualitative study considered marriage and

                                            childcare was even lower – only 7 firms offered such facilities. Of the firms that provided either
                                            maternity leave or childcare facilities (46), the average share of female employees was 20.5
                                            percent, slightly more than the share of those that did not (14.7 percent; Sutra Consulting, 2016).

                                                                                                                       INDIA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE MAY 2017 » 68
                          Relatively few regular salaried jobs were created between 2005 and 2012, and four of every five
                          such jobs went to men (Figure 115), who continue to hold a disproportionate share of regular
                          jobs (Figure 116).

Labor laws are            Part of the reason women do not take up a higher share of regular wage jobs may lie with Indian
relatively restrictive    labor laws. First, they do not afford the same levels of maternity benefits as other countries
towards women             (Figure 117). Second, in many cases they prevent women from taking up certain types of jobs
                          in the formal economy (Table 12). And third, labor laws reduce the flexibility of regular wage
                          jobs: while in the Republic of Korea parents are entitled by law to flexible or part-time work
                          schedules, the same is not available in India. More broadly, S. Das et al. (2015) find that more
                          flexible state labor markets are associated with higher female LFPRs. The authors also find that
                          the chance of being employed in the formal sector is higher in states with more flexible labor
                          laws.

Employers seem            Nearly all women and girls interviewed for the qualitative study in Madhya Pradesh were of the
increasingly open to      opinion that employers were more open to hiring women in regular salaried jobs than 10 years
hiring women,             ago, and particularly so in urban areas. However, they felt that the appreciation of female
although certain          employees differs among industries and services and is high especially in the retail industry and
biases remain             in services like accounting, catering, beauty parlors – in sum, areas that require customer
                          interface.

                          This perception is confirmed by the World Bank enterprise survey undertaken in Madhya
                          Pradesh. The employers answering to the survey held positive and supportive attitudes to
                          women’s work. Around 85 percent of them agreed that women should work after marriage.
                          Furthermore, 90 percent of employers said that men and women deserve equal wages and
                          benefits for the same job. In general, there was little variation in these responses by firm sector
                          or size. It is possible though, that employers with such perceptions are more likely to respond
                          to the survey and some may have wanted to be seen as having adopted a “politically correct”
                          stand on these issues.

                          When asked whether men have a greater right to a job than women, especially if jobs are scarce,
                          employers were more divided: 53 percent agreed with the statement, while another 34 percent
                          refrained from offering an opinion. This result was similar to findings from the World Values
                          Survey, where 52 percent of all respondents and 43 percent of women respondents agreed men
                          had priority over jobs (Figure 118; for more details, see Kapoor-Mehta et al., forthcoming)35.

  In another survey, Pew Research found that 84 percent of Indians agree with the statement, “when jobs are scarce, men should
have more right to a job than women” (Pew Research Center , 2010).

                                 Similarly, when asked whether men made better employees than women, 42 percent of the
                                 employers interviewed responded in the affirmative, while 30 percent did not have a view (the
                                 rest disagreed). There was no significant variation on this subject by firm size, sector or city.

                                 A majority of the employers interviewed for the enterprise survey in Madhya Pradesh also
                                 considered men as better suited for jobs in most functional areas, except for customer services
                                 and care. In general, employers perceived men to be more suited for jobs in the
                                 production/technical/operational domain (82 percent said so); and slightly lesser so for jobs
                                 involving procurement/purchase (71 percent); business development, marketing, sales and HR
                                 (62 percent) and IT support (57 percent) (Figure 119). In contrast, they were indifferent about
                                 hiring men or women for finance and accounting jobs, and in fact preferred women for jobs
                                 involving customer service or customer care: 62 percent of employers interviewed found women
                                 to be better suited for such jobs.

                                 The attitudes and opinions that employers hold about women appear to influence women’s
                                 employment outcomes. Across all firms interviewed for the enterprise survey, women
                                 comprised a small proportion of total workers (under 16 percent) with service sector enterprises
                                 employing a slightly higher share of women than manufacturing (18 percent compared with 15
                                 percent). Interestingly, firms where employers are more open to hiring women in technical
                                 functional areas such as production and operations, also tend to hire more women. The average
                                 share of women in the workforce in firms where respondents opine that women are better suited
                                 to work in production/operations/technical areas is 28 percent compared to 12 percent when
                                 they think that men are better suited. Overall, larger shares of women are seen in industries that
                                 traditionally tend to employ female employees (e.g. manufacture of food products, apparel) or
                                 in services which involve a client interface (e.g. tuition centers, wholesale trade, health and social
                                 work, beauty parlors, tailoring units and photo studios).

Are there too few women entrepreneurs?
Female                           Firms in which the employer is a woman tend to hire more women. For example, in the
entrepreneurs tend               unorganized manufacturing sector, approximately 90 percent of employees in female-owned
to hire more women               businesses are female, while this share is 81 percent in the case of services (Ghani et al., 2016).
                                 Figure 120 shows the high correlation between the share of employees in a given service industry
                                 that are female, and the share of establishments in the industry that are female-owned. This is
                                 partly because most firms have a single owner-worker, which mainly reveals that there are

                               sized firms in the services sector owned by women also tend to hire more women compared to
                               firms of similar size owned by men.

few women become               employed but are more likely than women to have non-farm businesses. According to the
entrepreneurs                  economic census (MOSPI, 2014) only some 14 percent of all Indian establishments are owned
                               by women, over 80 percent of which are single-worker firms. The remaining firms provide
                               employment to over 13 million persons of which approximately 90 percent are employed in
                               establishments with less than 10 workers. Out of the establishments owned by women, about
                               35 percent are involved in agricultural activities with livestock dominating. Manufacturing and
                               retail trade account for 30 percent and 18 percent of the establishments respectively.

                               Less than 10 percent of the firms interviewed for the enterprise survey in Madhya Pradesh had
                               a woman working as an owner or a director.36 Those run by a woman, were mostly micro units
                               run as sole proprietorships, with a majority having only one to two employees. Most of these
                               enterprises offered services such as tailoring or were salons; the manufacturing firms operated
                               by women were engaged in dyeing of apparel, and some produced food and beverages.

                               The female employers interviewed held more positive attitudes about women’s work, and did
                               have a higher share of women in their workforce. More female employers agreed that women
                               should work after marriage compared to male respondents (96 percent compared to 84 percent).
                               Women’s positive opinions about hiring female workers reflected in their workforce
                               composition. Enterprises where the owner or Managing Director (MD) was a woman had a
                               significantly higher likelihood of hiring more women: of the 61 enterprises where a woman was
                               the owner/MD, in 49 the share of women in the workforce was more than half. However, such
                               enterprises also tended to hire more women given the nature of their production or service (e.g.
                               food production, beauty salons which tend to employ more women). In other words, female
                               headship of firms may not be the sole factor influencing female employment in formal jobs.



36In the remaining firms, only in 10 did women rise to the level of a manager. Thus, it was not very clear if any of the women in top
managerial positions were breaking the glass ceiling within organizations; the ones that were, were operating as owners of very small,
self-run enterprises.

                             within a district-industry predicts a greater share of subsequent entrepreneurs will be female.
                             Moreover, higher female ownership of local businesses in related industries (similar labor needs,
                             input-output markets) predicts greater relative female entry rates. Business networks are thus
                             important for women’s economic participation. Similarly, Fields et al. (2015) find in an
                             experimental setting that women who took a course on business skills with a friend were more
                             likely to take a loan, and to use the loan specifically for business purposes. However, there is
                             evidence that such networks are not strong in India. The Female Entrepreneurship Index (where
                             India ranks 70 out of 77 countries) suggests that networking is one of the weaknesses of the
                             Indian entrepreneurship ecosystem (Figure 122).

                             As of 2010, a survey by Banerji et al. (2010) suggests that out of a total of 1,112 directorships

                             on the BSE-100, only eight are held by women. As argued by Cuberes and Teignier (2016),
                             gender gaps in entrepreneurship and management positions negatively affect both income and
                             aggregate productivity, since they reduce the average talent of pools of managers and

v.         Policy considerations
A combination of             This chapter identified a scarcity of suitable jobs as a key explanation for the low and declining
gender-targeted              female LFP in India. First and foremost, remedy needs to come from creating new job
policies and formal          opportunities, including regular part time jobs, especially in newly-urbanizing areas. Three-
job creation is              quarters of women who were willing to accept work, if made available, favored such jobs
needed                       (Chatterjee et al., 2015). “Supply-side” interventions can also be helpful and the suitability of
                             existing employment opportunities for women needs to improve.

                             Ultimately, only a combination of gender-targeted policies that lower constraints on female labor
                             force participation and reforms that boost formal job creation are likely to improve gender

                                                                                     INDIA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE MAY 2017 » 72
                      equality in the labor market substantially and lead to considerable gains in GDP and employment
                      (Khera, 2016). While gender-targeted policies can boost female labor force participation to some
                      extent, due to the presence of labor market rigidities, these policies may not generate sufficient
                      job creation in the formal sector, so that many of the additional women in the labor force may
                      end up in low paying informal jobs or even remain unemployed.

                      Increasing formal labor market flexibility by simplifying and reducing regulation would allow
                      more women (and men) to be employed in the formal sector. A resulting decline in aggregate
                      informality and unemployment would boost GDP in the long run. However, with unchanged
                      constraints on female labor supply and demand, such policies would lead to a smaller increase
                      in female formality compared to male formality (Khera, 2016). Hence what is needed is a
                      combination of gender-targeted policies and formal job creation.

More jobs suitable    The sectors that draw in female workers the most have expanded the least in India, and related
for women need to     constraints need to be overcome. Employment opportunities in labor intensive manufacturing
be created and more   and white-collar services have not expanded sufficiently to absorb enough women (Klasen and
jobs need to become   Pieters, 2015). A different example is provided by Bangladesh, where a combination of higher
suitable              education of women and a rising garment sector provided many new job opportunities. As a
                      consequence of the high demand for women’s work, female LFP in Bangladesh is much higher
                      than in India, and driven almost entirely by the manufacturing sector (Figure 106 and World
                      Bank, 2012). A more female- and labor-intensive export-oriented growth strategy can contribute
                      to creating the missing employment opportunities (Klasen and Pieters, 2015).

                      In addition, firms can harness educated women to meet their skills needs by making existing
                      jobs more suitable for women. In particular, childcare facilities and maternity leave granted by
                      urban enterprises provide women with the flexibility they demand and thereby can increase the
                      share of women in formal employment. Similarly, improved safety for women – such as through
                      hiring more police-women – may be helpful. Infrastructure investment may not only be
                      fundamental to India’s growth agenda, but improved connectivity would also make more jobs
                      suitable for women. For example, women in India face barriers in using transport facilities often
                      related to safety that can be reduced by increasing lighting and establishing safe waiting areas.

                      Das and Zumbyte (2017) note that change in norms often follows strong policy interventions.
                      The government could signal a more enabling vision for women and mothers through public
                      information campaigns that value women as workers and project an image of child care as a
                      shared responsibility in the home. Such campaigns have been effectively used in India and
                      elsewhere to encourage literacy, or to achieve health outcomes such as immunization.

                      Finally, supporting female entrepreneurs can be an important way to create jobs for women and
                      to enlarge further the talent pool of India’s entrepreneurs. Women’s access to networks of
                      information and capital need to be strengthened, for example through stronger involvement of
                      industry bodies like CII or a propagation of new online information portals. Ghani et al. (2012)
                      argue that better local infrastructure is also linked to higher relative entry of female
                      entrepreneurs in both manufacturing and services.

                      The qualitative study described in this chapter revealed that the aspirations of younger women
                      are increasing. While one-third of the women between the age of 15 to 19 years engaged in
                      domestic work said they would like to work at their home, daughters of women who are
                      involved in home-based work no longer want to be employed in piece meal paying jobs. In fact,
                      older women engaged in home based work in many cases encourage their daughters to step out
                      and get formal jobs, provided they are close to their homes and have reasonable working hours.
                      “I do not want my daughter to do as much physical work as I have to do,” said one older woman
                      who rolled papads for a living in Indore. “I do not want her to do home based work. I want a
                      good and proper job for her”.

Women’s labor force participation differs significantly across states and districts in India. A handful of states – mountainous states
such as Himachal Pradesh (HP) and those in the North-East such as Sikkim (SK), Meghalaya (MG) and Mizoram (MZ), or states with
higher tribal populations such as Chhattisgarh (CG), have high participation rates (Figure 124). Women in HP, for example, are six
times as likely to be in the labor force as those in Bihar, which has the lowest female LFPR at 9 percent.

M. Das et al. (2015) identify a combination of factors that appears to drive high female LFP in HP. First, HP has had the tradition of
a large public sector which gave jobs to citizens as part of an implicit social contract after the state was carved out from Punjab.
Almost half of urban men and 20 percent of urban women in HP had regular salaried jobs in 2011 (which is above average for India),
with one in three jobs being in the public sector, which would be generally regarded as suitable jobs. Second, women in rural areas in
HP were more than twice as likely as their male counterparts to report themselves as being self-employed in agriculture, which remains
the mainstay of HP’s largely rural economy. Predominantly agricultural economies tend to have higher female LFPRs. HP is a state
that has invested considerably in agricultural processing industries and in expanding cultivation of crops that are locally grown (e.g.
apples, mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers, ginger etc.). Besides being involved in their cultivation, women play an active role in
agribusiness, floriculture and dairy farming (M. Das et al., 2015). Finally, HP has some of the best gender indicators in India, suggesting
an elevated level of women’s empowerment in the state. For example, it is the only state in northern India with a chil d sex ratio (in
age group 0-6) above 900 (as of the 2011 census), and the Breakthrough Index of Women’s Empowerment (Rossow and Watson,
2016) ranks Himachal Pradesh 5th among states.

  rates that are six times the participation rates in districts in the bottom quintile of the distribution, although with a larger variance
  (Figure 125). For men, on the other hand, the difference is minor (Figure 126).

  Broadly, at both the state and district-level, a few features tend to be clearly associated with higher female LFPR. Places with a larger
  share of scheduled tribes and where agriculture is the mainstay of the economy stand out as areas where women are more likely to
  work (Figure 127and Figure 128). Patterns are less clear-cut when it comes to infrastructure (Figure 129 and Figure 130).

Technical Appendix: Definitions of Labor Force Participation
The persons surveyed by the NSS are classified into various activity categories on the basis of the activities pursued by
them during three reference periods namely, (i) one year, (ii) one week, and (iii) each day of the reference week. Based on
these three periods, three different measures of activity status were arrived at, which are termed as “usual status” (principal
and subsidiary), “current weekly status” and “current daily status” respectively.
Usual Principal Status: The activity status on which a person spent relatively long time (i.e. major time criterion) during the
365 days preceding the date of survey was considered as the usual principal activity status of the person. To decide the
usual principal activity of a person a two stage dichotomous classification was followed. At the first stage, persons were
first categorized as those in the labor force and those out of the labor force depending on the major time spent during
the 365 days preceding the date of survey. At the second stage, for persons belonging to the labor force, the broad activity
status of either “working” (employed) or “not working but seeking and/or available for work” (unemployed) was
ascertained based on once again the time criterion.
Usual Subsidiary Status: A person whose principal usual status is determined on the basis of the major time criterion could
pursue some economic activity for a relatively shorter time during the reference period of 365 days preceding the date of
survey or for a minor period, which is less than 30 days (not necessarily for a continuous period) during the reference
year. The status, in which such economic activity is pursued, is the subsidiary economic activity status of that person.
Usual Status: The usual status, determined on the basis of the usual principal activity and the usual subsidiary activity of a
person taken together, is considered as the usual activity status (principal + subsidiary status) of the person. According to
the usual status, workers are those who perform some work activity either in the principal status or in the subsidiary status.
Thus, a person who is not a worker in the usual principal status is considered as worker according to the usual status, if
the person pursues some subsidiary economic activity for 30 days or more during 365 days preceding the date of survey.
Current Weekly Status: The broad current weekly activity status of a person is decided on the basis of a certain priority cum
major time criterion. A person was considered working (or employed) if, while pursuing any economic activity, had worked
for at least one hour on at least one day during the seven days preceding the date of survey. A person was considered
“seeking or available for work (or unemployed)” if, during the reference week, no economic activity was pursued but
he/she made efforts to get work or had been available for work any time. A person who had neither worked nor was
available for work any time during the reference week was considered as out of the labor force. After the broad current
weekly status of a person was determined using priority criterion, the detailed current weekly status was derived from the
intensities37 (time disposition during the week) assigned for the daily activities performed by a person during the seven
days of the reference week.
Current Daily Status: The current daily activity status for a person was determined on the basis of his/her activity status on
each day of the reference week using a priority-cum-major time criterion. A person is considered “working full day” if
he/she had worked for four hours or more during the day, considered as “working half day” if he/she had worked for
one to four hours in a day and “unemployed or not in the labor force “for the other half of the day. If a person had not
worked for even one hour in a day but was seeking/available for work for four hours or more, he/she would be considered
“unemployed” for full day and if he was seeking/available for work for less than 4 hours, he would be considered
“unemployed” for half day and “out of labor force”.




37   Intensity is calculated for up to a maximum of two economic activities per day. Thus, on a day, a person may either have only
     one activity with 'full' intensity or two activities with 'half' intensity for each. If the activity is pursued with intensity 'half' on a
     particular day, the entry will be 0.5 against that activity and if that is pursued with intensity more than half, 1.0 will be recorded
     against that activity. Generally, an activity, which is pursued for more than 1 hour but less than 4 hours is considered to have
     been pursued with ‘half’ intensity. If it is pursued for 4 hours or more, the activity is considered to have been pursued with ‘full’
     intensity.
                                                                                           INDIA DEVELOPMENT UPDATE MAY 2017 » 76
