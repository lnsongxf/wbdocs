I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Myanmar perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Myanmar
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Myanmar
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From February to April 2017, 300 stakeholders of the WBG in Myanmar were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 117 stakeholders participated in
the survey (39% response rate).
Respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier. Respondents were asked
about: general issues facing Myanmar; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Myanmar; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’14 (response rate was 26%, N=173). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’14 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 93).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
        For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
         combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from PMUs were
         combined with consultants working on WBG projects and employees of ministries,
         respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from
         private sector organizations; NGOs/community based organizations were renamed as in
         the “CSO” category; and the small number of respondents from local governments,
         bilateral/multilateral agencies, and other organizations were included in the “Other”
         category. There were no respondents from private foundations, independent government
         institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups or the judiciary branch.

        significantly correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Myanmar, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2017 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2014
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2014 COS report.

FY 2014 Number of comparable respondents = 145  FY 2017 Number of comparable respondents = 105

By weighting, the FY 2014 and FY 2017 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the following
 TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Myanmar? (Choose no more than TWO)
  1    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  2    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., start small and medium sized businesses)
       Better business environment (i.e., government creating equal business environment by reducing barriers and
  3
       supporting SME)
  4    A growing middle class
  5    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  6    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
  7    Consistent economic growth
