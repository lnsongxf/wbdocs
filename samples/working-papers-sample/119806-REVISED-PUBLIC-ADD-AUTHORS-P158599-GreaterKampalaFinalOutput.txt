                                           Executive Summary
Uganda’s Vision 2040 aims to transform the economy through industrialization. The
Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA) is well positioned to be the engine to drive
this positive structural transformation. The capital city region is the main urban area in
Uganda capable of delivering scale economies in terms of concentrated demand, specialization,
diversity and depth of skills and innovation. Greater Kampala is currently following a broad
economic development strategy set out in both the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA)
strategy and the GKMA Development Framework. Under the economic growth theme, KCCA is
seeking to develop a more specific city economic development strategy that will provide a
framework for sustained economic growth driven by an efficient infrastructure network2. Also,
the Government of Uganda (GoU), recognizing the need for a coordinated effort toward economic
growth in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA), has tasked the Ministry of Lands,
Housing and Urban Development, Office of the Prime Minister, KCCA and relevant Local
Governments to develop an integrated framework for the development of GKMA3.

To assist KCCA’s and other GKMA stakeholder’s efforts, this report aims to do three things.
Firstly, it seeks to profile Greater Kampala’s economy, emphasizing its importance to Uganda’s
development and goals outlined in Vision 2040 4 . Secondly, the report identifies the key
constraints and opportunities to growth and competitiveness for Kampala’s firms. Finally, the
report provides policy makers with practical actions to unlock the city’s economic potential.
These recommendations focus specifically on what local governments can do but also addresses
complementary national-level actions5.

     1. Greater Kampala’s economic role, challenges and potential


The GKMA is the main centre of economic activity within Uganda. The city represents 10%
of the country’s population6, a third of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and hosts 46% of all
formal employment in the country7. Moreover, Kampala is the heart of Ugandan industry. 70% of
the country’s manufacturing plants are clustered in the city and subsequently produces a third of
Uganda’s manufacturing GDP8.

Kampala’s economy has been performing well, but underemployment and informality are
major issues, as formal job creation is not keeping pace with population increases. While
Kampala’s overall GDP growth rate (6.7%) is modest compared to other similar cities9, it’s per
capita GDP growth is on par and better than other cities with similar per capita income. However,
the city’s formal employment creation is not keeping up with its accelerating population. While
Kampala’s outright unemployment, currently at 10%10, although concerning, is not considered
high relative to comparator cities in East Africa, underemployment and informality are the

primary concern. Underemployment is currently estimated at 23% and informal firms account
for 57% of the city’s employment11.

Understanding Kampala’s informal sector12

The evidence in this report counters three common notions prevalent in the usual discourse
around the informal sector in Uganda: i) that the majority of informal firms are evading taxation
and therefore depriving formal firms of their hard-earned profits, ii) that the informal sector
could be an untapped reservoir of entrepreneurial energy13, and that iii) informal enterprises
should locate themselves outside the city to reduce congestion.

Firstly, the majority of people working in the informal sector are poor, rather than evading
taxation. Nearly all (97%) of the firms in the informal sector employ 5 or less people and 59%
are self-employed. Our analysis estimates that 93% of microenterprise owners would be beneath
the World Bank’s poverty line of $1.90/day, in purchasing power parity, if the business were their
only source of income. This is consistent with the informal sector being primarily a source of
livelihood for the urban poor, rather than a substantial generator of value added. Indeed, when
asked why owners had chosen to start their businesses, 24% of owners responded it was because
they lacked alternative opportunities to generate income. Importantly, 69% of firms generate
UGX10 million or less in annual turnover and are below the minimum tax threshold for small
business income tax14. This suggests that efforts to formalize informal firms are unlikely to lead
to substantial tax revenue gains.

Secondly, it is unlikely that the majority of informal firms will be able to grow and generate
jobs for others. Policy makers are often interested in the question of how to support the informal
sector to grow and become more productive. However, using a range of indicators, our analysis
indicated that only 18% of firms have potential to grow and expand. Moreover, international
experience suggests that it is difficult to identify these firms ex-ante. The analysis also suggests
that informal firms are facing increasing competition due to the lack of viable markets and
competitive business models. When asked about the biggest constraints to expanding their
business, 45% of respondents reported that it was a lack of customers, competition or the
profitability of their business model. If formal employment is not generated to keep pace with
population growth, this competition is likely to intensify as those without other opportunities
increasingly join the informal sector.

Thirdly, location and access to customers is important for informal businesses. Kampala’s
informal sector clusters in three locations in close proximity to the central business district,
indicating that location and access to customers is critical for informal firms. Furthermore, 97%
of informal businesses were found to sell to other households or individual customers (as
opposed to other businesses). 84% of businesses sell to customers within a 30-minute walk. As
such, close proximity to population densities is essential for the livelihoods of those operating in
the informal sector – this is particular true for those firms working in street trading and retail.
Consequently, polices aimed at re-locating informal firms away from population densities,
without communicating with them to find alternative marketing locations, may negatively affect
people’s livelihoods.

   Given the paucity of data on the informal sector, the team commissioned the 2017 Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) informal sector
survey to provide relevant statistics for analysis and decision making. Unless otherwise indicated, this is the data source for the remainder
of this section.

Generating higher productivity jobs

To keep pace with its population growth and satisfy the expectations of its population for
better quality jobs, Kampala must create jobs in sectors which will encourage
industrialization and economies of scale. To reach its potential, Greater Kampala needs to
generate more jobs but also the right kind of jobs. To ensure growth is sustainable, employment
in sectors which produce goods and services tradable outside the local market (such as
manufacturing) will accelerate the city’s transition from a market town to a production centre.

Investment in manufacturing and tradable service sub-sectors can increase productivity
and stimulate structural transformation. Our analysis, using an econometric model of the
Kampala economy, show that while investments in manufacturing and tradable service sub-
sectors create fewer jobs than local service sub-sectors in the short term, they lead to larger
increases in economy-wide labor productivity. Such a shift from lower to higher productivity
activities in East Asian countries, for example, led to higher levels of growth (and higher earnings
at the individual level), which in the long term compensated for lower labor intensity. So, despite
creating fewer jobs in the short term, manufacturing and tradable service sub-sectors are likely
to stimulate job generating growth in the longer term. The analysis also revealed several win-win
subsectors which generate above-average job creation as well as labour productivity gains. Grain
milling, chemical manufacturing, other food manufacturing, and financial services all have both
above average returns to job creation and productivity15.

Greater Kampala is more specialized than the national economy in a number of tradable
sub-sectors, yet the share of labour employed in these activities remains negligible and
some sub-sectors are declining. Of the sub-sectors in which Greater Kampala is highly
specialized, nearly half are in manufacturing 16 . However, not all sub-sectors that the city is
specialized in have been growing. Most concerning are those large sub-sectors including
manufacturing in structural and fabricated metal products, manufacturing in basic iron and steel,
and manufacturing in plastics, where employment has been declining 17 . Additionally,
employment growth in large and medium firms has been reducing. In particular, large firms in
the tradable sector have lost five thousand jobs during 2001-2011 in Greater Kampala (four times
more than that in the non-tradable sector)18. This is a cause for concern given that medium and
large firms are not fulfilling their potential for creating higher value added jobs and the majority
of people seem to be forced to engage in survival activities, whether or not there is a market for
them. The city’s ability to gradually develop alternative subsectors of specialization will be
important to avoid a worsening in unemployment and informality levels.

     2. Binding constraints to firm growth and job creation and recommendations
        for action by subnational governments

For Greater Kampala to accelerate its transition to a production centre and lead Uganda’s
structural transformation, its local governments will need to better understand the
constraints to firm growth and job creation. The research undertaken identified three major
areas of constraints: i) the built environment is disconnected and costly for business, ii)
enterprises face a myriad of constraints, internal and external to their business, and iii) there is
no institutional and financing mechanism for coordinated investment across Greater Kampala.

This calls for a deliberate policy transition of the role of subnational government, from
merely being a regulator of businesses to a facilitator of private sector growth and job

creation. Currently, subnational governments main relationship with the private sector is one of
taxation and regulation. And yet, the private sector faces major constraints in their ability to grow
and create jobs, many of which could be alleviated by subnational and national government. The
report therefore makes three main recommendations to the subnational governments of Greater
Kampala, to play a greater role as a facilitator of private sector success in the city: a) Invest in
coordinated transport and economic infrastructure together with land use management, b)
Empower domestic firms to improve productivity and c) Capacitate institutions & coordination
structures.

a) INVEST in coordinated transport and economic infrastructure together with land use
management,

Greater Kampala’s built environment is disconnected and costly for business. Kampala’s
urban form does not encourage economic density and poor infrastructure makes production
activities expensive. As the city has expanded, firms and employment have dispersed further from
the urban core in a non-uniform fashion reducing economic density and creating a more
fragmented city. In general, firm concentration in Kampala’s Central Business District (CBD) has
declined from 65% of firms in 2002 to 55% in 201119. Beyond this, leapfrog development20 has
more than doubled from the 1990s to 2000s, leaving patches of land within the city
underdeveloped21. Such development inhibits density and disconnects people living in Kampala
from opportunities. Moreover, while clustering of firms within similar industries is a factor
proven to be important to their productivity, there are low levels of firm clustering in Kampala22.

Transport: improve mobility within the city to encourage increased economic densities
and agglomeration effects. Investment in transport infrastructure has been shown to decrease
the cost of motorized transport in Kampala, which would reduce costs for business. A primary
issue for transportation in Kampala is road congestion, with the number of vehicles on the roads
in Greater Kampala increasing faster than infrastructure investment can keep up. Kampala’s lack
of systematic and reliable public transport is a key and underlining reason for the level of road
congestion. The only affordable transport is offered by the ‘matatus’ or local taxis. However, the
lack of coordination of their routes and stops—as well as their small capacity—means that the
number of times a taxi has to stop in order to collect or drop-off passengers is high23. This slows
down the speed of the service and has knock-on effects on other forms of motorized transport.

One quick win is to strengthen the regulation of the current minibus taxi system - Before
Kampala is ready to make new public transport investments, such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) or
rapid rail systems, the current transport system and regulatory environment needs to be further
strengthened. A complete and sudden phasing out of taxis will not be feasible in the short run. As
KCCA has taken over more control of the taxi industry’s regulation since 2015, this provides an
opportunity to better regulate and coordinating taxi routes and stops, hopefully leading to less
congestion and better traffic management.

Strategic roads and public transport investment to better connect people with jobs - Road
investment is strongly associated with density increases and economic activity. KCCA and Local
Governments have made significant progress in increasing paved roads in the city but further
investments are needed, particularly those of a cross GKMA nature, which would have a bigger
impact on better connecting where people live with where they work. Research suggests that
road improvements of the northern bypass around the city would enhance the connectivity of
east and west parts of the city and improve city mobility. The feasibility of Bus Rapid Transit

(BRT) and light rail investments are also being considered. To support access to markets for
informal enterprises, taxi stops could also be coordinated with investments in markets and
premises for them24. Finally, providing a conducive environment for non-motorized modes of
transport (such as cycling and walking) will also be important.

Land: facilitate better access to land for investment. Two main constraints in relation to land
were highlighted by firms in Kampala; the price of land (which is a particular constraint for small
and medium firms) and the complex land tenure regime. Uganda’s land price index has more than
tripled in the past decade25 and firms explained that the high cost of procuring land constrains
their capital supply and reduces their ability to invest in machinery or raw materials, etc. In
addition, the majority of the land in Kampala operates under a complex land tenure regime —
giving rise to legal disputes and blocking investment. Subnational governments do not, however,
have control over land management in the city and must therefore coordinate with the other land
management institutions to facilitate better access to land for investment.

Piloting affordable housing schemes that also release land for mixed use development in
the city’s core - KCCA should re-attempt to pilot a high density affordable housing scheme in one
slum area, that also frees up land for economically productive investments26. The idea would be
to work in collaboration with landowning institutions such as the Church or the Buganda
Kingdom as well as an affordable housing mortgage finance provider which would finance the
upfront cost of housing construction and mortgage provision to dwellers. KCCA would provide
supporting infrastructure and facilitate the partnership between stakeholders.

Land use zoning and land purchasing. Land zoning and city planning is crucial to encourage
the efficient use of space in the city. KCCA and local governments are unable to effectively zone
and plan given the lack of land which local governments control and the multitude of large land
owners that city that local governments need to work with to secure land. As an initial step, vacant
and underdeveloped land should be first identified through GIS mapping. KCCA and local
governments will also need to work closely with current major landowning institutions (such as
the Church and the Buganda Land Board) to jointly collaborate on land zoning. Furthermore, the
potential for land swaps can be further explored with landowning institutions in order to
facilitate land development of essential city locations. In order to finance land purchasing it is
recommended that KCCA and local governments begin to coordinate purchasing vacant and
underdeveloped land through a land banking mechanism, using financing from the GoU’s existing
Land Fund.

b) EMPOWER domestic firms to improve productivity

Enterprises in Kampala face many constraints – internal and external to their business.
Cities are not limited to their built environment. The role of a city authority and local government
lies in creating a conducive environment to support enterprise growth, through understanding
the constraints they face and acting to alleviate them. Firms in Greater Kampala (formal and
informal) face a number of constraints including access to finance, labour skills, business skills
and tax administration. In terms of skills, skilled labor appeared to only be a constraint for
medium and large sized firms, some of which mentioned difficulties in finding and recruiting
technically skilled employees. Whilst for small and micro or informal enterprises, the evidence
indicates that behaviours focused on external factors such as market research, experimentation
of new approaches, and researching competition were strongly correlated with performance
indicators. Underlying these issues were firms’ mistrust of the Kampala Capital City Authority
(KCCA) and local governments, which makes public private cooperation difficult. Local tax

26 This was attempted before with Development Partner support but was not able to get off the ground as the negotiations with the

landowners (in this case, the Church), were not concluded within the timeframe that the donor funding was available.

                                                               8
collection by KCCA and local governments was considered more aggressive and heavy handed
than income tax and VAT collection by the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA). Practices such as
locking-up businesses’ machinery or premises due to payment delays were perceived as
draconian and unnecessarily leading to loss of livelihoods27. The fact that the assessment of local
tax payment level and band relies on observation of the business by a tax collector (compared to
self-assessment for national taxes with URA), was felt to be introducing major avenues for
corruption.

Business services: Establish business engagement and support centres at a subnational
level. Providing improved support and business engagement is both within local government’s
remit and strategic plans, however currently very limited enterprise support services are being
provided (some micro-enterprise development programs and business licensing centres) due to
limited funding and capacity. KCCA and Local Governments have an opportunity to develop
business engagement centres within their administrations which could engage in a range of
activities:
    • Tax education - work with URA in producing tax advice print and radio communication
         materials as a way of further disseminating key taxation information. If demand for tax
         advice is large enough, a taxation helpline could also be trialed for firms in Kampala.
    • Assisting firms to developing bankable business plans – provide firms with business
         plan development advice to increase their chances of accessing finance.
    • Providing information on skill gaps – improve public dissemination of information
         regarding skill gaps in the Greater Kampala economy to encourage a better matching of
         skills to local business needs.
    • Trial mentorship programs focused on increasing firms’ understanding of their
         markets and customers. The evidence shows that the effectiveness of mentorship
         programs in Uganda could be enhanced if programs focused on helping business owners
         focus not only on their internal business management (record keeping etc), but also on
         their external environment: customers, competitors and suppliers. This is particularly
         relevant for informal sector enterprises to help them better develop products that have
         market potential.
    • Improve public private dialogue - hold town hall meetings to disseminate the kinds of
         business services which KCCA and local governments can provide and are looking to
         provide in the future and listen to the issues and constraints facing the private sector. This
         could help decrease the distrust between local government and the business community.
    • Investment promotion. The business centre could play a leading role by promoting
         Kampala as an attractive investment location. Additionally, the centre could identify
         potential areas for public private partnerships (PPPs).

Partner with business associations to provide engagement centre services – in order to
provide the above mentioned services, KCCA and local governments can partner with business
associations like the Uganda Manufacturers Association (UMA), The Uganda Small Scale
Industries Association (USSIA), and the Private sector foundation (PSFU), among others, which
enjoy strong engagement with firms and are key stakeholders in the provision of business
training.

Cascading e-governance tax administration systems to all local governments of KGMA is an
important quick win. Given the above findings regarding the current tax administration opening
avenues for corruption, there is a need to further reduce the human element in the process and
provide the services online. KCCA has already introduced e-governance for a significant
proportion of the process and this successful experience can be further cascaded to the other local
governments.

Protect the livelihoods of informal enterprises. As our analysis on the informal sector showed,
this sector mainly provides a livelihood for the city’s poorest and most disadvantaged people who
work in it out of necessity. But given the small percentage of firms that have a potential to grow
and the difficulty in identifying them, the most impactful policies are likely to be those aiming at
encouraging investment and job creation in the formal sector and worker mobility to these new
opportunities. At the same time, to protect the livelihoods of informal sector workers and help
increase their incomes, subnational governments should work with representatives of the
informal sector to identify viable locations for their markets and access points to consumers. Any
re-location of informal sector vendors and enterprises should be done in consultation with them,
while giving them viable alternative locations that take population densities and access to
transport into account.

Provide infrastructure that increases access to markets and suitable working premises for
informal enterprises. Research shows that firms with permanent establishments are more
likely to see increased performance and to formalize. KCCA and local governments could
therefore increase access to serviced premises and market infrastructure for micro-enterprises
throughout the city.

c) CAPACITATE institutions & coordination structures.

Currently KCCA and Greater Kampala’s other local governments lack crucial institutional
mechanisms to coordinate investments across the metropolitan area, for more impact. The
multiplicity of agencies and lack of coordinated framework for development within the GKMA,
compounded by weak coordination between these agencies have resulted in confusion and lack
of clear cut leadership for the development of the GKMA. It will be imperative for these
institutions to work collaboratively in order to manage the future growth of the city.

A quick win would be to put in place the Greater Kampala Working Group as provided for
in the NDPII. This would bring the various agencies together on a voluntary basis to coordinate
urban and economic development plans as well as marshal political support and traction for the
continual urban development of Greater Kampala. The experience of the Greater Manchester
Combined Authority is a relevant example for the GKMA to learn from.

Put in place common financing mechanisms for pooled funding on metropolitan wide
projects. The Ministry of Kampala and Metropolitan Affairs (MoK), The Ministry of Lands
Housing and Urban Development and the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) could also design
a common financing mechanism that both KCCA as well as surrounding local governments can
jointly draw from in order to finance common infrastructure projects across Greater Kampala.
This mechanism would provide a key incentive for increased coordination. It is also
recommended that the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development fast tracks the
ratification of an Urban Development policy that clearly provides for the GKMA. Given the special
provisions for the GKMA in the Vision 2040 and its declaration as a special planning area,
Government needs to streamline the operations and build the capacity of the Ministry of Kampala
Capital City and Metropolitan Affairs to be able to coordinate and enhance economic development
in the GKMA.

   3. National policy levers and the role of the private sector


Some significant business constraints are outside the remit of local government and require
policy leadership from the central government. Chief among these constraints are Uganda’s
complex land tenure system, the high cost of finance and the reliability and cost of electricity.



                                                10
Addressing Uganda’s complex land tenure system – One of the most crippling constraints
facing capital expenditure and firms in Greater Kampala is Uganda’s complex land tenure system.
In the longer term, the central government needs to prioritize significant land policy reforms that
improve access to land and reduce tenure disputes. In the meantime, further collaboration
between local governments and the various official and customary land management institutions
will be required so that Greater Kampala’s urban development is managed in the most efficient
form possible. Central to this will be the effective implementation of a transparent land
information system. Evidence suggests that increased transparency will also foster competition
in the land market and drive down prices.

Lowering the cost of finance – The high cost of finance is a concern for businesses across
Uganda, but is felt severely in Kampala given the higher concentration of industrial firms, with
higher financing needs. For large and medium size businesses, high interest rates have curtailed
their ability to make long term investments and to compete regionally. For small businesses, high
interest rates directly affected their ability to not only expand but to run their daily operations.
For informal firms, access to finance was linked to increased likelihood of formalisation and
increased profitability. However, lowering the cost of finance is clearly outside the remit of local
government and demands central government leadership to address. As briefly mentioned in this
report and more compressively in World Bank Ugandan financial sector reviews, there are a
number of causes for high lending rates outside of macroeconomic pressure. These additional
causes include, the high cost of due diligence, the banks’ lack of capital reserves to lend to
domestic clients, and the level of Government borrowing. These issues will require serious work
from the Bank of Uganda together with private sector associations particularly the Uganda
Bankers Association.

Reducing the cost and reliability of electricity - Greater Kampala’s industry suffers from high
input costs. Central to these costs is the reliability and price of electricity. Due to the frequency of
power outages and surges, a number of the firms interviewed had resorted to running their
machines on generators to avoid damaging machinery, making their production costs more
expensive and thus less competitive in the region. Despite continued difficulties, the electrical
network in Uganda and Kampala has improved greatly over the past decade. This challenge is a
responsibility for central government and has been publicly acknowledged by President
Museveni28. The central government is already making large investments in new hydroelectric
facilities (Karuma and Isimba Falls projects) which are hoped to reduce the cost of electricity.

The private sector is an essential stakeholder in the future development of Greater
Kampala. In the above recommendations, involving the private sector will be an important step
for KCCA and Local Governments. The potential for PPPs should be further explored for all
infrastructure options. This may require further institutional development for KCCA and Local
Governments to develop the required expertise. It will also be important for the private sector to
be consulted in regards to identifying labor skill shortages and designing training programs to
meet skills gaps. Finally, KCCA and local governments future physical and integrated plans should
consult heavily with private sector associations to ensure that public plans align with private
development. A crucial link with the private sector for KCCA and local governments will be the
various business associations which represent the private sector in Uganda. Further
strengthening the relationship between local governments and associations will be a crucial first
step in further involving the private sector.

     1. Background and Subnational Government Scope
        and Capacity within Greater Kampala
The purpose of this report29 is to provide Ugandan policymakers with economic analyses
on the role of Greater Kampala in achieving Uganda’s economic goals outlined in Vision
2040 and the actions needed to unlock the city’s economic potential. The report is part of
the World Bank’s Technical Assistance project on Enhancing Economic Performance of African
Cities. The project aims to apply the learning from the World Bank’s global report on Competitive
Cities30 to support policy makers in selected African cities, including Kampala, to plan reforms
and investments that would alleviate constraints to the city’s productivity and employment
creation performance. The project was launched in February 2016 and has, so far, provided
support to the city governments of Kampala and Addis Ababa in the two areas of (i) economic
analyses that fill knowledge gaps that policy makers face, and (ii) institutional support and
capacity development to strengthen their ability to plan and implement relevant reforms31.

Uganda is urbanizing rapidly. If not proactively managed, Uganda will miss a major
opportunity for structural transformation. The latest World Bank Uganda Economic Update,
“The Growth Challenge: Can Ugandan Cities get to Work?” shows that between 2002 and 2010,
Uganda’s urban population grew by 5.6%, almost twice as fast as the rural population. As is the
case in many other developing countries, the prospects of good jobs, higher incomes and better
living conditions in the cities continue to attract Ugandans from rural areas. With 70 percent of
Uganda’s nonagricultural GDP being generated in these urban areas, the prospect of higher
productivity jobs is considerably better than in the countryside. Going by global experience,
urbanization is likely to accelerate with economic development. As a result, Kampala is projected
to become a mega-city of more than 10 million by 2040, and other Ugandan cities will also see a
demographic explosion. Currently, the opportunity presents itself for Uganda to leverage
urbanization to benefit a large proportion of the population. However, the achievement of these
goals will require a comprehensive set of actions that will establish the necessary business and
regulatory environment. Appropriate investments in the development of the country’s cities are
therefore vital if Uganda is to prevent urbanization from resulting in dysfunctionality and
diseconomies of scale.

Cities are drivers of economic development and structural transformation. 80% of global
economic activity is generated in cities32 and cities generated 58% of all new private sector jobs,
despite being collectively home to only a quarter of total private sector employment 33 .
International evidence has shown how agglomeration in cities improves economic productivity34.
As economic activity agglomerates, firms are able to; mix and match their requirements for
inputs; access a wider range of shared services and infrastructure; and spark innovation by the
sharing and receiving of ideas. Growing agglomeration in cities leads to economies of scale,

raising productivity in non-agricultural sectors and contributing to economic growth. Hence, all
industrialized countries have gone through a process or urbanization35.

The link between urbanization and economic development and structural transformation
in Africa has been less direct. The population in African cities is expanding on average by 3.5%
per year and some cities will double their population in the next 15 years36. By 2040 Africa will
on average have more than 50% of its population living in cities37. However, this high rate of
urbanization has not been matched with the anticipated economic development as seen in other
urbanizing regions in the world including East Asia and Latin America. Africa’s manufacturing
and service sectors have remained small and unproductive38. The only structural change has been
a reduction in agriculture's share of output and a commensurate rise in services 39 . This is
resulting in African countries becoming (low value added) service economies, even before they
have industrialized, or in other words, experiencing premature deindustrialization 40 . Cities in
Africa are not delivering agglomeration economies or reaping the expected urban productivity
benefits.

The World Bank’s recent research on the spatial development of African Cities shows that
African cities’ development is constrained because they are more crowded, disconnected
and costly41. The study finds that African cities are not economically dense and that investments
in infrastructure, industrial and commercial structures have not kept pace with the concentration
of people. Cities have developed as collections of small and fragmented neighborhoods limiting
workers’ job opportunities and preventing firms from reaping scale and agglomeration benefits.
And that African cities are expensive - 55% of African households face higher costs relative to
other countries with comparable per capita GDP. This high cost of living raises nominal wages
and transaction costs, making African industries less competitive both regionally and
internationally. In order for African cities to grow economically as they have grown in size, they
must create productive environments to attract investment, increase economic efficiency and
create livable environments that prevent urban costs from rising with increased population
densification. For African cities to take advantage of agglomeration forces, policy makers will
need to resolve central structural problems and improve conditions for both people and
businesses.

Learning from competitive cities worldwide, their improved economic performance has
not been by accident. It typically involves a strategic vision and critical action from both
national as well as local Governments. The World Bank’s global research on competitive
cities 42 shows that job creation and economic growth in cities are clearly linked to the cities’
success in facilitating all three sources of private sector growth, (i) expansion of existing firms,
(ii) creation of new firms, and (iii) attraction of investors. The review of successful cities
worldwide identified four drivers of competitiveness, that cities need to invest in improving: (1)
institutions and regulations, (2) infrastructure and land, (3) skills and innovation, and (4)
enterprise support and finance (see figure 1). Successful cities were also found to have strong
political leadership that spearheads a collective effort towards economic development, in
partnership with the private sector, and sets a clear vision for the success of prominent economic
subsectors43.

1.1      Greater Kampala’s scope and capacity
City governments around the world have taken on increasing responsibilities to deliver
service and facilitate economic growth through various program and policy interventions.
Several factors have contributed to this, including the decentralization of administrative, political
and fiscal powers to local governments, providing cities with an increasingly expanding ‘wedge’.
The City Wedge framework outlines how policy reforms and interventions at the city level are
channelled through a city government’s operational scope and capacity – that is, the powers at
the government’s disposal and the ability to effectively and efficiently carry out those powers.
The framework includes city scope components of institutional and economic development
context, functional assignments, budget and staffing discretion and expenditures, revenue
discretion and political system. A city’s capacity is further disaggregated in terms of human
resource management; public financial management; controlling corruption; and building
“growth coalitions” (See Figure 2 below). Importantly, aspects of both scope and capacity need to
be aligned to the city’s overall vision for development.

Greater Kampala is currently following a broad economic development strategy set out in
both the KCCA strategy and the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA) Development
Framework. One of the four themes of KCCA’s strategy is economic growth. Under this theme,
KCCA is seeking to develop a more specific city economic development strategy that will provide
a framework for sustained economic growth driven by an efficient infrastructure network44. The
Government of Uganda (GoU), recognizing the need for a coordinated effort toward economic
growth in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA), has tasked the Ministry of Lands,
Housing and Urban Development, Office of the Prime Minister, KCCA and relevant Local
Governments to develop an integrated framework for the development of GKMA 45 . To assist
KCCA’s and other GKMA stakeholder’s efforts, this report seeks to provide detailed
recommendations on policies and investments which would help stimulate structural
transformation, job creation and economic growth in Greater Kampala.

Greater Kampala contains a variety of local governments with varying jurisdictions and
accountabilities. GKMA includes Kampala city which is governed by KCCA as well as portions of
Mukono, Entebbe, Wakiso and Mpigi, all of which are governed by their respective local
governments46. Uganda has a high level of administrative decentralization. Local governments
have executive and legislative powers and are responsible for key service delivery and
implementing local development plans. Local governments are overseen by the Ministry of Local
Government 47 . Kampala city on the other hand is administered by KCCA which in 2010 was
elevated to legal authority under the central government and reports to its own MoK 48 . The
Authority consists of both democratically appointed members49 as well as members appointed to
represent professional bodies 50 . KCCA reports directly to the cabinet Minister for Greater
Kampala. KCCA’s administration is headed by the Executive Director who manages ten
directorates. For an organizational chart explaining KCCA’s reporting structure, see figure 3. This
current institutional framework means that no one single government entity has planning
authority or service delivery responsibilities over Greater Kampala. For these reasons, this
report’s audience encompasses the range of stakeholders (KCCA, central government and
relevant local governments) in Greater Kampala. A breakdown of roles and responsibilities
between local and central government in Uganda is outlined in Table 1

       Five years since its inception, KCCA has made significant progress in generating increased
       revenues and moving closer toward financial independence. Since 2011 to the 2015/16
       financial year KCCA has been able to increase its internal revenue collection by 250% (table 2). A
       great deal of this growth has been through reforms in the efficiency of taxation collection. The
       primary growth in revenue has come from property rates, licenses and parking fees. KCCA has
       also managed costs well, leading to large surpluses in the 2015 and 2016 financial years. Prudent
       financial management has also encouraged confidence from the central government with
       transfers increasing by 20% in 2015 54 . KCCA’s performance has also engendered external
       confidence, as grants from international agencies doubled from 2014 and 2015. Additionally, in
       2014, Global Credit Ratings (GCR), a South African credit analysis agency, gave Kampala an “A”
       rating, a rating which has since been maintained55. KCCA is currently limited from borrowing by
       national legislation however there is growing interest in lifting this constraint to allow the city

       obliged to pay an NSSF contribution of 10% to their employees.

government to access commercial debt for further financial flexibility56. While starting form a
modest base, KCCA in a short period has been able to improve its governmental efficiencies and
drive growth in its revenue. Further budget surpluses and potential access to commercial credit
will enable KCCA to increase its investment and service delivery in the city.

Budget constraints and the ad-hoc organization structure of KCCA and Local Governments
has meant they have been unable to staff their organizations with adequate technical focus
on local economic development. KCCA has 10 directorates with an approved total of 1,428
technical staff. But as at December 2015, only 415 (29%) positions57 had been filled. Similarly,
staffing levels in Local Governments58 is only 56% due to limited budgets. This directly affects
subnational governments’ ability to deliver their mandates in economic development or even
their basic service delivery mandates. Analysis of KCCA and Local Government organizations
shows that economic development talents are scattered across different departments which
makes integrated economic development solutions next to impossible, and only ad-hoc efforts in
specific sectors are being carried out. The economic development functions as detailed in the
KCCA five-year strategic plan (2015/16-2019/20) are anchored in the Gender, Social Services
and Production Directorate, under the Deputy Director of Production and Marketing at KCCA. On
the other hand, the tourism portfolio is under the Directorate of Education. Similarly, within the
Local Government structure, commercial officers, gender officers and production offices all have
a role to play in economic development functions. 59 Due to varied capabilities among these
officers in different line functions, some departments might receive more support on a specific
topic/sector depending on the expertise of the officers located in that specific location. Thus,
economic development expertise in KCCA and Local Government has been spread thin and
inconsistent support for local firms.

Outline of the report

Based on these international frameworks and background information, this report drills
down into the case of Greater Kampala and outlines the metropolitan’s main challenges to
promoting economic development and recommending areas for government action.
Following this introductory section, Section 2 profiles Greater Kampala’s economic strengths and
weaknesses as well as outlines the vital role it plays in Uganda’s economy. The section will show
that Greater Kampala is not generating enough jobs in the value-added sectors, like
manufacturing, for sustained economic development and concludes by identifying promising
sectors which have the greatest potential to create productive jobs. This report then argues that
there are three focus areas which are crucial to Greater Kampala’s future economic development:
i) Built environment and; ii) Business constraints affecting the tradable sector. Section 2 evaluates
Greater Kampala’s built environment, assessing the city’s urban form and infrastructure and how
they impact on firm competitiveness. This section concludes with practical suggestions for the
GKMA stakeholders and identifies opportunities to better manage Greater Kampala’s
urbanization. Section 3 addresses the business constraints which Kampala’s formal firms face.
This section discusses how governments can best engage businesses to address barriers to firm
growth including access to finance, taxation and skills. The report concludes by outlining all
recommendations in a sequenced plan.

                                                    Economic Performance
                              Vision 2040 sets the ambitious goal of transforming Uganda from a low-income country to
                              a competitive upper middle-income country by 2040. To achieve this goal, the strategy
                              identifies Uganda’s low competitiveness and low industrialization as key challenges for the
                              country to overcome. Subsequently, the strategy aims to triple industry’s share of the labor force
                              by 2040 and increase the percentage of manufactured exports by 45%60. To achieve faster socio-
                              economic transformation, the strategy seeks to invest in better urban systems to enhance
                              productivity, livability, and sustainability. Greater Kampala is the economic engine of Uganda. It’s
                              the country’s center of economic activity and the heart of the country’s burgeoning industrial
                              sector. Consequently, Greater Kampala will play a central role in Uganda achieving Vision 2040
                              targets. However, the city faces a number of challenges which it will need to overcome to realize
                              its growth potential. This section outlines Greater Kampala’s important economic role, some of
                              the challenges it faces and identifies key sectors to help Kampala and Uganda grow and prosper.


                              2.1       Greater Kampala’s economic role and performance

                              Kampala is by far Uganda’s largest city. Kampala is one of the fastest growing African cities,
                              with an annual growth rate of 3.9%61. Greater Kampala hosts approximately 4 million people,
                              with Kampala city housing over 2 million people62 in 2016. The UN projects that Kampala city’s
                              population growth will accelerate to 4.8% and will reach 4 million people by 2030 (figure 4).
                              Moreover, Kampala is larger than any other Ugandan city. As figure 5 shows, the next largest cities
                              all have a population below 400,000 people. The next largest urban center is Nansana, followed
                              by Kiira and then Makindye Ssabagabo which are all within Greater Kampala. It is clear that
                              Greater Kampala, is central to Uganda even in simple demographic terms.

      While Growth has been slowing, per capita GDP growth remains steady. Kampala’s overall
      GDP growth rate (6.7%) is modest compared to other comparator cities67. However, Kampala’s
      per capita GDP growth, is on par or better than other comparator cities with similar per capita
      income. In a simple model of economic growth, one expects the growth rate in per capita income
      to slow as per capita income rises. Productivity in poorer cities grows faster, because they start
      at a lower base. We see this pattern within Africa when comparing per capita GDP growth rates
      of 5.6% and 10.3% in Kigali and Addis Ababa respectively, which have the lowest incomes per
      capita, to those of 3.1% and 1.9% in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi respectively, which have higher
      incomes (table 4). It is therefore appropriate to benchmark Uganda’s per capita growth rate to

  cities with income per capita near its own, $2,918 per person68. Here we see that it’s growth rate
  of 2.7%, out performs Nairobi, which has similar income, and is even on par with Hanoi, which
  has a substantially higher GDP per capita, at $4,721 (figure 8). Though Kampala is performing
  well, faster growth is still possible: Coimbatore, which has similar income, has achieved more
  than double the growth rate in per capita GDP, at 6.5%.

Kampala’s GDP growth is being driven by its manufacturing and other tradable goods and
services sector. Figure 9 breaks down by sector Kampala’s 6.7% cumulative annual real GDP
growth between 2008 and 2012. The main observation that emerges is that tradable goods and
services drove two thirds of GDP growth, indicating that Kampala is on the way to transitioning
from a “market town” producing local services towards being a “production center” which
produces tradable goods and services. Manufacturing’s contribution to growth, 31.1%, was
greater than its share of GDP in 2008, 27.7%, indicating an expansion of the sector. This pattern
was similar for transportation, storage and ICT, which drove 26.2% of growth, off a base of only
11% of GDP, indicating a rapid expansion of the wholesale trading sector. Non-tradable services
contracted as a share of GDP, indicating a decreasing reliance on local demand. Consumer
services, for instance, which includes mostly retail trade, comprised 39.4% of GDP in 2008 fell to
29.5% of growth between 2008 and 2012.

Nonetheless, this structural transformation is still at an early stage. Figure 10, shows the
composition of GDP for each comparator city and Kampala, breaking GDP in to four categories,
manufacturing, tradable services, non-tradable services and agriculture. This figure emphasizes
that Kampala has the third lowest share of output in tradable goods: agriculture, manufacturing
or tradable services. It is thus at the beginning of its transition away from a “market town,” to a
“production center,” with a higher share of tradable, high value-added output. The only two cities
below it in structural transformation, Addis Ababa and Kigali, have much lower per capita income,
as shown in Table 4.

Moreover, job creation in formal employment is not keeping pace with Kampala’s growing
population. Uganda has the third fastest growing population in Africa, with the population
doubling around every twenty years.69 Young people are entering the workforce at a rate of 4
million people per year, which is forecasted to increase to over 8 million by 2040 70 . Current
evidence suggests that formal job creation in Kampala is not keeping up with the rise in
population. Kampala’s outright unemployment is currently 10%, which while concerning, is not
considered high relative to comparator cities in East Africa71. Underemployment and informality
is the primary concern for the Greater Kampala. Currently underemployment is estimated at 23%
and informal firms account for 57% of the city’s employment 72 . The majority of Kampala’s
employment is in micro or small firms. As figure 11 shows, employment growth has dramatically
increased in micro firms and actually reduced in large and medium firms. In particular, large firms
in the tradable sector have lost five thousand jobs during 2001-2011 in Greater Kampala (four
times more than that in the non-tradable sector). Kampala will not be able to keep pace with its
population growth and satisfy the expectations of its population for better quality jobs unless it
is able to create more formal jobs in sectors which will encourage further industrialization and
economies of scale.

2.2 Understanding Greater Kampala’s Informal Sector

A large unregulated informal sector focused in low productivity sectors presents a
significant barrier to Kampala’s structural transformation. However, policies aimed at
reducing the informal sector’s dominance needs to be informed by an understanding of the kind
of firms and people working within it. This report synthesizes findings from the 2017 UBOS
informal sector survey to shed light on the composition of Kampala’s informal sector73.

Greater Kampala’s informal sector is largely concentrated in non-tradeable services (e.g.
retail trade, transportation, or restaurants). Figure 12 shows the distribution of informal
firms by main activity. Most firms (56%) are primarily engaged in trading and services within
which the most common occupation is shopkeeper or street vendor. The next sector, hotels, bars
and restaurants, comprises 26%. Manufacturing, which includes primarily tailoring and
woodwork, comprises just 13%. Not surprisingly for an urban area, agriculture comprises only
4% of firms.

The informal sector is largely made up of micro-firms who are not required to pay taxes.
Uganda defines micro-enterprises as businesses employing five or less staff, or having assets
below UGX10million74. According to survey data, 70% of the informal sector is made up of micro-
firms. Significantly, 69% of informal firms generate an annual turnover of UGX10million which is
the lowest company income tax threshold as defined by the Income Tax Act (Figure 13).
Importantly, this means that the majority of the informal sector are not avoiding tax
responsibilities but are rather under the size revenue threshold required to pay tax. In terms of
employment, the informal sector is largely made up of self-employment. Figure 14 shows the
breakdown of firm sizes in the informal sector. The vast majority of people in the sector are self-
employed (59.3%) or employ less than 5 people (38%). Only a very small number of firms (2.2%)
could be considered a small business in terms of employment.

The majority of people in the informal sector are women. Women account for 66% of firm
owners in the informal sector and for the vast majority of those employed by informal firms.
Further, as shown in Figure 15, women are largely concentrated in self-employment or firms with
less than 5 employees. Female owned firms experience lower performance compared to male-
owned firms. Male-owned firms outdo their female counterparts in three important outcomes:
firm size, Business-to-Business (B2B) customers and market reach. Possible reasons for this
could be that retail businesses are targeting individual customers (hence fewer B2B customers);
and that females, who are responsible for looking after the household, are more constrained in
their ability to travel away from the city to build and serve different markets (thus less market
reach). By contrast, a statistically larger proportion of female business owners accessed credit in
the past year, particularly formal credit from savings groups, MFIs and banks. This could be
because female business owners have less capital of their own (as suggested by their having fewer
assets), which would make them more reliant on credit to start and run a business.

The informal sector is made up of youth, and people with lower levels of education. The
informal sector is also made up largely of young people (figure 16). Business owners under 29
years old account for 43% of informal sector business and over half of the employees. The level
of education in the informal sector is also much lower than compared to Greater Kampala’s
broader labor force. 70% of Kampala’s labor force has secondary education or higher. In the
informal sector, the share of workers with secondary education or higher is 56% with the most
common level of education being primary school (36%).

Firms in the informal sector provide a subsistence income for owners, who entered the
sector out of necessity, using their own resources. While the total income of firm owners is
not reported in the UBOS survey, one can provide a rough estimate of the incidence of poverty
among informal firm owners by applying a profit margin to annual turnover. Assuming this
margin is 10%75, then 93% of micro firm owners would be beneath the international poverty line
of $1.90/day in purchasing power parity, if the business were their only source of income. If the
margin is lower, as is likely particularly in petty trading businesses, owners of small firms, in
addition to micro, could also be in poverty. This is consistent with the informal sector being
primarily a source of livelihood for the urban poor, rather than a substantial generator of value
added. Indeed, when asked why owners had chosen to start their businesses, 24% of owners
responded it was because they lacked alternative opportunities to generate income. This
response was higher among those in self-employment. The majority of firms have used their own
savings to start their businesses, typically money generated through previous work in the private
sector (65%).

Location and access to customers is important for informal businesses. Kampala’s informal
sector is concentrated in three major clusters in close proximity to the central business district.
Figure 17 shows a heat map of informal firm location density. Figure 18 shows a zoomed in map
of three main clusters in Katwe, Kasubi and along Masaka road. Each cluster shares a number of
features. Firstly, the clusters are in low income residential areas with large informal settlements.
This is unsurprising given that a large proportion of informal firms are household based,
suggesting that those who live in informal settlements are likely to run informal businesses.
Secondly, the clusters are close to high population densities and the city center. Being close to
customers is essential for informal firms. 97% of informal businesses sell to other households or
individual customers and 84% of businesses sell to customers within a 30-minute walk.




75 The Income Tax Act applies a 3% tax to turnover for small firms, and a 30% tax to the profit of medium/large firms. If the tax rate of profit
were constant for both groups of firms, the implied profit margin on turnover would be 10%.

There appears to be little co-agglomeration between formal and informal firms in
Kampala. Figure 19 maps formal firm density with the informal firm clusters overlaid. As to be
expected formal firms show an even spread throughout the city with particular concentration in
the CBD and greater density in the northern parts of the city. While the Katwe cluster has the
greatest overlap with formal firm location, the clusters in general do not share much space with
formal firms. The spatial separation between informal and formal firms suggests little economic
integration and possible economic exclusion of those working in the informal sector. This is
further corroborated in the survey, which found only 8.5% of firms trading with medium and
large firms. For the majority of informal firms, which are in service and retail sector, a lack co-
agglomeration with formal firms may have little effect. As noted above, for these firms, proximity
to markets and populations densities (i.e. customers) may dictate location choice as opposed to
positive externalities related to agglomeration economies. However, for the few manufacturing
firms in the informal sector, co-agglomeration with other manufacturing formal firms may be
advantageous. It is reasonable to assume that informal activity does not benefit in the same way
formal firms do from agglomeration economies, either through the sharing of sector specific
inputs, labor and/or knowledge. Moreover, informal manufacturing firms’ co-agglomeration with
formal firms may bring unique advantages as a number of studies have found the interaction
between formal and informal manufacturing firms are beneficial for both sectors76.

 Recommendation: Ensure the protection of livelihoods of informal enterprises

 Close proximity to markets and customers is crucial for the viability of informal sector
 firms. Given the sector’s important role in providing the poorest in the city a livelihood,
 policies to re-locate informal sector enterprises away from the CBD will have negative
 results. Importantly, policies seeking to encourage informal firms to move from their current
 location are unlikely to succeed, as any move away from a large number of customers and foot
 traffic will affect firm profitability. It is recommended that KCCA along with other Greater
 Kampala local governments work closely with vendors to zone land specifically for trading.
 Locations of any new markets should take into account population density and foot traffic for
 them to be an attractive option for informal firms. It would be ideal to coordinate these
 demarcated trading areas with newly regulated matatu routes and stops.


Informal firms face major constraints related to increased competition and the
profitability of their business model – in addition to access to finance. When asked what was
the biggest problem in potentially expanding their business, 45% of respondents reported that it
was a lack of customers, competition or the profitability of their business model and 40%
reported that it was access to finance. Other items such as access to inputs such as capital
equipment, land, utilities, labor or skills were not ranked highly at all. When asked the biggest
problem in running their business at its current scale, again, 35% reported it was a lack of
customers, competition or the profitability of their business model, and 22% reported access to
finance was the issue. Again, access to inputs was not ranked by many.

It is unlikely that many informal firms will be able to grow and generate more jobs in their
businesses. This is particularly true for self-employed and micro-firms. A key question to
ask about the informal sector is what share of its firms, if constraints were removed, or if
supported with additional capital or resources, could potentially grow, become formal and create
jobs. While it is impossible to forecast growth rates with any certainty for a single firm, one can
examine the incidence among the informal sector of indicators typically used by investors to
assess the likelihood of future growth. Table 5 presents 9 such indicators, as well as an overall
growth potential score derived from the indicators. The indicators cover owner’s ambition and
ability, past growth, resources available and age of the business. Age, or whether a firm was
established within the last year, 2016, is considered an indicator of potential growth because
older firms have shown themselves to have remained small for more than a year, and are thus
plausibly less likely to grow in the future. Looking at Table 5, only 61% of firms have plans to
grow, placing an upper bound on the share that might expand. Further, while larger firms are
more likely than small and micro firms to have an owner with a post-secondary school degree,
only 16% of micro firms do, suggesting that the smallest firms may be less likely to have the
human capital required to expand. A similar pattern is seen for record keeping. Finally, though
33.5% of large firms started because they saw an opportunity in the market, just 9.9% of micro
firms did so. Overall, only 13.5% of informal firms in general started for this reason, indicating
that they may not be in the highest potential markets. This is consistent with the observation
above that most sell local services to nearby residents—their output is limited by the size of the
local economy, and is unlikely to become widely traded. Overall, using the most generous overall
growth potential score---whether a firm has at least 4 of the 9 indicators – just 18% of firms have
potential. Restricting the score to those with 5 or more indicators, this share drops to 4%.

Recommendation – focus on livelihoods and labor mobility for those in the informal
sector with low growth potential

The informal sector in Kampala provides essential livelihoods for the city’s poorest in
the absence of more formal jobs in the city. As discussed above, only a small portion (18%)
of informal firms are estimated to have the potential to grow. For the remaining informal firms,
they provide essential livelihoods for those in the city without formal job opportunities. For
the city to assist this large group of poor people, KCCA and local governments need to focus on
generating more employment in the formal sector. However, it is also crucial to assist those in
the informal sector to attain those jobs once they are available. Instead of trying to stimulate
growth in informal firms which do not have much growth potential, local governments should
focus attention on labor mobility for those at the bottom quintile of the informal sector so that
they are more able to transition to formal employment. Training and labor matching will be
important to improve labor mobility. Local governments can work closely with business
associations to identify key skills in growing industries in order to design these interventions.

2.3 Generating jobs in high productivity sectors

Enabling Greater Kampala’s industry sector and other priority sectors will be key to
delivering on Uganda’s goals of further industrialization. A key objective of the NDPII and
Vision 2040 is to promote growth with “positive structural change”. The latter occurs when
workers migrate from less to more productive sectors, thereby increasing economy-wide labor
productivity. The NDPII prioritizes a number of high productivity sectors which are primarily
located in Greater Kampala. However, the majority of jobs in the city are still in low-productivity
sectors.

Long-term job growth in cities is usually driven by tradable sectors (like manufacturing).
Non-tradable sectors (like retail, hairdressers and street vending) encounter diminishing returns
because they are limited by their size of the local markets. Tradable sector (such as
manufacturing) on the other hand offer the prospect of increasing returns by selling outside the
local market both regionally and globally. The World Bank’s Competitive Cities report found that
the most competitive cities exhibit a particular emphasis on the production of tradable goods and
services as a way to boost economic growth and job creation. The study found that for those cities
that grew the fastest, tradable sector employment growth outstripped nontraded sector growth.

Further growth in Kampala’s high-productivity sectors will be key to delivering on
Uganda’s goals of further industrialization and formal employment generation. Over the
last ten years, tradable sectors in Greater Kampala are overrepresented in the top 20 sectors
creating new jobs. Greater Kampala unsurprisingly has a comparative advantage in tradable
sectors, yet the share of labor employed in these activities remains negligible. Conducting location
quotient 77 and shift share 78 analyses shows which sub-sectors Greater Kampala has a
comparative advantage in and which industries have been growing compared to the rest of the
economy 79 . The subsectors where Kampala has a comparative advantage over the national
economy are mainly tradable industries and services. While non-tradable activities on the other
hand are overrepresented in the sectors that have lost most jobs. Micro-enterprises are also over-
represented in the economic activities losing jobs.

To assist policy makers’ future efforts to understand the subsectors most important to job
creation and structural transformation, a sectoral job multiplier analysis was
commissioned for Greater Kampala. The analysis estimates the size and economic structure of
Greater Kampala’s economy, develops an economic model for Greater Kampala that captures the
structural linkages between sectors and households within the local economy, and between the
city and the rest of the country. We use the model to assess the economy-wide impact of investing
in each of Kampala’s economic sectors, including industries and services and, given the structural
characteristics of the local economy, the analysis indicates which sectors are most likely to
stimulate local job creation and income growth in Greater Kampala as well as in the rest of the
country. The model also included the assumption of limited supply of resources such as skilled
workers or scarce land and capital in order to realistically assess which kinds of economic
activities are likely to be the most effective at stimulating local (and national) economic
development80.



77 Location quotient analysis compares a region’s industry share of employment with its share of national employment and helps
determine which industries make the regional economy unique, but at the same time could increase the vulnerability of the city economy,
if in decline.
78 Shift-share analysis, identifies industries where a regional economy has competitive advantage over the larger economy by
decomposing regional growth in employment and calculating how much can be attributed to national, industry and regional factors.

Investment in higher value sub-sectors, particularly in manufacturing, have a greater
contribution to productivity. Using an econometric model of the Kampala economy,
investments in higher value manufacturing and service sub-sectors creates fewer jobs than lower
value added sub-sectors but leads to larger increases in economy-wide labor productivity81.
Importantly shifting from lower to higher productivity activities leads to higher overall growth
(and higher earnings at the individual level), which compensates for lower labor intensity. So,
despite creating fewer jobs in the short term, manufacturing and tradable service sub-sectors
have the potential to stimulate job generating growth in the longer term. The model also revealed
several win-win subsectors which generate above-average job creation as well as labor
productivity gains (figure 20). Grain milling, chemical manufacturing, other food manufacturing,
and financial services all have both above average returns to job creation and productivity82. It is
clear from this analysis that future development of industry and tradable services can encourage
increased productivity and stimulate structural transformation in Uganda.

There are also several win-win subsectors which generate above-average job creation as
well as labor productivity gains. As Figure 18 shows, grain milling, chemical manufacturing,
other food manufacturing, and financial services (highlighted) all have both above average
returns to job creation and productivity. In addition to these, investment in a number of sectors
generates above average returns in job creation, structural change or poverty alleviation. These
sectors are summarized in table 6 It is clear from this analysis that future development of these
sub-sectors will encourage increased productivity and stimulate structural transformation in
Uganda. However, local service sectors will remain important for job creation.

   While greater Kampala is specialized in manufacturing sub-sectors, not all of these sub-
   sectors have been growing. Of the sub-sectors which Greater Kampala is highly specialized
   (LQ>1.7) nearly half are in manufacturing. When restricting for those sub-sectors that Greater
   Kampala is specialized in and employ at least one thousand workers and have created jobs in the
   last decade, four manufacturing sub-sectors appear, along with sub-sectors in wholesale and
   services. These subsectors appear to be promising areas within Greater Kampala (Table 7).
   However not all sub-sectors have been growing. Most concerning are those large sub-sectors
   including manufacturing in structural and fabricated metal products, manufacturing in basic iron
   and steel, and manufacturing in plastics where employment has declined despite being highly
   specialized in Greater Kampala. Developing alternative subsectors of specialization will be critical
   to avoid a deterioration in unemployment and informality.

   Uganda’s manufactured exports, as a whole, have recently declined but market
   opportunities continue to exist. City level export data does not exist. But an analysis of Uganda’s
   exports shows that, while food and raw commodities make up the majority of Uganda’s export
   basket, the share of non-food exports had been growing over past decades84. However, Uganda’s
   manufacturing sector has recently been performing poorly. Figure 21 shows the declining export
   performance of three subsectors that Greater Kampala is specialised in – machinery, beverages
   and textiles. Additionally, Uganda’s merchandise exports have stagnated in stark comparison to

manufactured exports include primarily the consequence of the reduced level of demand from
South Sudan and Eastern DRC which have been affected by instability) and in Europe, where
recovery from the recession has been slow85.

Despite recent events disrupting Uganda’s manufacturing trade, it is important to note that
export markets for manufactured goods exist and have potential for growth. When
disaggregating Uganda’s export data further we see that only three sectors have decreased in
their world export market share between 2005 and 2015 - computer and communications services;
fishing and fishing products; and upstream metal manufacturing (see figure 23). Further, while
Uganda’s exports are dominated by primary commodities and food processing, a number of
smaller manufacturing sectors have been growing in their world market share. These sectors
include footwear, production of heavy machinery, IT and analytical instruments and automotive.
This suggests that there is indeed a market for Uganda’s manufactured goods to be exported.

2.4 Challenges Greater Kampala faces to build its productive sectors
     For Greater Kampala to transition to a production centre and lead Uganda’s structural
     transformation, its local governments will need to better understand the constraints
     to firm growth in order to support job and productivity growth. This section has
     highlighted the importance of Greater Kampala to the Ugandan economy and the central role
     in which the city will play in Uganda’s future industrialisation. However, the city faces a
     number of challenges. Economic growth is slowing and the city faces accelerated population
     growth amidst pervasive underemployment and a dominant informal sector. To reach its
     economic potential the city must generate more wage employment in tradable sectors that
     can benefit from scale economies. Greater Kampala has a comparative advantage in the
     tradable sector, in particular manufacturing. However, a number of promising tradable sub-
     sectors have been shrinking, whilst the number of micro enterprises have grown
     considerably. The following sections report findings on key constraints for Greater Kampala’s
     subnational Governments to address to ensure future growth of the metropolitan’s
     productive sectors:

     I.     A disconnected and costly environment (section 3) – Greater Kampala’s urban form
            does not encourage economic density and poor infrastructure makes production
            activities expensive. The spatial configuration of a city affects the location and density of
            infrastructure, which in turns affects economic competitiveness. High production costs
            has a direct impact on firm competitiveness. As regional integration accelerates in East
            Africa, Kampala is increasingly placed in direct competition with other regional cities,
            particularly Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Uganda’s burgeoning industrial sector is located
            in Greater Kampala86. For Uganda to meet the industrialisation targets set out in Vision

                                                            38
         2040 and National Development Plan (NDPII), Kampala’s industrial sector will need to
         become more cost competitive.

   II.   Lack of enterprise services and support (section 4) – Cities are not limited to their
         built environment. The role of a city authority and local government lies in creating a
         conducive environment to support enterprise growth. In practice, this translates into
         understanding and acting to alleviate the constraints which businesses face in the city.
         Firms in Greater Kampala face a number of constraints which relate to their business
         environment and human capital. These included constraints with access to finance,
         labour skills, business skills and tax administration. Underlying these issues were firms’
         mistrust of the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and local governments, which
         makes public private cooperation difficult. The key to any successful enterprise support,
         is to understand the particular barriers in depth and how they affect firms of varying
         types and sizes.

Crucially, while city governments are important stakeholders in promoting their city’s
firm competitiveness through coordination, engagement and investment, the report
highlights a number of key constraints which requires central government leadership.
Chief among these constraints are Uganda’s complex land tenure system, the high cost of finance
and the reliability and cost of electricity. These constraints are outside the remit of local
governments and are currently being addressed by a number of national projects and as such
have not been the focus of this program. However, local governments still have a role to play in
lobbying the central government for swift and effective reform and investment. Without these
national constraints being addressed, Greater Kampala’s growth potential, and Uganda’s
economic development, will be significantly hampered.

      3. Building a competitive city – Greater Kampala’s
                      urban environment

How a city is spatially configured and the infrastructure it offers are key determinants as
to whether a city is able to generate and promote competitive industries. The World Bank’s
recent research on the Spatial Development of African Cities shows that African Cities are
crowded, disconnected and costly, and that this is likely inhibiting their ability to take advantage
of the benefits of agglomeration. This section evaluates Kampala’s built environment, assessing
the city’s urban form and infrastructure, and how these may be impacting firm competitiveness.
The section argues that Greater Kampala is currently disconnected, which curtails mobility and
inhibits economic agglomeration. And secondly that Greater Kampala’s urban form and poor
infrastructure makes production expensive. Underlying these issues and making potential
remedies difficult, is a complex land tenure system which slows the effectiveness of future
investments. However, Greater Kampala is still in its early stages of urbanization. Local
Governments working together can contribute to a well-managed city which supports clusters of
houses and firms, and allows transport to connect people to jobs, making the city more livable for
its residents and reducing the cost of living and production. The section concludes with practical
suggestions for the Greater Kampala local governments to coordinate Kampala’s urban
investments.

Well managed cities can have large benefits to firm productivity. Cities allow firms to access
and find suitable skills and labor quickly, they also provide common resources and infrastructure,
such as airports, markets and electricity. Cities and urban density also provide increased
knowledge spill overs which makes it easier for information to be shared and innovation to be
generated. Recent evidence suggests that Kampala’s workers have a higher wage than rural
counterparts, and that this in part is driven by higher productivity affects generated by the city87.
Within the city, studies have shown that firms within the tradable sector - specifically
manufacturing - benefit most from agglomeration and scale economies88. Additionally, empirical
evidence suggests that Kampala’s land tenure also plays an effect on firms’ productivity89 – these
findings are further discussed throughout the report. Cities are crucial for generating improved
productivity. However, if not managed well, cities can impede firm productivity through
congestion, lack of services and weak economic density.

3.1 Moving from a disconnected toward a connected city
Kampala has expanded rapidly, but expansion has left the city with low population density.
Kampala is not a dense city. The city over time has spread out, tripling its built-up area over the
past 40 years (Figure 24 & 25). Growth in the city’s built environment has spread east towards
Mukono, west towards Entebbe, north towards Luwero, Wakiso and north-west towards Mpigi.
As the city has expanded, firms and employment have dispersed further from the urban core.
Employment densities around the CBD of Kampala are between 5,000 and 10,000 workers per
square kilometer 90 . This is low compared to other cities. For example, in Kigali’s downtown,
employment density is 25,000 workers per square kilometer, and in 1990s downtown London
and Seoul, employment density was 42,000 and 58,000 workers respectively91.

Kampala’s urban development has not been uniform, leading to scattered population
density peaks instead of clustered density which can enhance scale economies. Recent
research has found that Kampala’s population densities are fragmented in its core. Figure 26
compares the population densities of Kampala and Surat, India. The Surat population shows a
compact form, with contiguous spikes of population. While Kampala’s population spikes are
larger they are separated by gaps. And this trend is increasing, the share of new development
happening in leapfrog has more than doubled from the 1990s to the 2000s92. Such development
put a break on density and disconnect people from opportunities.

Kampala’s fragmented form also has an effect on businesses. Businesses within cities
benefit from dense economic activity. However, Kampala lacks any clear industry clusters.
Greater density allows firms to access a wider market of inputs and buyers while reducing the

cost of production thanks to scale economies. In particular, empirical evidence suggests that firms
in Kampala within the tradable sector - specifically manufacturing - benefit most from
agglomeration and scale economies. 93 This is unsurprising given that the vast majority of
Kampala’s employment is concentrated in local services which have less to gain from clustering
than other sectors. Using the Ellison Glaesar (EG) index on Kampala’s industries, shows that most
of Kampala’s labor force is scattered94. Those industries which are most spatially concentrated
are largely tradable activities such as manufacturing and food processing. Kampala’s urban form
is currently not facilitating industrial clusters and, in general, the EG index shows there are low
levels of firm clustering by industry in Kampala95.

 Recommendation: Prioritize zoning and development of vacant land

 Further land zoning and city planning is crucial to encourage the efficient use of space
 in the city. There are powerful agglomeration incentives for firms, particularly in
 manufacturing sectors to cluster with one another. A lack of industrial clustering suggests
 coordination failures within the city. Given the high cost of land and land tenure issues, it
 appears unlikely that firms will be able to harmonize locations and generate industrial
 clustering without some government assistance. KCCA and local governments can address this
 coordination failure by facilitating increased firm clustering for key sectors, through increased
 zoning and infrastructure provision. However, KCCA and local governments are unable to
 effectively zone and plan given the lack of land which local governments control and the
 multitude of large land owners city and local governments need to work with to secure land.

 As an initial step, vacant and underdeveloped land should be first identified through GIS
 mapping. KCCA and local governments will also need to work closely with current major
 landowning institutions (such as the Church and the Buganda Land Board) to jointly
 collaborate on land zoning. Furthermore, the potential for land swaps can be further explored
 with landowning institutions in order to facilitate land development in essential city locations.
 In order to finance land purchasing it is recommended that KCCA and local governments begin
 to coordinate purchasing vacant and underdeveloped land through a land banking mechanism,
 which could potentially make use of the GoU’s Land Fund. The efficient purchasing and
 reallocating of underused or vacant land would increase land supply for mixed uses, including
 commercial and industrial activities. Crucially, in order to discourage further speculation and
 corruption, land should be earmarked and reallocated in a transparent process that benefits a
 large number of firms or citizens.



Outside of Kampala’s core, secondary points of employment have emerged. However,
these secondary centers’ density remains low given the high commuting costs. In general,
firm concentration in Kampala’s CBD has declined from 65% of firms in 2002 to 55% in 201196.
As firm concentration in Kampala’s CBD has declined, secondary employment concentrations
have emerged, the most significant of which is in Entebbe. However, employment densities in
these areas are still low, representing only about 10% of those in the urban core97. Outside of the
CBD, high commuting costs to new potential sub-centers are preventing their growth. When
commuting is cheap, various localized centers of production and employment emerge. Decreasing
transport costs can therefore encouraging the concentration and clustering of firms and lead to
increased job creation in other secondary clusters outside downtown Kampala.98

To encourage increased economic densities which lead to agglomeration effects, it is
crucial for Greater Kampala to further develop its transportation system and improve
mobility within the city. Economic activities, especially those in the tradable sector, benefit from
agglomeration effects resulting from improved connectivity and economic density. Investment in
transport infrastructure is therefore critical and has been shown to decrease the transport cost
of motorized transport in Kampala. Indeed, other residents also benefit through decreased prices,
translating in lower costs of living. With time, people relocate: the rich can move further from
their job as commuting times have decreased, lowering the pressure on land close to the city
center and allowing the poorer to settle close to their job, reducing their share of transport costs.99

Greater Kampala’s fragmented urban form and inefficient transportation system is a
barrier to firms. The World Bank Enterprise Survey found that 15% of firms in Greater Kampala
considered transportation a major or severe constraint to their businesses. This was reiterated
in firm interviews 100 which highlighted the debilitating effect of congestion. One firm
interviewed101 explained:

          “Because of the traffic jams, it takes 6 hours for a 30km round journey, this means I can’t
          make multiple deliveries in a day and can’t promise that deliveries will arrive on time.” –
          Medium manufacturing firm


KCCA currently estimates that 24,000 man hours a day are lost by commuters due to traffic
jams.102 Congestion is particularly troublesome for medium and large firms in the tradable sector,
who rely on the transportation of goods around and outside of the city.

Road congestion is an increasing problem in Kampala, and road infrastructure cannot
keep pace. As the economy grows, the number of vehicles on the roads in Greater Kampala has
been increasing at a faster rate than infrastructure investment can keep up. Motor vehicle
ownership is on the rise, a trend which will only accelerate as incomes rise and cost of vehicles
reduce. The existing roads in Kampala were constructed in the 1960s for 100,000 vehicles per
day; today 400,000 vehicles use the roads every day.103 Compounding the issues of increased use
is that 73% of roads in Kampala are unpaved, which slows traffic and increases the likelihood of
accidents.104 Kampala’s road system is radial and has most traffic running through the city center.
While the northern ring road system, which was completed in 2009, has reduced traffic in the
city, it now too suffers from heavy congestion. Currently, Greater Kampala’s road infrastructure
cannot keep pace with the rise of vehicles on its roads.

Kampala’s lack of public transport is a key underlining reason for the level of road
congestion. Kampala’s roads are dominated by private motorcycle taxis (boda bodas) and
private cars (private cars estimated to be growing at 11% per year)105. Boda bodas have become
increasingly popular due to the poor state of the road infrastructure and high level of congestion.
While they are highly prone to accidents, they provide their customers with fast and flexible
transport. However, boda bodas are not the most efficient use of public roads. Table 8 shows that
while boda bodas represent the largest share of vehicles in the city, they only carry under 10% of

passengers. On the other hand, the informal mini-bus taxis (matatu) transport the largest portion
of people despite making up the smallest group of vehicles using the road. However, according to
a study by MoWT, 64% of congestion problems are due to frequently stopping taxis. The lack of
coordinated routes and stops—as well as their small capacity—means that the number of times
a taxi has to stop in order to pick-up or put-down passengers is high.106 This slows down the speed
of the service and has knock-on effects to other forms of motorized transport.

Reducing congestion will be key to lowering commuting costs for workers and firms,
however little in the way of public transportation reform has been made. The National
Transport Master Plan (NTMP) 2009-2023 outlined a plan to develop a high-quality public
transport network. However, there has been little progress in terms of reforming the public
transport system in Kampala. In 2012, a private company – Pioneer Bus Company – began
operating conventional single decker buses on allocated routes. However, one year after
operating, the bus company’ services were suspended for tax reasons. While the company has
repaid the tax debt and services have resumed, it is still faced with the challenge of accessing the
areas within the other metro local governments, since the agreement was signed with KCCA who
have no jurisdiction beyond Kampala City. Introducing a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system has also
been suggested and feasibility study conducted. However, work implementing this system has yet
to begin and there are doubts regarding the feasibility of such a system in a low income and low
density city setting. There is a need, therefore, to ensure that the Multi-modal urban transport
masterplan for Greater Kampala currently being designed under the Kampala Institutional and
Infrastructure Development Program (KIIDP) gives rise to a more tightly focused Public
Transport Policy for Kampala.

  Recommendation: Transport – improving connectivity and reducing congestion in Greater
  Kampala

  Regulate current transportation system - Before Kampala is ready to invest in a new public
  transport system, the current transport system and regulatory environment needs to be
  prepared. While the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) outlines a broad transport plan for
  the Greater Kampala, there is need to ensure that the Multi-modal urban transport masterplan for
  Greater Kampala currently being designed gives rise to a more tightly focused Public Transport
  Policy for Kampala. A central task of this policy will be to address the regulatory framework for
  local taxis. For decades, the Uganda Taxi Owners and Drivers Association (UTODA) and rival
  associations assigned routes and prices to its members – in essence the industry was informally
  self-regulating with a number of governance issues. However, since early 2015, KCCA has taken
  over more control of the taxi industry’s regulation. A complete and sudden phasing out of taxis will
  not be feasible in the short run. Instead, increased structuring of the local taxis system can enhance
  labor mobility in the city and reduce congestion quickly. Key to improving congestion in the city
  will be to coordinate taxi routes and stops to ensure that traffic is not slowed down by taxis
  constantly stopping to pick up and drop off passengers. It will be imperative for taxi stops and
  routes to be planned to accommodate where city workers live and the main areas of employment
  – including informal sector hubs. As an initial step, maps of the taxi system should be updated and
  plans should be made in line to connect current high density residential area and employment
  hubs. Once immediate steps are taken to regulate the current informal transport system,
  investments can be made to further upgrade the system to higher capacity vans, light rail or a bus
  system. The private sector could be further involved in future transport upgrading could be
  financed through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP).

  Improve non-motorized transport - Attention should also be given to providing improved
  conditions for non-motorized transportation. For the poorest urban residents, the cost of
  vehicle transport is prohibitive. Data reported in the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS)
  suggest 70% in Kampala’s population walk to work. Typically, transport choice is determined by
  incomes, with the mode and number of trips increasing with incomes. As Kampala has expanded,
  market opportunities for people who have to walk to their employment has been diminishing. This
  may also even exacerbate slum formation as many people will trade off housing quality to be close
  to jobs. While it is crucial to ensure affordable vehicle transportation systems, improving the safety
  for pedestrians and cyclists should not be ignored. Furthermore, consultation with the poor in
  regards to transportation is often an area which is neglected in policy formation.

  Further road improvement and public transport investments. Road investment is strongly
  associated with density increases and economic activity. KCCA and Local Governments have made
  significant progress in increasing paved roads in the city but further investments are needed,
  particularly those of a cross GKMA nature, which would have a bigger impact on better connecting
  where people live with where they work. Research suggests that road improvements of the
  northern bypass around the city would enhance the connectivity of east and west parts of the city
  and improve city mobility. The feasibility of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and light rail investments are
  also being considered. To support access to markets for informal enterprises, taxi stops could also
  be coordinated with investments in markets and premises for them107.

3.2 An expensive urban environment for business
High production costs and the price of land all have a direct impact on firm
competitiveness. As regional integration accelerates in East Africa, Kampala is increasingly
placed in direct competition with other regional cities, particularly Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. As
outlined in section one of this report, Uganda’s burgeoning industrial sector is located in Greater
Kampala. For Uganda to meet the industrialization targets set out in Vision 2040 and NDPII,
Kampala’s industrial sector will need to become more cost competitive.

Greater Kampala’s industry suffers from high input costs. Central to these costs is the
reliability and price of electricity. While the electricity system has shown signs of
improvement, the cost and reliability of electricity were identified as a key business constraint in
enterprise survey and firm level interviews. Due to the frequency of power outages and surges a
number of firms interviewed108 had resorted to running their machines on generators to avoid
damaging machinery, which makes their production costs more expensive. In response to the
continued unreliable service, there has been an increase in the investment in generators. The cost
of purchasing industrial sized generators is substantial. One business owner stated the cost of
their generator was UGX400 million.

      “We had a power surge once, which caused a fire that incinerated our machinery and damaged
      the factory. From then onwards, we made a decision to run all the machines on generators,
      which had greatly increased our production costs” – medium sized manufacturing firm



This is particularly damaging for smaller businesses who struggle with tight cash flows, limited
savings and expensive finance109.


      “people can import goods from China and Kenya, even after being taxed, they are cheaper.
      The cost of production here is so high” – small sized manufacturing firm



     Recommendation: Coordination with power utility management

     It is recommended that local governments and KCCA are involved in advocacy and
     lobbying for improved electricity in strategic areas where there are more firms
     clustered together. Uganda’s electricity network is managed by power utility firm Umeme,
     which won a 20-year lease on the power network and is responsible for most distribution
     of electricity in Uganda. However, it is essential that local urban planning is aligned with
     system improvements planned by Umeme. As an initial step, KCCA and local governments
     will need to meet with Umeme planning teams to ensure that the city’s industrial clusters
     are provided with commercial grade electricity access to prevent system degradation and
     reduced outages.

Many firms explained that the high cost of procuring land constrains their capital supply110. This
reduces their ability to invest in machinery or raw materials, consequently stunting firm growth.
One firm noted that:


 “land prices have gone up very fast – it is overvalued because there’s a scramble for land with the influx of
 migrants and corrupt officials who have a lot of cash and need to put it somewhere”.

Small firms in particular found land prices one of the biggest issues they face. Consequently, most
firms interviewed were renting property as they were unable to purchase it themselves111. One
metal fabrication firm stated that:

  “it is impossible for me to buy land, because of the price, it’s very expensive. I want to expand my business, but
  to do that I require more land”.

For informal firms, only 18% operated from an established store or building for at least a year112.
It was found that those businesses without an established and stable operating location were less
likely to formalize and had reduced profits and productivity. On the other hand, large firms
interviewed did not express concern regarding the cost of land as most had access to rent free
space in industrial parks or had the means to pay the costs required113.

A number of factors have been identified as contributing to the increase in land prices in
Kampala. Firstly, Kampala’s population increase has increased the demand and competition for
prime real estate114. Land speculation has also been identified as a factor contributing to the sharp
increases in land value115. Some have argued that Kampala’s land speculation has been driven by
a lack of alternative investments, given that interest on bank deposits is low and the stock market

underdeveloped. As a result, investors turn to land to make easy profits by holding onto it for a
few years before selling it on and without having to develop the land in any significant way. Land
speculation is particularly severe in conjunction with the announcement of government physical
construction. It’s been suggested that individuals will hoard land when they hear that large-scale
public projects (e.g. roads) will be commissioned as this would require the central/local
government to buy private land in order to physically construct the project116. Corruption also is
said to have an impact on land transaction, elevating land prices. Due to the current lack of
systematic land titles and ownership database, opportunities for corruption have been created117.
Bribes to land officials may thus inflate land values.

Informal settlements located in city center locations and suffering from substandard
housing are using large tracts of land. Approximately 16% of land in central Kampala is an
informal settlement 118 , while nearly half of the city’s population live in a slum. 119 These
settlements typically suffer from poor services, high population densities, and low quality and
shanty housing which horizontally takes up a large amount of land. The prominence of informal
settlements in Kampala suggests that urban planning and housing provision has not been able to
keep pace with the influx of rural migrants into the city. Despite poor living standards, migrants
will choose to crowd into these settlements in order to be close to jobs.

  Recommendation: Prioritizing affordable housing schemes that also release land for
  mixed use development and increase informal firms’ access to premises

  KCCA should re-attempt to pilot a high density affordable housing scheme within one
  slum area, that also frees up land for economically productive investments in the city’s
  core. This would have the twin objectives of improving living conditions for people in slum
  dwellings as well as better access to jobs through the release of land for more economically
  productive uses. This was attempted before with Development Partner support but was not
  able to get off the ground as the negotiations with the landowners (in this case, the Church),
  were not concluded within the timeframe that the donor funding was available. The idea
  would be to work in collaboration with landowning institutions such as the Church or the
  Buganda Land Board as well as an affordable housing mortgage finance provider which would
  finance the upfront cost of housing construction and mortgage provision to dwellers. KCCA
  would provide supporting infrastructure and facilitate the partnership between stakeholders.
  As an initial step, KCCA should identify potential areas for the affordable housing pilot and
  begin initial discussion with key landowners to begin the design processes. Furthermore, the
  private sector could be leveraged through a PPP to assist local governments financing
  affordable housing.

  Increasing informal firms’ access to serviced premises. As the study suggests those firms
  with permanent establishments are more likely to see increased performance and formalize,
  KCCA could further investigate areas in the city where firms could be assisted to gain
  established locations for their business – particularly through public private partnerships.

3.3 An Underlying issue - Complex land tenure

Greater Kampala has multiple and complex land
tenures which constrain both public investment and                                Figure 28: Multiple Land Tenures in Greater
firm’s ability to grow. Clear land rights are a                                   Kampala
requirement for organized and efficient urban
development. The majority of the land in Kampala
operates under a complex land tenure regime that
recognizes independent rights over land and structures
— giving rise to legal disputes and blocking investment.
The 1995 Constitution and 1998 Land Act, transferred
all land from the central government to the Buganda
Kingdom, local governments (e.g. District Land Boards)
and     private     landowners      (including    tribes).
Consequently, the Central Government must now
purchase land from these landowners if it wishes to use
land for development purposes (such as building
infrastructure). Article 237(3) of the 1995 Constitution
re-instituted Uganda’s four land tenures, as outlined in
the below table 9. The majority of land in Kampala city is
Mailo and Leasehold (figure 28). The large share of Mailo
land and subsequent private land compensation, has
meant the construction of each urban road is expensive
and land is released for development in an uneven
manner.

Uganda’s land tenure system is also seen to be a large barrier to large-scale investments.
Mailo land tenure, in particular is beset by overlapping land rights between those who are
registered owners and the lawful or bona fide occupants. The tenure system has become an even
greater barrier since the implementation of the 2010 Land Amendment Act, which increased the
powers of tenants over landlords122. Tenant- land lord’s conflicts continue due to the overlapping

land rights and speculation on land thus making land acquisition not only costly but risky for
firms.

According to recent research123, leasehold land has been found to be the most productive
in Kampala. The research used a Spatial Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model to
analyze to what extent the variation in productivity in different areas of the city can be explained
by the variation in land tenure systems. Preliminary results indicate that leasehold land was
found to be particularly productive, leading to higher economic activity in certain areas of the city
across all sectors. In comparison, customary land and Mailo land reduce economic activity while
increasing residential densities, with the former particularly leading to high density low-income
neighborhoods. Freehold and Mailo land systems also negatively impact local service activities in
particular, primarily because of the predominance of overlapping and conflicting rights of
registered owners on one hand and the lawful and bona fide occupants on the other. These results
highlight the need for action to address overlapping and conflicting land rights (between
registered owners and lawful and bona fide occupants) often found on Mailo and freehold tenure
in Kampala.

Interviews with medium and large firms revealed that businesses have taken a number of
measures to avoid land tenure issues. Some of the large businesses interviewed were located
in industrial parks and therefore did not have difficulty with land tenure. The rest of the large
firms interviewed had obtained land through a personal contact and increased due diligence124.
This was seen as a method of circumventing fraudulent owners, overlapping title claims, and
unfair land prices. However, there were instances where this had still not worked out for firms.
In one instance, a firm discovered squatters on their land, which they had to compensate (as is
required under the Constitution and National Land Policy), leading to a delay of the firm’s planned
expansion. Another large company had a neighbor who began to dispute land boundaries after
the land purchased had been finalized. Similarly, two other firms experienced overlapping
ownership claims on small secondary pieces of land they had purchased125. In one instance, the
Buganda Kingdom had disputed the registered title and claimed the land rightfully belonged to
them, while in the other instance an individual had claimed the land and built a restaurant on the
disputed plot. In all these cases, land tenure disputes cost businesses in terms of legal fees and
lost revenue resulting from an inability to develop and utilize the land until the claims became
resolved.

There is concern that current efforts towards establishing a land registry for Kampala is
not expected to address issues around over lapping tenure. Firms interviewed believed land
tenure issues could be resolved by setting up a better, more effective centralized online land
system than the one currently in place 126 . Current efforts are underway by the Central
government, with the support of the World Bank, to encourage formal registration of land and to
digitize land titles through the Land Information System. However, according to key informants,
this system will not significantly reduce instances of multi-tenure. Another key informant,
working closely with the Land Information System explained that the process of computerizing
land titles was about achieving faster and cheaper transactions rather than addressing problems
of multi-tenure.

 Recommendation: Strengthen land administration

 Overall land policy reform, which would alleviate the above issues, is within the remit of
 the national government. In addition, land administration needs to be strengthened and
 improved coordination among the various land management institutions. Land management
 falls under the mandate of a number of different institutions in Kampala. Coordination between
 these stakeholders needs to be strengthened with the focus to improve dispute resolutions,
 improve land information databases and strengthen the local government’s ability to acquire
 land for infrastructure improvement.




3.4 Effective Institutional Coordination will be key to better urban
planning and infrastructure provision across the GKMA
Currently Greater Kampala lacks strategic planning and infrastructure investment across
the metropolitan area. Assigning responsibilities to address urban challenges and is difficult
due to unclear and sometimes conflicting mandates among various sub-national government
agencies in Greater Kampala. Uganda’s current institutional framework is guided by the 1995
Constitution operationalized by various Acts, Ordinances, and Policies. From 1995 when GoU
started the devolution process127, to 2010 when GoU elevated the status of KCCA to administer
the capital city area on behalf of the central government128, many of the laws/Acts/Polices that
concern the roles and mandates of sub national governments are not fully aligned. 129 For
example, the 2010 KCCA Act, provides for the development of the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
Development Plan under a metropolitan physical development authority, to enable uniform
planning across greater Kampala. However, the plan’s development has s talled and suffers from
unclear institutional leadership. KCCA who draws its authority through the Minister for Kampala
and Metropolitan Affairs has no jurisdiction in surrounding local government areas within the
GKMA. Local Governments are governed by their respective councils and answer to the Minister
of Local Government. Different jurisdictions within the Greater Kampala region have meant a lack
of clear leadership in developing the GKMA development plan. Besides, KCCA and the Local
Governments, the other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) by law are supposed to
provide guidelines, standards and support the local authorities in implementation, however, they
are also faced with overlapping and conflicting mandates and there is limited coordination among
them, sometimes leading to conflicting policies.




127 Local Government Act CAP, 243
128 KCCA Act (2010)
129Subnational governments in Greater Kampala are governed by two different Acts: Local Government Act for the 3 surrounding LGs,
and KCCA Act for KCCA. On one hand, the 1995 Constitution of the Republic of Uganda (as amended), and the Local Government Act (CAP
243), devolved service delivery mandates to the sub national governments, the local governments thus play a key role in the
implementation of Government’s policies and programmes. The local governments are governed by the LG Act (CAP 243). On the o ther
hand, the Central Government transformed Kampala City from a Local Government into a Government Entity directly under the Central
Government. Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA), a corporate legal entity was established in 2010 to serve as the governing body and
administers the Capital City on behalf of the central government.

                                                                 51
        The lack of a comprehensive policy framework for the GKMA is a critical issue. The current
        institutional framework for GKMA urban development has resulted in a multiplicity of agencies
        in urban development posing numerous coordination problems. The Ministry of Kampala and
        Metropolitan affairs, as well as the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development do not
        have direct jurisdiction over the numerous agencies and institutions in the GKMA and thus
        oversight and coordination functions are weak. This is compounded by the fact that the Ministry
        of Kampala metropolitan affairs is a young ministry and is inadequately staffed. It is critical for a
        comprehensive planning framework for the GKMA to assist agencies coordinate and offer policy
        guidance. Given the special provisions for the GKMA in the Vision 2040 and its declaration as a
        special planning area, Government needs to streamline the operations and build capacity of the
        Ministry of Kampala Capital City and Metropolitan Affairs to be able to coordinate and
        development across the GKMA.




Box 1 - Best practice example: Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA)
In 2011, Greater Manchester city created the first combined authority in the UK, the GMCA. The GMCA is made up
of ten Greater Manchester councils who work closely with one another to provide local services and improve the
city-region. The GMCA has been identified as a stable and accountable platform for local government and a best
practice example of local government coordination.

The GMCA was the outcome of a long time of consistency of aspiration which developed trust, credibility and
capacity necessary for a highly collaborative and “bottom up” governance arrangement. While tech nical capacity
was important in the process, buy in from a wide range of participants was essential. One way of developing trust
among stakeholders was the inclusive process of narrative-building which each local authority could support. The
City of Manchester was unique in opening the city strategy process to surrounding local authorities to contribute
and promote a regional identity based on the economic reality of the city as opposed to the administrative borders.
The collaborative strategy also sparked a number of cross-district planning and joint-initiatives (including the
Manchester Airport and the Manchester Growth Company) which not only increased planning efficiencies but
developed local government technical capacities.

Recommendation: Greater Kampala Working Group

It is recommended that future coordination of the GKMA development plan should be
led by a national level government agency with mandate to operate across the
Greater Kampala. Given Kampala’s significance to Uganda’s economy and structural
transformation, it’s recommended that the governmental coordination on the GKMA
development plan be represented in cabinet, to ensure high level buy in and harness the
required unified political support for this agenda.

Coordination does not develop spontaneously but develops over time. Government
stakeholders during consultative forums proposed a phased approach to introduce
coordination mechanisms. It’s proposed that the coordination mechanism for the GKMA
development plan be structured as follows:

   i)      Greater Kampala Development Technical Group for Planning,
           Implementation and Monitoring. The working group will include personnel
           from local governments and KCCA and would be hosted by NPA. The group
           would be made up of economic and physical planners whose responsibilities
           would be to design interventions for Greater Kampala. This would include
           responsibility for coordination and harmonization of interventions, developing
           strategies and drafting policy notes for an inter-ministerial working group.

   ii)     Greater Kampala Development Inter-Ministerial Working Group as
           provided for in the NDPII and Vision 2040. for Policy decisions and
           Problem solving. This working group would form a coalition of stakeholders
           from relevant national ministries, local governments, KCCA the private sector
           and civil society organisations. The working group, would provide policy
           oversight as well as guide the development and implementation of the GKMA
           development plan.

   iii)    Long term institutional arrangement for GKMA development.
           Governmental stakeholders repeatedly emphasized the need for a long-term
           institutional arrangement with a clear mandate, legal status and budget. It’s
           proposed that the above two temporary structure should eventually lead to a
           more permanent one.

A key incentive for increased coordination will be the establishment of a common
financing mechanism which both KCCA as well as surrounding local governments can
draw on for capital expenditure across the GKMA. Local Governments are considerably
budget constrained and are unable to provide large capital expenditure. While KCCA is in a
relatively stronger budgetary position, it however, does not have jurisdiction over the
surrounding local government areas. Once an agreed infrastructure plan for the GKMA has
been put together by stakeholders, a key deliverable for the inter-ministerial committee will
be an MOU between Ministries to delegate a sole Ministry in charge of increased
coordination among GKMA stakeholders. This MoU should also establish a single funding
mechanism which can be used jointly by Local Governments and KCCA for the provision of
infrastructure investments across the GKMA.

  4. Enabling business growth – Enterprise Support in
                   Greater Kampala
Cities are not only limited to their built environment. The role of a city authority and local
governments lies in creating a conducive environment to support enterprise growth. In
practice, this translates into understanding and acting to alleviate the constraints which
businesses face in the city. Firms in Greater Kampala face a number of constraints which relate to
their business environment and human capital. The 2013 enterprise survey identified access to
finance and taxation as two key constraints facing firms in Greater Kampala. Firm level interviews
reiterated this as well as finding labor skills, business skills and tax administration common
constraints for firms. Underlying these constraints were firm’s mistrust of KCCA and local
governments making cooperation difficult. Institutional analysis found that currently KCCA and
local governments provide only minor enterprise support, which could be strengthened to assist
local firms and industries. Key to any successful enterprise support is understanding the
particular barriers in depth and how they affect firms of varying types and sizes. This section
outlines these constraints and how they affect firms and offers practical solutions which are
within the remit of KCCA and local governments as well as highlighting those that fall within the
remit of national government.


4.1 Cost of finance – too high and prohibitive to growth
Uganda’s high cost of finance is a significant barrier to firm growth of all sizes. The cost of
finance in Uganda is high – the lending rate is currently 23.5%130. For large and medium size
businesses, high interest rates have curtailed their ability to make long term investments and
compete regionally. Given the high interest rates, banks are inclined only to provide short term
loans. For firms in Kampala, roughly 50% of loan durations are under one year131. Interviews
revealed that for medium and large sized businesses, loans were required for long term, capital
investment which would require decades to pay off. Moreover, a number of business owners
noted that regional competition was difficult as their international competitors had access to
cheaper credit. For small businesses, high interest rates directly affected their ability to not only
expand but to run their daily operations. Only 13% of small businesses in Kampala have a loan or
a line of credit 132 . For informal firms, access to finance was linked to increased likelihood of
formalization and increased profitability. From those firms which did access formal credit, the
largest proportion (6%) received a loan a microfinance institute. When asked why they did not
have a line of credit, small and micro businesses either responded that they had no need or that
the interest rates were unfavorable. For those micro and small businesses that do use loans, the
vast majority of their credit was used to finance materials or working capital. High interest rates
in turn reduced firms’ ability to purchase large quantities of materials to grow their businesses.
Moreover, business owners showed hesitation to enter into large contracts or fill large orders as
they would be required to obtain larger loans in order to meet the contract requirements. For
many of these businesses, obtaining financing was seen as too dangerous (see box 2).

Box 2 - Stories from firms: A fear of finance
One firm interviewed explained that the cost of finance has nearly made him go bankrupt. The owner had started a
small carpentry business. After modernizing his operations, the owner won a lucrative contract with a large
telecommunication firm. Subsequently the business grew dramatically, employing over one hundred staff. To manage
this expansion the owner took out a number of business loans. However, following delays in contract payments,
balancing loan repayments with purchasing materials became difficult. The bank increased the interest rates due to
these delays and the business was forced to sell much of its machinery and lay off most of its staff to manage the
repayments. Given this experience the owner vowed to never to take out a business loan again in fear of losing his
business.




          A number of factors explain Uganda’s high interest rate, all of which are outside local
          governments’ remit. Uganda’s lending rate appears to be delinked from both inflation and the
          Bank of Uganda set interest rate. Research suggests that, apart from macroeconomic factors,
          banks’ high overheads are a factor in Uganda’s inflated lending rates133. In particular, the cost of
          due diligence for banks which target small and micro enterprises is high. Another reason for the
          high interest rates is related to the share of bank loans that are taken up by the Ugandan
          Government.



           Recommendation – Lower the cost of finance

           The high cost of finance is a concern for businesses across Uganda, but is felt severely in
           Kampala given its central role in Ugandan industry. However, lowering the cost of finance
           is clearly outside the remit of local government and demands central government leadership
           to address. As briefly mentioned in this report and more compressively in World Bank Ugandan
           financial sector reviews, there are a number of causes for high lending rates outside of
           macroeconomic pressure. The high cost of due diligence, the banks’ lack of capital reserves to
           lend to domestic clients, and the level of Government borrowing will require serious work from
           the Bank of Uganda and private sector associations particular the Uganda Bankers Association.

           While cost of credit is a constraining factor for firms, the demand side of finance in
           Kampala also plays an important role. Interviews with bank officials found that there is a
           lack of “bankable” projects which prevents lenders from further increasing private sector
           credit. There is an opportunity for KCCA and Local Governments to support firms to develop
           bankable business plans. These services could be provided through business associations
           which have good connections with and trust of the private sector.

4.2 Labour skills – lack of coordination
According to firm level interviews, technical skills in the labor market appeared to only be
a constraint for medium and large sized firms. A number of firms had difficulties in finding
and recruiting technically skilled employees. To address inadequate skills in the labor market,
businesses typically allocated resources to training employees. Between 2006 and 2013, the
percentage of firms offering formal training increased by 10% 134 . This, however, has led to
problems of high employee turnover as other businesses tend to poach trained workers 135 :
Despite this, many medium-sized firms acknowledged that when they have managed to find and
hire skilled workers, this was crucial in enabling them to grow.

“we became a breeding place for other businesses because competitors prefer to poach our trained
workers than training up their own workforce” – Medium sized firm



There appear to be two reasons for skill shortages; a lack of supply and labor matching
issues. Uganda’s education systems appear to not be training enough people 136 . The Central
Government determined that only 5% of Uganda’s workforce have completed secondary
education, while only 35% of the urban workforce reported possessing a technical skill or
trade137. Furthermore, of the people who do possess a technical skill, most are trained informally
through families and friends (53% of the time) or through on-the-job training (16% of the
time)138.

The National Government has recognized the importance of technical training in helping
businesses grow. The ambitious ‘Skilling Uganda’ program aims to shift Uganda’s skills training
industry from supply to demand driven by involving the private sector in policy
implementation 139 . However, since its inception, Skilling Uganda has been slow to implement
reforms and has been heavily criticized140. Another issue highlighted in the interviews was the
lack of awareness of what technical training programs were available to businesses. Structural
transformation goes hand-in-hand with available human capital. For Kampala to generate jobs
for the future, it will need to ensure that its young population has training in skills in higher value
sectors.

     Recommendation: connect local firms and workers to training opportunities

     Local government can play a coordinating role to connect businesses and workers to
     training opportunities. Local governments could create a dashboard to increase public
     information on the areas where Uganda has a surplus of skilled workers, a deficit of skilled
     workers, and industries which employ the most people. Having a publicly shared dashboard
     of Kampala’s employment trends would enable future students to identify areas which have
     the most demand for skilled workers. It could also help training providers better tailor their
     courses to local business needs. Such initiatives would need to be implemented in close
     partnership with the local private sector and academic and vocational institutions.

Qualitative interviews also indicated that the lack of business skills was a constraint to the
growth of small enterprises. Interviews with small firm owners identified that they had
difficulty with costings, book keeping, marketing and business strategy. While the qualitative
study cannot establish a causal link, business owners who had taken advantage of business
training or had a good level of business skills seemed to have more dynamic businesses. A
number of key informants also highlighted the importance of business training for micro and
small businesses. For example, a key informant from a financial institution noted that
professionally kept records were crucial for businesses to be awarded finance141. A number of
firm owners noted that access to training sessions conducted by business associations were the
most persuasive reasons for joining, demonstrating a demand from owners to develop their skills
in these areas142. In particular, informal firms, the study found that behaviors focused on external
factors such as marketing research, experimentation of new approaches, and researching
competition were strongly correlated with performance indicators143. Additionally, it was found
that keeping records of assets, transactions and debts is associated with good firm performance.
However very few firms were found to collect any financial information. This could be due to a
lack of sufficient time or a lack of appreciation of the importance of financial tracking on their
business growth.

Both national and local governments have recognized the importance of business training
in helping small and micro-enterprises grow, but current interventions have several
shortcomings. While the Skilling Uganda program has supported some business training
institutes, it is largely focused on the provision of technical training. KCCA is also involved with
the provision of some business training for small and micro-enterprises. This training includes
short courses on financial literacy, marketing and product packaging. However, these programs
remain minimal and focused exclusively on micro-enterprises.

 Recommendation: Local government to partner with associations to provide business
 training

 Local Government could partner with business associations in order to provide high
 quality business training to firms. Business associations are key stakeholders in the
 provision of business training. The majority of the firms interviewed, which had received
 business training, had been trained through business associations. These training sessions
 were either paid for by international donors or covered by the associations themselves. While
 not all firms interviewed saw value in joining business associations, many of the firms
 highlighted these business training sessions as an important way to build their skills. Business
 associations enjoyed stronger engagement with firms than government agencies. However, the
 relationship between government and these associations is currently weak. Business
 associations can play an important role in bridging the gap between enterprises and
 government services, particularly due to the current mistrust between enterprises and local
 governments.

  4.3 Tax system – too complex
  The tax rate was a major concern of all firm sizes in Kampala. However, interviews
  revealed that firms had an unclear understanding of tax regulations and exemptions. The
  primary tax which firms felt was too high was the Value-Added Tax (VAT). Large firms were
  concerned that the VAT was much higher than in neighboring countries and in turn reduced their
  ability to compete regionally. However, while Uganda’s VAT rate (18%) is indeed higher than both
  Kenya (16%) and Ethiopia (15%), 18% is the standard VAT rate for most other East African
  countries 144 . More importantly, the VAT is zero rated on all goods or services exported from
  Uganda. Similarly, small businesses complained that the VAT was unfair. However, this may be
  driven by a misunderstanding of the VAT requirements, which recently changed. A common
  concern for small business owners was that the non-registration of suppliers made it difficult to
  “claim back” their tax but this is not technically correct. In 2015, the Ugandan VAT registration
  threshold was increased from a UGX50 million annual turnover to UGX150 million 145 .
  Consequently, all small businesses in Kampala should now not be VAT registered. If a business is
  not registered but pays VAT on a supply product, then they must absorb the cost as a business
  expense and thus are not entitled to a tax refund. However, small businesses appeared confused
  as to what refunds they were entitled to or indeed if they were VAT registered or not. This was
  exacerbated by their lack of resources to be able to afford accountancy services in order to access
  the information146.


 “We assess ourselves for tax but at times this becomes a challenge if you’re not knowledgeable about the tax
system so you end up assessing yourself incorrectly.” – small business




       Recommendation: Tax advice and assistance

       While not strictly within the remit of Greater Kampala’s local governments, increased
       understanding of the national taxation system will assist firms in avoiding
       unnecessary tax burdens. The VAT is a central government tax and is the responsibility of
       the Ugandan Revenue Authority (URA) to administer. However, interviews made it clear
       that businesses require assistance with taxation advice. Moreover, the enterprise survey
       results show that more firms in Kampala see tax rates as a major barrier than anywhere else
       in the country. Local governments in the Greater Kampala region can play a facilitation role,
       assisting firms by providing taxation training and linking queries with the proper services
       within the URA. As an initial step, KCCA and local governments can work with URA in
       producing tax advice and radio commercial materials as a way of further disseminating key
       taxation information. If demand for tax advice is large enough, a taxation helpline could also
       be trialed for firms in Kampala, firstly as a way of providing free advice but also to collect
       data on which taxation issues firms find most difficult.

4.4 An underlying issue -Tax administration and a lack of business
engagement
Currently, the primary interaction local businesses have with local governments is
through the tax collection process. Local tax collection was considered heavy handed,
souring the relationship between business and government. National level taxes (such as
VAT and income tax) involve self-assessment and then payment to URA through an online
platform. Local taxes, on the other hand, involve 1) an assessment of tax category and payment
band through local government officials’ visits to firm premises, and then 2) tax payments made
through local bank branches or KCCA’s online platform. Businesses expressed concerns about
KCCA’s tax collectors aggressive methods147. Practices such as locking-up businesses’ machinery
or premises due to payment delays were perceived as draconian and unnecessarily leading to loss
of livelihoods. Moreover, when asked to describe the efficiency and general approach adopted by
tax collectors, most business owners clearly differentiated between KCCA agents’ attitude and
approach, often described it as aggressive, and between URA’s approach which was preferred for
ensuring business compliance in a more objective and reasonable manner. Also, the fact that the
assessment for local tax payment relies on observation of the business by a tax collector
(compared to self-assessment for national taxes with URA), was also felt to be introducing
avenues for corruption148.

KCCA’s recently developed online platform to collect local taxes, should be expanded to
include assessments and all other procedures and avoid visits by officials to firm premises.
Online tax collection systems should also be replicated in the surrounding local
governments. Originally designed for collecting tax revenue from taxis, e-CITIE, is an online
system which will allow businesses to pay their local taxes online without having local officials
visit. This online process will remove the need for local tax collectors to carry out random and on
the spot audits and assessments and should reduce avenues for corruption and improve the
relationship between government and the private sector.

 Recommendation: improve private sector engagement

 While a weak relationship between local government and the business community is not
 a direct constraint on firm growth, government is best able to facilitate an enabling
 environment for firm growth and competitiveness if there is a positive relationship with
 the local private sector. Despite the uneasy relationship between the private sector and local
 government, business owners were interested in a new and more positive kind of engagement
 suggesting that local Government create a specific department or desk, which is responsible
 for business engagement and public private dialogue.

 To implement initiatives which will assist business development in Greater Kampala,
 local governments should start by working toward creating a more positive relationship
 with the local private sector through active public private dialogue and a business
 engagement desk or one stop shop. As an initial step, town hall meetings could be held as a
 way of disseminating the kinds of business services which KCCA and local governments can
 provide and are looking to provide in the future. Working closely with business associations
 will also be key in further strengthening the dialogue between local governments and the
 private sector. Eventually, a business advisor panel, made up of key business leaders from
 varying industries, and firm sizes (micro to large), could be convened to advise local
 governments on key services and investments needed. This forum could also provide
 opportunities to discuss public private partnerships.

Local governments are responsible
for delivering the information, skills
and capacities to allow firms to
succeed. A common theme in enterprise

             Recommendation – Business engagement centre

             KCCA and LGs have an opportunity to develop business engagement centres within
             their administrations which would provide enterprise support services to firms in
             Greater Kampala. Once set up, business engagement centres could engage in a range of
             activities to address firm constraints:

              ➢ Tax education - work with URA in producing tax advice print and radio
                communication materials as a way of further disseminating key taxation information.
                If demand for tax advice is large enough, a taxation helpline could also be trialed for
                firms in Kampala.
              ➢ Grievance mechanism – provide a mechanism in which firms can raise concerns over
                government behavior, with particular regards to tax collection, and report instances of
                corruption.
              ➢ Assist firms to develop bankable business plans – provide firms developing
                business plans with necessary skills in project management and risk assessments.
              ➢ Link citizens with training providers and disseminate information on the skill
                needs of local businesses - create a dashboard to publicly demonstrate the areas
                where Uganda has a surplus of skilled workers, a deficit of skilled workers, and
                industries which employ the most people. Link citizens to training providers and
                disseminate information on skill needs of local businesses.
              ➢ Improve business engagement - Disseminate the kinds of business services which
                KCCA and local governments can provide and are looking to provide in the future.
              ➢ Trial mentorship programs focused on increasing firms’ understanding of their
                markets and customers. The evidence shows that the effectiveness of mentorship
                programs in Uganda could be enhanced if programs focused on helping business
                owners focus not only on their internal business management (record keeping etc), but
                also on their external environment: customers, competitors and suppliers.
              ➢ Investment attraction. The business centre could play a leading role by promoting
                Kampala as an attractive investment location though business engagement and
                marketing. Additionally, the centre could identify potential areas where private
                financing could be involved. For instance an PPP to renew tourist amenities around
                Lake Victoria.

               Summary of major recommendations
Given the significance of Greater Kampala to national development, it is a national priority to
alleviate these constraints facing firms in order to increase the city’s productivity and encourage
positive structural transformation more generally in Uganda. This calls for a deliberate policy
transition for the role of Local Government, from merely being a regulator of businesses to an
enabler or facilitator for private sector growth and jobs creation. Based on the above findings, it’s
recommended that KCCA and Greater Kampala local governments focus on the below three
principles:

INVEST in coordinated transport & economic infrastructure together with land use
management. Greater Kampala’s disconnected and costly urban form is hampering the
competitiveness of its firms. To address this, investments should be made in affordable housing
in the city which would also free up land for mixed uses. City authorities also need to encourage
further industrial clusters by priority zoning and subsidies. However, for these measures to be
effective it is important to address Greater Kampala’s suffocating congestion by further managing
its transportation system. A longer-term priority for the city will be the need to provide an
affordable public transport system for its citizens. Finally, one of the most binding constraint face
capital expenditure in the city Kampala’s complex land tenure system. Further collaboration
between local governments and land administrations will be required so that Greater Kampala
urban development is managed in the most efficient form possible.

EMPOWER domestic firms to improve productivity. Findings demonstrated that firms in
Greater Kampala face numerous obstacles to grow their businesses. KCCA and local governments
can play an important role through the provision of enterprise services and support. Local
governments are also in a unique position to provide the business community with information
on affordable finance and taxation guidance. These business services may be implemented
through dedicated units within KCCA and local government administrations. While the vast
majority of informal firms do not have great potential to grow, they provide many of Kampala’s
poorest a livelihood. Importantly, reducing the size of the informal sector will rely on the creation
of more formal jobs in tradable sectors of the economy and supporting informal workers to find
opportunities for formal wage employment if they want to. A further barrier to the provision of
business support is the poor relationship local governments have with the private sector.
Improved engagement will be a key enabling factor for any future work in this field.

CAPACITATE institutions & coordination structures. The Greater Kampala economic region
encompasses several jurisdictions and local governments. It will be imperative for these
institutions to work collabouratively in order to manage the future growth of the city. This report
calls on Government to put in place the Greater Kampala Working Group as provided for in NDPII
and Vision 2040. This working group would coordinate urban and economic development plans
as well as marshal political support and traction for continual urban development. Alongside this,
it is recommended that a technical committee be established to facilitate technical support for the
working group and Greater Kampala stakeholders. There is also a need for a single financing
mechanism that KCCA and local governments can draw on to finance infrastructure investment
for Greater Kampala. Finally, capacity enhancements within subnational governments are needed
to put in place efficient systems for service delivery, particularly to the private sector.

   Annex 1: Examples of Practical LED Actions that LGs
               internationally undertake
While it is impossible to list here all the policy reform and investment possibilities that could be
undertaken, various toolkits have documented the wide variety of interventions that can and
have been implemented by cities to improve their economic competitiveness 149 . Illustrative
examples of actions that may be relevant to the African city context include:

1) Institutions and regulations
• Improving the regulatory environment for businesses and investors through: reducing the
    time it takes to process business registration applications; reducing business costs for MSEs
    through lowering municipal taxes and local charges; reducing the complexity of legislation
    imposed on businesses and investors; introducing e-governance, One Stop Shops and other
    means for providing information and simplifying procedures
• Encouraging cluster development through tax incentives and zoning regulations that
    encourage firms to cluster in one area
• Marketing and promotion of the locality as a good place to start a business, location for
    investment or tourism, etc. through actions such as city or local area brochures and economic
    profiles, producing information packages for potential investors, direct mailing to potential
    investors in relevant economic sectors, promotion via media outlets, organising local
    festivals, exhibitions and community events to promote the area and its products as well as
    participating in international fairs and exhibitions
• Provision of land, utilities, investment facilitation and "after care" services targeted at new or
    higher value added sectors

2) Infrastructure
• Improving transport infrastructures such as roads and multi-modal public transport (road,
    rail, sea port and airports)
• Improving infrastructure necessary for economic production including gas, electricity,
    telecommunications and water supply
• Town centre enhancement or beautification schemes using local labour
• Ensuring there is enough land for business needs – e.g. supporting the clearing and
    preparation of sites for economic activity, putting together a land and property database, etc.
• Establishing industrial, business parks or incubators in partnership with the private sector
• Investing in infrastructure that supports certain economic sectors – e.g. renovation of sites
    that could attract tourists, or creation of a market area for informal firms, etc.



3) Skills and innovation
• Establishing local skill development partnerships between local industries, businesses, and
    training providers, to improve information on the type of skills needed and the design of skill
    development courses
• Setting up internship, apprenticeship and training in the work place schemes through
    partnering with local businesses
• Implementing Diaspora attraction initiatives

•   Encouraging partnerships between research institutions and businesses towards better R&D
    for business needs

4) Enterprise support and finance.
• Increasing access to finance, through providing information to local firms on credit
   availability, or providing incentives to finance providers to better serve certain types of firms,
   including credit guarantee schemes, etc.
• Increasing access to Business Development Services (BDS) and knowledge on financial
   management, business plan development, export product standards, etc. in partnership with
   private BDS providers
• Establishment of incubators for start-ups in new sectors, in partnership with the private
   sector, supporting enterprises with office space at below market rents, MSE financing, BDS,
   support in navigating registration and licensing etc. to help companies through the first years
   of their operation
• Awards to innovative and diversifying companies through annual prize ceremonies for
   successful companies and individuals, in cooperation with local Chambers of Commerce
